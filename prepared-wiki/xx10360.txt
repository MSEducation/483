==Early life==

Rudolph Giuliani was born in an Italian-American enclave in East Flatbush in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the only child of working-class parents, Harold Angelo Giuliani (1908–1981) and Helen (née D'Avanzo; 1909–2002), both first-generation Americans, children of Italian immigrants.[tpl]cite news|first=Danielle|last=Burton|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Rudy Giuliani|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070207/7giulianifacts.htm|work=U.S. News & World Report|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=June 21, 2007[/tpl] He was raised a Roman Catholic.[tpl]cite web|last=Fairchild|first=Mary|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/religionpolitics/p/giulianifaithss.htm|title=Presidential Candidate Rudy Giuliani|publisher=About.com|accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] Harold Giuliani had trouble holding a job and had been convicted of felony assault and robbery and served time in Sing Sing;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mondaymemo.net/020218feature.htm|title=Rudy Giuliani: The Long View of Leadership|accessdate=October 26, 2007|last=Bock|first=Wally|publisher=Wally Bock's Monday Memo[/tpl] after his release he served as an enforcer for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who ran an organized crime operation involved in loan sharking and gambling at a restaurant in Brooklyn.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,barrett,16192,1.html|title=Thug Life: The Shocking Secret History of Harold Giuliani, the Mayor's Ex-Convict Dad|accessdate=April 6, 2007|last=Barrett|first=Wayne|authorlink=Wayne Barrett|date=July 4, 2000|work=The Village Voice[/tpl]

He graduated in 1965. Giuliani eventually decided to forego the priesthood, instead attending New York University School of Law in Manhattan, where he made law review and graduated cum laude with a Juris Doctor in 1968.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/bio.html|title=A Biography of Mayor Rudolph W.

Giuliani started his political life as a Democrat. He has stated that he admires the Kennedy family, and volunteered for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1968. He also worked as a Democratic party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s,The Democratic Party| DNC Statement on Giuliani's Potential Presidential Bid[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]Jack Newfield, "The Full Rudy: The Man, the Mayor, the Myth", The Nation, May 30, 2002; retrieved June 2, 2007 and voted for George McGovern for president in 1972."What an anti-Giuliani ad should say"

==Legal career==

Upon graduation, Giuliani clerked for Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.[tpl]cite book|author=Giuliani, Rudy|year=2002|title=Leadership|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-6841-4[/tpl]
Giuliani did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War. His conscription was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from NYU Law in 1968, he was classified by the Selective Service System as 1-A, available for military service. He applied for a deferment but was rejected. In 1969, Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon wrote a letter to Giuliani's draft board, asking that he be reclassified as 2-A, civilian occupation deferment, because Giuliani, who was a law clerk for MacMahon, was an essential employee. The deferment was granted. In 1970, Giuliani received a high draft lottery number; he was not called up for service although by then he had been reclassified 1-A.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani18.html|title=Rudolf W.

WorldNetDaily, November 17, 2007 In 1973, he was named Chief of the Narcotics Unit and became executive U.S. attorney.
In 1975, Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent as he was recruited to Washington, D.C. during the Ford administration, where he was named Associate Deputy Attorney General and chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Harold "Ace" Tyler. His first high-profile prosecution was of U.S. Representative Bertram L. Podell (NY-13), who was convicted of corruption."Convicted Politician Bertram Podell, 79". The Washington Post. August 22, 2005. From 1977 to 1981, during the Carter Administration, Giuliani practiced law at the Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler law firm, as chief of staff to his previous DC boss, Ace Tyler. Tyler later became critical of Giuliani's turn as a prosecutor, calling his tactics "overkill".
On December 8, 1980, one month after the election of Ronald Reagan brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican. Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies "naïve", and that "by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me". Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department. Giuliani's mother maintained in 1988 that: [tpl]quote|He only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He's definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn't. He still feels very sorry for the poor.[/tpl]
In 1981, Giuliani was named Associate Attorney General in the Reagan administration,"Doing Rudy Justice", National Review, November 7, 2007 the third-highest position in the Department of Justice. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Corrections, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the federal government's "detention posture" regarding the internment of over 2,000 Haitian asylum seekers who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were "economic migrants". In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that "political repression, at least in general, does not exist" under President of Haiti Jean-Claude Duvalier's regime."Around the World; U.S. Official Finds No Repression in Haiti". The New York Times. April 3, 1982.
In 1983, Giuliani was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of Wall Street figures Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, organized crime, and corruption in government. He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the "perp walk", parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ihc/PubArticleIHC.jsp?id=1142862090121|title=How to Avoid Letting a 'Perp Walk' Turn Into a Parade|author=William Mitchelson, Jr.|work=National Law Journal|date= March 21, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2007[/tpl] After Giuliani "patented the perp walk", the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.[tpl]cite news|title=Breaking Down the "Perp Walk"|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/22/breaking-down-the-perp-walk|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=March 22, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2007|first=Peter|last=Lattman[/tpl]
Giuliani's critics claim he arranged public arrests of people, then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his public arrests of alleged white-collar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged "perps".[tpl]cite web|title=No more 'perp walks'|url=http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|publisher=National Law Journal|date=August 5, 2002|accessdate=June 1, 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] He claimed that veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of Kidder, Peabody & Co. was guilty of insider trading; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.Peter J.

We're just the tip of the iceberg", but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until Giuliani's successor was in place. Giuliani's high-profile raid of the Princeton/Newport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes.[tpl]Cite news|last=Nocera|first=Joseph| date=August 6, 1995|title=Junk Bondage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/books/junk-bondage.html|accessdate=June 8, 2007|work=The New York Times [/tpl]

===Mafia Commission trial===

In the Mafia Commission Trial (February 25, 1985 – November 19, 1986), Giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures, including the heads of New York's so-called "Five Families", under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire. Time magazine called this "Case of Cases" possibly "the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: "Our approach is to wipe out the five families."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101860210-143096,00.html|title=The Passionate Prosecutor|accessdate=November 15, 2006|last=Stengel|first=Richard|date =June 24, 2001|work=Time [/tpl] Eight defendants were found guilty on all counts and subsequently sentenced on January 13, 1987 to hundreds of years of prison time.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
According to an FBI memo revealed about 20 years later, leaders of the five New York mob families voted in 1987 on whether to issue a contract for the death of U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani. Heads of the Lucchese, Bonanno, and Genovese families rejected the idea, though Gambino leader John Gotti encouraged assassination.[tpl] cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/inside-the-american-mob/galleries/mob-murder-faq/at/q-do-mafioso-ever-put-out-contracts-on-law-enforcement-officials-1748568/ |title=Mob Murder FAQ: Do Mafioso ever put out contracts on law enforcement officials? |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=August 25, 2013 [/tpl]

===Boesky, Milken trials===

Ivan Boesky was a Wall Street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers. He was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a [tpl]frac|3|1|2[/tpl]-year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2000/boesky.html|title=Ivan Boesky|accessdate=November 15, 2006|last=Trumbore|first=Brian|publisher=BUYandHOLD[/tpl] In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Mayoral campaigns==

Giuliani was U.S. Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the Reagan Administration ended. He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases, and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions. He joined the law firm White & Case in New York City as a partner. He remained with White & Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, also in New York City.Rudolph W. Giuliani, Bracewell & Giuliani

===1989===

Giuliani first ran for New York City Mayor in 1989, attempting to unseat three-term incumbent Ed Koch. He won the September 1989 Republican Party primary election against business magnate Ronald Lauder, in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was not a true Republican and by an acrimonious debate.[ref]Katharine Q. Seeley
"In G.O.P. Debate Today, Which Tack for Giuliani?", The New York Times, May 3, 2007. Retrieved March 31, 2008.[/ref] In the Democratic primary, Koch was upset by Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.
In the general election, Giuliani ran as the fusion candidate of both the Republican and Liberal Parties. The Conservative Party, which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead.Frank Lynn, "Giuliani Files 2 Challenges To Take Lauder off Ballot", The New York Times, July 21, 1989. Retrieved March 30, 2007. Conservative Party leaders were unhappy with Giuliani on ideological grounds. They cited the Liberal Party's endorsement statement that Giuliani

During two televised debates, Giuliani framed himself as an agent of change, saying, "I'm the reformer""In Their First Debate, Dinkins and Giuliani Go At It, Gently", The New York Times, November 5, 2007. Retrieved June 24, 2007. that "If we keep going merrily along, this city's going down", and that electing Dinkins would represent "more of the same, more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down". Giuliani also accused Dinkins of not having paid his taxes for many years and of several other ethical missteps, in particular a stock transfer to his son. Dinkins said the tax matter had been fully paid off, denied other wrongdoing, and said that "what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor", and that Giuliani refused to say "the R-word — he doesn't like to admit he's a Republican."  Dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily New York newspapers, while Giuliani won approval from the New York Post.David Dinkins Elected First Black Mayor of New York[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] AfroTimes, November 11, 1989
In the end, Giuliani lost to Dinkins by a margin of 47,080 votes out of 1,899,845 votes cast, in the closest election in New York City's history.

===1993===

Four years after he was beaten by Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor. Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist George Marlin."Q&A: George Marlin", The New York Sun, March 21, 2007; Retrieved June 24, 2007 The city was suffering from a spike in unemployment associated with the nationwide recession, with local unemployment rates going from 6.7% in 1989 to 11.1% in 1992.New York State Department of Labor statistics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/apps.asp?reg=nys&app=laus|title=Workforce industry data|accessdate=November 18, 2006[/tpl]

===1997===

Giuliani's opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, who had beaten Al Sharpton in the September 9, 1997 Democratic primary."Giuliani Wins With Ease", CNN, November 4, 2007. In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1302.xml?ReleaseID=808|title=Giuliani Approval, Satisfaction With City Hit New Highs, Quinnipiac College Poll Finds; Mayor's Lead Over Messinger Nears 2–1|publisher= Quinnipiac University|date=October 29, 1997|accessdate=June 24, 2007[/tpl]
Throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fund-raising advantage over Messinger. On her part, Messinger lost the support of several usually Democratic constituencies, including gay organizations and large labor unions."The Last Of The Liberals" The local daily newspapers — The New York Times, Daily News, New York Post and Newsday — all endorsed Giuliani over Messinger."Giuliani Goes After Voters In Messinger's Stronghold", The New York Times, October 27, 1997; Retrieved June 24, 2007
In the end, Giuliani won 59% of the vote to Messinger's 41%, and became the first Republican to win a second term as mayor since Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1941. Voter turnout was the lowest in 12 years, with 38% of registered voters casting ballots.Adam Nagourney, "The 1997 Elections: The Overview; Giuliani Sweeps To Second Term As Mayor; Whitman Holds On By A Razor-Thin Margin", The New York Times, November 5, 1997; Retrieved June 24, 2007 The margin of victory included gainsDavid Firestone, "The 1997 Elections: The Voters; Big Victory, But Gains For Mayor Are Modest", The New York Times, November 6, 1997; Retrieved June 24, 2007 in his share of the African American vote (20% compared to 1993's 5%) and the Hispanic vote (43% from 37%) while maintaining his base of white ethnic, Catholic and Jewish voters from 1993.

==Mayoralty==

Giuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 through 2001.

===Law enforcement===

In Giuliani's first term as mayor, the New York City Police Department at the instigation of Commissioner Bill Bratton adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on James Q. Wilson's "Broken Windows" approach.ISBN 978-0679452515 This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, cannabis possession, and aggressive panhandling by "squeegee men", on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained. The legal underpinning for removing the "squeegee men" from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins.[tpl]cite book|last=Bratton|first=William|title=Turnaround: How America's Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic|year=1998|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780679452515|coauthors=Knobler, Peter[/tpl] Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple, also created and instituted CompStat, a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions.Jack Maple: Betting on Intelligence Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data.Patrick A.

Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in New York City crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7,000 officers to the NYPD, lobbied for and hired by the Dinkins administration, and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time.[ref]Greene Crime Delinquency

Giuliani's supporters cite studies concluding that the decline in New York City's crime rate in the 1990s and 2000s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country: what University of California sociologist Frank Zimring calls "the most focused form of policing in history". In his book The Great American Crime Decline, Zimring claims that "up to half of New York's crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing crime decline since 2000, has resulted from policing."Heather MacDonald New York Cops: Still the Finest CityJournal.org[tpl]cite book|last=Zimring|first=Franklin E.|title=The Great American Crime Decline (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=November 3, 2006|location=|page=272|isbn=0-19-518115-8[/tpl]

===Appointees as defendants===

Several of Giuliani's appointees to head City agencies became defendants in criminal proceedings.

===2000 U.S. Senate campaign===

Due to term limits, Giuliani could not run in 2001 for a third term as Mayor. In November 1998, long-serving Democratic New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat. Due to his high profile and visibility Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party, even though he had irritated many by endorsing incumbent Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo over Republican George Pataki in 1994.[tpl]cite news|title=1994 Ad|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n22_v46/ai_15999869|publisher=National Review|date=November 21, 1994|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel and others to recruit then-U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.
An early January 1999 poll showed Giuliani trailing Clinton by 10 points.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/31/opinion/losing-the-women.html|title=Losing the Women|author=Lee M.

By January 2000, Giuliani had reversed the polls situation, pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton. Nevertheless, the Giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses; so closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to normally Republican voters in Upstate New York.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/opinion/looking-for-the-senator-from-all-of-new-york.html|title=Looking for the Senator From All of New York|author=George Gates|work=The New York Times|date=November 6, 1999|accessdate=September 27, 2007[/tpl] The New York Police Department's fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond in March 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained relations with the city's minority communities,[tpl]cite book|last=Gerth|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Gerth|coauthors=Don Van Natta, Jr.|title=Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton|year=2007|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-316-01742-6[/tpl], pp. 211. and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue.

Then followed four tumultuous weeks, in which Giuliani's medical life, romantic life, marital life, and political life all collided at once in a most visible fashion. Giuliani discovered that he had prostate cancer and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with Judith Nathan became public and the subject of a media frenzy; he announced a separation from his wife Donna Hanover; and, after much indecision, on May 19, 2000 he announced his withdrawal from the Senate race.

===September 11 terrorist attacks===

====Preparedness====

Giuliani has been criticized for ignoring the ongoing threat to New York City from Islamist terrorism in the years between the World Trade Center 1993 bombings and September 11.
Prior to September 11, Giuliani reportedly never referred to the 1993 bombing publicly except for a single metaphorical reference in his inaugural address not referring to terrorism."Olbermann Giuliani blames his terror mistakes" (busted) Giuliani also reportedly never discussed the threat of terrorism with the U.S. Attorney in his district, and had to ask Henry Kissinger for background information on Osama Bin Laden after the September 11th attacks despite the fact that the Bin Laden had previously declared a Fatwa against the United States;[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm | title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders | publisher=Federation of American Scientists | date=1998-02-23 | accessdate=2007-11-09[/tpl] the Clinton administration had established a section of the CIA devoted exclusively to hunting Bin Laden.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html | title=C.I.A.

Jerome Hauer, Giuliani's emergency management chief between 1996 and 2000, later said that "We never talked about Islamic terrorism. We talked about chemical terrorism, biological terrorism. We did talk about car bombs every now and then. But I don't think there was much interest on his part Islam terrorism."Amanda Ripley, "Mr. Tough Talk," Time Magazine September 3, 2007, p. 30 http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1655262,00.html

====Response====

Giuliani was prominent in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards– for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said: [tpl]quote|Tomorrow New York is going to be here. And we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before... I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.[/tpl]
The 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January 1 to April 1 under the New York State Constitution (Article 3 Section 25).[tpl]cite web|title=Content Removed|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?co=5|accessdate=November 15, 2005[/tpl] He threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full four-year term, if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty.[tpl]cite web|title=Conservative Party and Courts May Hold Key to NYC Mayor's Race — October 1, 2001| url=http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html| accessdate=November 15, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020116071502/http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |archivedate = January 16, 2002[/tpl] In the end leaders in the State Assembly and Senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert Michael Bloomberg, took office on January 1, 2002 per normal custom.
Giuliani claimed to have been at the Ground Zero site "as often, if not more, than most workers.... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them." Some 9/11 workers have objected to those claims.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/08/10/2007-08-10_911_workers_outraged_by_new_rudy_claim.html|title=9/11 workers outraged by new Rudy claim|author=Celeste Katz|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Giuliani's 'I'm one of them' remark angers 9-11 workers|first=Dan|last=Sewell|work=The Cincinnati Post (Associated Press) |date=August 10, 2007|page=A1|quote=Battalion Chief John McDonnell, head of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association in New York, said: 'I have a real problem with that statement.

When Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal suggested that the attacks were an indication that the United States "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause", Giuliani asserted, "There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem." Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10 million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.[tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/|title=Giuliani rejects $10 million from Saudi prince|publisher=CNN|date=October 12, 2001|accessdate=October 5, 2007[/tpl]

====Preparedness====

Giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the 7 World Trade Center building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993.[tpl]cite web|title=World Trade Center: Profile|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center|accessdate=June 12, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Grand Illusion: The untold story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0635%2Cbarrett%2C74322%2C6.html|author=Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins|work=The Village Voice|date=September 2006|accessdate=September 6, 2006[/tpl] The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters.[tpl]cite web|title=Open and Shut|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549,murphy,70685,6.html|accessdate=June 12, 2007[/tpl] Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7 World Trade to power the command center.

Hauer, who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City's first Director of Emergency Management. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and New York Magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in Brooklyn but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and claimed that Hauer said that the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271917,00.html|title=Transcript: Rudy Giuliani on Fox News Sunday|date=May 14, 2007|accessdate=September 29, 2007|quote=Then why did he say the building– he said it's not– the place in Brooklyn is not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan[/tpl]audio and video from interview available on Robert Greenwald's "The REAL Rudy: Command Center"[tpl]cite news|title=Onetime Giuliani Insider Is Now a Critic|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=June 12, 2007|work=The New York Times|first=Russ|last=Buettner|date=May 22, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Angry Giuliani Aide Lashes Back|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/angry-giuliani-aide-lashes-back|accessdate=June 12, 2007|work=The New York Times|date=May 15, 2007[/tpl]Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins, "The Real Rudy: From the September print issue: The image of Rudy Giuliani as the hero of September 11 has never been seriously challenged.

====Time person of the year====

On December 24, 2001,CNN.com - Transcripts Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/poy2001/poyprofile.html|title=Mayor of the world|author=Eric Pooley|magazine=Time|date=December 31, 2001|accessdate=October 5, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] Time observed that, prior to 9/11, the public image of Giuliani had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician. After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006: [tpl]quote|With time, Giuliani's legacy will be based on more than just 9/11. He left a city immeasurably better off– safer, more prosperous, more confident– than the one he had inherited eight years earlier, even with the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center at its heart. Debates about his accomplishments will continue, but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny.Washington Post Book World September 3, 2006[/tpl]
Giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts, but others argue that "Giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks, casting himself as a hero for political gain."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/us/politics/17firefighters.html|title=Among Firefighters in New York, Mixed Views on Giuliani|accessdate=December 1, 2007|last=Wilson|first=Michael|coauthors=Kate Hammer, Trymaine Lee and Matthew Sweeney|date=June 17, 2007|work=Politics|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Giuliani has collected $11.4 million from speaking fees in a single year (his demand increasing after the attacks).cbs2chicago.com - Many Wonder, Did Giuliani Profit From 9/11?[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] Before September 11, Giuliani's assets were estimated to be somewhat less than $2 million, but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount."Wealth Is a Common Factor Among GOP Hopefuls", The New York Times, May 17, 2007 However one must take into account that since then he has been working in the private sector. As is the case with many politicians, he has made most of his money since leaving office.

====Aftermath====

For his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on February 13, 2002.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/02/13/knighthoods/|title=Giuliani joins a distinguished club|publisher=CNN|author=Renolds, Dylan|date=February 13, 2002|accessdate=November 6, 2007[/tpl]
Giuliani initially downplayed the health effects arising from the September 11 attacks in the Financial District and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site.Ben Smith, "Rudy's Black Cloud", New York Daily News, September 18, 2006, p. 14 He moved quickly to reopen Wall Street, and it was reopened on September 17. In the first month after the attacks, he said "The air quality is safe and acceptable."Anita Gates, "Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles", "New York Times", September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary, "Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11" However, in the weeks after the attacks, the United States Geological Survey identified hundreds of asbestos 'hot spots' of debris dust that remained on buildings. By the end of the month the USGS reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner.AlterNet: Special Coverage: 9/11: One Year Later It would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials.C&En: Cover Story - Chemical Analysis Of A Disaster The city's health agencies, such as the Department of Environmental Protection, did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings. Instead, the city left this responsibility to building owners.
Giuliani took control away from agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, leaving the "largely unknown" city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.Anthony DePalma, "Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy", The New York Times, May 14, 2007 orMacho Mistakes at Ground Zero, The New York Times, May 22, 2007 In June 2007, Christie Todd Whitman, former Republican Governor of New Jersey and director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), reportedly stated that the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by Giuliani. She stated that she believed that the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions."Christie blasts Rudy on WTC air" However, former deputy mayor Joe Lhota, then with the Giuliani campaign, replied, "All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators."[tpl]cite web|last=Murray|first=Mark|title=Pushing Back Against Whitman|date=June 25, 2007|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/25/234621.aspx|accessdate= July 9, 2007[/tpl]
Giuliani asked the city's Congressional delegation to limit the city's liability for Ground Zero illnesses be limited to a total of $350 million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1 billion to a special insurance fund, called the World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company, to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits."Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy", The New York Times, May 14, 2007
In February 2007, the International Association of Fire Fighters issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: "Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no closure for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the Fresh Kills Landfill", it said, adding: "Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them."Giuliani & New York firefighters[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill."Giuliani foes plan to use 9/11 against him"[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Politics===

====Before 2008 election====

Since leaving office as Mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. He was a speaker at the 2004 Republican National Convention, where he endorsed President George W. Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell, [tpl]quote|Without really thinking, based on just emotion, spontaneous, I grabbed the arm of then-Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and I said to him, 'Bernie, thank God George Bush is our president'.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-08-30/politics/giuliani.transcript_1_giuliani-governor-pataki-mayor-bloomberg/2?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS | title=Giuliani: 'Thank God that George Bush is our president' | publisher=CNN | date=August 31, 2004 | accessdate=July 25, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]
Similarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called Solutions America to help elect Republican candidates across the nation.
After campaigning on Bush's behalf in the U.S. presidential election of 2004, he was reportedly the top choice for Secretary of Homeland Security after Tom Ridge's resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani's confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. After the formal announcement of Kerik's nomination, information about Kerik's past– most notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had been sued for sexual harassment and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servant– became known.

====2008 presidential campaign====

In November 2006 Giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for President of the United States in 2008. In February 2007 he filed a "statement of candidacy" and confirmed on the television program Larry King Live that he was indeed running.Giuliani 'not confident' war will turn around - CNN.com
Early polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition and support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans. Original front-runner Senator John McCain had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator Fred Thompson and former Governor Mitt Romney showing greater support in some per-state Republican polls.WH2008: Republicans On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from evangelist, Christian Broadcasting Network founder, and past presidential candidate Pat Robertson.[tpl]cite news|first=Paul|last=Steinhauser|title=Giuliani, McCain pick up key Christian conservative backing|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/07/conservatives.endorsements/index.html#cnnSTCText|publisher=CNN|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2007[/tpl] This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21669328|title=Pat Robertson endorses Giuliani|publisher=NBC news|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=November 7, 2007[/tpl]

===Bracewell & Giuliani===

In 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell & Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell & Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm's new New York office.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/nyregion/30rudy.html|title=Giuliani to Be Partner in Texas Law Firm|author=Healy, Patrick D.|work=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2005[/tpl] When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of Attorney General Michael Mukasey, into the firm.
Despite a busy schedule, Giuliani was highly active in the day-to-day business of the law firm, which was a high-profile supplier of legal and lobbying services to the oil, gas, and energy industries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/us/politics/02giuliani.html|title=Giuliani's Tie to Texas Law Firm May Pose Risk| work=The New York Times|author=Buettner, Russ|date=May 2, 2007[/tpl] Its aggressive defense of pollution-causing coal-fired power plants threatened cause political risk for Giuliani, but association with the firm helped Giuliani achieve fund-raising success in Texas. In 2006, Giuliani acted as the lead counsel and lead spokesmen for Bracewell & Giuliani client Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, during their negotiations with federal prosecutors over charges that the pharmaceutical company misled the public about OxyContin's addictive properties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/19drug.html|title=Big Part of OxyContin Profit Was Consumed by Penalties|work=The New York Times|date=June 19, 2007|author=Meier, Barry[/tpl] The agreement reached resulted in Purdue Pharma and some of its executives paying $634.5 million in fines.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===

Giuliani has been married three times. On October 26, 1968, soon after he graduated from law school, he married Regina Peruggi, whom Giuliani had known since childhood. In the mid-70s the marriage was in trouble and in 1975 they agreed to a trial separation.Rudy Giuliani's Vulnerabilities - February 12, 2007 Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the Attorney General's Office. Giuliani met local television personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami. Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982. The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage was ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982,Lynda Richardson, "A Scholarly Fund-Raiser's Stroll to the Park", The New York Times, May 4, 2001. Retrieved March 31, 2008. while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the Giuliani-Peruggi marriage was granted at the end of 1983, according to Giuliani, because he discovered that he and his wife were second cousins,Powell, Michael and Goldfarb, Zachary A.

Giuliani biographer Wayne Barrett reports that Peruggi's brother believes that Giuliani knew at the time of the marriage that they were second cousins. Alan Placa, Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped get the annulment through proper channels. Recollections differ on whether Placa told Giuliani's mother at the time of the marriage that the couple's familial relationship would not be a problem. See Barrett, Rudy!: An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani, pp. 143–44.

Giuliani and Hanover then married in a Catholic ceremony at St. Monica's Church in New York on April 15, 1984."Donna's Riskiest Role" They had two children, son Andrew Harold (born January 30, 1986 in New York) and daughter Caroline (born 1989). Andrew first became a familiar sight by clowning onstage at Giuliani's first mayoral inauguration, and later with his father at New York Yankees games, of whom Rudy Giuliani is an enthusiastic fan. Andrew became an accomplished junior golfer, although he was later kicked off the golf team at Duke University on the grounds of misbehavior.[tpl]cite news|first=Anne|last=Blythe|title=Andrew Giuliani flubs Duke golf suit|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/1536270.html|work=newsobserver.com|publisher=The News & Observer|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090522112135/http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/1536270.html|archivedate=May 22, 2009|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=May 26, 2009[/tpl]
Beginning in 1996, Giuliani and Hanover's public relationship became distant, with Hanover appearing at few public events.Margaret Carlson, "In Rudy's Playground", Time, July 11, 1999.

On Father's Day Giuliani had told reporters that he was returning to Gracie Mansion to play ball with Andrew, but instead went to City Hall, to a basement suite with his press secretary. Three hours later, Hanover, angered, appeared at City Hall; a mayoral aide prevented her from entering the suite.Wayne Barrett, "Public Displays of Disaffection", The Village Voice, August 15, 2007 In 1997, a Vanity Fair article reported that Giuliani had a romantic relationship with Cristyne Ford Lategano, the mayor's communications director.[tpl]cite news|last=Roberts|first=Joel|title=The Women In Giuliani's Life|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/05/11/politics/main194350.shtml|work=cbsnews.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=May 26, 2009|date=May 11, 2000[/tpl] The mayor and Lategano denied the allegations.
