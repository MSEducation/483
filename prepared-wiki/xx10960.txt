[[File:Relations between new SI units definitions.png|thumb|right| Relations between proposed SI units definitions (in colour) and seven physical constants (in grey) with fixed numerical values in the proposed system.
Unlike the current (2013) definition, the base units are derived from one or more constants of nature.]]
When the metre was redefined in 1960, the kilogram was the only SI base unit that relied on a specific artifact and thus the only unit that was subject to "periodic comparisons of national standards with the international prototypes". After the 1996â€“1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.
At its 23rd meeting (2007), the CGPM mandated the CIPM to investigate the use of natural constants of nature as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artefacts that were then in use, thus involving a change from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions. At a meeting of the CCU held in Reading, United Kingdom, in September 2010, a resolution
and draft changes to the SI Brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the CIPM in October 2010 were agreed to in principle. The proposals that the CCU put forward were:
The CIPM meeting of October 2010 found that "the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met. For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time".
The CIPM did however sponsor a resolution at the 24th CGPM in which the changes were agreed to in principle and which were expected to be finalised at the CGPM's next meeting in 2014.
