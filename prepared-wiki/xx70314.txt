The city is home to Montréal-Mirabel International Airport.

==History==

Mirabel was formed through the expropriation of private lands and the merger of 8 municipalities in 1971. The former municipalities were (with their individual founding dates in brackets): Saint-Augustin (1855); Saint-Benoît (1855); Saint-Hermas (1855); Saint-Janvier-de-Blainville (1855); Sainte-Scholastique (1855); Saint-Canut (1857); Sainte-Monique (1872), and Saint-Janvier-de-la-Croix (1959). Initially called Ville de Sainte-Scholastique and renamed to Mirabel in 1973, the city was planned to become a vast transportation and industrial hub for eastern Canada with Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at its centre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/topos/carto.asp?Speci=72473&Latitude=45,65&Longitude=-74,08334&Zoom=1700 |title=Mirabel (ville) |accessdate=2009-03-10 |publisher=Commission de toponymie du Québec |language=French[/tpl]
The airport, which opened in 1975, never became a major aviation hub and the industrial parks never materialized, and in 2004 the airport closed to all passenger traffic.
In 2000, about 10 square kilometers of Mirabel's territory was annexed by Lachute.
