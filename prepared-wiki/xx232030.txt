</ref>  Semelparity is often associated with [[r/K selection theory|r-strategists]]. However, most fish and other spawning animals are iteroparous.
When the internal ovaries or egg masses of fish and certain marine animals are ripe for spawning they are called roe. Roe from certain species, such as shrimp, scallop, crab and sea urchins, are sought as human delicacies in many parts of the world. Caviar is a name for the processed, salted roe of non-fertilized sturgeon. The term soft roe or white roe denotes fish milt. Lobster roe is called coral because it turns bright red when cooked. Roe (reproductive organs) are usually eaten either raw or briefly cooked.
"The reproductive behaviour of fishes is remarkably diversified: they may be oviparous (lay eggs), ovoviparous (retain the eggs in the body until they hatch), or viviparous (have a direct tissue connection with the developing embryos and give birth to live young). All cartilaginous fishes—the elasmobranches (e.g., sharks, rays, and skates)—employ internal fertilization and usually lay large, heavy-shelled eggs or give birth to live young. The most characteristic features of the more primitive bony fishes is the assemblage of polyandrous (many males) breeding aggregations in open water and the absence of parental care...""spawning." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 03 Feb. 2011. 
There are two main reproduction methods in fish. The first method is by laying eggs and the second by live-bearing (producing their young alive).

==Sexual strategies==

===Basic strategies===

Monogamy occurs when one male mates with one female exclusively. This is also called pair spawning.Pair spawning Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 3 February 2011. Most fish are not monogamous, and when they are, they often alternate with non-monogamous behaviours. Monogamy can occur when feeding and breeding grounds are small, when it is difficult for fish to find partners, or when both sexes look after the young. Many tropical cichlids, which rear their young together in locations where they must fiercely defend against competitors and predators are monogamous.Barlow GW (2000) The cichlid fishes: Nature's grand experiment in evolution Perseus Publishing, ISBN 0-7382-0528-1. "In some pipefishes and seahorses, development of eggs takes a long time before the female can place them in the brood pouch of a male, where they are fertilized. While the male is pregnant, the female starts a new batch of eggs, which are ready at about the same time that the male gives birth to the young from the previous mating. This close timing of development promotes monogamy, especially if the likelihood of encountering another potential mate is low.
Polygyny occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In polygyny a large conspicuous male usually defends females from other males or defends a breeding site. The females choose large males that are successfully defending prime breeding sites which the females find attractive. For example, sculpin males defend "caves" underneath rocks which are suitable for the incubation of embryos.
Another way males get to mate with several females is through the use of leks. Leks are places where many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male they want to be their mate. For example, among the cichlid Cyrtocara eucinostomus in Lake Malawi, up to 50,000 large and colourful males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.[tpl]cite journal | author = McKaye  | year = 1983 | title = Ecology and breeding behavior of a cichilid fish, Cyrtocara eucinostomus, on a large lek in Lake Malawi, Africa | url = | journal = Envir. Biol. Fish. | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 81–96 | doi = 10.1007/BF00005175 [/tpl]
Polyandry occurs when one female gets exclusive mating rights with multiple males. This is not common, but it does happen among fish like clownfish that change their sex. It can also happen when males do the brooding but can cannot handle all the eggs the female produce, such as with some pipefish.[tpl]Rp|161[/tpl]
The males in some deep sea anglerfishes are much smaller than the females. When they find a female they bite into her skin, releasing an enzyme that digests the skin of their mouth and her body and fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly atrophies, losing first his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, ending as nothing more than a pair of gonads, which release sperm in response to hormones in the female's bloodstream indicating egg release. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W. Pietsch | title = Precocious sexual parasitism in the deep sea ceratioid anglerfish, Cryptopsaras couesi Gill | accessdate = 31 July 2008[/tpl] A single anglerfish female can "mate" with many males in this manner.
Polygynandry occurs when multiple males mate indiscriminately with multiple females. This mutual promiscuity is the approach most commonly used by spawning animals, and is perhaps the "original fish mating system."[tpl]Rp|161[/tpl] Common examples are forage fish, such as herrings, which form huge mating shoals in shallow water. The water becomes milky with sperm and the bottom is draped with millions of fertilized eggs.[tpl]Rp|161[/tpl]

===Cuckoldry===

Alternate male strategies which allow small males to engage in cuckoldry can develop in species where spawning is dominated by large and aggressive males. Cuckoldry is a variant of polyandry, and can occur with sneak spawners (sometimes called streak spawners). A sneak spawner is a male that rushes in to join the spawning rush of a spawning pair.Streak spawning Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011. A spawning rush occurs when a fish makes a burst of speed, usually on a near vertical incline, releasing gametes at the apex, followed by a rapid return to the lake or sea floor or fish aggregation.Spawning rush Fishbase Glossary. Retrieved 11 February 2011. Sneaking males do not take part in courtship. In salmon and trout, for example, jack males are common. These are small silvery males that migrate upstream along with the standard, large, hook-nosed males and that spawn by sneaking into redds to release sperm simultaneously with a mated pair. This behaviour is an evolutionarily stable strategy for reproduction, because it is favoured by natural selection just like the "standard" strategy of large males.Gross MR (1984) "Sunfish, salmon, and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics in fishes". Pages 55–75 in GW Potts and RJ Wottoon, eds. Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics. Academic Press.
Cuckoldry occurs in many fish species, including dragonets, parrotfishes and wrasses on tropical reefs and the bluegill sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that becomes too large to hide effectively become satellite males. With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They hover over a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. "Both sneaker and satellite males are usually badly chewed up by irate parental males by the end of the spawning season, but their strategy is nevertheless a successful one (giving them high fitness). Because these smaller males do not have to spend any energy on parental care, they can spawn at a much younger age than the parental males. Parental males may be 6 or 7 years old before they are large enough to compete successfully for the best nest sites, but the sneaker and satellite males may be only 2 or 3 years old."[tpl]Rp|161–2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Gross MR | year = 1982 | title = Sneakers, satellites and parentals: Polymorphic mating strategies in North American sunfishes | url = | journal = Z.

===Hermaphroditism===

Hermaphroditism occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes.Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics, Academic Press. "Hermaphrodites can be either synchronous, in which individuals possess both ovarian and testicular tissue, or sequential, in which individuals change sex. Synchronous hermaphrodites are uncommon. Among the best studied is the black hamlet, a species in which individuals take turns releasing sperm and eggs during spawning. Because such egg trading is advantageous to both individuals, hamlets are typically monogamous for short periods of time–an unusual situation in fishes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fischer EA, Peterson CW | year = 1987 | title = The evolution of sexuality in the seabasses | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 37 | issue = 7| pages = 482–489 | doi = 10.2307/1310420 [/tpl]  The most common pattern, known as Synchronous hermaphroditism, is for a female to change into a male (protogyny). This often happens when a large, dominant male controlling a harem of females is removed by a predator. Within a few days, the largest female in the harem becomes a dominant male and takes over the missing male's function. This pattern is common in coral reef fishes, such as parrotfishes, wrasses, and groupers. Less common than protogyny is protandry, in which a male converts to a female."[tpl]Rp|162[/tpl]
