Rancho Park is a small residential neighborhood in the Westside of the city of Los Angeles, California with mostly single family homes and tree lined streets. The community is nestled between West Los Angeles and Cheviot Hills. This enclave draws young professionals and families and is home to residents working in a variety of professional occupations. History proves the neighborhood was once a part of Westwood until Olympic Blvd. was placed dividing the area North and South. The Southern section, now known as Rancho Park, felt cut off from its North side lobbying for its own identity in the 1930s.

==Geography==

It is bordered by Sawtelle on the west, West Los Angeles on the northwest, Cheviot Hills on the East, Westside Village on the south. The district's boundaries, while somewhat ill-defined, are generally considered to be the San Diego Freeway (I-405) or Sepulveda on the west, Olympic Boulevard on the north, Manning Avenue (south of Pico Boulevard) and Beverly Glen Boulevard (north of Pico) on the east, and National Blvd. on the south. (Los Angeles City signs mark Olympic Boulevard as the district's northern boundary.)  Major thoroughfares include Pico, Westwood, Olympic, Sepulveda, and Beverly Glen Boulevards, nearby Santa Monica Boulevard, along with Overland and Manning Avenues.

==The name==

Rancho Park was named by area boosters after World War II.
  We thought it was about time to have our own community.  We must separate ourselves from Westwood.  There were many names suggested for our new community but there was a pioneer real estate broker here who had established his office on Pico near Manning back in 1927.  His name was Bill Heyler.  Bill did as much as any other one person to develop the area; so when it came time to adopting a name for the community, the wisdom of our pioneer was in counsel.  The honor of naming this community "Rancho Park" went to Bill Heyler.Gail B. McKay, quoted in "History of the Golden Westside, Book One, by Ralph Brogdon, The Rancho Park Story, Chapter One," Citizen-News, August 31, 1967 Heyler is also credited with bringing in the Rancho Park Golf Course, which opened in 1947.[tpl]cite news|last=Spitz|first=H.

==The neighborhood==

Rancho Park was developed in the 1920s as a middle-class area, and most of its housing stock consists of Spanish Colonial bungalows and ranch houses. Today, many of the modest sized homes have been rehabbed into larger and more modern architecture. Apart from the heavily traveled stretch of Pico Boulevard (including the Westside Pavilion shopping mall) in its central portions, the district has a notably quiet, suburban feel.  The district's streets are equipped with faux 19th-century streetlights and feature large deciduous trees in the strips between the sidewalk and the street.  (Rancho Park is one of the few districts in Los Angeles where fall foliage can be seen.)  The enclave is centrally located to other West side communities.
