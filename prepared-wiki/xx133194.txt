==Touchscreens==

In January of 2013 Lenovo announced the ThinkVision LT1423p, a mobile touchscreen display designed for use with Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system. The LT1423p is a 13.3-inch AH-IPS display with 1,600 by 900 resolution. The face of the device is Gorilla Glass in order to make it more durable. Pen-based and multitouch finger-based input are both supported. Wired and wireless versions will both be available. The wireless version, with a suggested price of US$449. will support WiFi and USB 3.0 connections and will have a 10-hour battery life. The wired version, with a suggested price of US$349, will use USB for both data and power. http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/06/lenovo-thinkvision-lt1423p-mobile-monitor/
