Paris is where Charles Mason Remey first met Thompson when she was taking classes on the religion from Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl.
Among many talks `Abdu'l-Bahá gave in the United States he gave one at her residence on 15 November 1912 at 48 West Tenth Street, New York.[tpl]Cite book | last = `Abdu'l-Bahá   |first =    | authorlink =  `Abdu'l-Bahá  | coauthors =  Notes of speeches by various  | title = Promulgation of Universal Peace   | publisher =  Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year = 1982 | location = Wilmette | pages = 431–437   | url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-127.html.utf8?query=principles&action=highlight#gr7| isbn = [/tpl] At this meeting he described distinctive qualities of the religion.

===Portrait of `Abdu'l-Bahá===

And during `Abdu'l-Bahá's first trip to the west in the fall of 1911 she met him at Thonon-les-Bains, France. During the second trip he reached New York - over several days he sat for a life-sized portrait starting June 1st.[tpl]Cite web | last = Lacroix-Hopson   | first = Eliane   | title = `Abdu'l-Bahá in New York: The City of the Covenant| work = About the Baha'is of New York City  | publisher = NewVistaDesign   | year = 1987   | url =http://www.bahainyc.org/about_us/city-of-covenant.pdf   | format = pdf   | doi =    | accessdate = 2009-10-26[/tpl]  Of the portrait, `Abdu'l-Bahá said "I want you to paint my servitude to God."

A reproduction was on display at the Second World Congress, and one is housed in the Seat of the Universal House of Justice just outside its meeting room for the members.

===Pilgrimages===

Over her life she made two Bahá'í pilgrimages. Her first was in July, 1909 when she began her diary which was eventually published. Her work is a main source on `Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West when he was in Europe in 1911 as well as some of his travels in the United States in 1912.
Thompson's second pilgrimage was in 1926.[tpl]cite journal | title = In Memoriam; Juliet Thompson | journal = Bahá'í World | year = 1970 | volume = 13 | pages = pp. 861–864 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm[/tpl]

Thompson died on December 9, 1956 at home. At the memorial service held for her at the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, several notable people spoke or sent messages - several Hands of the Cause and Paul E. Haney, Charles Mason Remey, Horace Holley, and Amelia Engelder Collins, and later Universal House of Justice member Charles Wolcott, as well as many notable Bahá'ís.
