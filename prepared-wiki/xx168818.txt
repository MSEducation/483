[[Small Hythe]]

CATEGORIES: Hamlets in Kent

Small Hythe is a hamlet near Tenterden in Kent, England.
It stood on a branch of the Rother estuary and was a busy shipbuilding port in the 15th century, before the silting up and draining of the Romney Marshes.
Small Hythe's quays and warehouses were destroyed in a fire in 1514 and were never rebuilt.Donald Maxwell, Unknown Kent (1921).

==History==

Small Hythe was within the medieval hundred of Tenterden, which does not appear to have existed at the time of the Domesday Book. It is first mentioned in about 1300 and received a charter in 1449 from Henry VI.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Tenterden |title=Tenterden - LoveToKnow 1911 |publisher=www.1911encyclopedia.org |accessdate=2010-02-11 [/tpl] Small Hythe itself lay on a branch of the River Rother, which certainly in 1509 made the locality accessible to seagoing craft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63409 |title=The hundred, town and parish of Tenterden |publisher =  British History Online |accessdate=2010-02-11 [/tpl]
