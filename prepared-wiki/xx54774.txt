==Governors==

Initially after the American Revolution, parts of the area now known as Ohio were claimed by New York, Virginia, and Connecticut; however, New York ceded its claim in 1782, Virginia in 1784, and Connecticut in 1786, though it maintained its Western Reserve in the area until 1800.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.heritagepursuit.com/Sandusky/SanduskyCII.htm | title=Ownership of the Northwest | publisher=Heritage Pursuit | accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl] On July 13, 1787, the Northwest Territory was formed. As territories were split from it, it eventually came to represent just present-day Ohio.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jlindquist.com/mapsupp1.html | title=Evolution of Territories and States from the Old "Northwest Territory" | publisher=John Lindquist | accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl]

===Governors of Northwest Territory===

Throughout its 15-year history, Northwest Territory had only one governor, Arthur St. Clair. He was removed from office by President Thomas Jefferson November 22, 1802, and no successor was named, with Charles Willing Byrd, Secretary of the Territory, becoming Acting Governor, serving until Tiffin was inaugurated March 3, 1803.[tpl]cite book |title=The Life and Public Services of Arthur St. Clair |editor-first=William Henry |editor-last=Smith |editor-link=William Henry Smith (Ohio politician)|volume=1 |page=246 |publisher=Robert Clarke and Company |year=1882 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sIUvN0eyjsIC&pg=PA246&dq=November[/tpl]  There was no Ohio Territory; Ohio is considered the successor state to the Northwest Territory.

===Governors of the State of Ohio===

Ohio was admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803. Since then, it has had 62 governors, six of whom served non-consecutive terms.
The first constitution of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two years, limited to six of any eight years, commencing on the first Monday in the December following an election.Ohio Constitution article II, § 3 The current constitution of 1851 removed the term limit, and shifted the start of the term to the second Monday in January following an election.[tpl]cite book | last1=Steinglass | first1=Steven H. | first2=Gino J. | last2=Scarselli | title=The Ohio State Constitution: A Reference Guide | url=http://books.google.com/?id=mQQ_eD1C2CsC | accessdate=May 30, 2008 | year=2004 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | pages=164–166 | isbn=0-313-26765-0[/tpl] In 1908, Ohio switched from holding elections in odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, with the preceding governor (from the 1905 election) serving an extra year.Article XVII (adopted November, 1905) of Constitution, section 2: "And the General Assembly shall have power to so extend existing terms of office as to effect the purpose of section 1 of this article." and section 3 : "Every elective officer holding office when this amendment is adopted shall continue to hold such office for the full term for which he was elected and until his successor shall be elected and qualified as provided by law."  source: [tpl]cite book|ref=sandles|title=The biographical annals of Ohio 1906-1907-1908 : A handbook of the Government and Institutions of the State of Ohio |editor1-first=A P|editor1-last=Sandles |editor2-first=E W |editor2-last=Doty |publisher=State of Ohio |page=123 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V-clAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA123[/tpl] A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again.Ohio Constitution article III, § 2 An Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1973 clarified this to mean governors could theoretically serve unlimited terms, as long as they waited four years after every second term.
Should the office of governor become vacant due to death, resignation, or conviction of impeachment, the lieutenant governor assumes the title of governor. Should the office of lieutenant governor also become vacant, the president of the senate becomes the acting governor.Ohio Constitution article III, § 15 If the vacancy of both offices took place during the first twenty months of the term, a special election is to be held on the next even-numbered year to elect new officers to serve out the current term.Ohio Constitution article III, § 17 Prior to 1851, the speaker of the senate acted as governor for the term.Ohio Constitution article II, § 12 Since 1974, the governor and lieutenant governor have been elected on the same ticket; prior to then, they could be (and often were) members of different parties.
