[[Hymir]]

CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Hymir is a giant, husband of the giantess Hroðr and according to the Eddic poem Hymiskviða the father of the god Týr. He is the owner of a mile-wide cauldron which the Æsir wanted to brew beer in; Thor, accompanied by Týr, obtained it from him. He has several daughters.

==Attestations==

===Hymiskviða and Gylfaginning===

Hymiskviða recounts how Thor and Týr obtain the cauldron from Hymir. His skull is unusually hard, and Thor breaks a cup by throwing it at Hymir's head.
Hymiskviða also recounts Thor's fishing for Jörmungandr, the Midgard serpent.[tpl]Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Hilda Ellis |authorlink=Hilda Ellis Davidson |title=The Lost Beliefs of Northern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |location= |pages=50–53 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sWLVZN0H224C&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false  |isbn=0-203-40850-0[/tpl] Thor goes fishing with Hymir, using the head of Hymir's best ox for bait, and catches Jörmungandr, who then either breaks loose[tpl]Cite book |last1=Bellows |first1=Henry Adams (transl.) |author1-link=Henry Adams Bellows (businessman) |contribution=Hymiskviða |title=The Poetic Edda |publisher= |year=1936 |location= |pages=144–147 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe09.htm  |isbn= [/tpl] or, as told in the Gylfaginning of the Prose Edda, is cut loose by Hymir.[tpl]Cite book |author1=Snorri Sturluson |authorlink=Snorri Sturluson |last2=Brodeur |first2=Arthur Gilchrist (transl.) |author2-link=Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur |contribution=Gylfaginning |title=The Prose Edda |publisher=The American-Scandinavian Foundation |year=1916 |location= |pages=69–70 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm  |isbn= [/tpl] The Prose Edda provides the additional detail that while Thor was attempting to pull Jörmungandr in, his feet went through the bottom of the boat.

===Picture stones===

This encounter between Thor and Jörmungandr seems to have been one of the most popular motifs in Norse art. Three picture stones have been linked with the story and show Hymir: the Ardre VIII image stone, the Hørdum stone, and the Gosforth Cross.[tpl]Cite book |last=Sørensen |first=Preben M. |coauthors=Williams, Kirsten (transl.) |editor-last=Acker |editor-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |contribution=Þorr's Fishing Expedition (Hymiskviða) |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |pages=119–138 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j4bufbA_UpQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |isbn=0-8153-1660-7[/tpl] p. 122-123, 127-128.
