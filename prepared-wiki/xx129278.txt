"Don't Say Goodnight (It's Time for Love)" is a 1980 quiet storm soul record by The Isley Brothers, released on their T-Neck imprint. The song, which was released as an answer of sorts to Teddy Pendergrass' hit, "Turn Off the Lights", was an ode to love sung by Ronald Isley who begs his lady in his trademark falsetto to give him her love stating if "people say that love is for the giving/so lemme love you girl". Released as the first single off their 1980 platinum album, Go All the Way, the song was also their last Top 40 pop hit in sixteen years, peaking at number thirty-nine pop while reaching number-one on the R&B singles chart.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=278[/tpl] In 2006, the 7" single's instrumental B-side was sampled by J Dilla on the instrumental album Donuts.
