Darren Aronofsky (born February 12, 1969) is an American film director, screenwriter and film producer. He has received acclaim for his often surreal, disturbing films and has been noted for frequent collaborations with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, film editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. His films have generated controversy and are well known for their often violent, bleak subject matter.
Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and the American Film Institute to study directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for best first screenplay. Aronofsky's followup, Requiem for a Dream, was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. After turning down an opportunity to direct an entry in the Batman franchise and writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following.
His fourth film, The Wrestler, was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. In 2010 Aronofsky was an executive producer on The Fighter and his fifth feature film, Black Swan, received further critical acclaim and many accolades, being nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and winning Best Actress for Natalie Portman's performance in the film. Aronofsky received nominations for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and a DGA nomination. His sixth film, Noah, was released in theaters on March 28, 2014.

==Directing style==

Aronofsky's first two films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of extremely short shots, also known as hip hop montages.[tpl]cite book | last = Boyd | first = Susan | title = Hooked | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-415-95706-0 |pages=97–98[/tpl] While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups.[tpl]cite book | last = Booker | first = M. | title = Postmodern Hollywood | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-275-99900-9 [/tpl] Long tracking shots (including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam) and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices.[tpl]cite book |last=Powell |first=Anna |title=Deleuze, Altered States and Film |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |isbn=0-7486-3282-4 |page=75[/tpl] Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme distance shots to create a sense of isolation.[tpl]cite book |last=Dancyger |first=Ken |title=The Technique of Film and Video Editing |publisher=Focal |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-240-80420-1 |pages=257–258[/tpl]
With The Fountain, Aronofsky restricted the use of computer-generated imagery. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, "Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics... and I think the results are outstanding."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.awn.com/news/visual-effects/look-effects-does-more-less-cg-fountain | title=Look Effects Does More With Less CG on The Fountain | publisher=Animation World Network|date=October 26, 2006| accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl] He used more subtle directing in The Wrestler and Black Swan, which less visceral directing style showcases the acting and narratives. Aronofsky filmed both works with a muted palette and a grainy style.[tpl]cite news|last=Barry |first=Colleen |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100901/eu-italy-venice-film-festival/ |title=Black Swan opens Venice Film Festival |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 1, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sQGLcLbm |archivedate=August 1, 2010[/tpl] The cinematographer Matthew Libatique has collaborated with Aronofsky on three films, and film composer Clint Mansell has worked with him on all five films.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics/t/thewrestler.php | title=Springsteenlyrics.com[/tpl] Mansell's music is an often important element of the films.[tpl]cite news |last=Weiland |first=Jonah |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5080 |title=Talking with the Makers of "The Fountain" |work=Comic Book Resources | date=April 11, 2005 | accessdate=November 10, 2006[/tpl]

===Themes and influences===

Pi features several references to mathematics and mathematical theories. In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for "Pi":
The visual style of "Pi" (and even "Requiem for a Dream") features numerous similarities to the Japanese film Tetsuo: The Iron Man."Darren Aronofsky: THE ASK HOLLYWOOD INTERVIEW". Darren Aronofsky Online (1998). Retrieved 2013-08-27.
"An Interview with Darren Aronofsky and Sean Gullette of "Pi"". IndieWire (January 21, 1998). Retrieved 2013-08-27.
The majority of reviewers characterized Requiem for a Dream in the genre of "drug movies", along with films like The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting, Spun, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.[tpl]cite book |last=Boyd |first=Susan |title=Hooked |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-95706-0 |pages=97–98[/tpl] But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying:
With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for The Fountain; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that The Matrix redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science.[tpl]cite news | last=Linder | first=Brian | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/050/050987p1.html | title=Aronofsky, Pitt Team for Sci-Fi Epic | work=IGN | date=April 5, 2001 | accessdate=November 1, 2006[/tpl]
In the Toronto International Film Festival interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 Charles Mingus song "The Clown" as a major influence on The Wrestler. It's an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2207076/ |title=The Wrestler Is Good |journal=Slate |last=Foley |first=Mick |publisher=The Slate Group |date=December 18, 2008 |accessdate=December 18, 2008 |authorlink=Mick Foley[/tpl]
Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to The Wrestler, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as "too much for one movie". He compared the two films: "Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would even call it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves." About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby,[tpl]cite news|last=Wigler |first=Josh |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/05/natalie-portman-likens-black-swan-to-rosemarys-baby-in-terms-of-tone/ |title=Natalie Portman Likens Black Swan To Rosemary's Baby In Terms of Tone |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlueS6jv |archivedate=August 6, 2010[/tpl] while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were "big influences" on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by Alejandro Jodorowsky' movieshttps://www.filmin.es/blog/las-peliculas-favoritas-de-darren-aronofsky and David Cronenberg's early work.[tpl]cite news|last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/08/vincent-cassel-on-mesrine-black-swan-and-acting-you-need-a-hard-on-perpetually.php?page=3 |title=Vincent Cassel on Mesrine, Black Swan, and Acting |work=Movieline |date=August 26, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sK8q2fXY |archivedate=August 28, 2010[/tpl]

==Controversy==

Several aspects of Aronofsky's films have been controversial, most notably Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler and Black Swan. Requiem for a Dream was originally set for release in 2000, but it met with controversy in the United States, being rated NC-17 by the MPAA due to a graphic sex scene.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.screendaily.com/mpaa-slams-nc-17-rating-on-artisans-requiem/403357.article| title =MPAA slams NC-17 rating on Artisan's 'Requiem' | publisher = Screendaily| author = Goodridge, Mike | date= August 22, 2000 | accessdate= December 19, 2010[/tpl] Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied and Artisan decided to release the film unrated.[tpl]cite web | last=Hernandez | first=Eugene | coauthors=Anthony Kaufman | title=MPAA Upholds NC-17 Rating for Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream"; Artisan Stands Behind Film and Will Release Film Unrated | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/daily_news_artisan_backs_unrated_requiem_san_sebastian_lineup_shaping_up/ | date=August 25, 2000 | work=indieWIRE | publisher=SnagFilms | accessdate=November 1, 2011[/tpl]
The Wrestler has been condemned as an "anti-Iranian" film in many Iran newspapers and websites, in response to a scene in which Mickey Rourke violently breaks a pole bearing an Iranian flag in half across his knee. Borna News, a state-run Iranian newspaper, also criticized the heel (bad-guy) wrestler character "The Ayatollah." Portrayed as a villain, he wears Arabic items of clothing (keffiyeh and bisht), which the newspaper believed was intended to lead audiences to associate Iranians with Arabs. In the wrestling ring, he wears a skimpy leotard in the pattern of an Iranian flag with the alef character, representing the first letter of the word Ayatollah.[tpl]Cite news  | last = Tait | first = Robert | title = Iranian official demands apology from visiting Hollywood delegation | newspaper = The Guardian  | date = December 13, 2008 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/dec/13/usa-iran-the-wrestler | location=London[/tpl]
Some Iranian newspapers avoided mentioning the character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from a delegation of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and unfair portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.[tpl]Cite news  | last = Mostaghim | first = Ramin | title = Iranian official demands apology from visiting Hollywood delegation | newspaper = Los Angeles Times  | date = March 2, 2009 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-iran-hollywood2-2009mar02,0,2857275.story[/tpl]
The question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers in Black Swan was one publicized controversy related to the film.[tpl]cite web|title=Black Swan: Amy Westcott Interview |url=http://clothesonfilm.com/black-swan-amy-westcott-interview/18997/ |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |publisher=Clothes on Film |first=Chris |last=Laverty |date=January 28, 2011[/tpl] The media gave substantial coverage to the dance double controversy: how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to Portman and how much to her "dance double", Sarah Lane, an American Ballet Theatre soloist.[tpl]cite news | url = http://pointemagazine.com/issues/aprilmay-2010/call-board | title = Ballet All Over: Big Names in Black Swan | work = Pointe Magazine | publisher = Macfadden Performing Arts Media | author = Fuhrer, Margaret | date = May 21, 2010[/tpl] Lane claimed to have danced more than she was credited. The director and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. Their released statements said, "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film."[tpl]cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/26/black-swan-responds-cover-up/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly |first=Jeff |last=Labrecque|date=March 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |title='Black Swan' controversy: 'Natalie herself did most of the dancing,' insist filmmakers[/tpl]
