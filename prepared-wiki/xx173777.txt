[[Translocase of the outer membrane]]

CATEGORIES: Transport proteins, Mitochondria, Outer membrane proteins

The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) is a complex of proteins found in the outer mitochondrial membrane of the mitochondria. Its function is to allow movement of proteins through this barrier and into the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion. Most of the proteins needed for mitochondrial function are encoded by the nucleus of the cell. The outer membrane of the mitochondrion is impermeable to large molecules greater than 5000 Daltons.[tpl]cite book| last = Alberts| first = Bruce| authorlink = | coauthors = Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter| year = 1994| title = Molecular Biology of the Cell| publisher = Garland Publishing Inc.| location = New York| isbn = 0-8153-3218-1[/tpl] The TOM works in conjunction with the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) to translocate proteins into the mitochondrion. Many of the proteins in the TOM complex, such as TOMM22, were first identified in Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[tpl]cite journal | author=Seki N, Moczko M, Nagase T, et al. |title=A human homolog of the mitochondrial protein import receptor Mom19 can assemble with the yeast mitochondrial receptor complex |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=375 |issue= 3 |pages= 307–10 |year= 1996 |pmid= 7498524 |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(95)01229-8  [/tpl]
The complete mitochondrial protein translocase complex includes at least 19 proteins: several chaperones, four proteins of the outer membrane translocase (Tom) import receptor, five proteins of the Tom channel complex, five proteins of the inner membrane translocase (Tim) and three "motor" proteins.

==Protein targeting to the mitochondria==

There are various mitochondrial import pathways that exist to facilitate the import of precursor proteins to their destined mitochondrial subcompartments. HSP90 aids the delivery of the mitochondrial preprotein to the TOM complex in an ATP-dependent process.[tpl]cite journal | journal=J Biol Chem. |date=March 2005 | volume=280 | issue=12 | pages=11535–43 | title= Dissection of the mitochondrial import and assembly pathway for human Tom40 | author=Humphries AD, Streimann IC, Stojanovski D, Johnston AJ, Yano M, Hoogenraad NJ, Ryan MT | pmid=15644312 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M413816200[/tpl] Many precursor proteins (those that are destined for the matrix) contain amino-terminal presequences that carry information required for the targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial matrix[tpl]cite journal | author = Saitoh T, Igura M, Obita T, Ose T, Kojima R, Maenaka K, Endo T, Kohda D | title = Tom20 recognizes mitochondrial presequences through dynamic equilibrium among multiple bound states | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 26 | issue = 22 | pages = 4777–87 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 17948058 | pmc = 2080804 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601888 | url =  [/tpl] These matrix targeting signals generally contain 10-80 amino acid residues that take on the conformation of an amphipathic-α helix[tpl]cite journal | author = Tokatlidis K, Vial S, Luciano P, Vergnolle M, Clémence S | title = Membrane protein import in yeast mitochondria | journal = Biochem.

Some proteins however, that are targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane contain a hydrophobic tail domain that anchors the protein to the membrane.[tpl]cite journal | author = Koehler CM, Merchant S, Schatz G | title = How membrane proteins travel across the mitochondrial intermembrane space | journal = Trends Biochem.

==Members of the complex==

The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) forms a complex made of Tom70, Tom22, and Tom20, along with Tom40, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5. Tom20 and Tom22 are preprotein receptors, which are responsible for recognition of the cleavable presequence possessed by mitochondrial-targeted proteins.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ryan MT, Müller H, Pfanner N | title = Functional staging of ADP/ATP carrier translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane | journal = J.
