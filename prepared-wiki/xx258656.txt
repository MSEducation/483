==Playing career==

After playing four years with St. Cloud State University, Lasch completed his collegiate career as the University's all time leading scorer.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://www.scsuhuskies.com/custompages/MHOCKEY/Career/histcarr.htm#CIL.FCA | title = Huskies' leading scorers | publisher =  St. Cloud State Huskies | date = 2010-10-14 | accessdate = 2013-01-02[/tpl] An Undrafted Free Agent, Lasch began his professional career in Europe, signing a one-year contract with Södertälje SK of the Swedish Elitserien. During the following 2011–12 season he led the Finnish SM-Liiga with 62 points to capture the scoring title whilst helping the Lahti Pelicans to finish second, their highest in franchise history.
Despite re-signing to a one-year contract extension with the Pelicans, on May 31, 2012, Lasch was signed by the Anaheim Ducks to a two-year contract prior to the 2012–13 season. In signing he became the franchise's first Orange county-born player to sign with the Ducks.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://ducks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=633411 | title = Q&A: Ryan Lasch | publisher = Anaheim Ducks | date = 2012-05-31 | accessdate = 2012-05-31[/tpl] Due to the lockout he was directly assigned to the Ducks AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals. 
Unable to duplicate his European success with the Admirals, and also enduring a stint with ECHL club the Fort Wayne Komets, Lasch opted to return to the Swedish Elitserien, signing on loan from the Ducks to the Växjö Lakers for the remainder of the season on January 26, 2013.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://vaxjolakers.se/artikel/32971/ | title = Lasch joins Lakers for remainder of season | publisher = Växjö Lakers | date = 2013-01-26 | accessdate = 2013-01-26 | language = Swedish[/tpl] After playing in the Lakers last 10 games to end their season, the Ducks traded Lasch along with a seventh round pick in 2014 to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for David Steckel on March 15 2013. He was then immediately recalled to report to AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies.[tpl]citeweb| url =  http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=418251 | title = Leafs trade Steckel to Ducks for Lasch, draft pick | publisher = The Sports Network | date = 2013-03-15 | accessdate = 2013-03-15[/tpl]
