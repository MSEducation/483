[[Northeastern Ontario]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Northern Ontario

Northeastern Ontario is the region within the Canadian province of Ontario which lies north and east of Lakes Superior and Huron.
Northeastern Ontario consists of the districts of Algoma, Sudbury, Cochrane, Timiskaming, Nipissing and Manitoulin; and the single-tier municipality of Greater Sudbury.
For some purposes, Parry Sound District and Muskoka District Municipality are treated as part of Northeastern Ontario even though they are geographically in Central Ontario. These two divisions are coloured in green on the map.
Northeastern Ontario and Northwestern Ontario may also be grouped together as Northern Ontario. An important difference between the two sub-regions is that Northeastern Ontario has a sizeable Franco-Ontarian population â€” approximately 25 per cent of the region's population speaks French as a first language, compared to just 3.2 per cent in the northwest.

==Cities and towns==

Northeastern Ontario has six cities. They are Greater Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, Timmins, Elliot Lake and Temiskaming Shores.
Smaller towns in the region include Espanola, Blind River, Chapleau, Cochrane, Englehart, Hearst, Iroquois Falls, Kapuskasing, Kirkland Lake, Moosonee, French River, St. Charles, Markstay-Warren and West Nipissing.
