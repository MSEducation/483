The 99 names of God in Islam (or the 99 names of Allah; [tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|أسماء الله الحسنى[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ʾasmāʾ allāh al-ḥusnā[/tpl]) are the names by which Muslims regard God. Among other places, they are described in the Qur'an and Sunnah.[tpl]cite book |year=2004 |title=Religious Studies for AQA; Thinking About God and Morality |isbn=0-435-30713-4 |publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishers |location=Oxford |first=Marrianne |last=Fleming |coauthors=Worden, David[/tpl]Abdullah Saeed, The Qur'an: An Introduction, pg. 63. London: Routledge, 2008. ISBN 9781134102945 There is, according to hadith, a special group of 99 names, but no enumeration of them. Thus the exact list is not agreed upon, and the names of God (as adjectives, word constructs, or otherwise) exceed a total of 99 in the Qur'an and Sunnah. According to a hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, some of the names of God have also been hidden from mankind.[tpl]cite book |title=The Goodly Word: al-Kalim al-Ṭayyib |isbn=1-903682-15-0 |publisher=Islamic Texts Society |first=Ibn |last=Taymiyya |page=72[/tpl]

==Origin==

According to Islamic tradition,Ibn Majah, Book of Du`a;[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] Imam Malik, Muwatta', Kitab al-Shi`r. Muhammad is said to have invoked Allah by a number of names. The most common hadith used to cite the 99 names is considered weak, though there are less commonly cited hadith which are considered authentic and also support the same point.Diane Morgan, Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice, pg. 10. Santa Barbara, California Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2010. ISBN 9780313360251 A widely accepted hadith in Sahih Muslim states:
[tpl]quote |Abu Hurairah reported Allah's Messenger Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as saying: "There are ninety-nine names of Allah; he who commits them to memory would get into Paradise. Verily, Allah is Odd (He is one and it is an odd number) and He loves odd numbers. And in the narration of Ibn 'Umar words are: "He who enumerated them"." |Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri |Sahih Muslim [tpl]Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|35|6475[/tpl][/tpl]
Over time, it became custom to recite a list of 99 names, compiled by al-Walid ibn Muslim,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] as an addendum to the hadith. In 2005, Mahmoud Abdel-Razek compiled an alternative list, endorsing only 69 from the al-Walid list.Mahmoud Abdul Razek Al Radwany, "Of the 99 Names Of Allah That We Repeat: Only 69 Are Authentic" published in the Egyptian daily, Al Ahram, on Nov 18, 2005. His objections are mostly grammatical in that a 'name' in Arabic must be a noun: "only 69 of those Names are authenticated from the Quran and Sunnah, while 29 are not authentic in that 22 are verbs or adjectives, and 7 are 'modafa' or 'added to.'" Islamic Forum
The Qur'an refers to the names of God as God's "most beautiful Names" ([tpl]unicode|al-ʾasmāʾ al-ḥusnā[/tpl]).See the suras "Al-A'raf" (7:180), "Al-Isra" (17:110), "Ta-Ha" (20:8) and "Al-Hashr" (59:24). According to Gerhard Böwering:
[tpl]quote |They are traditionally enumerated as 99 in number to which is added as the highest Name ([tpl]unicode|al-ism al-ʾaʿẓam[/tpl]), the Supreme Name of God: Allāh. The locus classicus for listing the Divine Names in the literature of [tpl]unicode|Qurʾānic[/tpl] commentary is 17:110, “Call upon God, or call upon The Merciful; whichsoever you call upon, to Him belong the most beautiful Names,” and also 59:22-24, which includes a cluster of more than a dozen Divine epithets.[/tpl] Mystic philosopher Ibn Arabi surmized that the 99 names are outward signs of the universe's inner mysteries.Malcolm Clark, Islam For Dummies. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2011. ISBN 9781118053966
Most, though not all, of the 99 names appear in the Qur'an with a smaller number appearing exclusively in the hadith.Martin Parsons, Unveiling God, pg. 206. William Carey Library, 2005. ISBN 9780878084548Juan Eduardo Campo, Encyclopedia of Islam, pg. 515. Infobase Publishing, 2009. ISBN 9781438126968 The total number of all names in both the Qur'an and the hadith actually add up to more than 99,Susanne Enderwitz, "The 99: Islamic Superheroes - A New Species."

==Lists of names==

There isn't universal agreement among Muslims as to what exactly counts as a name and what does not. Additionally, while some names are only in the Qur'an, and others are only in the hadith, there are some names which appear in both. Different sources give different lists of the 99 names.

==The Greatest Name==

The 99 names point to the inherent unity of the all-embracing Greatest Name (Ismi Azam).[tpl]cite book |last = Schimmel |first = Annemarie | authorlink = Annemarie Schimmel |year = 1993 |title = The Mystery of Numbers |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = New York, USA |isbn = 0-19-508919-7 | page = 271|url = http://books.google.com/?id=lBIZ9PRZvPIC&pg=PA271[/tpl] In Islamic traditions, it is stated "The Greatest Name of Allah is the one which if He Allah is called (prayed to) by it, He will Answer."[tpl]cite book |last = Momen |first = Moojan |year = 2000 |title = Islam and the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = George Ronald |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-446-8 |pages = 241[/tpl] The endnote states: "Ibn Májah, Sunan, 34.

Similar statements in Shi'i Traditions include: Majlisí, Bihár al-Anwár, vol. 26. p. 7."

==Personal names==

According to Islamic tradition,Islam-QA website Are there any names which it is forbidden to use? If so, what are they? a Muslim may not be given any of the 99 names of Allah in exactly the same form.  For example, nobody may be named al-Malik (The King), but may be named Malik (King). This is because of the belief that Allah is almighty, and no human being is the equivalent of Allah, and no human being will ever be the equivalent of Allah. Muslims are allowed to use the 99 names of Allah for themselves but should not put 'Al' at the front of them.Prohibited Muslim Names.
However the names of Allah can be combined with the word "‘Abd-" which means "servant/Worshiper" (of Allah) and are commonly used as personal names among Muslims. For example ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ("Servant of the Most Compassionate/the Beneficent"). The two parts of the name may be written separately (as above) or combined as one transliterated name; in such a case, the vowel transcribed after ‘Abd is often written as u when the two words are transcribed as one: e.g., Abdurrahman, Abdul'aziz, "Abdul Jabbar", or even Abdullah ("Servant of Allah"). (This has to do with Arabic case vowels, the final u vowel showing the normal "quote" nominative/vocative case form: ‘abd-u.)
Some Muslim people have names resembling those 99. Examples include:

==Views of other religions==

===Bábí and Bahá'í view===

Bahá'í sources state that the 100th name was revealed as "Bahá’" (an Arabic word بهاء meaning "glory, splendor" etc.), which is the root word for Bahá'u'lláh and Bahá'í. They also believe that it is the 'Greatest Name'.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= greatest name |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 167–8[/tpl] The Báb wrote a noted pentagram-shaped tablet with 360 derivatives of the word "Bahá'" used in it.
According to Bahá'í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávari, Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili adopted the pen name (takhallus) 'Baha' after being inspired by words of Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam) and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the Greatest Name of God was included in either Du'ay-i-Sahar or A`amaal Ummi Dawud.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Bahá'í Studies Review |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1993 |first=Stephen |last=Lambden |title=The Word Bahá': Quintessence of the Greatest Name |url=http://bahai-library.com/lambden_quintessence_greatest_name[/tpl] In the first verse of the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a dawn prayer for Ramadan, the name "Bahá" appears four times: "Allahumma inni as 'aluka min Bahá' ika bi Abháh va kulla Bahá' ika Bahí".[tpl]cite journal |title=Bahá'u'lláh and His Most Holy Shrine |first=Dhikru'llah |last=Khadem |authorlink=Dhikru'llah Khadem |journal=Bahá'í News |date=March 1976 |pages=4–5 |url=http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm |issue=540[/tpl]

===Zoroastrianism===

Some names of Allah are similar to 101 names of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.http://www.avesta.org/ka/101names.htm
