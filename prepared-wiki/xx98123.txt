[[Earl of Inverness]]

CATEGORIES: Inverness, Peerages in the Jacobite peerage, Earldoms in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

The title of Earl of Inverness (Scottish Gaelic:Iarla Inbhir Nis) was first created in 1718 in the Jacobite Peerage of Scotland by James Francis Edward Stuart ("James III & VIII") for the Honourable John Hay of Cromlix, third son of the 7th Earl of Kinnoull, but became extinct upon the death of the grantee in 1740.
It has been created several times in  of the Peerage of the United Kingdom, each time as a subsidiary title for a member of the royal family.  It was created first in 1801 as a subsidiary title of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, sixth son of George III, becoming extinct in 1843.  Sussex's second wife (whom he married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act of 1772) was given the title of Duchess of Inverness, which became extinct upon her death in 1873.
The next creation was for Prince George, second son of Edward VII, as a subsidiary title along with the Dukedom of York. As the Prince became King in 1910, succeeding his father, his titles merged in the crown.
The title was created again in 1920 as a subsidiary title of Prince Albert, second son of George V, who was also created Duke of York at the same time.  The title merged in the crown when York succeeded his brother in 1936 to become King George VI.
The title was created a fourth time in 1986 as a subsidiary title for Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York.
