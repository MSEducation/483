Iron deficiency (sideropenia or hypoferremia) is one of the most common of the nutritional deficiencies.[ref]

Examples include as a carrier of oxygen to the tissues from the lungs in the form of hemoglobin, as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes, and as an integral part of enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.
The eventual consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia where the body's stores of iron have been depleted and the body is unable to maintain levels of haemoglobin in the blood. Children and pre-menopausal women are the groups most prone to the disease.
Total body iron averages approximately 3.8 g in men and 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin. There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron deficiency anemia.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms of iron deficiency can occur even before the condition has progressed to iron deficiency anemia.
Symptoms of iron deficiency are not unique to iron deficiency (i.e. not pathognomonic). Iron is needed for many enzymes to function normally, so a wide range of symptoms may eventually emerge, either as the secondary result of the anemia, or as other primary results of iron deficiency.  Symptoms of iron deficiency include:
Continued iron deficiency may progress to anaemia and worsening fatigue.  Thrombocytosis, or an elevated platelet count, can also result.  A lack of sufficient iron levels in the blood is a reason that some people cannot donate blood.

==Causes==

Though genetic defects causing iron deficiency have been studied in rodents, there are no known genetic disorders of human iron metabolism that directly cause iron deficiency.

===Athletics===

Possible reasons that athletics may contribute to lower iron levels includes mechanical hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells from physical impact), loss of iron through sweat and urine, gastrointestinal blood loss, and haematuria (presence of blood in urine).[tpl]cite journal|last=Nielson|first=Peter|coauthors=Nachtigall, Detlef|title=Iron supplementation in athletes: current recommendations|journal=Sports Med|date=Oct 1998|volume=26|pages=207–216|url=http://camilleherron.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ironsupplementation.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Chatard|first=Jean-Claude|coauthors=Mujika, Iñigo; Guy, Claire; Lacour, Jean-René|title=Anaemia and Iron Deficiency in Athletes Practical Recommendations for Treatment|journal=Sports Med|date=Apr 1999|volume=27|series=4|pages=229–240|url=http://www.pilarmartinescudero.com/pdf/asignaturabiopatologia/LecturasRecomendadas/Anaemiaandirondeficiencyinathletes.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2013|doi=10.2165/00007256-199927040-00003[/tpl] Although small amounts of iron are excreted in sweat and urine, these losses can generally be seen as insignificant even with increased sweat and urine production, especially considering that athlete’s bodies appear to become conditioned to retain iron better. Mechanical hemolysis is most likely to occur in high impact sports, especially among long distance runners who experience “foot-strike hemolysis” from the repeated impact of their feet with the ground. Exercise-induced gastrointestinal bleeding is most likely to occur in endurance athletes. Haematuria in athletes is most likely to occur in those that undergo repetitive impacts on the body, particularly affecting the feet (such as running on a hard road or Kendo) and hands (e.g.Conga or Candombe drumming). Additionally, athletes in sports that emphasize weight loss (ballet, gymnastics, marathon running, wrestling) as well as sports that emphasize high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets, may be at an increased risk for iron deficiency.
