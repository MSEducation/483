[[Big Dumb Object]]

CATEGORIES: Science fiction themes, Fictional objects, Narratology

In discussion of science fiction, a Big Dumb Object (BDO) is any mysterious object (usually of extraterrestrial or unknown origin and immense power) in a story which generates an intense sense of wonder just by being there; to a certain extent, the term deliberately deflates this. Probably coined by reviewer Roz Kaveney,Kaveney, Roz, 1981, Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction, issue 22. the term was not in general use until Peter Nicholls included it in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction as a joke.Nicholls, Peter, 2000, Big Dumb Objects and Cosmic Enigmas: The Love Affair between Space Fiction and the Transcendental, in Westfahl, Gary (ed), Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction, Greenwood Press, p. 13. "... I decided to write an April Fool's entry. I would pretend that a phrase Iâ€™d always liked, originated by the critic Roz Kaveney but not in general use, was actually a known critical term. I would write an entry called 'Big Dumb Objects' in a poker-faced style, suggesting an even more absurd critical term to be used in its place, 'megalotropic sf.'"
Big Dumb Objects often exhibit extreme or unusual properties, or a total absence of expected properties:[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
