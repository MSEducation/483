By the mid-1990s, the World Superbike championship had more international stars (such as Troy Corser and Carl Fogarty) and Pirovano was less competitive. In [tpl]SBK|1995[/tpl], a second place finish at the season-opener at Hockenheim was his only podium, and he left the championship at the end of the year. He moved to the Open Championship for 1996, winning several races[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europark.com/ny-gpdat/ny-pw_ss.htm |title=1990-2005 Supersport Winners / World Championship Superbike Series |publisher=Europark.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] and remained there as it became the Supersport World Championship in [tpl]WorldSS|1997[/tpl]. He was champion with five wins in [tpl]WorldSS|1998[/tpl], and finished in the top 10 in the four other seasons he contested. In [tpl]WorldSS|2001[/tpl] his best results were a pair of 5th places,http://website.lineone.net/~mouser/motorsport/2001/world-supersport600/wss600-2001-results.htm and this proved to be his last full season. As of 2006 he was semi-retired, but won a one-off race in the Suzuki GSX-R Cup at Misano in June 2006.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
