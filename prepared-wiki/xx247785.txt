A member of the Arte dei Legnaioli (woodworkers' guild), he was one of the planned architects on the Loggia della Signoria (1379) in Florence. In 1381 he was examined and declared fit to take up Republican offices in Florence. He rose through the ranks, from Castellan of Frassino (1385) then of Pistoia (1390), then multiple terms as Priore di Libertà (1396 and 1407) then Gonfaloniere di Compagnia (1400, 1405, 1412, 1416). Finally he became a member of the Magistracy of the "XII Buonuomini" (1404 and 1406) then of the Magistracy of the "VIII di Custodia e Balia" (1412). Though in 1412 he was suspected of involvement with the Alberti counts, declared a rebel and exiled, he was pardoned aroundd 1416, when he took up office as castellan of Torre di Sant’Alberto and Casseretto ad Arezzo.
In 1404 he bought the chapel of San Sebastiano in church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence from the Servites, with the unusual condition in the acquisition contract that the Servites were required to invite the two senior members of the Pucci family to dinner on every Saint Sebastian's day (20 January).
