[[Litae]]

CATEGORIES: Personification in Greek mythology, Greek goddesses, Offspring of Zeus

Litae ([tpl]lang-el|Λιταί[/tpl] meaning 'Prayers') are personifications in Greek mythology.
They appear in Homer's Iliad in Book 9 as the lame and wrinkled daughters of Zeus (no mother named and no number given) who follow after Zeus' exiled daughter Até ('Folly') as healers but who cannot keep up with the fast-running Até. They bring great advantage to those who venerate them; but if someone dishonors them, then they go to Zeus and ask that Até be sent against that person.Homer, Iliad, 9. 502 ff; see also Quintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy, 10. 302
This is an obvious allegory on the supposed power of prayer to mitigate the misfortunes into which one's folly has led one.
