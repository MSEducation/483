[[Hakka (genus)]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Hakka is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). It includes a single species, Hakka himeshimensis. H. himeshimensis is native to East Asia, but has been introduced to the United States. It is most commonly found in rocky coastal habitats.Kaldari et al. 2011

==Description==

Both sexes have a body length of about 7Â mm. The body and legs are uniformly dark brown. The body is covered with sparse lighter hairs. Between the eyes there are longer, reddish hairs that stand up diagonally. The chelicerae are brown and robust.Berry & Proszynski 2001

==Distribution==

The only described species of this genus occurs in China, North Korea, Japan, Hawai'i, and the Eastern United States. It is not clear if there is a viable population in Hawai'i, or if the found specimens represent incidental recent arrivals (although three specimens were collected over a period of 74 years). It is likely that the species was accidentally introduced to the Eastern United States by maritime shipping.

==Name==

The genus name is derived from Hakka, a Chinese people with 70 million worldwide. Many members were brought to Hawai'i as laborers on sugar cane plantations in the middle of the 19th century. This is probably a reference to the species' origin in Asia.
