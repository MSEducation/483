Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative rod-shaped coccobacillus, a facultative anaerobic bacterium that can infect humans and animals.[tpl]cite book |author=Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |pages=484–488 |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-8385-8529-9[/tpl]
Human Y. pestis infection takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms were responsible for a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including the sixth century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the 19th century's Third Pandemic.[tpl]Cite book | last = Austin Alchon | first = Suzanne | title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA21&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | year = 2003 | page = 21 | isbn = 0-8263-2871-7[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003349 |pmid=23658525 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130510075449.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=May 10, 2013|title=Yersinia pestis DNA from Skeletal Remains from the 6th Century AD Reveals Insights into Justinianic Plague |journal=PLoS Pathogens |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=e1003349 |year=2013 |last1=Harbeck |first1=Michaela |last2=Seifert |first2=Lisa |last3=Hänsch |first3=Stephanie |last4=Wagner |first4=David M. |last5=Birdsell |first5=Dawn |last6=Parise |first6=Katy L. |last7=Wiechmann |first7=Ingrid |last8=Grupe |first8=Gisela |last9=Thomas |first9=Astrid |last10=Keim |first10=Paul |last11=Zöller |first11=Lothar |last12=Bramanti |first12=Barbara |last13=Riehm |first13=Julia M. |last14=Scholz |first14=Holger C.

Y. pestis was discovered in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin, a Swiss/French physician and bacteriologist from the Pasteur Institute, during an epidemic of plague in Hong Kong.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bockemühl J |title=100 years after the discovery of the plague-causing agent--importance and veneration of Alexandre Yersin in Vietnam today |journal=Immun Infekt |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=72–5 |year=1994 |pmid = 7959865[/tpl] Yersin was a member of the Pasteur school of thought. Kitasato Shibasaburō, a German-trained Japanese bacteriologist who practiced Koch's methodology, was also engaged at the time in finding the causative agent of plague.[tpl]cite journal |author=Howard-Jones N |title=Was Kitasato Shibasaburō the discoverer of the plague bacillus? | journal=Perspect Biol Med |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=292–307 |year=1973 |pmid = 4570035[/tpl] However, it was Yersin who actually linked plague with Yersinia pestis. Originally named Pasteurella pestis, the organism was renamed in 1967.
Every year, thousands of cases of plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although, with proper treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better. A five- to six-fold increase in cases occurred in Asia during the time of the Vietnam war, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. Plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals. In the United States of America, animals such as the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret are under threat from the disease.

==Historical outbreaks==

===Plague of Justinian===

During the mid 6th century, the pandemic known as the Plague of Justinian wiped out roughly one third 
of the Byzantine Empire's population, creating major military and financial difficulties. Modern historians named this plague incident after the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I, who held power in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople at the time of the initial outbreak. The primary years of the plague were 541–542 AD, although plague returned throughout the Mediterranean basin in successive generations, until about 750.
The waves of disease had a major effect on the future course of European history.  The plague's social and cultural impact during the Justinian period is comparable to that of the Black Death.
The most commonly accepted cause of the pandemic has been bubonic plague.[tpl]cite web |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html|work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-01 [/tpl] A genetic study suggests that the Plague of Justinian (and others from antiquity) arose from either now-extinct strains of Y. pestis, genetically distinct from the strain that broke out in the 14th century pandemic, or from pathogens entirely unrelated to bubonic plague.[tpl]cite news|last=McGrath|first=Matt|title=Black Death Genetic Code 'Built' |publisher=BBC World Service|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15278366 |accessdate=12 October 2011|date=12 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7370/full/nature10549.html|title=A draft genome of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death|last1=Bos|first1=Kirsten|journal=Nature|volume=478|issue=7370|pages=506–510|doi=10.1038/nature10549|date=12 October 2011|bibcode = 2011Natur.478..506B|last2=Schuenemann|first2=Verena J.|last3=Golding|first3=G.

===Role in Black Death===

In 2000, Didier Raoult and others reported finding Y. pestis DNA by performing a "suicide PCR" on tooth pulp tissue from a fourteenth-century plague cemetery in Montpellier.[tpl]cite journal | author = Drancourt M, Aboudharam G, Signolidagger M, Dutourdagger O, Raoult D.| title = Detection of 400-year-old Yersinia pestis DNA in human dental pulp: An ory of plague | journal = Microbes Infect. | year = 2002 | volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 105–9 | pmid = 11825781  | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(01)01515-5[/tpl]
A study by an international team of researchers published in October 2010 confirmed that Y. pestis was the cause of the Black Death and later epidemics on the entire European continent over a period of 400 years. The team used ancient DNA and proteins recovered from the bodies of plague victims buried in Hereford in England, in Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse in France, and Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands to identify the pathogen.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134|pmid=20949072|title=Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e1001134|year=2010|last1=Haensch|first1=Stephanie|last2=Bianucci|first2=Raffaella|last3=Signoli|first3=Michel|last4=Rajerison|first4=Minoarisoa|last5=Schultz|first5=Michael|last6=Kacki|first6=Sacha|last7=Vermunt|first7=Marco|last8=Weston|first8=Darlene A.|last9=Hurst|first9=Derek|last10=Achtman|first10=Mark|last11=Carniel|first11=Elisabeth|last12=Bramanti|first12=Barbara[/tpl] They found two previously unknown, older strains of Y. pestis that had spread from China by two different routes, rather than the modern Orientalis and Medievalis.[tpl]cite news | first = | last =  | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/black-death-plague-bacteria.html | title = Black Death Blamed on Bacteria | date = October 8, 2010 | work = Associated Free Press | publisher = Discovery | accessdate = October 11, 2010[/tpl]
Three biovars of Y. pestis were originally thought to correspond to one of the historical pandemics of bubonic plague.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhou D, Tong Z, Song Y, Han Y, Pei D, Pang X, Zhai J, Li M, Cui B, Qi Z, Jin L, Dai R, Du Z, Wang J, Guo Z, Wang J, Huang P, Yang R |title=Genetics of Metabolic Variations between Yersinia pestis Biovars and the Proposal of a New Biovar, microtus |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=186 |issue=15 |pages=5147–52 |year=2004 | pmid =  15262951 | doi = 10.1128/JB.186.15.5147-5152.2004 |pmc=451627 [/tpl]  Biovar Antiqua is thought to correspond to the Plague of Justinian; it is not known whether this biovar also corresponds to earlier or smaller epidemics of bubonic plague, or whether these were even truly bubonic plague.[tpl]cite journal |author=Guiyoule A, Grimont F, Iteman I, Grimont P, Lefèvre M, Carniel E |title=Plague pandemics investigated by ribotyping of Yersinia pestis strains |journal=J Clin Microbiol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=634–41 |year=1994 |pmid=8195371 |pmc=263099[/tpl] Biovar Mediaevalis was formerly thought to correspond to the Black Death, while Biovar Orientalis was thought to correspond to the Third Pandemic and the majority of modern outbreaks of plague. However, calculations of Y pestis's evolutionary age, found using the number of synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in conjunction with molecular clock rates, date the emergence of the biovars prior to any of the historical epidemics due to the length of time needed to accumulate such mutations.[tpl]cite journal |author= Parkhill |title= Genome sequence of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague |journal=Nature |volume=413 |pages=523–527 |year=2001 |doi= 10.1038/35097083 |pmid= 11586360 |issue= 6855 |author-separator= , |author2= J. |author3= B.

[/tpl] Additional evidence against this hypothesis includes the fact that Mediaevalis is likely too young to have produced the Black Death due to its recent divergence from Orientalis.[tpl]cite journal| author=Achtman M, Morelli G, Zhu P, Wirth T, Diehl I, Kusecek B et al.| title=Microevolution and history of the plague bacillus, Yersinia pestis | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 2004 | volume= 101 | issue= 51 | pages= 17837–42 | pmid=15598742 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0408026101 | pmc=535704   |bibcode = 2004PNAS..10117837A [/tpl]

===Use in biological warfare===

Y. pestis is potentially one of the first examples of biological warfare in history, when in 1347 plague victims were catapulted by the Mongols over the city walls of Caffa, a town currently known as Feodosiya located in present day Ukraine. It is possible that infected inhabitants may have fled to Italy, thus spreading the Black Death to Europe, though this is likely only one of a few routes that could have brought the Plague from the East.[tpl]cite journal |last=Wheelis |first=Mark |date=September 2002 |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseseases |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–75 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530[/tpl]
Y. pestis has been used as a biological weapon in World War II, when on October 4, 1940 a Japanese airplane flying over Chushien, Chekiang Province, China released rice and wheat plus rat fleas carrying Y. pestis.  A second plane load was released 3 weeks later. These actions led to a local plague that killed 121 people.[tpl]cite book |author=Drisdelle R |title=Parasites. Tales of Humanity's Most Unwelcome Guests |publisher=Univ. of California Publishers, 2010| page=162f |isbn=978-0-520-25938-6[/tpl] Leon A. Fox from the U.S. Army Medical Corps had suggested a similar approach in 1933 proposing to drop infested rats from planes.

==General characteristics==

Y. pestis is a non-motile, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobe with bipolar staining (giving it a safety pin appearance).[tpl]cite book | author = Collins FM | title = Pasteurella, Yersinia, and Francisella.

[/tpl] As of 2006, the genomic sequence of a strain of biovar Antiqua has been recently completed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chain PS |title=Complete Genome Sequence of Yersinia pestis Strains Antiqua and Nepal516: Evidence of Gene Reduction in an Emerging Pathogen |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=188 |issue=12 |pages=4453–63 |year=2006 |pmid=16740952 |doi=10.1128/JB.00124-06 |pmc=1482938 |author-separator=, |author2=Hu P |author3=Malfatti SA |display-authors=3 |last4=Radnedge |first4=L. |last5=Larimer |first5=F. |last6=Vergez |first6=L. M. |last7=Worsham |first7=P. |last8=Chu |first8=M. C. |last9=Andersen |first9=G. L.[/tpl] Similar to the other pathogenic strains, there are signs of loss of function mutations. The chromosome of strain KIM is 4,600,755 base pairs long; the chromosome of strain CO92 is 4,653,728 base pairs long. Like its cousins Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica, Y. pestis is host to the plasmid pCD1.  In addition, it also hosts two other plasmids, pPCP1 (also called pPla or pPst) and pMT1 (also called pFra) that are not carried by the other Yersinia species. pFra codes for a phospholipase D that is important for the ability of Y. pestis to be transmitted by fleas. pPla codes for a protease, Pla, that activates plasminogen in human hosts and is a very important virulence factor for pneumonic plague. Together, these plasmids, and a pathogenicity island called HPI, encode several proteins that cause the pathogenesis, for which Y. pestis is famous. Among other things, these virulence factors are required for bacterial adhesion and injection of proteins into the host cell, invasion of bacteria in the host cell (via a Type III secretion system), and acquisition and binding of iron that is harvested from red blood cells (via siderophores). Y. pestis is thought to be descendant from Y. pseudotuberculosis, differing only in the presence of specific virulence plasmids.
A comprehensive and comparative proteomics analysis of Y. pestis strain KIM was performed in 2006.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hixson K| title = Biomarker candidate identification in Yersinia pestis using organism-wide semiquantitative proteomics | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | year = 2006 | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 3008–3017 | pmid = 16684765  | doi = 10.1021/pr060179y | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Adkins | first2 = Joshua N. | last3 = Baker | first3 = Scott E. | last4 = Moore | first4 = Ronald J. | last5 = Chromy | first5 = Brett A. | last6 = Smith | first6 = Richard D. | last7 = McCutchen-Maloney | first7 = Sandra L. | last8 = Lipton | first8 = Mary S. | last9 = Heffron | first9 = F | first10 = RD[/tpl] The analysis focused on the transition to a growth condition mimicking growth in host cells.

==Pathogenesis and Immunity==

In the urban and sylvatic (forest) cycles of Y. pestis, most of the spreading occurs between rodents and fleas. In the sylvatic cycle, the rodent is wild, but, in the urban cycle, the rodent is primarily Rattus norvegicus. In addition, Y. pestis can spread from the urban environment and back. Transmsision to humans is usually through tee bite of infected fleas. If the disease has progressed to the pneumonic form, humans can spread the bacterium to others by coughing and possibly sneezing.

===In reservoir hosts===

Several species of rodents serve as the main reservoir for Y. pestis in the environment. In the steppes, the reservoir species is believed to be principally the marmot. In the south western United States, several species of rodents are thought to maintain Y. pestis. However, the expected disease dynamics have not been found in any rodent. It is known that a variety of species of rodents have a variable resistance, which could lead to a carrier status.[tpl]cite journal |author=MEYER KF |title=The natural history of plague and psittacosis: The R.

This lack of knowledge of the dynamics of plague in mammal species is also true among susceptible rodents such as the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), in which plague can cause colony collapse, resulting in a massive effect on prairie food webs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pauli JN, Buskirk SW, Williams ES, Edwards WH |title=A plague epizootic in the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) |journal=J.

In other regions of the world, the reservoir of the infection is not clearly identified, which complicates prevention and early warning programs. One such example was seen in a 2003 outbreak in Algeria.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bertherat E |title=Plague Reappearance in Algeria after 50 Years, 2003 |journal=Emerging Infect.

===Vector===

The transmission of Y. pestis by fleas is well characterized.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhou D, Han Y, Yang R |title=Molecular and physiological insights into plague transmission, virulence and etiology |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=273–84 |year=2006 |pmid=16182593 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2005.06.006[/tpl] Initial acquisition of Y. pestis by the vector occurs during feeding on an infected animal. Several proteins then contribute to the maintenance of the bacteria in the flea digestive tract, among them the hemin storage (Hms) system and Yersinia murine toxin (Ymt).
Although Yersinia murine toxin is highly toxic to rodents and was once thought to be produced to ensure reinfection of new hosts, it has been demonstrated that Ymt is important for the survival of Y. pestis in fleas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hinnebusch BJ, Rudolph AE, Cherepanov P, Dixon JE, Schwan TG, Forsberg A |title=Role of Yersinia murine toxin in survival of Yersinia pestis in the midgut of the flea vector |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5568 |pages=733–5 |year=2002 |pmid=11976454 |doi=10.1126/science.1069972|bibcode = 2002Sci...296..733H |last2=Rudolph |last3=Cherepanov |last4=Dixon |last5=Schwan |last6=Forsberg [/tpl]
The Hms system plays an important role in the transmission of Y. pestis back to a mammalian host.[tpl]cite journal |author=B.J. Hinnebusch, R.D. Perry and T.G.

The black-tailed prairie dog, the Endangered Species Act, and the imminent threat of bubonic plague.  Journal of Land, Resources, and Environmental Law 24: 355-391.). Transmission of Y. pestis occurs during the futile attempts of the flea to feed. Ingested blood is pumped into the esophagus, where it dislodges bacteria lodged in the proventriculus and is regurgitated back into the host circulatory system.

===In humans and other susceptible hosts===

Pathogenesis due to Y. pestis infection of mammalian hosts is due to several factors including an ability of these bacteria to suppress and avoid normal immune system responses such as phagocytosis and antibody production. Flea bites allow for the bacteria to pass the skin barrier. Y. pestis expresses the yadBC gene, which is similar to adhesins in other Yersinia species, allowing for adherence and invasion of epithelial cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Forman S, Wulff CR, Myers-Morales T, Cowan C, Perry RD, Straley SC |title=yadBC of Yersinia pestis, a New Virulence Determinant for Bubonic Plague |journal=Infect.

Two important anti-phagocytic antigens, named F1 (Fraction 1) and V or LcrV, are both important for virulence. These antigens are produced by the bacterium at normal human body temperature. Furthermore, Y. pestis survives and produces F1 and V antigens while it is residing within white blood cells such as monocytes, but not in neutrophils. Natural or induced immunity is achieved by the production of specific opsonic antibodies against F1 and V antigens; antibodies against F1 and V induce phagocytosis by neutrophils.[tpl]cite book | author = Salyers AA, Whitt DD | title = Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach | edition = 2nd | publisher = ASM Press | year = 2002 | id = pp. 207-12[/tpl]
In addition, the Type III secretion system (T3SS) allows Y. pestis to inject proteins into macrophages and other immune cells. These T3SS-injected proteins are called Yops (Yersinia Outer Proteins) and include Yop B/D, which form pores in the host cell membrane and have been linked to cytolysis. The YopO, YopH, YopM, YopT, YopJ, and YopE are injected into the cytoplasm of host cells via T3SS into the pore created in part by YopB and YopD.[tpl]cite journal |author=Viboud GI, Bliska JB |title=Yersinia outer proteins: role in modulation of host cell signaling responses and pathogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=59 |issue= |pages=69–89 |year=2005 |pmid=15847602 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121320[/tpl] The injected Yop proteins limit phagocytosis and cell signaling pathways important in the innate immune system, as discussed below. In addition, some Y. pestis strains are capable of interfering with immune signaling (e.g., by preventing the release of some cytokines).
Yersinia pestis proliferates inside lymph nodes where it is able to avoid destruction by cells of the immune system such as macrophages. The ability of Yersinia pestis to inhibit phagocytosis allows it to grow in lymph nodes and cause lymphadenopathy. YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that contributes to the ability of Yersinia pestis to evade immune system cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = de la Puerta ML, Trinidad AG, del Carmen Rodríguez M, Bogetz J, Sánchez Crespo M, Mustelin T, Alonso A, Bayón Y | title = Characterization of New Substrates Targeted By Yersinia Tyrosine Phosphatase YopH | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e4431 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 19221593 | pmc = 2637541| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004431 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004431 | editor1-last = Bozza | editor1-first = Patricia |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4431D | last2 = Trinidad | last3 = Rodríguez | last4 = Bogetz | last5 = Sánchez Crespo | last6 = Mustelin | last7 = Alonso | last8 = Bayón [/tpl] In macrophages, YopH has been shown to dephosphorylate p130Cas, Fyb (Fyn binding protein) SKAP-HOM and Pyk, a tyrosine kinase homologous to FAK. YopH also binds the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the Gab1, the Gab2 adapter proteins, and the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
YopE functions as a GTPase activating protein for members of the Rho family of GTPases such as RAC1. YopT is a cysteine protease that inhibits RhoA by removing the isoprenyl group, which is important for localizing the protein to the cell membrane. It has been proposed that YopE and YopT may function to limit YopB/D-induced cytolysis.[tpl]cite journal| author = Mejía E, Bliska JB, Viboud GI | title = Yersinia Controls Type III Effector Delivery into Host Cells by Modulating Rho Activity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e4431 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 18193942 | pmc = 2186360| doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.0040003 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004431 [/tpl] This might limit the function of YopB/D to create the pores used for Yop insertion into host cells and prevent YopB/D-induced rupture of host cells and release of cell contents that would attract and stimulate immune system responses.

===Immunity===

A formalin-inactivated vaccine once was available in the United States for adults at high risk of contracting the plague until removal from the market by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was of limited effectiveness and could cause severe inflammation. Experiments with genetic engineering of a vaccine based on F1 and V antigens are underway and show promise. However, bacteria lacking antigen F1 are still virulent, and the V antigens are sufficiently variable, such that vaccines composed of these antigens may not be fully protective.[tpl]cite journal | author = Welkos S| title = Determination of the virulence of the pigmentation-deficient and pigmentation-/plasminogen activator-deficient strains of Yersinia pestis in non-human primate and mouse models of pneumonic plague | journal = Vaccine | year = 2002 | volume = 20 | issue = 17–18| pages = 2206–2214 | pmid = 12009274 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00119-6 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Pitt | first2 = M.L.M. | last3 = Martinez | first3 = M. | last4 = Friedlander | first4 = A. | last5 = Vogel | first5 = P. | last6 = Tammariello | first6 = R.[/tpl] United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) have found that an experimental F1/V antigen-based vaccine protects cynomolgus macaques but fails to protect African green monkeys.[tpl]cite journal  |url=http://www.fda.gov/cber/minutes/plague101304t.pdf | author = Pitt ML| title = Non-human primates as a model for pneumonic plague.

==Clinical aspects==

===Symptoms and disease progression===

If this occurs with the classic buboes, this is considered primary, while secondary occurs after symptoms of bubonic or pneumonic infection. Since the bacteria are blood-borne, several organs can be affected, including the spleen and brain. The diffuse infection can cause an immunologic cascade to occur, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which in turn results in bleeding and necrotic skin and tissue. Such a disseminated infection increases mortality to 22%.
With the exception of the buboes, the initial symptoms of plague are very similar to many other diseases, making diagnosis difficult.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60566-2|title=Plague|journal=The Lancet|volume=369|issue=9568|pages=1196|year=2007|last1=Prentice|first1=Michael B|last2=Rahalison|first2=Lila[/tpl]
ICD-9 codes for the diseases caused by Y. pestis:

===Clinical determination===

Gram's stains can confirm the presence of gram-negative rods, and in some cases the identification of the double-curved shape. An anti-F1 serology test can differentiate between different species of Yersinia, and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to identify Y. pestis.
The protein H of the tail fiber of the bacteriophage Yersinia phage L-413C permits the differenciation between Y. pestis and ''Y. pseudotuberculosis", the gastro-intestinal corrolary (Kane et al.).[tpl]cite journal|pmid=18045639|year=2008|last1=Garcia|first1=E|last2=Chain|first2=P|last3=Elliott|first3=JM|last4=Bobrov|first4=AG|last5=Motin|first5=VL|last6=Kirillina|first6=O|last7=Lao|first7=V|last8=Calendar|first8=R|last9=Filippov|first9=AA|title=Molecular characterization of L-413C, a P2-related plague diagnostic bacteriophage|volume=372|issue=1|pages=85–96|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2007.10.032|journal=Virology| display-authors = 1[/tpl]

===Treatment===

The traditional first line treatment for Y. pestis has been streptomycin,[tpl]cite journal | author=Wagle PM. | title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague | journal=Indian J Med Sci | year=1948 | volume=2 | pages=489–94 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Meyer KF. | title=Modern therapy of plague | journal=JAMA | year=1950 | volume=144 | pages=982–5 | pmid = 14774219 | issue=12 | doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02920120006003[/tpl] chloramphenicol, tetracycline,[tpl]cite journal | author=Kilonzo BS, Makundi RH, Mbise TJ. | title= A decade of plague epidemiology and control in the Western Usambara mountains, north-east Tanzania | journal=Acta Tropica | year=1992 | volume=50 | pages=323–9 | pmid = 1356303 | doi = 10.1016/0001-706X(92)90067-8 | issue=4[/tpl] and fluoroquinolones.  There is also good evidence to support the use of doxycycline or gentamicin.[tpl]cite journal | author=Mwengee W | title=Treatment of plague with gentamicin or doxycycline in a randomized clinical trial in Tanzania | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=42 | pages=614–21 | pmid = 16447105  | doi = 10.1086/500137 | issue=5 | author-separator=, | author2=Butler T | author3=Mgema S | display-authors=3 | last4=Mhina | first4=G. | last5=Almasi | first5=Y. | last6=Bradley | first6=C. | last7=Formanik | first7=J.

Antibiotic treatment alone is insufficient for some patients, who may also require circulatory, ventilator, or renal support.
In an emergency department setting, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine  outlines the following treatment course.[tpl]cite book |author=Jameson, J. N. St C.; Dennis L.

Streptomycin or gentamicin are the first-line drugs, with chloramphenicol for critically ill patients, or rarely for suspected neuro-involvement.
