[[10BASE-FB]]

CATEGORIES: Ethernet

The 10BASE-FB (10BASE-FiberBackbone) is a network segment used to bridge network hubs.  Due to the synchronous operation of 10BASE-FB, delays normally associated with Ethernet repeaters are reduced, thus allowing segment distances to be extended without compromising the collision detection mechanism. The maximum allowable segment length for 10BASE-FB is 2000 meters.
