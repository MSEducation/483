==History==

Iveco was incorporated on January 1, 1975, with the merger of five different brands: Fiat Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin, Italy), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France) and Magirus-Deutz (Germany).[tpl]cite web|title=History of Iveco / 1975-1984|url=http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-us/group/history/iveco/Pages/iveco_1975_1984.aspx|publisher=fiatindustrial.com|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl]   
Following the merger, the newly founded Iveco began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the Iveco range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for a light vehicle to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, not to mention buses and engines.Massimo Condolo: IVECO 1975–2005, 2005 Fondazione NegriRaffaele Sanguineti, Carlo Felice Zampini Salazar: IVECO Story.

===Social responsibility===

Iveco has been working together with Transaid since 2005, an international non-profit organisation from England. In 2011 it donated several Stralis 4x2 to the National Institute of Transport of Dar El Salam in Tanzania, which were used in training heavy vehicle drivers with the objective of lowering the fatality rate on the roads of Sub-Saharan Africa.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 173  
Iveco also sponsors a technological laboratory dedicated to industrial vehicles called TechPro2, in association with CNOS-FAP (national centre of Salesian works – training for professional updating).Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf

===Eco-dealer in Brazil===

In 2011 Iveco inaugurated its first eco-sustainable dealership in Brazil. The headquarters of the new “Jundiaí Mercalf” dealership are in Jundiaí, approximately 80 km from São Paulo, in an area that lends itself to the collection of sunlight for energy production. A special roof covering with a layer of grass laid over several layers of recycled material and one layer of asphalt can lower the temperature inside the showroom by six degrees. The roof is also equipped with special tubes for channeling and collecting rainwater.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 111

===Sustainable mobility===

====Euro VI Engines with SCR Technology====

Iveco engines from the Cursor and Tector ranges observe the upcoming Euro VI standardsFiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 76 by adopting High Efficiency SCR (HI-eSCR) technology.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p.28 This technology optimises the processes of exhaust combustion and after-treatment, reducing consumption and enabling achievement of greater efficiency in the conversion of NOx emissions.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 75

====Electric drive====

Iveco developed and built the first Daily with electric propulsion in 1986;Raffaele Sanguineti, Carlo Felice Zampini Salazar: IVECO Story. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 330 later the range was broadened to include trucks and city buses.International Energy Agency, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells, 2004 OECD Publishing – p. 143 Iveco introduced the New Daily with electric propulsion and zero exhaust emissions in which a battery system powers an electric three-phase asynchronous engine – through the aid of an inverter – in charge of moving the vehicle directly and recovering energy during braking.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 81  
The vehicle runs on two to four batteries made with Na/NiCl2 (Sodium-nickel chlorine) technology at a nominal voltage of 278 Volt.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 81 The maximum velocity is electronically limited to 70 km/h and the vehicle does from 90 to 130 km on a fully charged battery, depending on the number of batteries and the mission.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 81

====Diesel-electric parallel hybrid traction====

The parallel hybrid solution incorporates both a Diesel engine and an electric engine that can be used individually or simultaneously, which makes for greater operating flexibility and allows the vehicle to work under both urban and non-urban conditions.Fiat Industrial Official website http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/innovation/iveco/Pages/technology_highlights.aspx
In 2010 Iveco introduced this technology on the Eurocargo Ibrido, a commercial vehicle for the European market with electri-diesel parallel propulsion for distributing and collecting goods in city centres. The payload capacity decreases by 200 kg in comparison to diesel-engine models, but it is possible to save up to 30% on the urban cycle.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 82   Iveco Official website http://web.iveco.com/en-us/press-room/kit/Pages/E3-Diesel%E2%80%93ElectricParallelHybridTraction.aspx 
The Eurocargo hybrid range is made up of two versions:

====Diesel-electric series traction hybrid for people transport====

Iveco has been active in this sector since 1990 with 6, 7, 4 and 12 metre buses for urban transportation. The series hybrid technology features a diesel engine – smaller than that of a traditional vehicle – that acts as a battery charger.Raffaele Sanguineti, Carlo Felice Zampini Salazar: IVECO Story. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 216-217

====CNG – Compressed Natural Gas====

Iveco's range of light, medium and heavy vehicles and buses can run on methane. 
Methane makes it possible to save on consumption by 38% per kg transported as compared to that consumed by diesel engines for the same payload and distance travelled. In addition, compared to Euro VI diesel engines, methane engines reduce NOx emissions by approximately 60% and particulates emissions by approximately 70%.Oecd: Can Cars come clean? Strategies for low emission vehicles?, 2004 OECD Publishing – p. 166

====LNG – Liquefied Natural Gas====

In April 2012 Iveco presented its first vehicle with this technology, the Stralis LNG.
As opposed to vehicles with CNG technology, LNG technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank (up to 750 km) and reduces the vehicle's tare thus increasing the load. The main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed, which in this case is kept in a liquid state at −125 °C in cryogenic tanks; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas.Fiat Industrial 2011 Annual Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/investor_relations/financial_reports/bilanci/FiatDocuments/FI_Relazione_finanziaria_annuale_2011_FINALE_NIS_ENG.pdf – p. 51 Also, the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle.Iveco Official website http://web.iveco.com/en-us/press-room/release/Pages/RAITRakkerLNG.aspx

====Iveco Trakker Bifuel – diesel-ethanol prototype====

Iveco created the first prototype of a bifuel, diesel and ethanol-run vehicle. The technology was developed by Iveco together with FPT Industrial and Bosch.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 80 The prototype uses a Trakker truck with Common Rail Cursor 9 engine with 360 HPFiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 80 that may be powered by a 40–60% ethanol-diesel blend.http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/05/18/40-ethanol-60-diesel-buses-offer-6-fuel-savings-says-iveco/ The prototype was tested by Raízen, a joint venture between the cane sugar producer Cosan and Shell.http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2011/05/18/40-ethanol-60-diesel-buses-offer-6-fuel-savings-says-iveco/ 
In 2011, this prototype earned Iveco the “Prêmio Top Etanol” – for the alternative fuel technology.Fiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report http://www.fiatindustrial.com/en-US/sustainability/Documents/files/fi_eng_sostenibilita_sfogliabile_ott.pdf – p. 80

===Heating and air-conditioning systems===

A prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the Iveco Daily vehicle. The system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low temperature heat generated by the drive systems. At the same time, the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption.http://www.ice-project.webs.upv.es/images/public/Paper_IIE-UPV_EAEC_2011.pdf
