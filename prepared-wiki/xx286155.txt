Stump Lake is a naturally formed lake located in Nelson County, North Dakota. It covers 15,742.4 square acres, has 72.5 miles of shoreline, and has an average depth of 29.7 feet with a maximum depth of 73.3 feet.http://www.lake-link.com/North-Dakota-Lake-Finder/lake.cfm/23445/Stump-Lake-Nelson-County-North-Dakota/ It is stocked by the North Dakota Department of Natural Resources with Walleye, Yellow Perch, and  Northern Pike.
Stump Lake's waters have risen 45 feet in the last few years,[tpl]vague|date=August 2013[/tpl] and are now at the levels of neighboring Devils Lake. Devil's Lake will overflow into Stump Lake if the surface level reaches [tpl]convert|1,447|ft[/tpl]. Stump Lake, like Devil's Lake, is an endorheic (closed) lake, and has no input or output of rivers or streams, and is only fed by rain or human sources. If water levels exceed [tpl]convert|1,458|ft[/tpl] the combined lake would flow into the Sheyenne River.  This has not occurred since lake levels in this area have been recorded.[tpl]cite web|title=Prehistoric Water Levels|url=http://www.swc.state.nd.us/4dlink9/4dcgi/GetContentPhoto/PB-218/640/480[/tpl]
