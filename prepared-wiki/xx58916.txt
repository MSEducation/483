Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport[tpl]NSW GNR|id=TRlpoeZTGH|title=Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport|accessdate=28 September 2010[/tpl] (also known as Kingsford-Smith Airport and Sydney Airport; [tpl]Airport codes|SYD|YSSY|p=n[/tpl]; [tpl]ASX|SYD[/tpl]) is an international airport located 8 km (5 mi) south of the city centre, in the suburb of Mascot in Sydney, New South Wales.  It is the only major airport serving Sydney, and is a primary hub for Qantas, as well as a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways.  Situated next to Botany Bay, the airport has three runways, colloquially known as the "east–west", "north–south" and "third" runways.
Sydney Airport is one of the oldest continuously operated airports in the world,http://www.sydneyairport.com/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Sydney Airport and the busiest airport in Australia, handling 35,630,549 passengers in 2011[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/corporate/about-us/fact-sheets/capacity.aspx|title=Capacity|accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] and 326,686 aircraft movements in 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/Airport-Movement-Calendar-YTD-April-2013.pdf |title=Australian Airport Movements - Summary |publisher=Airservicesaustralia.com |accessdate=20 February 2014[/tpl] It was the 31st busiest airport in the world in 2012. The airport is managed by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) and the current CEO is Kerrie Mather. Currently 46 domestic and 43 international destinations are served to Sydney directly.

==History==

===1920–30: Early history===

The area that the airport was situated was originally a bullock paddock.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/bullock-paddock-grew-to-nations-busiest-air-hub/story-e6frg95x-1225799888484|title=Bullock paddock grew to nation's busiest air hub|work=The Australian |author=Steve Creedy|date=24 November 2009|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl] Nigel Love, a former wartime pilot, was looking into the possibilities for aviation in Australia. He was interested in establishing the nation's first aircraft manufacturing company, this required him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. His search for a potential site eventually led him to a real estate office in Sydney which was aware of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club (that was kept as a hedge against losing its government-owned site at Randwick). It had been used by a local abattoir, which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. This land appealed to Love, the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. This grass which had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle running on it that it required little to make it serviceable to land aircraft. In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and Botany Bay.
Love established Mascot as a private concern, leasing [tpl]Convert|200|acre|km2|2[/tpl] from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was on 19 November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love.
In 1921 the federal government purchased [tpl]Convert|161|acre|km2|2[/tpl] in Mascot for the purpose of creating a public airfield. In 1923, when Love's three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the federal government from the racing club. The first regular flights began in 1924.

===1930–60===

In 1933 the first gravel runways were built. By 1949 the airport had three runways – the [tpl]convert|1085|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] 11/29, the [tpl]convert|1190|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] 16/34 and the [tpl]convert|1787|m|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] 04/22.  The Sydenham to Botany railway line crossed the latter runway approximately [tpl]convert|150|m|ft[/tpl] from the northern end and was protected by special safeworking facilities.[tpl]cite book|last=Pollard|first=Neville|title=Offal, Oil and Overseas Trade: The Story of the Sydenham to Botany Railway Line|year=1988|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society NSW Division|location=Australia|isbn=0909650217|page=51[/tpl] The Cooks River was diverted away from the area in 1947–52 to provide more land for the airport and other small streams were filled. When Mascot was declared an aerodrome in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport, in 1953 it was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] in honour of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who was a pioneering Australian aviator. Up to the early sixties the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), jutting into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate large jets. 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, although large four engine jet aircraft still periodically land on the runway from the east, when south-westerly winds are blowing in Sydney. 16R is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with [tpl]Convert|14300|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] paved length and [tpl]Convert|12850|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] between the zebra thresholds.

===Modern history===

By the 1960s the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries.[tpl]cite news|title=Paynter and Dixon|newspaper=The Sun Herald|date=26 April 1970|page=57[/tpl] The plans for the design are held by the State Library of New South Wales.[tpl]cite web|title=George Surtees architectural and design drawings, ca. 1950's-1989|url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemdetailpaged.aspx?itemid=457408|work=Skip Navigation LinksManuscripts, Oral History and Pictures Search|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|accessdate=22 March 2013[/tpl]
The new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 "Jumbo Jet" at the airport, Pan American's Clipper Flying Cloud (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east-west runway was then 8300 ft;Aviation Daily 27 July 1971 in the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 and has undergone several refurbishments since then.
The limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney's airport capacity for decades; eventually the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved in 2004, before being reexamined in 2009–2012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030

====Curfew====

The "third runway" (as it is known to Sydneysiders) which the Commonwealth government commenced development of in 1989 and completed in 1994, remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. The 1990s saw the formation of the No Aircraft Noise Party, although it failed to win a parliamentary seat. There has been general acquiescence in the arrangements for Sydney Airport that were introduced by the Howard government shortly after its election, namely to maintain curfews between 11pm and 6am, rotate runway operation and fan flight paths out, especially over water (especially Botany Bay) wherever possible and continue the use of noise abatement on aircraft on departure.
In 1995 the Australian Parliament passed the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995, which limits the operating hours of the airport. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11pm and 6am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the "shoulder periods" of 11pm to midnight and 5am to 6am, by Section 12 of the Act. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/aviation/environmental/pdf/airport_curfews_general_information_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Airport Curfews – General Information |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. As of 2009, fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of $550,000 applicable.[tpl]cite news|last=Creedy|first=Steve|title=Jetstar fined for airport curfew breach|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,25436950-5014090,00.html|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=31 May 2009|work=news.com.au|publisher=News Limited[/tpl]
In addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/Movement_Cap_Report_Sydney_December_Quarter_2010.pdf |title=Sydney Airport Runway Movement Cap Report for December quarter 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]

===Expansion===

In 2002, the Australian Government sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed Sydney Airport Corporation Limited, SACL), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. 82.93 per cent of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of Macquarie Bank, Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12.11 per cent and Ontario Teachers' Australia Trust own 4.96 per cent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Ownership.html |title=Ownership |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] SACL holds a 99-year lease on the airport which remains Crown land.
Since the international terminal's original completion, it has undergone two large expansions. One such expansion is underway and will stretch over twenty years (2005–25). This will include an additional high-rise office block, the construction of a multi-level car park, the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. These expansions—and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations—are seen as controversial, as they are performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. As of April 2006, some of the proposed development has been scaled back.Sydney Morning Herald. 21 April 2006 issue
Sydney Airport's International terminal underwent a $500 million renovation that was completed in mid-2010. The upgrade includes a new baggage system, an extra [tpl]Convert|7300|m2|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of space for shops and passenger waiting areas and other improvements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/sacl/International-Terminal---Expansion-and-Upgrade.html |title=International Terminal – Expansion and Upgrade |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
In March 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a report sharply critical of price gouging at Sydney airport, ranking it fifth out of five airports. The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008–09 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power.[tpl]Cite news|last1=West|first1=Andrew|last2=Matt|first2=O'Sullivan|title=ACCC slams price gouging at Sydney Airport|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 March 2010|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/accc-slams-price-gouging-at-sydney-airport-20100311-q1lj.html|accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl]

===Future===

In December 2011, Sydney Airport announced a proposal to divide the airport into two airline-alliance-based precincts; integrating international, domestic and regional services under the one roof by 2019. The current domestic Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas, Jetstar and members of the oneworld airline alliance while today's international Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners. Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/corporate/media-centre/media-releases/media-release-detail.aspx?item=%7b19FE83DF-66A6-49CA-A219-72C3A4A4C7E0%7d&lst=%7bC313C142-0E4E-4269-A2FB-BDEB95B3BC9E%7d&cat=%7b8555596C-B175-417F-9CE3-6BC16C1F0630%7d|title=New Vision To Integrate International, Domestic and Regional Services |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |accessdate=5 December 2011[/tpl]
In September 2012, Sydney Airport CEO Kerrie Mather announced the airport had abandoned the proposal to create alliance-based terminals in favour of terminals "based around specific airline requirements and (passenger) transfer flows". She stated the plan was to minimise the number of passengers transferring between terminals.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ghee |first1=Ryan |year=2012 |title=Integrated Terminals Central to Sydney Airport Vision |journal=ACI Asia-Pacific Airports |issue=Winter 2012 |pages=13–14 |publisher=PPS Publications Ltd. |doi= |url= |accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] In June 2013 the airport released a draft version of its 2013 Masterplan, which proposes operating domestic and international flights from the same terminals using 'swing gates', along with upgrading Terminal 3 (currently the Qantas domestic terminal) to accommodate the Airbus A380.[tpl]cite news|last=McKenny|first=Leesha|title=Airport says the sky's the limit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/airport-says-the-skys-the-limit-20130604-2noc5.html|accessdate=4 June 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=4 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sydney Airport Master Plan|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/corporate/master-plan/|publisher=SALC|accessdate=5 June 2013[/tpl]

==Terminals==

Sydney Airport has three passenger terminals. The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway, therefore connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times. Sydney Airport requires minimum connection times:
The airport provides a shuttle service between the terminals at a cost of A$5.50.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport's north western sector. It has 25 gates (thirteen in concourse B numbered 8–37, and twelve in concourse C numbered 50–63) served by aerobridges. There are also a number of remote bays, though these are rarely used. It can accommodate the Airbus A380 with flights to and from Singapore on Singapore Airlines; London via Dubai, Los Angeles and Hong Kong (on most services) on Qantas; Dubai and Auckland on Emirates; and Guangzhou (in summer) on China Southern Airlines. The terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal also has an observation deck located on the rooftop. The terminal hosts six airline lounges: Two for Qantas, and one each for Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Emirates. The terminal underwent a major $500 million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to [tpl]convert|254000|m2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com/SACL/Master-Plan.html |title=Master Plan |publisher=Sydneyairport.com.au |accessdate=30 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2, located in the airport's north-eastern section, was the former home of Ansett Australia's domestic operations. It features 16 parking bays served by aerobridges and several remote bays for regional aircraft. Today it serves Virgin Australia, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines, Jetstar, Tigerair Australia, Regional Express Airlines and Skytrans Airlines. There are lounges for Virgin Australia and Regional Express Airlines.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas with QantasLink flights having moved their operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 on 16 August 2013[tpl]cite web|last=Nickell |first=Alena |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1709818/terminal-take-off-for-country-passengers/?cs=2452 |title=Terminal take off for country passengers | St George & Sutherland Shire Leader |publisher=Theleader.com.au |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=20 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=QantasLink Terminal Change|publisher=Qantas|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/qantaslink-terminal-change/global/en|accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl] Originally, it was home for Trans Australia Airlines (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section. The current terminal building is largely the result of extensions made during the late 1990s. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a 'Heritage Collection' located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to Qantas and including many collections from the airline's 90-plus years of service. It also has a view of the airport's apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters.

===Other terminals===

Sydney Airport had a fourth passenger terminal, east of Terminal 2. This was formerly known as Domestic Express and was used by Regional Express Airlines; and low-cost carriers Virgin Blue (now known as Virgin Australia) and the now-defunct Impulse Airlines; during the time Terminal 2 was closed following the collapse of Ansett Australia. It is now used by DHL Express and Tasman Cargo Airlines as an office building.
The dedicated Freight Terminal is located north of Terminal 1. It is used for international freight operations, except for Tasman Cargo Airlines' trans-Tasman services. It is also used as overflow parking when all Terminal 1 gates are occupied.

==Second Sydney airport==

The local, state and federal governments have investigated the viability of building a second major airport in Sydney since the 1940s.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl][/ref] Between 1987 and 2000 domestic flights through Sydney more than doubled to nearly 27 million, and international passengers served increased from 8 million to 15 million. The Sydney region passenger demand is forecast to reach 87 million passengers by 2035, more than doubling, and to double again by 2060.[tpl]cite news|agency=AAP| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/no-airport-cap-or-curfew-change-albanese-20120302-1u6et.html| title = No airport cap or curfew change: Albanese|publisher = www.news.smh.com.au| work=Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2 March 2012| accessdate = 4 March 2012[/tpl] Close to half of all scheduled flights in Australia take off or land at Kingsford Smith. In 1998 the airport handled 45 per cent of international passengers in Australia.[tpl]cite book| author=Philip Laird| title = Where We Are Now| work=Back on Track| publisher=UNSW Press| year = 2001| page = 29| isbn = 0-86840-411-X[/tpl]
The Federal Government has bought most of the required land in a proposed site at Badgerys Creek, west of Sydney. This site would be accessible by the Westlink M7 motorway. Despite acquiring almost all the land necessary for the building of the Badgerys Creek airport, and multiple studies and reports commissioned that recommended building the airport, in 1995 new airport leasing legislation was blocked in the Australian Senate, and construction was delayed until after the 2000 Sydney Olympics. All the major Australian airlines, including Qantas, indicated they would prefer additional development of Kingsford-Smith Airport. In 1998 most local authorities reversed their previous support of the new airport and protested against potential noise and pollution impacts. After the 2001 terrorist attacks decimated the air travel industry, the national government announced its belief that the current Sydney airport could accommodate additional air travel demands for at least another decade. 
The issue of a second airport for Sydney arose again after the Rudd government was elected in 2007. Convinced that capacity at the current airport will be exhausted, it investigated Badgerys Creek, Wilton, Camden, Richmond and Canberra for feasibility, while Bankstown Airport was ruled out as being expanded from a light aircraft airport.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23645809-5001021,00.html|title=Search on for second Sydney airport|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 May 2008|publisher=www.news.com.au|accessdate=23 July 2008| first=Malcolm| last=Farr[/tpl]
On April 15, 2014 the Federal Government announced that Badgerys Creek would be Sydney's second international airport, to be known as Western Sydney Airport.[tpl]cite web|last=Truss|first=Warren|title=Western Sydney Airport to Deliver Jobs and Infrastructure|url=http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/wt/releases/2014/April/wt056_2014.aspx|work=Media Release|publisher=Ministry for Inreastructure and Regional Development|accessdate=15 April 2014|coauthors=Tony Abott[/tpl] The airport's design is still to be determined, but is expected initially to be a single runway airport with a modest terminal.

==Traffic and statistics==

===Domestic===

(a) The Darwin – Sydney route includes data from May 2012, prior data was not released.

===International===

In 2012, Sydney Airport served 22,652,282 (3.3% higher than the previous year) domestic, 1,986,595 (down 0.7%) regional and 12,372,246 (up 5.3%) international passengers. In total there were 37,011,123 (3.7%) passengers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/ongoing/airport_traffic_data.aspxtraffic|title=Airport Traffic Data|publisher=Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Rail===

The airport is accessible via the Airport Link underground rail line. The International railway station is located below the International terminal, while the Domestic railway station is located under the car park between the domestic terminals (Terminal 2 and Terminal 3). While the stations are part of the Sydney Trains suburban network, they are privately owned and operated by the Airport Link consortium. As a result, as of 2014, a single ticket from the Domestic railway station to the city is $16.40 (day-return ticket $32.80), which includes an airport station surcharge (GatePass) of $12.60 ($25.20 for a day-return GatePass).
The trains that service the airport are regular suburban trains. Unlike airport trains at other airports, these do not have special provisions for customers with luggage, do not operate express to the airport and may have all seats occupied by commuters (peak hours) before the trains arrive at the airport.

===Shuttle Bus===

Shuttle Bus will drive passengers to the city and deliver them to the door of their hotel. You can buy a ticket for a shuttle bus to your hotel from the information desk at T3 for $15. The cheaper option is to book online in advance, which will be around $12.

===Bus===

Sydney Buses operates Route 400 from Burwood to Bondi Junction railway stations and stops at the International and Domestic terminals. It connects the eastern suburbs, Inner West and St George areas to the airport.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]
Private shuttle buses also service the airport from the Sutherland Shire, Blue Mountains and Central Coast.

===Road===

Sydney Airport, being located within a dense urban area, has road connections in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, is the fastest link with the city centre. The only other motorway, the M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney.
A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north-south runway and three taxiways as well as providing access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road — Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith) — connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only.
The Airport runs several official car parks—Domestic Short Term, Domestic Remote Long Term, and International Short/Long Term.[tpl]cite web| title =Sydney Airport Carparks| work=Sydney Airport Website| publisher=Sydney Airport Corporation Limited| date = 17 December 2010| url =https://parking.sydneyairport.com.au/| accessdate =17 December 2010[/tpl]

===Pedestrian and bicycle===

The International Terminal is located beside a wide pedestrian and bicycle path. It links Mascot and Sydney City in the north-east with Tempe (via a foot bridge over Alexandra Canal) and Botany Bay to the south-west. All terminals offer bicycle racks and are also easily accessible by foot from nearby areas.
