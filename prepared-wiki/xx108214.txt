===Northern Peripheral Road===

Northern Peripheral Road commonly known as Dwarka Expressway road is being developed under the public private partnership (PPP) model.

===Poor infrastructure===

Connectivity to Pataudi road is extremely in bad shape. Also, one cannot take a right turn from the Hero Honda Chowk, as the highway does not have a cut over here. So to reach Pataudi road, commuters have to go straight for another two kilometers till Kherki Dola toll tax collection point and then take a U-turn to come back to Hero Honda Chowk.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] The road connecting Pataudi from Gurgaon is one of the worst roads in Gurgaon District. This twelve kilometer Narrow road is flooded by pathholes, unwanted speed brakers and filled with rainwater is dangerous to drive. Despite big developers and SEZ flooding Pataudi road connectivity is decade away.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hsrdc.in/links/projects.aspx |title=HSRDC |publisher=Hsrdc.in |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28[/tpl] The widening of Gurgaon-Pataudi Road to 135 metres is complete and the 60 metres sectors roads are under construction.
