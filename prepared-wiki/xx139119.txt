The mascot itself is a bird named "Freddie Falcon" [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
In 1981, the Franklin County district was split into two high school attendance zones with the opening of Western Hills High School, with Franklin County High now serving primarily the eastern half of the county, including eastern portions of the city of Frankfort. The central part of the city is served by a separate district, Frankfort Independent Schools, which operates the other public high school in the county, Frankfort High School.
in 1990, science classrooms  and some math classrooms were enlarged, two computer labs were added, and the library was expanded. A more extensive renovation project began in the summer of 1997 and continued uninterrupted through the summer of 2001. The facade was updated, the original band room and administrative offices were torn down, and the original bus circle was removed.  New music classrooms, practice rooms, business classrooms, and offices were constructed.  Also added were a new center hallway on both the first and second floors; the second floor hallway connects the original front wing with the back foyer. The cafeteria, auditorium, and gymnasium also were updated, and the library and the remaining original classrooms were enlarged. Franklin County High School Yearbooks 1998-2002

===Team Records===

===Individual Records===

==Fight song==

The Franklin County High Fight Song is mostly played at sporting events where the school's band is present, mainly football and basketball games.  As the band begins to play the song, fans stand up, clap and sing along with the music.

==Alma mater==

The school's Alma Mater is not as widely known as the fight song and is mainly played at graduation and other scholarly events.  The "Avenue of Trees" referenced in the song describes the tall oak trees lining the shared driveway between the school and Elkhorn Middle School from the entrance at East Main Street.  However, this entrance was closed and no longer exists because of traffic re-routing.  Both schools now have separate entrances to alleviate traffic.
Unlike many high schools which use re-written lyrics to popular college songs, both Franklin County's Fight Song and Alma Mater are original works by the school's first band director, David Livingston.
