IMEI Number Allocation:The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a 15-digit decimal number required to identify terminal equipment when it is used on a GSM/UMTS mobile phone network. To ensure traceability of each item of equipment connected to the network, the IMEI must be unique and manufacturers must ensure no duplication of IMEI.
This requires the registration of companies onto the IMEI database before the allocation of TAC (part of the IMEI) numbers. IMEI numbers are a global resource. The allocation of a TAC does not imply ownership of an IMEI by either the organisation to which the TAC is allocated or by the organisation performing the allocation function. The overriding principles for the allocation and management of IMEI are preservation of the available number range, the prevention of duplication and the maintenance of security.
