A PC bang  (Korean: PC방; literally "PC room") is a type of LAN gaming center, where patrons can play multiplayer computer games for an hourly fee. The typical cost for an hour of play ranges from 500 to 1500 won (approximately $0.44 to $1.32 USD.), with 1000 won per hour being the most common cost. Although the per capita penetration of computers and broadband internet access is very high in South Korea, PC bangs remain popular as they provide a social meeting place for gamers (especially school-aged gamers) to play together with their peers. The computer hardware used by PC bangs may be more powerful than the systems available in the players' homes. Most popular game titles include Starcraft, Diablo, and World of Warcraft.Pc bangs as an industrial driving force.. (2008, October 21).

Catering to people who stay for long hours, PC rooms are usually equipped with drinks and snacks (that are bought separately). Popular snacks include ramen cup noodles, coffee in cans, and various chips. Players can also order food from local restaurants.

==Social aspect==

PC bang industry has created a culture that is participated in by most youth in South Korea. Gamers have turned the PC bang into a socialization facility, becoming a huge part in the lives of the Korean youth today. Many students have suggested that the PC-Bang provides a stress free, fun and youth dominated environment where groups of friends can meet and engage in a cooperative game. They have suggested that the games themselves may promote a social environment by promoting the development of squads or groups of players to play the game more effectively.Stewart,K., & Choi, H. P.

With computer and Internet access so readily available to the public, both at home and at the PC-Bangs, gaming addiction has become a concern. The consequences of several amount of hours spent at the PC bang gaming and the strong need to compete causes increased addiction and displacement problems of the Korean PC-Bang users. Biggest displacements due to addiction include sleep, school, homework, promises to meet with friends and time spent with friends. As part of its efforts to battle online game addictions among teenagers, South Korea introduced a law that prohibits those aged 16 and under from playing online games between midnight and 6 a.m.Marlowe, C.
