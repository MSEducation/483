[[List of antidepressants]]

CATEGORIES: Antidepressants

This is a list of antidepressants by drug group. Generic drug names are listed first with trade names in brackets.
Antidepressant drugs may be augmented in the treatment of depression or other mood disorders by non-antidepressant drugs (such as lithium carbonate) which have been shown to boost the antidepressant effect of a main antidepressant treatment.

==Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)==

Be aware of drug interactions. Dextromethorphan, which is found in many brands of over-the-counter cough syrup, opioids tramadol (Tramal and Ultram), and pethidine/meperidine are contraindicated.  They all have serotonin re-uptake inhibition effects themselves, and the combination could cause the potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Many SSRIs inhibit the metabolism of dextromethorphan as well, further adding to the risk.
Drug interactions may also occur when concurrently taking phenytoin (Dilantin) and warfarin (Coumadin) because phenytoin and warfarin levels are increased.
Always check with pharmacy regarding potential drug interactions.

==Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)==

Agents such as Tramadol (Tramal, Ultram) and Sibutramine (Meridia, Reductil) are also SNRIs and may be included in this class.

==Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs)==

==Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs)==

==Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs)==

==TAAR1 agonists==

==Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)==

Tricyclics can cause arrhythmias and ECG changes and are very toxic in overdose.
These medications should be used with extreme caution in the elderly.

==Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs)==

==Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)==

===Irreversible===

===Reversible===

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. There are two types with regard to the effect on the enzyme, the irreversible and the newer reversible inhibitors. As there are potentially fatal interactions between irreversible MAOIs and certain foods (particularly those containing tyramine), as well as certain drugs, classic irreversible MAOIs are rarely prescribed any more. However, this does not apply to Emsam, Emsam is the transdermal patch form of selegiline, which due to its bypassing of the stomach has a lesser propensity to induce such events.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Elisa F. |last1=Cascade |first2=Amir H. |last2=Kalali |first3=Sheldon H. |last3=Preskorn |pmid=20711332 |url=http://www.psychiatrymmc.com/emsam-the-first-year/ |year=2007 |title=Emsam: The first year |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=19–21 |pmc=2921248 |journal=Psychiatry[/tpl] Reversible inhibitors such as moclobemide do not require dietary restrictions,[tpl]cite journal |author=Nair NP, Ahmed SK, Kin NM |title=Biochemistry and pharmacology of reversible inhibitors of MAO-A agents: focus on moclobemide |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=214–25 |date=November 1993 |pmid=7905288 |pmc=1188542 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Fulton B, Benfield P |title=Moclobemide.

==Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA)==

== Serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS) == 
These drugs work by serving as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor and an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.

==Others==

==Adjunctive treatments==

This category is reserved for agents that generally do not possess antidepressant activity by themselves but when combined with antidepressants they tend to improve therapeutic responses in depression.

===Atypical antipsychotics===

===Others===

==Miscellaneous==

===5-HT1A Receptor Partial Agonists===

===mACh receptor antagonists===

===NMDA receptor antagonists===

===Combination products===
