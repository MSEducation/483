===History===

Hartwell station opened on 7 May 1906, under the name of Hartwell Hill.VICSIG Infrastructure â€“ Hartwell Confusingly, Burwood was named Hartwell at the time. On 1 August 1909, Hartwell Hill was renamed Hartwell, and Hartwell was renamed Burwood. Hartwell was originally part of the Deepdene Dasher service that connected Ashburton with Deepdene. After the closure of the Deepdene service in 1927, Hartwell became part of the Ashburton line, which in turn became the Alamein line in 1948.
Hartwell is named after one of the early estates in the area, "Hartwell House", which was the residence of James Irwin, who owned and operated Irwin's Hotel in the mid-1850s which was located on lot 149a the corner of Norwood Road (now Toorak Road) and Wattle Valley Road, subsequently demolished about the time the railway line was built. In the 1850s, Hartwell was a small hamlet known as "Back Creek" named after the creek nearby. Irwins Hotel in the Boorandarra Roads Board minutes of meetings noted that c/- Irwin Hotel "Back Creek" was used as a Polling Station.
The station has two platforms arranged in an island configuration (where trains arrive either side of a central shared platform). The station building is historically significant, as it was originally built as Walhalla station on the Walhalla line, but was moved to Hartwell in December 1938, six years before the Walhalla line closed in 1944. Hartwell is the only station on the Alamein branch to have an island platform.  Until the Alamein line was converted from single line to double line in the 1950s, Hartwell was the only crossing loop on the line.  This meant that nearly every train met a service going in the opposite direction, at Hartwell.  Thus, Hartwell was an important Staff and Ticket safeworking station.
