==History==

A church was on the site in 1338.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.blackburn.anglican.org/ |title=Hornby St Margaret |accessdate=29 April 2008 |publisher=Diocese of Blackburn [/tpl] The oldest part of the current church is the tower which was built by Sir Edward Stanley, Lord Mounteagle, in 1514. Lord Mounteagle also arranged for the rebuilding of the chancel but this was incomplete when he died in 1524. In 1817 the old nave was demolished and replaced by a new nave.[tpl]citation  |last=Farrer |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors=Brownbill, J.

The nave was largely rebuilt, arcades and a clerestory were inserted, the church was reroofed and refloored, the west gallery was removed, the box pews were replaced by modern seating, the vestry was converted into an organ chamber, and a new vestry was built; this was done at an estimated cost of £3,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|3000|1888|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-4[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).[tpl]Citation | last = Brandwood| first = Geoff| author-link = | last2 = Austin| first2 = Tim| last3 = Hughes| first3 = John| last4 = Price| first4 = James| publication-date = | year = 2012| title = The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin| edition = |publication-place = Swindon| publisher = English Heritage| page = 237| isbn = 978-1-84802-049-8[/tpl][tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl]
