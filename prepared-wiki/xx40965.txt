===Books===

Cavalli-Sforza has summed up his work for laymen in five topics covered in Genes, Peoples, and Languages.Luigi Cavalli-Sforza, Genes, Peoples, and Languages, tr. Mark Seielstad, North Point Press (2000) ISBN 0-86547-529-6  According to an article published in The Economist, the work of Cavalli-Sforza "challenges the assumption that there are significant genetic differences between human races, and indeed, the idea that 'race' has any useful biological meaning at all". The book illustrates both the problems of constructing a general "hereditary tree" for the entire human race, and some mechanisms and data analysis methods to greatly reduce these problems, thus constructing a fascinating hypothesis of the recent 150,000 years of human expansion, migration, and human diversity formation.Geoffrey Carr, "Survey: The proper study of mankind", The Economist Vol. 356, no. 8177,  pg. 11. (July 1, 2000) In the book Cavalli-Sforza asserts that Europeans are, in their ancestry, about two-thirds Asian and one-third African.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/01/books/shelf-life-dismantling-race-and-unifying-the-human-species.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=New York Times | title=SHELF LIFE; Dismantling Race and Unifying the Human Species | date=2000-04-01 | accessdate=2012-05-16 | first1=Edward | last1=Rothstein[/tpl]
Cavalli-Sforza's The History and Geography of Human GenesCavalli-Sforza, L. L., P. Menozzi, A. Piazza. 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton University Press, Princeton. ISBN 0-691-02905-9 (1994 with Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza) is a standard reference on human genetic variation. Cavalli-Sforza also wrote The Great Human Diasporas: The History of Diversity and Evolution (together with his son Francesco).

===Schooling and positions===

Cavalli-Sforza entered Ghislieri College in Pavia in 1939 and he received his M.D. from the University of Pavia in 1944. After the war he followed studies at Cambridge with the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald A. Fisher in the area of bacterial genetics. They were followed by years of teaching in northern Italy, in Milan, Parma, and Pavia, and then he moved in 1970 to Stanford, where he has remained.
In 1999 he won the Balzan Prize for the Science of human origins.  He has been a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences since 1994.He was awarded the Telesio-Galilei Academy Award in 2011 for Biology.

===Specific contributions===

Cavalli-Sforza initiated a new field of research by combining the concrete findings of demography with a newly-available analysis of blood groups in an actual human population. He also studied the connections between migration patterns and blood groups.
Writing in the mid-1960s with another genetics student of Ronald A. Fisher, Anthony W. F. Edwards,  Cavalli-Sforza pioneered statistical methods for estimating  evolutionary trees (phylogenies); to estimate evolutionary trees, they used maximum likelihood estimation. Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza wrote about trees of populations within the human species, where genetic differences are affected both by treelike patterns of historical separation of populations and by spread of genes among populations by migration and admixture.  In later papers, Cavalli-Sforza has written about the effects of both divergence and migration on human gene frequencies.
While Cavalli-Sforza is best known for his work in genetics, he also, in collaboration with Marcus Feldman and others, initiated the sub-discipline of cultural anthropology known alternatively as coevolution, gene-culture coevolution, cultural transmission theory or dual inheritance theory. The publication Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach (1981) made use of models from population genetics to investigate the transmission of culturally transmitted units. This line of inquiry initiated research into the correlation of patterns of genetic and cultural dispersion.

==Criticism==

His proposed ambitious Human Genome Diversity Project to gather further genetic data from populations around the world was accused[tpl]by whom|date=February 2014[/tpl] of "cultural insensitivity, neocolonialism, and biopiracy."Mitchell Leslie, "The History of Everyone and Everything", Stanford Magazine
Linguist William Poser in Language Log has criticized some of Cavalli-Sforza's comments about linguistics,"Irresponsible Punditry", Language Log, Pennsylvania U. (December 10, 2003) in particular the suggestion, echoing controversial linguists Merritt Ruhlen and Joseph Greenberg, that some mainstream linguists are unnecessarily conservative about hypothesized long-range relationships between language families, and an overstatement that Greenberg's critics "have ruled out the possibility of hierarchical classification", which Cavalli-Sforza did not defend when challenged by Poser, but deferred to Ruhlen. Cavalli-Sforza's interest in hypothesized large-scale language families is as a basis for comparison with similarly large-scale postulated genetic classifications of human populations.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
