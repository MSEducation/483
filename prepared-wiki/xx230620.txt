It is the story of Lauren (Athena Cansino), a young woman from America who learns that her Uncle Sam (director David Winters) has been missing at sea, and that as a result she has inherited his beach bar on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. When she arrives, she meets Angelito, a young handsome artist. They go to the bar, only to find it in terrible shape.
Depressed, Lauren returns to town where she meets two more Americans, (Beth and Marilyn) and Crazy Larry.
Beth was currently working in a bar, and Marilyn, is a passionate young dancer who was fired after an altercation with a group of drunk buffoons. Crazy Larry, a wacky British DJ was also recently fired for accidentally throwing up on his boss.
Together, the four decide to renovate the bar and get the business running again. Meanwhile, Beth's ex, Nick has come from the United States to try to get back together with her. But romance on the rocks is the least of their worries, when they discover that Angelito's father is being held captive by Cortez, a local gangster (Busey).
