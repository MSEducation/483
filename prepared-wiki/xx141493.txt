Expedition 15 Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson did not land with the Soyuz TMA-10, so he was considered part of Expedition 16 for the few weeks prior to the arrival of STS-120.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/070925_exp15_exp15_crewswap.html|title=Space Station Astronauts Prepare for Crew Swap |accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=Space.com|year=2007|author=Tariq Malik[/tpl] STS-120 launched on 23 October, docked on 25 October, and replaced Anderson with new Flight Engineer Daniel Tani.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html|title=Discovery docks with space station|accessdate=25 October 2007|publisher=CBS News|year=2007|author=William Harwood [/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2007/10/25/Discovery_successfully_docks_at_the_ISS/UPI-48981193324029/|title=Discovery successfully docks at the ISS|accessdate=25 October 2007|publisher=United Press International|year=2007|author=UPI[/tpl] Following docking, the Soyuz seat liners for Anderson and Tani were swapped, and Anderson became part of the STS-120 crew.  Léopold Eyharts, who came aboard during STS-122, joined the mission on 9 February 2008, replacing Tani.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/iss/english/exp_16.htm|title=Expedition 16|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=Spacefacts|year=2007|author=Spacefacts[/tpl] The crew was then joined by Garrett Reisman, who was launched aboard Endeavour with STS-123, on 11 March 2008, replacing Eyharts. Reisman joined Expedition 16 in progress, and was a part of Expedition 17 as well. Upon reentry, the astronaut's Soyuz TMA-11 spacecraft suffered a minor malfunction, causing the craft to follow a very steep ballistic descent. As a result, the crew experienced forces up to 10 G, ending up about 260 miles (418 km) west of the targeted landing site. Roscosmos reported all three crew members were doing just fine and in good health.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/04/19/skorea.soyuz/index.html | work=CNN | title=Soyuz crew endures severe G-forces on re-entry - CNN.com | date=19 April 2008 | accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]

==Mission details==

Expedition 16 was the first ISS mission to include two crew members who had served on a previous expedition, and the first time a former commander (Malenchenko) returned as a flight engineer. Whitson was the first female commander of an ISS expedition,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299313,00.html|title=Astronauts Ponder State of Space Exploration|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=Fox News|author=Tariq Malik | date=4 October 2007[/tpl] and with STS-120 commanded by female astronaut Pamela Melroy, it marked the first time that two female mission commanders were in orbit simultaneously.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_M07096_whitson_melroy_liveshots.html|title=Female Space Commanders Available for Interviews|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20761344/|title=Female commanders set for landmark mission|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=MSNBC|year=2007|author=Tariq Malik[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.local6.com/news/14290968/detail.html?rss=orlpn&psp=news|title=History In Space: 2 Women Commanders|accessdate=9 October 2007|publisher=Local6.com Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. |year=2007|author=Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. [/tpl] On her first expedition, Whitson implemented a "Friday night movie night" to help the crew wind down at the end of the week, and plans to keep the custom of adding some levity to the station going for Expedition 16.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3777490&page=1|title=Space Boredom Busters: Movies, Music, Jokes|accessdate=26 October 2007|publisher=ABC News - Associated Press|year=2007|author=Gina Sunseri[/tpl] Anderson incorporated some entertainment into the daily planning conference with the ground, quizzing the ground team on a wide variety of subjects, and Michael Lopez-Alegria did a similar activity with movie and music trivia.

===STS-120===

The first major objective of the increment was accomplished successfully on 26 October, when the crew of STS-120 delivered the Harmony module, and attached it to a temporary location on the Unity module.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts120/071026fd4/index3.html|title=Harmony module  pulled from cargo bay|accessdate=19 November 2007|publisher=Spaceflight Now|year=2007|author=William Harwood for CBS News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/26/science/26cnd-shuttle.html?hp|title=New Room Added to Space Station|accessdate=26 October 2007|work=The New York Times |author=John Schwartz | date=26 October 2007[/tpl] The new addition added over [tpl]convert|2500|cuft|m3[/tpl] to the station's living volume.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3781048|title=Astronauts Attach Space Station Addition|accessdate=26 October 2007|publisher=ABC News / The Associated Press|year=2007|author=Liz Austin Peterson[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The joint crews also moved the P6 truss, and relocated it from its position on top of the station, to its final port-side position, during the third of four spacewalks.

===Configuration of Harmony===

Following the departure of STS-120, a series of Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and robotic activities were carried out to move the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) from the end of the Destiny laboratory, to the end of Harmony. Whitson and Malenchenko carried out the increment's first EVA on 9 November, that prepared the docking port for relocation.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/eva_pma_harmony.html|title=Station Spacewalk Prepares for PMA, Harmony Moves|accessdate=19 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl] On 12 November, Whitson and Tani used the station's Mobile Servicing System (robotic arm) to detach the docking port, and relocated it to the forward port of Harmony.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/hitch111507.xml&headline=ISS%20Crew%20Moves%20Harmony%20Node&channel=space|title=ISS Crew Moves Harmony Node|accessdate=19 November 2007|work=Aviation Week|year=2007|author=Frank Morring, Jr.[/tpl] On 14 November, the Tani and Whitson again used the robotic arm and moved Harmony from its temporary location, to its permanent location on the forward port of Destiny.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_harmony_move.html|title=Harmony Moved to Front of Space Station|accessdate=19 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl]
On 20 November, Whitson and Tani completed the second EVA for the increment, a 7-hour, 16-minute spacewalk to outfit the Harmony node in its new position. All tasks were accomplished, and three get-ahead tasks were performed.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_eva_112007.html|title=Spacewalkers Harmonize on Node Hookup Tasks|accessdate=24 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl]
On 24 November, Whitson and Tani completed the third EVA for the increment, a 7 hour, 4 minute spacewalk to complete the outfitting of Harmony. All task were accomplished, and photographic inspection of the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) was performed, as well as some ISS maintenance get-ahead tasks.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_eva_112407.html|title=Spacewalkers Complete More Harmony Hookup Work|accessdate=24 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/iss_reports/reports2007/11-24-2007.htm|title=ISS On-Orbit Status report 11/24/07|accessdate=27 November 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071130235958/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/osf/iss_reports/reports2007/11-24-2007.htm  |archivedate = 30 November 2007[/tpl]

===EVA milestone===

On 18 December 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16 to inspect the S4 starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), the ground team in Mission Control informed Whitson that she had become the female astronaut with the most cumulative EVA time in NASA history, as well as the most EVAs, with her fifth EVA. Three hours and 37 minutes into the spacewalk, Whitson surpassed NASA astronaut Sunita Williams with a total time at that point of 29 hours and 18 minutes.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/ISS/|title=Space Station Commander Breaks Spacewalking Record|accessdate=18 December 2007|publisher=Space.com|year=2007|author=Tariq Malik[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_eva_121807.html|title=Spacewalkers Find No Solar Wing Smoking Gun|accessdate=18 December 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA[/tpl] At the completion of Whitson's fifth EVA, the 100th in support of ISS assembly and maintenance, Whitson's cumulative EVA time became 32 hours, and 36 minutes, which placed her in 20th place for total EVA time.
