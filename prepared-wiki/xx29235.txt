==Production==

The night that they arrived in New York after their first tour of England with their vaudeville routines, George Burns and Gracie Allen attended a party where they were approached by their agent Arthur Lyons, who asked if they'd be interested in filming a short for Warner Brothers the following morning.[tpl]cite book|last=Burns|first=George |title=I Love Her, That's Why!|publisher=Simon and Schuster.|year=1955|pages=143[/tpl]  Comedian Fred Allen was slated to film one of his comedy routines but had come with the flu, leaving the studio in a lurch.  Burns was told that the job paid $1,700, so he said yes on the spot.  "I'd never heard of $1,700 in my life, especially for nine minutes' work," Burns quipped.
When they arrived on-set in Astoria, Queens the next morning, Burns was shocked to see his childhood buddy Murray Roth, who was directing.  Burns didn't believe Roth was in showbiz, let alone a film director, so Roth shouted "Lights!" and the set lights come on.  "Off!" he shouted, and the stage went black.  This glimpse of the living room set that they'd be shooting on perplexed Burns.  His toup√©e was still in his luggage, which he hadn't had time to pick up from the loading dock following their trip.  To explain why he was wearing a hat, he quickly rewrote the comedy duo's "Lambchops" routine to begin with himself and Gracie coming in the room and looking for the audience.

==Reception==

According to George Burns, Warner Brothers was not impressed with the short, which he himself described as, "not the greatest,"[tpl]cite book|last=Burns|first=George |title=I Love Her, That's Why!|publisher=Simon and Schuster.|year=1955|pages=144[/tpl] so they were not asked to shoot any more for the studio.  Burns, however was so enamored by the paycheck that he actively sought out more film work and was quickly embraced by Paramount Pictures, with whom Burns and Allen subsequently released a whole series of short subjects.
In 1999 the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/clamen/misc/movies/NFR-Titles.html|title=U.S. National Film Registry -- Titles|accessdate=2013-12-07[/tpl]  Lambchops was released on DVD in three disc deluxe edition of The Jazz Singer in October 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Singer-Three-Disc-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00005JKSC|title=Amazon.com: The Jazz Singer (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)|accessdate=2013-12-07[/tpl]
