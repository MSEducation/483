Kitsap Mall in Silverdale, Washington is an indoor shopping mall with 110 retail stores.  Anchor tenants include JCPenney, Macy's, Sears and Kohl's. The mall is managed and owned by Starwood Capital Group.

==History==

After many years of planning, Kitsap Mall opened in August 1985. As a result the retail core of Kitsap County was shifted from Bremerton, Washington to the Silverdale area. The mall's original anchors were Lamonts, Sears, and The Bon Marche. Later in the decade, and after much success, Kitsap Mall nearly doubled in size, adding Mervyns in 1988 and JCPenney in the 90's, while The Bon Marche was expanded to the east, nearly doubling its size. 
In 2000, Lamonts became Gottschalks. The Bon Marche was re-branded under the Macy's name plate, first as Bon-Macy's in 2003, becoming Macy's in 2005.
In 2006, Kitsap Mall received a big change as Gottschalks closed down. 
The building housed Gottschalks was torn down and replaced by a new building, which now houses Barnes & Noble and Cost Plus World Market. 
In 2007, Mervyns closed down. 
It has been replaced by a new building for Kohl's.
In 2008, Hollister Co. opened in a location formerly occupied by the Disney store. Hale's Aleshouse opened in the former location of Champ's Sports in Kitsap Mall in 2010. Remodelling of the mall's fa√ßade and interior was performed in 2011 through 2012.
In June 2013, Kitsap Mall and its surrounding properties (NorthPoint, Kitsap Place) were bought by Starwood Capital Group from Macerich.
