The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) or Chagos Islands is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom situated in the Indian Ocean halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia. The territory comprises the six atolls of the Chagos Archipelago with over 1,000 individual islands[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]many tiny[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]amounting to a total land area of [tpl]convert|60|km2|sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| title=British Indian Ocean Territory| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html| publisher=Central Intelligence Agency| work=World Factbook| date=27 March 2013| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]
The largest island is Diego Garcia, [tpl]convert|44|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], the site of a joint military facility of the United Kingdom and the United States. Following the eviction of the native population (Chagossians) in the 1960s, the only inhabitants are US and British military personnel and associated contractors, who collectively number around 4,000 (2004 figures).
Mauritius sought to resume control over the Chagos Archipelago which was split from its territory by the UK in 1965 to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. Between 1968 and 1973, the Chagossians, then numbering about 2,000 people, were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to establish a military base on the island. Today, the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return, claiming that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal (see Depopulation of Diego Garcia).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13882233|title=Mauritius profile|year=2011|publisher=BBC World|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chagosinternational.org/files/page_detail.php?id1=127&lang=1|title=HISTORICAL BACKGROUND - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO ?|publisher=chagosinternational.org|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl]

==History==

Maldivian mariners knew the Chagos Islands well.[tpl]cite book| author=Xavier Romero-Frias| title=The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom| location=Barcelona| year=1999| publisher=Nova Ethnographia Indica| isbn=84-7254-801-5| chapter=1 A Seafaring Nation| page=19[/tpl] In Maldivian lore, they are known as Fōlhavahi or Hollhavai (the latter name in the closer Southern Maldives). According to Southern Maldivian oral tradition, traders and fishermen were occasionally lost at sea and got stranded on one of the islands of the Chagos. Eventually they were rescued and brought back home. However, these islands were judged to be too far away from the Maldives to be settled permanently by them. Thus, for many centuries the Chagos were ignored by their northern neighbours.
The islands of Chagos Archipelago were charted by Vasco da Gama in the early sixteenth century, then claimed in the eighteenth century by France as a possession of Mauritius. They were first settled in the 18th century by African slaves and Indian contractors brought by Franco-Mauritians to found coconut plantations.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/JD17Aa01.html| title=Introducing the other Guantanamo| work=Asia Times| date=17 April 2008| last=Vine| first=David| publisher=atimes.com| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] In 1810, Mauritius was captured by the United Kingdom, and France ceded the territory in the Treaty of Paris.
In 1965, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius and the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches (Des Roches) from the Seychelles to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The purpose was to allow the construction of military facilities for the mutual benefit of the United Kingdom and the United States. The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965.[tpl]cite book|author=United States Dept. of State. Office of the Geographer|title=Commonwealth of Nations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iq1IQ2yDsiYC|accessdate=7 November 2013|year=1968|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=15[/tpl] On 23 June 1976, Aldabra, Farquhar and Desroches were returned to Seychelles as a result of its attaining independence. Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago.
In 1990, the first BIOT flag was unfurled. This flag, as well as containing the flag of the United Kingdom, has depictions of the Indian Ocean, where the islands are located, in the form of white and blue wavy lines and also a palm tree rising above the British crown.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/biot.htm|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=WorldAtlas.com[/tpl]

==Population==

In 1966, the British government purchased the privately owned copra plantations and closed them. Over the next five years, the British authorities forcibly and clandestinely removed the entire population of about 2,000 people, known as Chagossians (or Ilois), from Diego Garcia and two other Chagos atolls, Peros Banhos and Salomon Islands, to Mauritius.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2524531120070525| title=The coral sea vista opened up by British judges| last=Baker| first=Luke| publisher=Reuters| date=25 May 2007| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] In 1971, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a treaty, leasing the island of Diego Garcia to the US military for the purposes of building a large air and naval base on the island. The deal was important to the UK government, as the United States granted it a substantial discount on the purchase of Polaris nuclear missiles in return for the use of the islands as a base.[tpl]Cite news| title=Law Lords to rule on whether Chagos Islanders can finally return home| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/3237331/Law-Lords-to-rule-on-whether-Chagos-Islanders-can-finally-return-home.html| last=Knapton| first=Sarah| date=21 October 2008| work=The Daily Telegraph| publisher=telegraph.co.uk| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] The strategic location of the island was also significant at the centre of the Indian Ocean, and to counter any Soviet threat in the region.
Work on the military base commenced in 1971, with a large airbase with several long range runways constructed, as well as a harbour suitable for large naval vessels. Although classed as a joint UK/US base, in practice it is primarily staffed by the US military, although the British maintain a garrison at all times, and Royal Air Force long range patrol aircraft are deployed there. The United States Air Force used the base during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2001 war in Afghanistan, as well as the 2003 Iraq War.
During the 1980s[tpl]year needed|date=October 2011[/tpl], Mauritius asserted a claim to sovereignty for the territory, citing the 1965 separation as illegal under international law, despite their apparent agreement at the time. The UK does not recognise Mauritius' claim, but has agreed to cede the territory to Mauritius when it is no longer required for defence purposes.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/14708.htm#a39| title=Seventh Report – Overseas Territories| page=125| author=Foreign Affairs Committee| publisher=House of Commons| date=6 July 2008| accessdate=6 August 2009[/tpl] The Seychelles also launched a sovereignty claim on several of the islands.[tpl]which|date=October 2011[/tpl][tpl]when|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The islanders, who now reside in Mauritius and the Seychelles, have continually asserted their right to return to Diego Garcia, winning important legal victories in the English High Court in 2000, 2006 and 2007. However, in the High Court and Court of Appeal in 2003 and 2004, the islanders' application for further compensation on top of the £14.5 million value package of compensation they had already received was dismissed by the court.
On 11 May 2006, the High Court ruled that a 2004 Order in Council preventing the Chagossians' resettlement of the islands was unlawful, and consequently that the Chagossians were entitled to return to the outer islands of the Chagos Archipelago.[tpl]cite court| url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/1038.html| litigants=The Queen on the application of Louis Olivier Bancoult v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs| date=2006 reporter=EWHC| opinion=1038 (Admin)| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] On 23 May 2007, this was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.[tpl]cite court| url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/498.html| litigants=Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v The Queen (on the application of Bancoult)| date=2007| reporter=EWCA| opinion=Civ 498| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] In a visit sponsored by the British government, the islanders visited Diego Garcia and other islands on 3 April 2006 for humanitarian purposes, including the tending of the graves of their ancestors.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4852768.stm |work=BBC News |title=Paradise regained – for a few days |date=3 April 2006 |last=Reynolds |first=Paul |accessdate=27 April 2010[/tpl] On 22 October 2008, the British government won an appeal to the House of Lords regarding the royal prerogative used to continue excluding the Chagossians from their homeland.[tpl]cite news| url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdjVkpT6_bzQxOkAQiXHQRIerOtw| title=Britain wins appeal over Chagos islanders' return home| publisher=Google| agency=Agence France-Press| date=22 October 2008| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite court| url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/61.htm| litigants=R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs| date=2008| reporter=UKHL| opinion=61| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]
According to a WikiLeaks disclosure document,[tpl]cite news| title=HMG Floats Proposal for Marine Reserve Covering Chagos Archipeligo (British Indian Ocean Territory)| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/london-wikileaks/8305246/HMG-FLOATS-PROPOSAL-FOR-MARINE-RESERVE-COVERING-THE-CHAGOS-ARCHIPELAGO-BRITISH-INDIAN-OCEAN-TERRITORY.html |accessdate=5 April 2013| date=4 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph| publisher=telegraph.co.uk[/tpl] in a calculated move in 2009 to prevent re-settlement of the BIOT by native Chagossians, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a "marine reserve" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands. The summary of the diplomatic cable is as follows:
 HMG would like to establish a “marine park” or “reserve” providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park – the world’s largest – would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and U.S. should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that U.S. interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT’s former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve. 
The UK government established a marine reserve in April 2010 to mixed reactions from Chagossians. While the UK Foreign Office claimed that it was an environmental move as well as a necessary move to improve the coral populations off east Africa and therefore sub-saharan marine supplies, some Chagossians claimed that the reserve would prevent any resettlement due to the inability to fish in protected areas. The Chagossian UK-based Diego Garcian Society stated that it welcomed the marine reserve, noting that it was in the interest of Chagossians to have the area protected while they were exiled and that it could be renegotiated upon resettlement. The Foreign Office claimed the reserve was made "without prejudice to the outcome of the current, pending proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights".[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8599125.stm |title=UK sets up Chagos Islands marine reserve |work=BBC News | publisher=BBC.com |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2011[/tpl]
On 1 December 2010, a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable exposed British and US communications in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts "asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents."[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Richard Mills concludes:  "Establishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO’s Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands’ former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the British Indian Ocean Territory."[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]  The cable (reference ID "09LONDON1156") was classified as confidential and "no foreigners", and leaked as part of the Cablegate cache.

==Politics and law==

As a territory of the United Kingdom, the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II. There is no governor appointed to represent the Queen on the territory, as there are no longer any native inhabitants. The head of government is the commissioner, currently Dr. Peter Hayes (since October 2012, replacing Colin Roberts), and administrator John McManus (since April 2011, replacing Joanne Yeadon), all of whom reside in the United Kingdom. The commissioner's representative in the territory is the officer commanding the detachment of British forces.
The laws of the territory are based on the constitution, set out in the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004,https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/british_indian_ocean_territory_c which gives the commissioner full powers to make laws for the territory. Applicable treaties between the United Kingdom and the United States govern the use of the military base. The United States is required to ask permission of the United Kingdom to use the base for offensive military action.

==Geography==

The territory is an archipelago of 55 islands, the largest being Diego Garcia, accounting for almost three-quarters of the total land area of the territory, which is 60 km². The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding 2 metres above sea level. The climate is tropical marine; hot, humid, and moderated by trade winds. In 2010 [tpl]convert|545000|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] of ocean around the islands was declared a marine reserve.
With the exception of one four-lane motorway, most of the islands in the territory have no roads of any sort.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ctbto.org/verification-regime/featured-stations/types/hydroacoustic/ha08-british-indian-ocean-territory-biotchagos-archipelago-united-kingdom/?textonly=1 |title=HA08, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) Chagos Archipelago, United Kingdom |publisher=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] Diego Garcia has a short stretch of paved road between the port and airfield; otherwise transport is mostly by bicycle. Diego Garcia's military base is home to the territory's only airport. At 3000 metres long, it is capable of supporting heavy USAF bombers such as the B-52 and would have been able to support the Space Shuttle in the event of a mission abort.[tpl]cite web| author=John Pike |title=Space Shuttle Landing Sites |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=20 July 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl] It also has a major seaport.
There is also a marina bus service along the main road of the island.[tpl]cite web| title=On the Chop's Visit to Diego Garcia| url=http://thebaltimorechop.com/2010/10/12/on-the-chops-visit-to-diego-garcia/| date=12 October 2010| publisher=thebaltimorechop.com| accessdate=5 April 2013[/tpl]

==Conservation==

In April 2010, an MPA (Marine protected area) was created in the BIOT that covers the territorial waters of the Chagos Archipelago, except for the area immediately surrounding Diego Garcia. This declaration doubled the total area of environmental no take zones world-wide. The benefits of protecting this area:
The area had already been declared an Environmental (Preservation and Protection) Zone, but since the establishment of the MPA, fishing is no longer permitted in the area.

==Demographics==

The total population was reported at 4,000 in 2006, of whom 2,200 were American military personnel or contractors, 1,400 were Filipino contract workers, 300 were Mauritian contract workers, and 100 were members of the British Armed Forces. It is believed the population has significantly decreased since the end of US bombing operations from the island in August 2006.

==Economy and communications==

All economic activity is concentrated on Diego Garcia, where joint Anglo-American defence facilities are located. Approximately 2,000 native inhabitants, known as the Chagossians or Ilois, were forcibly relocated to Mauritius before construction of these facilities; in 1995, there were approximately 1,700 UK and US military personnel and 1,500 civilian contractors living on the island.
Construction projects and various services needed to support the military installations are carried out by military and contract employees from Britain, Mauritius, the Philippines, and the US. There are no industrial or agricultural activities on the islands. The licensing of commercial fishing provides an annual income of about $1 million for the territory.[tpl]cite hansard| house=House of Commons| url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040621/text/40621w13.htm#40621w13.html_sbhd2|  date=21 June 2004| column=1219W[/tpl]
Postage stamps have been issued for British Indian Ocean Territory since 17 January 1968. As the territory was originally part of the Seychelles, these stamps were denominated in rupees until 1992. However, after that date they were issued in denominations of British Pounds, the official currency of the territory.
Separate telephone facilities for military and public needs are available, providing all standard commercial telephone services, including connection to the Internet. International telephone service is carried via satellite. The territory has two FM radio broadcast stations. Due to its geographic location in proximity to the equator with unobstructed views to the horizon, Diego Garcia has access to a relatively large number of geosynchronous satellites over the Indian and eastern Atlantic Oceans, and the island is home to Diego Garcia Station (DGS), a remote tracking station making up part of the Air Force Satellite Control Network. Diego Garcia Station has two sides to provide enhanced tracking capabilities for AFSCN users.
Amateur radio operations occur from Diego Garcia, using the British callsign prefix VQ9. An amateur club station, VQ9X, was sponsored by the US Navy for use by operators both licensed in their home country and possessing a VQ9 callsign issued by the local British Indian Ocean Territory representative.[tpl]cite web|title=VQ9X Club Station|url=http://www.qsl.net/vq9la/2.htm|work=QSL.NET|accessdate=20 September 2013|author=Arneson, Larry (VQ9LA)[/tpl] However, the US Navy closed the station in early 2013, therefore any future licensed amateurs wishing to operate from the island will have to provide their own antenna and radio equipment.[tpl]cite web|title=(Post of) May 24, 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=653189054707236&id=148071511885662|work=Official VQ9X Facebook page|accessdate=20 September 2013|author=Arneson, Larry (VQ9LA)[/tpl]
