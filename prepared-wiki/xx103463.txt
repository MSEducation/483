Keating Millennium Centre (also known as the KMC) is a multi-purpose arena and conference centre located on the campus of St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. The $20 million athletics and conference centre was built in 2001 as part of St. Francis Xavier's campus renewal program. The building houses two large ice surfaces and the main surface can be converted into a large open area mainly for concerts and graduation. The main stadium seats 1,501. The entire building's area can hold over 2,207 people with room to spare. The KMC is home to the St. Francis Xavier X-Men and X-Women hockey teams of the AUS conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The 2006 CIS Women's Ice Hockey Championships were held at the KMC.
