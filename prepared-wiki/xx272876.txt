Club reviewer Erik Adams called the episode "one of the funniest pilots of the new fall season" commenting that "Showrunner Emily Spivey does well not to mine the saccharine elements of parenthood. She makes Up All Night’s intentions apparent from the moment that Arnett and Applegate can’t bring themselves to quit cursing in front of lil’ Amy."[tpl]cite web|last=Adams |first=Erik |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pilot,61664/ |title=“Pilot” | Pan Am | TV Club | TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl] Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff was slightly more negative towards the pilot writing that "The pilot for Up All Night isn’t very funny, especially given the people working on it, but it’s often well-observed.". His main criticism was that the series was "essentially, two shows in one" calling the workplace scenes "like a copy of many other shows on the air". The two reviewers eventually gave the series a B. HitFix reviewer Daniel Feinberg gave the series pilot a positive review, but disliked the office settings and the writing for Rudolph's character commenting that "Will Arnett and Christina Applegate are playing parents, but Maya Rudolph is playing a sitcom character".[tpl]cite web|last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-fien-print/posts/tv-review-nbcs-up-all-night |title=TV Review: NBCs Up All Night |publisher=HitFix |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=September 14, 2011[/tpl] He ultimately gave the series a B- rating the Baby Scenes with a B+ and the Rudolph scenes a C/C-.
