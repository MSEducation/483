Chauncey Black (born Chauncey Hannibal, November 24, 1968) is an American R&B singer, songwriter, music producer and member of the R&B group Blackstreet.   
The group’s name is a portmanteau of Hannibal’s nickname (Black) and Joseph Stonestreet’s last name (Street), which birthed the name Blackstreet.  The original members of the group were Teddy Riley, Chauncey Black, Levi Little, and Joseph Stonestreet.  Stonestreet was soon replaced by Dave Hollister before they began work on their self-titled debut album.
Chauncey Black remains the sole owner of Blackstreet, and CEO of Blackstreet Entertainment, Inc..  He continues to perform worldwide as a solo artist.
