==Football career==

Born in Brescia, Filippini emerged through his hometown Brescia Calcio's youth system, and stayed there for eight professional seasons, after having started – on loan – with amateurs Ospitaletto, the first of many teams he shared with his sibling Antonio. The pair made their Serie A debut on 31 August 1997, in a 1–2 away loss against Inter Milan. 
After one and a half seasons on loan to Parma AC Filippini moved, alongside Antonio, to U.S. Città di Palermo,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0405/news_scheda.jsp?id=2043|title=Quadriennale per Adriano, Ceduti i Filippini e Vannucchi, riscattato Pepe|trans_title=Four years for Adriano, Filippinis and Vannucchi loaned, rescued Pepe|publisher=Palermo's official website|language=Italian|date=31 August 2004|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] scoring four goals in his short spell to help the Sicilians return to the top division after 31 years.
Filippini then hard three more solid campaigns, one each with S.S. Lazio, Treviso F.B.C. 1993 and Bologna F.C. 1909 (the first two with Antonio, the latter in the second division), before signing with A.S. Livorno Calcio in 2007; in his second season he appeared in only a handful of games – unlike his twin, which had joined the previous year – but helped the club in the successful promotion play-offs, after which he was released, at nearly 36, retiring shortly after.
In late January 2010, Brescia appointed Filippini as assistant coach of the Giovanissimi Nazionali youth team guided by Omar Danesi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bresciaonline.it/or4/or?uid=BOLesy.main.index&oid=602690&uidx_15=BOLappl.news.dettaglio&idnews=1537497&is_popup=0|title=Emanuele Filippini nuovo aiuto allenatore dei Giovanissimi Nazionali|trans_title=Emanuele Filippini new Giovanissimi Nazionali assistant coach|publisher=Brescia Calcio|language=Italian|date=6 February 2010|accessdate=6 February 2010[/tpl]
