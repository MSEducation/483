==Combat history==

===Northern & Central Luzon===

Following the 1941 Japanese invasion, the 26th participated in the Allied withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula. In doing so, the unit conducted a classic delaying action that allowed other, less mobile, units to safely withdraw to the peninsula. During the delaying action the 26th provided the "stoutest" and only "serious opposition"[tpl]cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Louis |title=The Fall of the Philippines |editor1-first=Kert Roberts |editor1-last=Greenfield |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_Contents.htm#part2 |accessdate=17 September 2012 |series=United States Army in World War II |origyear=1953 |year=2006 |publisher=Center of Military History |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=VIII.

For instance, during the initial landings the regiment alone delayed the advance of four enemy infantry regiments for six hours at Damortis, and on 24 December repulsed a tank assault at Binalonan. However, the resistance was not without cost, as by the end of 24 December the regiment had been reduced down to 450 men.[tpl]cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Louis |title=The Fall of the Philippines |editor1-first=Kert Roberts |editor1-last=Greenfield |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_Contents.htm#part2 |accessdate=17 September 2012 |series=United States Army in World War II |origyear=1953 |year=2006 |publisher=Center of Military History |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=VIII.
