</ref>  The site has been ranked as high as the second spot in [[Google]] searches for the term "Scientology".<ref name="googleaddssitesbysubtracting" />
The term for the organization refers both to a traditional clam bake, as well as the notion from L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology: A History of Man that humans follow a "genetic line" which includes clams, and that the psychological problems afflicting humans are impacted by past experiences.  The domain name Xenu.net is a reference to the character Xenu from secretive "OT III" Scientology documents.
In 1996, the site was one of the first locations on the internet to host secret Scientology documents pertaining to Xenu and OT III.  Shortly thereafter, the Church of Scientology attempted to get this material removed from Operation Clambake and other internet sites, through letters written by counsel, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  After receiving a DMCA takedown notice, Google removed many Xenu.net pages from its indexes, which decreased the site's page rank in searches for "Scientology".  This inspired Google to contribute to the Chilling Effects archive, informing others about material missing from Google indexes due to DMCA takedown notices and other legal threats.
Operation Clambake has been consulted by news media organizations and other groups for information on Scientology and related organizations.  Dateline NBC cited the organization in a 1998 investigative journalism piece, as have other publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Associated Press.  During the Spring 2002 semester, Xenu.net was included as required reading in a New York University course on "Copyright and Censorship",[tpl]cite news  | last = Hull | first = Nathan |  title = Copyright and Censorship | work = Computers in Principle and Practice |   publisher = New York University | date = April 2002 | url = http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring02/V22.0004-004/nytimes.html | accessdate = 2007-10-22[/tpl] and in 2003 webmaster Andreas Heldal-Lund received the 2003 Leipzig Human Rights Award  by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, an organization opposed to the Church of Scientology.

==Foundation==

Operation Clambake was founded in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an information technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net.[tpl]cite news | last = Bugge| first = Stella| coauthors = Harald Vikoyr| title = Scientologi-Hemmeligheter Stoppet Pa Internett| work = VG|   publisher = Verdens Gang AS| date = November 15, 1996[/tpl]  This domain name has been described as provocative, because it is seen by some as a caricature of the character Xenu from Scientology cosmogony.  Operation Clambake is registered in Norway as a non-profit organization.[tpl]cite news   | last =Heldal-Lund  | first =Andreas   |  title =Disclaimer  | work =Operation Clambake  | pages =Main Page  | url =http://www.xenu.net/  | accessdate = 2008-01-03|quote=Operation Clambake is registered as a non-profit organisation in Norway, state reg.no.: 982 983 126[/tpl]
Heldal-Lund chose the name "Operation Clambake" for the organization, as a reference to statements made by L. Ron Hubbard in which Hubbard wrote that the problems of human beings today are a result of traumatic events experienced by them as spiritual beings  when they inhabited the bodies of clams during Earth's evolution.[tpl]cite news | last = Ortega | first = Tony  |  title = Sympathy for the Devil: Tory Bezazian was a veteran Scientologist who loved going after church critics.

==Conflict==

===OT III documents===

Prior to its own direct conflict with the Church of Scientology, Operation Clambake had described on its site how Amazon.com had pulled Jon Atack's book A Piece of Blue Sky, a work critical of Scientology.[tpl]cite news | last = Ryan | first = Nick  |  title = The gospel of the web | work = The Guardian |    date = March 23, 2000 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3977131,00.html [/tpl]  The site later became one of the focal points of what some have termed "the war between Scientology and the Internet".  On November 8, 1996, Operation Clambake was one of the first sites to host the secretive OT III documents describing the story of Xenu.[ref]
