[[Type XXI submarine]]

CATEGORIES: Type XXI submarines, Submarine classes, World War II submarines of Germany

Type XXI U-boats, also known as "Elektroboote" (German: "electric boats"), were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack.

==Description==

The key improvement in the Type XXI was greatly increased battery capacity, roughly triple the Type VIIC. This gave these boats great underwater range, and dramatically reduced the time spent on or near the surface. They could travel submerged at about [tpl]convert|5|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] for two or three days before recharging batteries, which took less than five hours using the snorkel. The Type XXI was also far quieter than the VIIC, making it harder to detect when submerged.
The Type XXI's streamlined and hydrodynamically clean hull design — even featuring a small, pioneering form of the later bulbous bow at the ventral end of the stem as designed — allowed high submerged speed. The ability to outrun many surface ships while submerged, combined with improved dive times (also a product of the new hull form), made it far harder to chase and destroy. It also gave the boat a 'sprint ability' when positioning itself for an attack. Older boats had to surface to sprint into position. This often revealed a boat's location, especially after aircraft became available for convoy escort. The new hull design also reduced visibility by marine or airborne radar when surfaced; whether this was a goal of the design or coincidence is still debated.
They also featured a hydraulic torpedo reloading system that allowed all six bow torpedo tubes to be reloaded faster than a Type VIIC could reload one tube.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] The Type XXI could fire 18 torpedoes in under 20 minutes. The class also featured a very sensitive passive sonar for the time.
The Type XXIs also had better facilities than previous U-boat classes, including a freezer for food.

==Construction==

Between 1943 and 1945, 118 boats were assembled by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg, AG Weser of Bremen, and F. Schichau of Danzig. Each hull was constructed from eight prefabricated sections with final assembly at the shipyards. This new method could have pushed construction time below six months per vessel, but in practice all the assembled U-boats were plagued with severe quality problems that required extensive post-production work to rectify. One of the reasons for these shortcomings was that sections were made by companies having little experience in shipbuilding, following a decision by Albert Speer. As a result, of 118 Type XXIs completed, only four were fit for combat before the war ended in Europe.[tpl]cite book | last=Tooze | first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Tooze| title=The Wages of Destruction | publisher= Penguin Books| location=London| year = 2006|isbn=978-0-14-100348-1 | pages=616–618[/tpl]
It was planned that final assembly of Type XXI boats would eventually be carried out in the Valentin submarine pens, a massive, bomb–hardened concrete bunker built at the small port of Farge, near Bremen.[tpl]cite book |last= Flower |first= Stephen |title= Barnes Wallis' Bombs |publisher= Tempus |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-7524-2987-6|page=350[/tpl] Construction took place between 1943 and 1945, using around 10,000 concentration camp prisoners and prisoners of war as forced–labour.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007390 | title =Neuengamme / Bremen-Farge | author =Marc Buggeln | date = | work = Holocaust Encyclopedia| publisher =United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate = 29 January 2011[/tpl] The facility was 90% completed when, in March 1945, it was badly damaged by Allied bombing with Grand Slam "earthquake" bombs and abandoned.

==Wartime and post-war service==

===Germany===

U-2511 and U-3008 were the only Type XXIs to go on war patrols, and neither sank any ships. U-2511 had a British cruiser in her sights on 4 May when news of the German cease-fire was received. She made a practice attack before leaving the scene undetected.[tpl]cite book | last=Van der Vat| first=Dan|authorlink=Dan van der Vat| title=Stealth at Sea| publisher= Orion| location=London| year = 1994|isbn=1-85797-864-1 | page=353[/tpl]
In 1957, U-2540, which had been scuttled at the end of the war, was raised and refitted as research vessel Wilhelm Bauer of the Bundesmarine. She was operated by both military and civilian crews in a research role until 1982. In 1984, she was opened to the public by the Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum (German Maritime Museum) in Bremerhaven, Germany.

===France===

U-2518 became French submarine Roland Morillot. She saw active service during the Suez Crisis in 1956, and remained in commission until 1967. She was scrapped in 1969.

===Soviet Union===

Four Type XXI boats were assigned to the Soviet Union by the Potsdam Agreement; these were U-3515, U-2529, U-3035, and U-3041, which were commissioned into the Soviet Navy as B-27, B-28, B-29, and B-30 (later B-100) respectively. However, Western intelligence believed the Soviets had acquired several more Type XXI boats; a review by the U.S. Joint Intelligence Committee for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in January 1948 estimated the Soviet Navy then had 15 Type XXIs operational, could complete construction of 6 more within 2 months, and could build another 39 within a year and a half from prefabricated sections, since several factories producing Type XXI components and the assembly yard at Danzig had been captured by the Soviets at the end of World War II. U 3538 — U 3557 (respectively TS-5 – TS-19 and TS-32 – TS-38) remained incomplete at Danzig and were scrapped or sunk in 1947. The four boats assigned by Potsdam were used in trials and tests until 1955, then scuttled or used for weapon testing between 1958 and 1973. The Type XXI formed the basis for the Project 614, essentially a copy of the Type XXI, and many of its characteristics were also incorporated into the Project 613 submarine (known in the West as the Whiskey class).[tpl]cite book | last = Polmar| first = Norman | authorlink = | author2 = Kenneth J.

===United Kingdom===

The U-3017 was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS N41. She was used for tests until being scrapped in November 1949.

===United States===

The United States Navy took over the U-2513 and U-3008, operating them both in the Atlantic. In November 1946 President Harry S. Truman became the first American President to travel on a submarine when he visited U-2513; the submarine dove to [tpl]convert|440|ft|m[/tpl] with the President on board."Truman Dives 440 Feet In German Sub", The Pittsburgh Press,  November 21, 1946, p9 The U-2513 was sunk as a target in 1951; U-3008 was scrapped in 1956.

==Survivors==

The only boat to survive intact is Wilhelm Bauer (ex-U-2540). The wrecks of other Type XXI boats are known to exist. In 1985, it was discovered that the partially scrapped remains of U-2505, U-3004, and U-3506 were still in the partially demolished "Elbe II" U-boat bunker in Hamburg. The bunker has since been filled in with gravel, although even that did not initially deter many souvenir hunters who measured the position of open hatches and dug down to them to allow the removal of artifacts.Hitler's U-boat Bases (2002), Jak P Mallmann Showell, Sutton Publishing ISBN 0-7509-2606-6 The wrecks now lie beneath a car park, making them inaccessible.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | author2 = | title = 3 Type XXI boats in the Elbe II in Hamburg | work = | publisher = uboat.net | date = | url = http://uboat.net/history/hamburg_elbe2.htm | doi = | accessdate = [/tpl]
U-2513 lies in [tpl]convert|213|ft|m[/tpl] of water [tpl]convert|70|nmi|km[/tpl] west of Key West, Florida. The boat has been visited by divers, but the depth makes this very difficult and the site is only considered suitable for advanced divers. Four other boats lie off the coast of Northern Ireland, where they were sunk in 1946 as part of Operation Deadlight. Both U-2511 and U-2506 were found by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney during his Operation Deadlight expeditions between 2001 and 2003.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uboat.net/gallery/DivingE/ | title = Uboat.net Operation Deadlight dives 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uboat.net/gallery/DivingF/ | title = Uboat.net Operation Deadlight dives 2002[/tpl] Both were found to be in remarkably good condition.

==Influences==

The Type XXI design directly influenced advanced post-war submarines, the GUPPY improvements to the American Gato, Balao, and Tench class submarines and the Soviet submarine projects designated by NATO as the Whiskey, ZuluFitzsimons, Bernard, general editor. The Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus Publishing Company, 1978), Volume 24, p.2594, "'Whiskey'", and p.2620, "'Zulu'". and Romeo classes.  The Chinese built Romeo-class submarines based on Soviet-supplied designs. The subsequent Ming class, some of which are still in operation in 2013, is in turn based on the Romeo.
