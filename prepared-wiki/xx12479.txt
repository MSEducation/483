</ref> Compton scattering is an [[inelastic scattering]] of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is a bit more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the [[Kleinâ€“Nishina formula]]. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum|momentum]].

===Rayleigh scattering===

Rayleigh scattering is the dominant elastic scattering mechanism in the X-ray regime.[ref]
</ref> The inelastic forward scattering is what gives rise to the refractive index, which for X-rays is only slightly below 1.<ref>

==Sources==

Since X-rays are emitted by electrons, they can be generated by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays.[ref]
