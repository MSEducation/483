==Early life==

Calista Flockhart was born on November 11, 1964 in Freeport, Illinois, the daughter of Kay, an English teacher, and Ronald Flockhart, a Kraft Foods executive.[tpl]Cite news|last=Schneider|first=Karen S.|coauthors=|title=Arguing Her Case|pages=|publisher=People Magazine|date=1998-11-09|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126712,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-12[/tpl] Her parents are retired and live in Morristown, Tennessee. She has one older brother, Gary. Her mother, Kay Calista,  "Calista Flockhart child of Ronald and Kay Calista" 
reversed her own first and middle names[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] in naming her Calista Kay. Calista also had a great-grandmother named Calista.
Because her father's job required the family to move often, Flockhart and her brother grew up in several places including Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Norwich, New York. As a child, she wrote a play called Toyland which she performed to a small audience at a dinner party.
Flockhart attended Shawnee High School in Medford Township, New Jersey. Following graduation in 1983, Flockhart attended the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met aspiring actress Jane Krakowski, the best friend of her roommate. Later, they both would work together on Ally McBeal.
People began recognizing Flockhart's acting ability when William Esper (Mason Gross' theatre director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue usually is reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of William Inge's Picnic. Flockhart graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theatre in 1988, as one of only a few students who successfully completed the course. Rutgers inducted her into the  Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.
Flockhart moved to New York City in 1989 and began seeking auditions, living with three other women in a two-bedroom apartment and working as a waitress and aerobics instructor. She would remain in the city until 1997.

==Career==

===Early career===

In spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of Guiding Light as a babysitter. She made her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in Beside Herself alongside Melissa Joan Hart, at the Circle Repertory Theatre. Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie Darrow. Though she later appeared in films Naked in New York (1993) and Getting In (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in Quiz Show, directed by Robert Redford.
Flockhart debuted on Broadway in 1994, as Laura in The Glass Menagerie. Actress Julie Harris felt Flockhart should be hired without further auditions, claiming that she seemed ideal for the part. Flockhart received a Clarence Derwent Award for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as Dianne Wiest and Faye Dunaway when she appeared in the movie Drunks. Later that year, Flockhart starred in Jane Doe as a drug addict. In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of Dianne Wiest and Gene Hackman's characters in The Birdcage. Throughout that year, she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters.

===Ally McBeal===

In 1997, Flockhart was asked to audition for the starring role in David E. Kelley's Fox television series, Ally McBeal. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though Flockhart at first hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to Los Angeles to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of Time magazine,[tpl]cite web|title=TIME Magazine Cover: Is Feminism Dead?|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19980629,00.html|date=June 29, 1998|publisher=Time (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Time[/tpl] placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of feminism, relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988616,00.html|title=It's All About Me!|publisher=Time (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Time|author=Ginia Bellafante|date=June 29, 1998[/tpl]
Throughout her professional career, Flockhart has maintained her naturally lean figure. However, many have commented that Flockhart had become dangerously thin, particularly when the actress made red carpet appearances in clothing that revealed a somewhat emaciated physique. She had maintained throughout the show's run that she was never diagnosed with either anorexia or bulimia, nor was she a user of illegal drugs. She did remark, however, that while starring in the show she refrained from eating sweets, retaining her slimness with intense workouts and running.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] In 2006, she admitted that she had a problem at the time, and was "exercising too much" and "eating too little".[tpl]cite news|title=Taking beauty's measure|author=Jenifer Goodwin|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20060924-9999-lz1c24beauty.html|date=September 24, 2006[/tpl]

The show was cancelled in May 2011 after running for five years.
