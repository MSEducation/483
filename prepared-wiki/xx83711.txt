===Seal===

The shield of Cúcuta was adopted in 1958 by Decree 032 on February 3, 1958, after a request by the History Academy of North Santander.

In the center are a quiver of spears, marked with X's, and a set of bow and arrows, tied with tricolor tape.

===US–Colombia Free Trade Agreement implications for Cúcuta===

Colombia signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States amidst opposition by Venezuela. Despite this opposition, industries from Venezuela are constructing their infrastructure in Cúcuta to export their products to the United States, registering their products as if they were Colombian, a strategy that would allow them to export without paying certain tariffs. For that reason, Cúcuta is expected to become an industrial city.[ref]
