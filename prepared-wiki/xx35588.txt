The [tpl]Convert|75|m|abbr=on[/tpl] Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree is situated within the park and was pegged in 1988 as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations.

The Warren River flows through the park along with many smaller creeks and gullies. The river is plentiful in trout and marron which can be caught in season.
