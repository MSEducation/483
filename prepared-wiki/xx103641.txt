[[Caterpillar 740 Ejector]]

CATEGORIES: Caterpillar Inc. vehicles, Trucks

The Caterpillar 740 Ejector Articulated Truck is Caterpillar's second generation of articulated haulers (dump truck) to have a system that pushes material out the back of the body.  It is the largest articulated haul truck offered by Caterpillar; larger trucks use a rigid frame system.  The ejector uses a 4-cylinder hydraulic ram and blade to dump the material out, a similar system to Cat's wheel tractor-scrapers.  The 740 Ejector is sold as separate model from the usual 740.
Total power is 436 hp (325 kW), total operating weight is 162,280 lb (73,610 kg), with the load being 42 short tons (38 tonnes), 37.3 yd3 (28.5 m3) at a 1:1 heap. Top forward speed is 34 mph (55 km/h).

==History==

Caterpillar introduced an ejector version of its D400E in 2001.  In 2002/2003, the DX00 series of trucks were replaced with the 7XX range.  Currently Caterpillar supplies 725, 730, 730 Ejector, 735, 740 and 740 Ejector versions.  The 7XX truck series uses the same cab design across all types. These are all manufactured in the UK.
