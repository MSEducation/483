===Mascot and nickname===

The university's teams are nicknamed the "Tar Heels," in reference to the state's eighteenth century prominence as a tar and pitch producer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.unc.edu/article.aspx?sid=3516|title=What's in a Name? Why We're All Called Tar Heels|last=Powell|first=William, S.|year=1982|publisher=UNC General Alumni Association|accessdate=May 21, 2008[/tpl] The nickname's cultural relevance, however, has a complex history that includes anecdotal tales from both the American Civil War and the American Revolution. The mascot is a live Dorset ram named Rameses, a tradition that dates back to 1924, when the team manager brought a ram to the annual game against Virginia Military Institute, inspired by the play of former football player Jack "The Battering Ram" Merrit. The kicker rubbed his head for good luck before a game-winning field goal, and the ram stayed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/trads/unc-trads-mascot.html|title=The Ram as Mascot|work=North Carolina Tar Heels Official Athletic Site|publisher=UNC Athletic Department|year=2006|accessdate=May 18, 2008[/tpl] There is also an anthropomorphic ram mascot who appears at games.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/147395/|title=UNC Mascot "Rameses" Killed|date=February 25, 1996|location=Raleigh, NC|publisher=WRAL|accessdate=May 21, 2008[/tpl] The modern Rameses is depicted in a sailor's hat, a reference to a United States Navy flight training program that was attached to the university during World War II.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncnrotcaa.org/history.php|title=History of NROTC at the University of North Carolina|year=2008|publisher=UNC Naval ROTC Alumni Association|accessdate=May 18, 2008[/tpl]

===Rivalries===

The South's Oldest Rivalry between North Carolina and its first opponent, the University of Virginia, was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1122productions.com/rivalries/most-played.html|title=Most-Played Rivalries|accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl] The 117th meeting in football between the two teams was in September 2012.
One of the fiercest rivalries is with Durham's Duke University. Located only eight miles from each other, the schools regularly compete in both athletics and academics. The Carolina-Duke rivalry is most intense, however, in basketball.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/richard_deitsch/06/22/media.623/index.html|title=HBO probes Carolina-Duke rivalry|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|work=Media Circus|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=June 23, 2008[/tpl] With a combined nine national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for the past thirty years. The rivalry has been the focus of several books, including Will Blythe's To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever and was the focus of the HBO documentary Battle for Tobacco Road: Duke vs Carolina.[tpl]cite web|title=HBO.com|url=http://www.hbo.com/sports/battle-for-tobacco-road-duke-vs-carolina/index.html|accessdate=November 14, 2011[/tpl]
Carolina holds an intense in-state rivalry with fellow Tobacco Road school, North Carolina State University. While attention shifted to Duke following a decline in NC State's basketball program since the 1980s, the rivalry is still held as one of the most bitter in the state. Combined, the two schools hold seven NCAA Championships and 27 ACC Championships in basketball. Students from each school often exchange pranks before basketball and football games.[tpl]cite news|url=http://media.www.technicianonline.com/media/storage/paper848/news/2006/11/16/News/Ram-Roast.Deters.Tar.Heel.Blue.Tunnel-2463417.shtml|title=Ram Roast deters Tar Heel blue tunnel|last=Blakely|first=Kyle|date=November 16, 2006|location=Raleigh, NC|work=Technician|accessdate=June 28, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2008/02/21/University/Campus.Awakes.To.A.Red.Old.Well-3224421.shtml|title= Campus awakes to a red Old Well|last= Tovar|first= Sergio|date= February 21, 2008|location=Chapel Hill, NC|work=The Daily Tar Heel|accessdate=May 18, 2008[/tpl]

===Rushing Franklin===

While students previously held "Beat Duke" parades on Franklin Street before sporting events,http://www.dailytarheel.com/news/features/30_years_at_sutton_s today students and sports fans have been known to spill out of bars and dormitories upon the victory of one of Carolina's sports teams.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/accnow/the-scene-from-franklin-street|title=The scene from Franklin Street (February 12, 2009)[/tpl] In most cases, a Franklin Street "bonfire" celebration is due to a victory by the men's basketball team,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/264/story/549933.html|title=News and Observer: Bonfires mark Tar Heels' win (March 5, 2007)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/441142.html|title=News and Observer: Radical changes for Chapel Hill celebrations[/tpl] although other Franklin Street celebrations have stemmed from wins by the women's basketball team and women's soccer team. The first known student celebration on Franklin Street came after the 1957 men's basketball team capped their perfect season with a National Championship victory over the Kansas Jayhawks.[tpl]cite web|last=Magill |first=Samuel |url=http://www.chapelhillnews.com/2008/03/17/13289/basketball-flavors-franklin-street.html |title=Basketball flavors Franklin Street celebrations |publisher=chapelhillnews.com |date=March 17, 2008 |accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl] From then on, students have flooded the street after important victories. After a Final Four victory in 1981 and the men's basketball team won the 1982 NCAA Championship, Franklin Street was painted blue by the fans who had rushed the street. This event has led local vendors to stop selling Carolina blue paint as the Tar Heels near the national championship.

===School colors===

Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been Carolina blue also known as "baby blue" and white.[tpl]cite book|last=Sumner|first=Jim L.|title=A History of Sports in North Carolina|publisher=Division of Archives and History, NC Department of Cultural Resources|location=Raleigh, NC|year=1990|page=35|isbn=0-86526-241-1 [/tpl] The colors were chosen years before by the Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies, the oldest student organization at the university. The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the "Di"s were from the western part of North Carolina while the "Phi"s were from the eastern part of the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/cr/archive/2006_03.pdf|title=Culture Corner: Di-Phi: The Oldest Organization |date=March 2006|page=13|accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl]
Society members would wear a blue or white ribbon at university functions, and blue or white ribbons were attached to their diplomas at graduation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/cr/archive/2006_03.pdf|title=Culture Corner: Di-Phi: The Oldest Organization|page=13|accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl] On public occasions, both groups were equally represented, and eventually both colors were used by processional leaders to signify the unity of both groups as part of the university.[tpl]cite book|last=Coates|first=Alfred|coauthors=Coates, Gladys Hall|title=The Story of Student Government in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill|year=1985|isbn= |asin= B00070WQNC[/tpl] When football became a popular collegiate sport in the 1880s, the UNC football team adopted the light blue and white of the Di-Phi Societies as the school colors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/trads/unc-trads-colors.html|title=School Colors|accessdate=April 5, 2008|year=2008|work=North Carolina Tar Heels Official Athletic Site|publisher=UNC Athletic Department[/tpl]

===School songs===

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic games are the university fight songs "I'm a Tar Heel Born" and "Here Comes Carolina".[tpl]cite web|title=UNC School Songs|work= North Carolina Tar Heels Official Athletic Site|publisher=UNC Athletic Department|year=2006|url=http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/trads/unc-trads-songs.html|accessdate=July 9, 2008 [/tpl] The fight songs are often played by the bell tower near the center of campus, as well as after major victories. "I’m a Tar Heel Born" originated in the late 1920s as a tag to the school's alma mater, "Hark The Sound". "Hark the Sound" was usually played at the end of games, but as of late it has been played at the beginning of games as well.

The University is also noted for its Campus Y, the social justice hub on campus that houses many service and internationally focused organizations. The Campus Y was founded in 1859, and is noted as a "leader in on-campus discussion and dialogue and off-campus service and activism". The Campus Y was at the center of many progressive movements within the university, including the racial integration of the student body, the effort to improve wages and working conditions for University employees,and the establishment of the Sonja Haynes Stones Center for Black Culture and History. The Y is a collection of many UNC specific and outside organizations, such as Carolina Kickoff, STAND, Nourish International, Carolina Microfinance Initiative, Homeless Outreach & Poverty Eradication (HOPE), and Project Literacy.
