"Love Will Find a Way" is a song by American rock group Pablo Cruise, from its album Worlds Away in 1978. It was released as a single and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The song received a considerable amount of airplay during the summer of 1978, prompting critic Robert Christgau to say, "Hear David Jenkins sing 'once you get past the pain' fifty times in a day and the pain will be permanent", referring to the lyrics of the chorus.http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=pablo+cruise
The song has most recently been used on CBS' period-drama Swingtown, at the end of episode 2, "Love Will Find a Way" (creating something of an anachronism, as the episode was set in 1976, two years before the song was released).
