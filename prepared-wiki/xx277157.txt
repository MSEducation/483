[[Maunch]]

CATEGORIES: Heraldic charges

A maunch (French manche "sleeve") is a heraldic charge representing a (detachable) lady's sleeve, originally representing part of the wardrobe in 13th to 14th-century fashion.
The charge is comparatively frequent in early (13th to 14th century) heraldry, but becomes unfamiliar in classical heraldry of the Early Modern period.
