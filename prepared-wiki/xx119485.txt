Richfield High School is the only public traditional high school in Richfield, Minnesota, and also the only public high school in the area that is a college preparatory school. Richfield, MN, a suburb of Minneapolis located directly south of the Minneapolis city limits.   The school, administered by Richfield Public Schools, has a total enrollment of about 1,500 students in grades 9-12.
Continuing in 2005, an effort towards realism regarding credits for students, a brand new policy has been introduced by the administration: the number of credits a student has affects their academic grade level.  Under the new system, if a student has less than eight credits, they are designated automatically as a part of the freshman class, regardless of age.
Also introduced in 2005 was the "Spartan Crew", a team primarily consisting of seniors for the purpose of orienting new freshmen and easing the transition between middle school and high school. This program is comparable to "link programs" currently in place at other area high schools. Each member of the Spartan Crew is in charge of 3-10 freshman, who become that senior's "crew".  The administration hopes that this new system will be more effective and cost-efficient than the "freshman retreats" of the past.
