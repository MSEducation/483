While posted to Kosovo, Blunt was introduced to the work of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or "Doctors Without Borders"). Since then, Blunt has been an active supporter of MSF by holding meet-and-greet auctions at many of his concerts, and filming the documentary Return to Kosovo, in which he visited the people and places he had encountered while stationed there.[tpl]cite web |title=James Blunt wraps up 'Beautiful' year |url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/news/article/?articleId=atlnewsarticle35800031 |publisher=Atlantic Records |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=4 October 2009[/tpl] Blunt is a patron of Help for Heroes, a charity aiming to raise money to provide better facilities for wounded British soldiers.

==Early life==

James Blunt was born at an army hospital in Tidworth, Wiltshire, England; the first child born to Jane A.F. ([tpl]née[/tpl] Amos) and Charles Blount. James spent his early childhood living in England, Cyprus and Germany, where his father, a colonel in the British Army Air Corps,[tpl]London Gazette|issue=56261|supp=yes |startpage=7807|date=3 July 2001|accessdate=12 February 2008[/tpl] and military helicopter pilot, was posted at various times.[tpl]cite news |authorlink= Austin Scaggs |title= The Blunt Life|work=Rolling Stone Magazine |publisher=Wenner Media LLC (Jann S. Wenner) |pages=56–58, 88 |date= 4 October 2007[/tpl]
The Blount family has a long history of military service, supposedly dating from the 10th century.[tpl]cite news |first= David|last= Thomas|title=To be blunt, James, you are a trooper |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/08/01/bmblunt01.xml |work=The Sunday Telegraph | date= 1 August 2005 |accessdate=29 December 2007 | location=London[/tpl] His father inculcated in him a love of flying, and he earned his pilot's licence at age 16. He has a keen interest in motorcycles after learning to ride when he was 16.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/features/article729454.ece The Sunday Times February 2006

==Education==

Blunt was enrolled at Elstree School in Woolhampton in Berkshire, before continuing to Harrow School in Harrow on the Hill in north-west London (Elmfield House) on an army bursary. From Harrow School he gained an army-sponsored place at the University of Bristol, where he first studied aerospace manufacturing engineering and then subsequently moved on to the study of sociology. He graduated with a BSc in sociology in 1996.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.alumni.bris.ac.uk/publications/intouch/intouch-aut05.pdf|format=PDF|title= In Touch. (newsletter) |publisher=University of Bristol Alumni Association |page=2 |date= Autumn 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl]

==Military service==

Because the British Army sponsored his university education, Blunt was obliged to serve a minimum of four years in the armed forces. He stated on an interview in his Back to Bedlam sessions that he chose to join the military as "his father was pushing for it, so that Blunt could obtain a secure work placement and income". Blunt trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=54899|supp=yes|startpage=10720|date=22 September 1997|accessdate=12 February 2008[/tpl] He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Life Guards, a unit of the Household Cavalry, where he rose to the rank of captain.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=55776|supp=yes |startpage=2269|date=28 February 2000|accessdate=12 February 2008[/tpl] One of his first assignments was to the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Alberta, Canada, where his regiment was posted for six months in 1998 to act as the opposing army in combat training exercises.[tpl]cite web | title = Household Cavalry, Brief regimental history | url =http://www.householdcavalry.info/hcr1992.htm | accessdate =1 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911122708/http://www.householdcavalry.info/hcr1992.htm |archivedate = 11 September 2007[/tpl]
In 1999, he served as an armoured reconnaissance officer in the NATO deployment in Kosovo. Initially assigned to reconnaissance of the Republic of Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, Blunt and his unit worked ahead of the front lines directing forces and targeting Serb positions for the NATO bombing campaign. His unit was given the assignment of securing the Pristina International Airport in advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force; however the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. American NATO commander Wesley Clark ordered that Blunt's unit forcibly take the airport from the Russian contingent. However, after Blunt queried the order, Mike Jackson, Blunt's superior officer, and Blunt himself refused to comply fearing greater consequences, with Jackson stating that they were "not going to start the Third World War" for Clark.[tpl]cite news|last=Peck |first=Tom |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/how-james-blunt-saved-us-from-world-war-3-2134203.html |title=How James Blunt saved us from World War 3 - News - People |publisher=The Independent |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport |date=9 March 2000|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1561897/General-Sir-Mike-Jackson-speaks-out.html|title=General Sir Mike Jackson speaks out|last=Grice|first=Elizabeth|date=1 September 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=5 March 2010[/tpl] The airport would eventually be shared peacefully by Blunt's unit and the Russians. There were less intense moments during Blunt's Kosovo assignment. Blunt had brought along his guitar, strapped to the outside of his tank.  At some places, the peacekeepers would share a meal with hospitable locals, and Blunt would perform. It was while on duty there that he wrote the song "No Bravery".[tpl]cite news |first=Dan |last=Epstein |title=Rocket Man |work=Guitar World Acoustic Magazine|publisher=Guitar World|pages=34–41 |date=June 2006[/tpl]
A keen skier, Blunt captained the Household Cavalry alpine ski team in Verbier, Switzerland, eventually becoming champion skier of the entire Royal Armoured Corps. He had extended his military service in November 2000,[tpl]London Gazette|issue=56034|supp=yes |startpage=13081|date=21 November 2000|accessdate=12 February 2008[/tpl] and after an intensive six-month army riding course was posted to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment in London, England.

==Music career==

===Early career===

Blunt had piano and violin lessons as a child, but his first significant exposure to popular music was at Harrow School. There, he was introduced to the guitar by a fellow student, and started playing the instrument and writing songs at age 14.[tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Neal |title=Back from Bedlam|work=Performing Songwriter|publisher=Performing Songwriter Enterprises, LLC |pages=56–60 |date=November 2007[/tpl] At University of Bristol, his undergraduate thesis was The Commodification of Image – Production of a Pop Idol; one of his main references for the thesis was Simon Frith, a sociologist and rock critic, and chair of the Mercury Music Prize panel of judges since 1992.[tpl]cite news |first=Johnny |last=Davis |title= Where did it all go Wrong?|work=Q Magazine |publisher=EMAP Metro Ltd|pages= 54–58|date=October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Staff Profile (Simon Frith)|publisher = University of Edinburgh|url =http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/edinburgh-college-art/music/staff/academic-staff?person_id=24&cw_xml=profile.php | accessdate = 25 August 2013[/tpl] While still in the army Blunt would work on demos during his time off. A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact Elton John's manager Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house. Interland told HitQuarters that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and after hearing the track 'Goodbye My Lover', pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_InterlandT.html |title=Interview with Todd Interland |publisher=HitQuarters|date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=24 Jun 2012[/tpl]
Blunt left the British Army in 2002 so that he could pursue his musical career. It was at that period that he started using the stage name "Blunt", in part to make it easier for others to spell; "Blount" is pronounced the same way, and remains his legal surname.[tpl]cite news|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|title=Q&A|work=Rolling Stone Magazine |publisher=Wenner Media LLC (Jann S. Wenner)|page=28| date=9 February 2006[/tpl] Shortly after leaving the army, he was signed to EMI music publishers, and to Twenty-First Artists management.[tpl]cite news |first= Michael |last= Poletta |title= James Blunt – Beautiful and the Beat |work=Billboard |publisher=Neilsen Business Media |pages=26–29|date= 21 July 2007[/tpl] A record contract remained elusive, with recording label executives pointing to Blunt's posh speaking voice as a barrier in class-divided Britain. Linda Perry, who was just launching her own Custard Records label in early 2003, heard Blunt's promotional tape when visiting London, and soon after heard him perform live at the South by Southwest Music Festival. She made an offer to him the same night[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_LindaPerry.html|title=Interview with Linda Perry|work=HitQuarters.com|accessdate=5 January 2006[/tpl] and within a few days, Blunt signed a recording contract with Perry, and one month later he was in Los Angeles working with producer Tom Rothrock.[tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Neal |title=Linda Perry |work=Performing Songwriter|publisher=Performing Songwriter Enterprises, LLC |page= 74|date= January–February 2007[/tpl]

===Back to Bedlam: 2003–2006===

Blunt recorded Back to Bedlam in 2003 with producer Tom Rothrock at Rothrock's home studio, using session musicians and performing on many different instruments himself.[tpl]cite journal |title=Back to Bedlam album liner notes|publisher=Atlantic Records|date=October 2004[/tpl] While in Los Angeles, he lodged with actress Carrie Fisher, whom he had met through the family of a former girlfriend. Fisher was very supportive of Blunt's aspirations, suggesting the name of the album and providing use of a bathroom in her home for Blunt to record the song "Goodbye My Lover". Back to Bedlam was finally released in the UK in October 2004. Blunt's debut single in the UK was "High" (co-written with Ricky Ross of Deacon Blue). This song initially peaked below the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart, however after the subsequent success of "You're Beautiful" it finally made the Top 75 before eventually being re-released.[tpl]cite news |first= Margo |last=Whitmire |coauthors=Emmanuel Legrand |title=Blunt's Journey |work=Billboard |publisher=Neilsen Business Media |page=31 |date= 17 September 2005 [/tpl] The song was chosen to appear in a Vodafone commercial in Italy, and was a Top 10 hit in that country.
The debut album from the unknown Blunt initially attracted little critical attention, and there were no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. Blunt's lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray.[tpl]cite web | last =Allcock | first =Anthony | title =James Blunt at Rescue Rooms | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) | date =7 November 2004 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/08/entertainment_music_event_reviews_2004_11_james_blunt_feature.shtml | accessdate =10 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Mugan |title=James Blunt, 93 Feet East, London |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/james-blunt-93-feet-east-london-486079.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |publisher=Independent News & Media|date=10 January 2005 |accessdate=10 February 2008 [/tpl] In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and this time next year it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number 1 album, Brit Award and countless accolade's  will be his for the taking."[tpl]cite web|last=McCann|first =Alex|title= Katie Melua/James Blunt – The Lowry, Manchester|work=Design Magazine|date=7 March 2004|url=http://designermagazine.tripod.com/KatieMeluaLIVEREV1.html|accessdate =10 February 2008[/tpl] After release of the album, concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamesblunt.co.uk/archives/tourdates.html|title= Tour Dates Archive|work=Jamesblunt.co.uk|accessdate=31 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928120550/http://www.jamesblunt.co.uk/archives/tourdates.html |archivedate = 28 September 2007[/tpl] In March 2005, his second single, "Wisemen," was released.
Blunt's third single "You're Beautiful" was his break-out hit. The song debuted at number 12 in the UK, and rose all the way to the number one position six weeks after its debut. The song also received massive airplay in the UK, which helped propel Back to Bedlam to number one on the UK Albums Chart. The extensive airplay ultimately led to Blunt and his co-writers being awarded the Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work.[tpl]cite web| title =James Blunt's Coldplay at 2006 Ivor Novello Awards| publisher=LondonNet Inc.| date =6 May 2006| url =http://www.londonnet.co.uk/entertainment/2006/may/2206_20060526.php| accessdate =12 February 2008[/tpl] After the success of "You're Beautiful" in the UK, the song crossed over to mainland Europe, becoming one of the biggest hits of summer 2005 across the continent. In the US, "You're Beautiful" made its debut in the summer of 2005 on WPLJ, a prominent radio station in New York City, despite not having been released to radio yet. Once the song was released to radio stations in the fall of 2005, the song climbed into the Top 10 in three radio formats: Adult Contemporary Music, Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks, and Adult album alternative. Blunt became the first British artist to top the American singles chart in nearly a decade when his song "You're Beautiful" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2006; the last British artist to do so had been Elton John in 1997 with the song "Candle in the Wind 1997". "Goodbye My Lover" was released as the fourth UK single from the album in December 2005, and was later the second US single. The songs "High" and "Wisemen" were subsequently re-released in 2006. Blunt started off 2006 celebrating five Brit Award nominations, going on to win Best British male solo artist and Best pop act categories, having already started an 11-month tour that would take him around the world.[tpl]cite web| title = Kaiser Chiefs lead Brit Award nominations|work=NME |location=UK Magazine| publisher=IPC Media| date =10 January 2006| url =http://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/21923 | accessdate =12 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080104020802/http://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/21923  |archivedate = 4 January 2008[/tpl] On 31 August, Blunt won two awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, with "You're Beautiful" winning the award for Best Male Video.2006 MTV Video Music Awards Rock on the Net. Retrieved 4 December 2011
There was extensive promotion in the United States starting in late 2005, with Blunt making appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show and as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live.  Eight of the songs on the album were featured in television shows (The O.C., Grey's Anatomy and many more), films (Undiscovered), and advertising campaigns (Hilton Hotels, Sprint telecommunications) throughout 2005 and 2006. Blunt performed "You're Beautiful" at the 49th Grammy Awards in February 2007, dedicating the song to the late Ahmet Ertegün of Atlantic Records, but he did not win in any of the five categories for which he had received nominations (includes one for Best New Artist Grammy, but lost to Carrie Underwood).[tpl]cite web | title =49th Annual Grammy Awards Winners List| work=Grammy.com| publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | date =11 February 2007| url = http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx| accessdate =12 February 2008| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080207111523/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx | archivedate =7 February 2008[/tpl]

In 2005, Blunt performed in 90 live shows, mainly across the UK and Europe, ending the year supporting Jason Mraz in a North American tour. The "Back to Bedlam World Tour" started off in January 2006, covering cities in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, as well as three separate headline tours in North America, ending in November of that year. Not including promotional appearances, Blunt performed over 140 live shows in 2006.  He enjoys the touring experience, saying in July 2006 that he and his band were having the time of their lives going to new places every day.[tpl]cite news |first=William |last=Shaw |title= "You're Beautiful" got me Laid|work=Q Magazine |publisher=EMAP Metro Ltd|pages= 52–56|date=July 2006[/tpl]

The videos for all of Blunt's singles from Back To Bedlam feature symbolism and dark imagery. In the first video for "High", he is buried in a desert. In the first video for "Wisemen", he is kidnapped and taken hostage. In the video for "You're Beautiful", he alludes to suicide by jumping off a cliff into the sea. In the "Goodbye My Lover" video, he is the outsider in a love triangle, imagining the couple, a man and woman (played by Matt Dallas of Kyle XY and Mischa Barton of The O.C.) together. The re-release video for "High" features Blunt running in a forest. The re-release video for "Wisemen" has Blunt burning identification papers, and then walking through a forest while he is on fire.
Blunt appeared on an episode of Sesame Street which aired on 14 November 2007, singing about triangles to the tune of "You're Beautiful".[tpl]cite web | title =LiveDaily Interview: James Blunt| work=LiveDaily.com| publisher=IAC | date =27 September 2007| url =http://www.livedaily.com/news/12879.html| accessdate =1 November 2008[/tpl]

Weird Al has since made the song available as a free MP3 download on his website.
