Theodore John "Ted" Kaczynski ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|z|ɪ|n|s|k|i[/tpl] [tpl]respell|ka|ZIN|skee[/tpl], or [tpl]respell|ka|CHIN|skee[/tpl]; Polish: Kaczyński, pronounced [tpl]IPA-pol|kaˈt͡ʂɨȷ̃skʲi|[/tpl]; born May 22, 1942), also known as the "Unabomber," is an American mathematician and serial murderer. He is known for his wide-ranging social critiques, which opposed industrialism and modern technology.Kaczynski identified himself as an anarchist, although few anarchists accept this claim.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lDD1AXpeoW4C&pg=PA199&dq=kaczynski+anarchist#v=onepage&q=kaczynski%20anarchist&f=false |title=Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs, Social Movements, and Political Parties |quote=... claimed to be from 'the anarchist group calling ourselves FC |isbn=9780230620247 |author1=Gautney |first1=Heather |year=2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uvVqrhVDtp0C&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A New Understanding of Terrorism: Case Studies, Trajectories and Lessons Learned |quote=...

Kaczynski was born and raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois. While growing up in Evergreen Park he was a child prodigy, excelling academically from an early age. Kaczynski was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 16, where he earned an undergraduate degree.  He subsequently earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 at age 25. He resigned two years later.
While at Harvard, Kaczynski was among the twenty-two Harvard undergraduates used as guinea pigs in ethically questionable experiments conducted by Henry Murray.[tpl]cite book | last = Chase| first = Alston | title = Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist | publisher = W.

Among other purposes, Murray's experiments were focused on measuring people's reactions under extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray himself called "vehement, sweeping and personally abusive" attacks. Assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were the tools used to cause high levels of stress and distress. These experiments were conducted at Harvard University from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962[tpl]cite news | author = Chase A | date  = 2000-06-01 | title = Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber | publisher = The Atlantic Monthly | pages = 41–65 | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm [/tpl] and were part of the CIA-sponsored Project MKUltra experiments.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.counterpunch.org/ciashrinks.html | title = CIA Shrinks and LSD | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | date = 1999-10-18 | last = Cockburn | first = A |author2=St Clair J | publisher = CounterPunch [/tpl]
In 1971, he moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water, in Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/tedk.htm|title=Interview with Ted Kaczynski, Administrative Maximum Facility Prison, Florence, Colorado, USA|date=June 1999 |work=Earth First Journal!|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090318135703/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/tedk.htm|archivedate=March 18, 2009[/tpl] From 1978 to 1995, Kaczynski sent 16 bombs to targets including universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23. Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995 and promised "to desist from terrorism" if the Times or the Washington Post published his manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future (also called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization.
The Unabomber was the target of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's costliest investigations. Before Kaczynski's identity was known, the FBI used the title "UNABOM" (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's "Manifesto," which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/trialstory.htm |title=FBI Gives Reward to Unabomber's Brother |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=August 21, 1998 |author=Claiborne, William |accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl] Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity in order to avoid the death penalty, as Kaczynski did not believe he was insane.Glaberson, William.

When it became clear that his pending trial would entail national television exposure for Kaczynski, the court entered a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. He has been designated a "domestic terrorist" by the FBI. Some anarcho-primitivist authors, such as John Zerzan and John Moore, have come to his defense, while holding some reservations about his actions and ideas.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://lemming.mahost.org/johnmoore/fragments.htm |first=John |last=Moore |title=Beyond the Fragments – A reaction to Industrial Society and Its Future |work=Green Anarchist |volume=#51 |issue=Spring 1998[/tpl]http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm[tpl]dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/days/unabomber.php |title=crimethinc.com |publisher=crimethinc.com |date= |accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl]

==Early life==

Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942, in Evergreen Park, Illinois, to second-generation Polish Americans Wanda (née Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/kaczynski.html|title=Ancestry of Ted Kaczynski |publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] At nine months of age, Ted's body was covered in hives. He was placed in isolation in a hospital where visitors were not allowed, as doctors were unsure of the cause of the hives. He was treated several times at the hospital over an eight-month period. His mother wrote in March 1943, "Baby home from hospital and is healthy but quite unresponsive after his experience."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/fyi/school.tools/profiles/kaczynski/index.story.html |title=Ted Kaczynski: Evil man, or tortured soul? |publisher=cnn.com |date=November 28, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl]
Kaczynski attended grades one through eight in Evergreen Park District 124 Schools. As a result of testing conducted in the fifth grade, which determined he had an IQ of 167, he was allowed to skip the sixth grade and enroll in the seventh grade. Kaczynski described this as a pivotal event in his life. He recalled not fitting in with the older children and being subjected to their bullying. As a child, Kaczynski had a fear of people and buildings, and played beside other children rather than interacting with them. His mother was so worried by his poor social development that she considered entering him in a study for autistic children led by Bruno Bettelheim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paulcooijmans.com/psychology/unabombreport.html|title=Psychological Evaluation of Theodore Kaczynski |publisher=Paul Cooijmans|accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl]
He attended high school at Evergreen Park Community High School. Kaczynski excelled academically, but found the mathematics too simple during his sophomore year. Sometimes he would cut classes and write in his journal in his room. During this period of his life, Kaczynski became obsessed with mathematics, spending prolonged hours locked in his room practicing differential equations. Throughout secondary schooling, Kaczynski had far surpassed his classmates, able to solve advanced Laplace transforms before his senior year. He was subsequently placed in a more advanced mathematics class, yet still felt intellectually restricted. Kaczynski soon mastered the material and skipped the eleventh grade. With the help of a summer school course for English, he completed his high school education when he was 15 years old. He was encouraged to apply to Harvard University, and was subsequently accepted as a student beginning in 1958 at the age of 16. While at Harvard, Kaczynski was taught by famed logician Willard Van Orman Quine, scoring at the top of Quine's class with a 98.9% final grade.
He also participated in a personality assessment study conducted by Dr. Henry Murray, an expert on stress interviews. Students in Murray's study were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student. Instead, they were subjected to a "purposely brutalizing psychological experiment"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm|title=Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber|work=The Atlantic|date=June 2000|author=Chase, Alston|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] stress test, which was an extremely stressful, personal, and prolonged psychological attack. During the test, students were taken into a room and connected to electrodes that monitored their physiological reactions, while facing bright lights and a one-way mirror. Each student had previously written an essay detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations: the essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who would enter the room and individually belittle each student based in part on the disclosures they had made. This was filmed, and students' expressions of impotent rage were played back to them several times later in the study. According to author Alston Chase, Kaczynski's records from that period suggest he was emotionally stable when the study began. Kaczynski's lawyers attributed some of his emotional instability and dislike of mind control to his participation in this study.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/ciashrinks.html|title=CIA Shrinks & LSD|work=CounterPunch|date=October 18, 1999|author=Cockburn, Alexander|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Indeed, some have suggested that this experience may have been instrumental in Kaczynski's future actions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jun/28/|title=Oops|date=June 28, 2010|author=RadioLab[/tpl]

==Career==

Kaczynski graduated from Harvard University in 1962, at age 20, and subsequently enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned a PhD in mathematics. Kaczynski's specialty was a branch of complex analysis known as geometric function theory. His professors at Michigan were impressed with his intellect and drive. "He was an unusual person. He was not like the other graduate students", said Peter Duren, one of Kaczynski's math professors at Michigan. "He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth." "It is not enough to say he was smart", said George Piranian, another of his Michigan math professors. Kaczynski earned his PhD with his thesis entitled "Boundary Functions" by solving a problem[tpl]cite web|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=755308911&sid=1&Fmt=1&clientId=1564&RQT=309&VName=PQD|title=Boundary Functions [/tpl] so difficult that Piranian could not figure it out.[tpl]cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960404&slug=2322396|title=Unabomber Suspect Is Charged – Montana Townsfolk Showed Tolerance For `The Hermit'|work=The Seattle Times|date=April 6, 1996|author=Ostrom, Carol M.|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Maxwell Reade, a retired math professor who served on Kaczynski's dissertation committee, also commented on his thesis by noting, "I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in the country understood or appreciated it." In 1967, Kaczynski won the University of Michigan's $100 Sumner B. Myers Prize, which recognized his dissertation as the school's best in mathematics that year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7D91139F935A15756C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title= Prisoner of Rage – A special report.; From a Child of Promise to the Unabom Suspect |work=The New York Times|date=May 26, 1996|author=McFadden, Robert D. |accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] While a graduate student at Michigan, he held a National Science Foundation fellowship and taught undergraduates for three years. He also published two articles related to his dissertation in mathematical journals, and four more after leaving Michigan.[tpl]cite news|title=Meteoric Talent that Burned Out|work=Boston Globe|date=April 5, 1996|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8378920.html | accessdate=May 9, 2009|author=Howe, Peter J. and Dembner, Alice[/tpl]
In late 1967, Kaczynski became an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught undergraduate courses in geometry and calculus. He was also noted as the youngest professor ever hired by the university, but this position proved short-lived. Kaczynski received numerous complaints and low ratings from the undergraduates he taught. Many students noted that he seemed quite uncomfortable in a teaching environment, often stuttering and mumbling during lectures, becoming excessively nervous in front of a class, and ignoring students during designated office hours. Without explanation, he resigned from his position in 1969, at age 26. The chairman of the mathematics department, J. W. Addison, called this a "sudden and unexpected" resignation,[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DC1339F936A35757C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title=On the Suspect's Trail: the Suspect; Memories of His Brilliance, And Shyness, but Little Else |work=The New York Times|date=April 5, 1996|author=Perez-Pena, Richard |accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] while vice chairman Calvin Moore said that given Kaczynski's "impressive" thesis and record of publications, "He could have advanced up the ranks and been a senior member of the faculty today."[tpl]cite news|title=Kaczynski Ended Career in Math with no Explanation|work=Buffalo News|date=April 6, 1996|author=Morris, Willy[/tpl]

==Montana==

In mid-1969, Kaczynski moved into his parents' small residence in Lombard, Illinois. Two years later, he moved into a remote cabin he built himself just outside Lincoln, Montana where he lived a simple life on very little money, without electricity or running water.[tpl]cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Ted Kaczynski|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/kaczynski.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011[/tpl] Kaczynski worked odd jobs and received financial support from his family, which he used to purchase his land and, without their knowledge, would later use to fund his bombing campaign. In 1978, he worked briefly with his father and brother at a foam-rubber factory, where he was fired by his brother, David, for harassing a female supervisor he had previously dated who had refused him as a boyfriend for not 'sharing much in common'.
Kaczynski's original goal was to move out to a secluded place and become self-sufficient so that he could live autonomously. He began to teach himself survival skills such as tracking, edible plant identification, and how to construct primitive technologies such as bow drills. He quickly realized that it was not possible for him to live that way, as a result of watching the wild land around him get destroyed by development and industry. He performed isolated acts of sabotage and initially targeted the developments near his cabin. The ultimate catalyst which drove him to begin his campaign of bombings was when he went out for a walk to one of his favorite wild spots, only to find that it had been destroyed and replaced with a road. About this, he said:
He began dedicating himself to reading about sociology and books on political philosophy, such as the works of Jacques Ellul, and also stepped up his campaign of sabotage. He soon came to the conclusion that more violent methods would be the only solution to what he saw as the problem of industrial civilization. He says that he lost faith in the idea of reform, and saw violent collapse as the only way to bring down the techno-industrial system. Regarding his switch from being a reformer of the system to developing a means of taking it down, he said:

==Bombings==

===Initial bombings===

Kaczynski's activities came to the attention of the FBI in 1978 with the explosion of his first, primitive homemade bomb. Over the next 17 years, he mailed or hand-delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated explosive devices that killed three people and injured 23 more.
The first mail bomb was sent in late May 1978 to materials engineering professor Buckley Crist at Northwestern University. The package was found in a parking lot at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with Crist's return address. The package was "returned" to Crist, but when Crist received the package, he noticed that it was not addressed in his own handwriting. Suspicious of a package he had not sent, he contacted campus policeman Terry Marker, who opened the package, which exploded immediately. Marker required medical assistance at Evanston Hospital for injuries to his left hand.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=July 5, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/unabomber/chronology/chron_7882.html|title=The Unabomber: A Chronology (1978–1982) |publisher=Court TV [/tpl]
The bomb was made of metal that could have come from a home workshop. The primary component was a piece of metal pipe, about [tpl]convert|1|in[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|9|in[/tpl] long. The bomb contained smokeless explosive powders, and the box and the plugs that sealed the pipe ends were handcrafted from wood. In comparison, most pipe bombs usually use threaded metal ends sold in many hardware stores. Wooden ends lack the strength to allow significant pressure to build within the pipe, explaining why the bomb did not cause severe damage. The primitive trigger device that the bomb employed was a nail, tensioned by rubber bands designed to slam into six common match heads when the box was opened. The match heads would burst into flame and ignite the explosive powders. When the trigger hit the match heads, only three ignited. A more efficient technique, later employed by Kaczynski, was to use batteries and heat filament wire to ignite the explosives faster and more effectively.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 6, 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DF1E39F935A25757C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title=Cabin's Inventory Provides Insight |work=The New York Times|date=April 16, 1996|author=Johnston, David [/tpl]
The initial 1978 bombing was followed by bombs sent to airline officials, and in 1979 a bomb was placed in the cargo hold of American Airlines Flight 444, a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C. The bomb began smoking, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. Some passengers were treated for smoke inhalation. Only a faulty timing mechanism prevented the bomb from exploding. Authorities said it had enough power to "obliterate the plane."
As bombing an airliner is a federal crime in the United States, the FBI became involved after this incident and derived the code name UNABOM (UNiversity and Airline BOMber). U.S. Postal Inspectors, who initially had the case, called the suspect the Junkyard Bomber because of the material used to make the mail bombs. In 1979, an FBI-led task force that included the ATF and U.S. Postal Inspection Service was formed to investigate the case. The task force grew to more than 150 full-time investigators, analysts, and others. This team made every possible forensic examination of recovered components of the explosives and studied the lives of victims in minute detail. These efforts proved of little use in identifying the suspect, who built his bombs essentially from "scrap" materials available almost anywhere. The victims, investigators later learned, were chosen irregularly from library research.
In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, working with agents in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a psychological profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 in favor of an alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic.[tpl]cite web|author= Franks, Lucinda|title=Don't Shoot|work=The New Yorker|date=July 22, 1996|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1996/07/22/1996_07_22_026_TNY_CARDS_000375118|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1 million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=February 4, 2009|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81530F934A35753C1A965958260&pagewanted=all|title= Clue and $1 million Reward In Case of the Serial Bomber |work=The New York Times|date=October 7, 1993|author=Labaton, Stephen [/tpl]

===Casualties===

The first serious injury occurred in 1985, when John Hauser, a graduate student and Captain in the United States Air Force, lost four fingers and vision in one eye.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/unabomber/chronology/chron_8587.html|title=The Unabomber: A Chronology (1985–1987)|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] The bomb, like others of Kaczynski's, was handcrafted and made with wooden parts.[tpl]cite news|title=Kaczynski Beard May Confuse Witness|work=The Washington Post|date=April 11, 1996|author=Claiborne, William|page=A11[/tpl]
Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old California computer store owner, was killed in 1985 by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. A similar attack against a computer store occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah on February 20, 1987. The bomb, which was disguised as a piece of lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would play a vital role in Ted's looming capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's being involved in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Ted was detained in 1996. David Kaczynski and Wright have remained friends and occasionally speak together publicly about their relationship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/06/unabomber.brother/index.html|title= Unabomber's brother, victim forge unique friendship|publisher=CNN|date=June 6, 2008|author=Lavandera, Ed|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl]
After a six-year break, Kaczynski struck again in 1993, mailing a bomb to David Gelernter, a computer science professor at Yale University. Though critically injured, Gelernter eventually recovered. Another bomb mailed in the same weekend was sent to the home of Charles Epstein from the University of California, San Francisco, who lost multiple fingers upon opening it. Kaczynski then called Gelernter's brother, Joel Gelernter, a behavioral geneticist, and told him, "You are next."[tpl]cite news | first=Elizabeth | last=Shogren | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Mail Bomb Attack Leaves Yale Computer Scientist in Critical Condition | date=June 25, 1993 | publisher= | url =http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-25/news/mn-7044_1_mail-bomb | work =The Los Angeles Times | pages = | accessdate = September 20, 2009 | language = [/tpl] Geneticist Phillip Sharp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also received a threatening letter two years later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/unabomber/chronology/chron_8895.html|title=The Unabomber: A Chronology (1988–1995)|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Kaczynski wrote a letter to The New York Times claiming that his "group", called FC, was responsible for the attacks.
In 1994, Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas J. Mosser was killed by a mail bomb sent to his North Caldwell, New Jersey home. In another letter to The New York Times Kaczynski claimed that FC "blew up Thomas Mosser because ... Burston-Marsteller[tpl]sic[/tpl] helped Exxon clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident" and, more importantly, because "its business is the development of techniques for manipulating people's attitudes."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/unabomber/transcripts/012298.html|title=U.S. v. Kaczynski Trial Transcripts |publisher=Court TV|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] This was followed by the 1995 murder of Gilbert Murray, president of the timber industry lobbying group California Forestry Association, by a mail bomb addressed to previous president William Dennison, who had retired.
In all, 16 bombs—which injured 23 people and killed three—were attributed to Kaczynski. While the devices varied widely through the years, all but the first few contained the initials "FC". Inside his bombs, certain parts carried the inscription "FC", which Kaczynski later asserted stood for "Freedom Club". Latent fingerprints on some of the devices did not match the fingerprints found on letters attributed to Kaczynski. As stated in the FBI affidavit:
[tpl]quote|203. Latent fingerprints attributable to devices mailed and/or placed by the UNABOM subject were compared to those found on the letters attributed to Theodore Kaczynski. According to the FBI Laboratory no forensic correlation exists between those samples.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/casefiles/unabomber/documents/affidavit.html|title=Affidavit of Assistant Special Agent in Charge|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl][/tpl]
One of Kaczynski's tactics was leaving false clues in every bomb. He would make them hard to find deliberately to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials "FC" hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb. One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads "Wu—It works! I told you it would—RV". A more obvious clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 5, 2008|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,537856,00.html|title=The end of anon: literary sleuthing from Shakespeare to Unabomber |work=The Guardian|date=August 16, 2001 | location=London[/tpl] One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson’s novel Ice Brothers.
The FBI theorized that Kaczynski had a theme of nature, trees and wood in his crimes. He often included bits of tree branch and bark in his bombs. Targets selected included Percy Wood, Professor Leroy Wood Bearson and Thomas Mosser. Crime writer Robert Graysmith noted, "in the Unabomber's case a large factor was his obsession with wood."Graysmith, Robert Unabomber: A Desire to Kill (1997) Berkely Publishing ISBN 0-425-16725-9

Throughout the manuscript, produced on a typewriter without the capacity for italics, Kaczynski capitalizes entire words in order to show emphasis. He always refers to himself as either "we" or "FC" (Freedom Club), though there is no evidence that he worked with others. Donald Foster, who analyzed the writing at the request of Kaczynski's defense, notes that the manuscript contains instances of irregular spelling and hyphenation, as well as other consistent linguistic idiosyncrasies (which led him to conclude that it was indeed Kaczynski who wrote it).[tpl]cite journal| journal = Lingua Franca| year = 1998|pages = 29–39| title = The Bard's fingerprints| last = Crain|first = Craig [/tpl]
Industrial Society and Its Future begins with Kaczynski's assertion that "the Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."F.C. 1995, § Introduction The first sections of the text are devoted to discussion of the psychology of various groups—primarily leftists (viewed from a psychological stand point; which he describes as people who are over-socialized and having feelings of inferiority 9)—and of the psychological consequences for individual life within the "industrial-technological system", which has robbed contemporary humans of their autonomy, diminished their rapport with nature, and forced them "to behave in ways that are increasingly remote from the natural pattern of human behavior." The later sections speculate about the future evolution of this system, arguing that it will inevitably lead to the end of human freedom, call for a "revolution against technology", and attempt to indicate how that might be accomplished.

===Political and social views===

In his opening and closing sections, Kaczynski addresses Leftism as a movement and analyzes the psychology of leftists, arguing that they are "True Believers in Eric Hoffer's sense" who participate in a powerful social movement to compensate for their lack of personal power. He further claims that leftism as a movement is led by a particular minority of leftists whom he calls "oversocialized":
He goes on to explain how the nature of leftism is determined by the psychological consequences of "oversocialization". Kaczynski "attributes the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions." He further specifies the primary cause of a long list of social and psychological problems in modern society as the disruption of the "power process", which he defines as having four elements:
Kaczynski goes on to claim that "in modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the first and third groups, and the second group tends to consist increasingly of artificially created drives." Among these drives are "surrogate activities", activities "directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the 'fulfillment' that they get from pursuing the goal". He argues that these surrogate activities are not as satisfactory as the attainment of "real goals" for "many, if not most people".F.C. 1995, § Surrogate Activities
He claims that scientific research is a surrogate activity for scientists, and that for this reason "science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other standard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who provide the funds for research."F.C. 1995, § The Motives of Scientists
Kaczynski developed his philosophical ideas early in life, and up to the moment of the bombings, carried on an extensive on-going debate with his brother David. Ted identified strongly with positivism, meaning that he strongly believed in an objective reality and that through sensory experience and analysis of this, one can obtain authentic knowledge.
Kaczynski, throughout most of his earlier years (the 1960s, deconstructivism, a distrust of "the system", a desire for revolution) remained "the intellectual outsider" and considered himself more important than others.Alston Chase, A Mind for Murder – The Education of The Unabomber and the Origins of Modern Terrorism. ISBN 0-393-32556-3, p. 108 "'I tended to feel that I was a particularly important person and superior to most of the rest of the human race (an undated entry in his journal records.) It just comes to me as naturally as breathing to feel that I was someone special'"

====Perceived control methods====

As mentioned above, the result of the "disruption of the power process" is the primary cause of various maladies in society (e.g., crime, depression, etc.). Kaczynski maintains that rather than recognizing that humans currently live in "conditions that make them terribly unhappy," "the system" (i.e., industrial society) develops ways of controlling human responses to the overly stressful environment in which they find themselves.
The following are current examples (according to Kaczynski) of this trend:

===Historical views and predictions===

In the last sections of the manifesto, Kaczynski carefully defines what he means by freedomF.C. 1995, § The Nature of Freedom and provides an argument that it would "be hopelessly difficult ... to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom".F.C. 1995, § Industrial-Technological Society Cannot be Reformed He says that "in spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior the system to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings" and predicts that "if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down" and that "the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years." He gives various dystopian possibilities for the type of society which would evolve in the former case.F.C. 1995, § The Future He claims that revolution, unlike reform, is possible, and calls on sympathetic readers to initiate such revolution using two strategies: to "heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the likelihood that it will break down" and to "develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology".F.C. 1995, § Human Race At A Crossroads He gives various tactical recommendations, including avoiding the assumption of political power, avoiding all collaboration with leftists, and supporting free trade agreements in order to bind the world economy into a more fragile, unified whole.F.C. 1995, § Strategy

===Related works and influences===

As a critique of technological society, the manifesto echoed contemporary critics of technology and industrialization, such as John Zerzan, Herbert Marcuse, Fredy Perlman, Jacques Ellul (whose book The Technological Society was referenced in an unnamed Kaczynski essay, written in 1971),[tpl]cite book|title=Unnamed Essay|author= Kaczynski, Theodore|year=1971[/tpl] Lewis Mumford, and Neil Postman.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2009|url=http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Terrorism_militias/sale_unabomber.analysis|title=Unabomber's Secret Treatise |work=Nation|date=September 25, 1995|author=Sale, Kirkpatrick [/tpl] Its idea of the "disruption of the power process" similarly echoed social critics emphasizing the lack of meaningful work as a primary cause of social problems, including Lewis Mumford, Paul Goodman, and Eric Hoffer (whom Kaczynski explicitly references).F.C. 1995, § The danger of leftism The general theme was also addressed by Aldous Huxley in his dystopian novel Brave New World, which Kaczynski references.F.C. 1995, § Human suffering The ideas of "oversocialization" and "surrogate activities" recall Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents and his theories of rationalization and sublimation (the latter term being used three times in the manifesto, twice in quotes, to describe surrogate activities).[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 6, 2008|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983355,00.html|title=The Evolution of Despair |work=Time|date=August 28, 1995|author=Wright, Robert [/tpl]

Joy wrote that, although Kaczynski's actions were "murderous, and, in my view, criminally insane", that, "as difficult as it is for me to acknowledge, I saw some merit in the reasoning in this single passage.

Before the publication of the manifesto, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda to follow up on suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/whistleblowers/1160076.html|title=Programme 9: September 9, 2007|publisher=RTÉ Radio 1|date=September 9, 2007|author= Kaczynski, David|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] David Kaczynski was at first dismissive, but progressively began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. David Kaczynski browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to what was found in the Unabomber Manifesto.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 4, 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2DC1339F936A35757C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title=On the Suspect's Trail: the Investigation; Long and Twisting Trail Led To Unabom Suspect's Arrest |work=The New York Times|date=April 5, 1996|author=Johnston, David [/tpl]
Prior to the publishing of the manifesto, the FBI held numerous press conferences requesting the help of the public in identifying the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area (where he began his bombings), had worked or had some connection in Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s was associated with the San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information, as well as the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released prior to the entire manifesto being published, was what had persuaded David Kaczynski's wife, Linda, to urge her husband to read the manifesto.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 5, 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4D61339F934A35757C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title= Tapestry of Links in the Unabom Inquiry |work=The New York Times|date=April 7, 1996|author=Perez-Pena, Richard [/tpl]
After the manifesto was published, the FBI received over a thousand calls a day for months in response to the offer of a $1 million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. There were also large numbers of letters mailed to the UNABOM Task Force that purported to be from the Unabomber, and thousands of suspect leads were sifted through. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski first hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C. attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, like Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would likely react irrationally or violently.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 5, 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E3DB1039F933A25757C0A960958260&pagewanted=all|title= In Unabom Case, Pain for Suspect's Family |work=The New York Times | first=Pam | last=Belluck | date=April 10, 1996[/tpl]
In early 1996, former FBI hostage negotiator and criminal profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Tony Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt to compare the manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters as well as the manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.
In February 1996, Bisceglie provided a copy of the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI. At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, Supervisory Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings. Linguistic analysis determined that the author of the essay papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski’s life, that analysis provided the basis for a search warrant.
David Kaczynski had attempted to remain anonymous at the outset but he was swiftly identified, and within a few days, an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings with the team, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, so the use of postmark dates enabled the enhancement of the timeline of Ted Kaczynski's activities being developed by the Task Force. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, with whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=July 6, 2008|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E2DE1631F936A35756C0A96E958260&pagewanted=all|title= 17-Year Search, an Emotional Discovery and Terror Ends |work=The New York Times|date=May 5, 1998|author=Johnston, David [/tpl]
David Kaczynski had once admired and emulated his older brother, but had later decided to leave the survivalist lifestyle behind.[tpl]cite web | url=http://stephenjdubner.com/journalism/101899.html | title=I Don't Want To Live Long.

CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School District #231 was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records.  At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.
Paragraphs 204 and 205 of the FBI search and arrest warrant for Ted Kaczynski stated that "experts"—many of them academics consulted by the FBI—believed the manifesto had been written by "another individual, not Theodore Kaczynski". As stated in the affidavit, only a handful of people believed Kaczynski was the Unabomber before the search warrant revealed the cornucopia of evidence in Kaczynski's isolated cabin. The search warrant affidavit written by FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie reflects this conflict, and is striking evidence of the opposition to Turchie and his small cadre of FBI agents that included Moss and Puckett—who were convinced Kaczynski was the Unabomber—from the rest of the UNABOM Task Force and the FBI in general:

==Arrest==

FBI officers arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his remote cabin outside Lincoln, Montana, where he was found in an unkempt state. Combing his cabin, the investigators found a wealth of bomb components, 40,000 handwritten journal pages that included bomb-making experiments and descriptions of the Unabomber crimes; and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found what appeared to be the original typed manuscript of the manifesto.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/topten/unabomb/unabomb.index.html|title=Unabomber suspect is caught, ending eight-year man-hunt|publisher=CNN|year=1996|accessdate=January 25, 2009[/tpl] By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of one of the most expensive investigations in the FBI's history.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/unabomb/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060618112917/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/unabomb/|archivedate=June 18, 2006|title=The Unabomb Trial|publisher=CNN|year=1997|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl]
After his capture, Kaczynski was among the several individuals who had been suspected of being the unidentified Zodiac Killer. Among the links that raised suspicion were the fact that Kaczynski lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1967 to 1969 (the same period that most of the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in California), both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes, and both writing letters to newspapers demanding the publication of their words with the threat of continued violence toward others if the demand was not met. However, his whereabouts could not be verified for all of the killings, and the gun and knife murders committed by the Zodiac Killer differ from Kaczynski's bombings, so he was not further pursued as a suspect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/zodiac/38.html |title=TruTV.com |publisher=TruTV.com |date= |accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/shows/haunting_evidence/mysterious_ways.html |title=TruTV.com |publisher=TruTV.com |date= |accessdate=April 10, 2010[/tpl] Robert Graysmith of San Francisco, author of the 1986 book Zodiac, said the similarities are "fascinating" but undoubtedly purely coincidental.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/05/14/MN44704.DTL&type=printable|title=Kaczynski, Zodiac Killer – the Same Guy?|last1=Fagan|first1=Kevin|last2=Wallace|first2=Bill|date=May 14, 1996|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=December 5, 2009[/tpl]

David Kaczynski's attorney asked the former FBI agent who made the match between the Unabomber's manifesto and Kaczynski to ask for leniency—he was horrified to think that turning his brother in might result in his brother's death. Eventually, Kaczynski was able to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty to all the government's charges, on January 22, 1998. Later, Kaczynski attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing it was involuntary. Judge Garland Ellis Burrell Jr. denied his request.

The early hunt for the Unabomber in the United States portrayed a perpetrator far different from the eventual suspect.

On August 10, 2006, Judge Garland Burrell Jr. ordered that personal items seized in 1996 from Kaczynski's Montana cabin should be sold at a "reasonably advertised Internet auction." Items the government considers to be bomb-making materials, such as writings that contain diagrams and "recipes" for bombs, were excluded from the sale. The auctioneer paid the cost and kept up to 10% of the sale price, and the rest of the proceeds must be applied to the $15 million in restitution that Burrell ordered Kaczynski to pay his victims.[ref]

Included among Kaczynski's holdings which were auctioned are his original writings, journals, correspondences, and other documents allegedly found in his cabin (for example, a copy of Strunk & White's The Elements of StyleCatherine Prendergast: "The Fighting Style: Reading the Unabomber’s Strunk and White", College English, Volume 72, Number 1, September 2009.Jane Perrone: "Crime Pays", The Guardian News Blog, 27 July 2005.Rong-Gong Lin II and Wendy Lee: "Unabomber 'Murderabilia' for Sale", Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2005.). The judge ordered that all references in those documents that allude to any of his victims must be removed before they were sold. Kaczynski challenged those ordered redactions in court on First Amendment grounds, arguing that any alteration of his writings is an unconstitutional violation of his freedom of speech.
The auction concluded in June, 2011, and raised over $232,000.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/unabomber-online-auction/ | work=Wired | first=David | last=Kravets | title=Photo Gallery: Weird Government 'Unabomber' Auction Winds Down | date=June 2, 2011[/tpl]
