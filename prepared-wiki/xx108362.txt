Söderstadion (translated in English as Southern Stadium) is a football stadium in Stockholm, Sweden. It was opened in 1966 although there had already existed stadiums at the site, the earliest opened in 1918 under the name Johanneshovs Idrottsplats, and a first stadium with the current name was built in 1950. Söderstadion has a capacity of 15,600–16,197 depending on usage. Bandy was played at Söderstadion wintertime until 1989. The Bandy World Championship 1987 final was played herehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BGOz97JE_U&feature=related (2nd half of the video). The home team Hammarby, the 2010 Swedish champions, now plays at Zinkensdamm. The arena has also been used for ice hockey.
The current record attendance is 15,626 and was set 6 April 2004, when Hammarby IF faced Malmö FF.
Before the Stockholm municipal elections of 2006, the right wing parties of Stockholm stated that a new stadium would be built if the municipal elections were won. On June 28, 2007, plans for a new stadium were officially announced.[tpl]cite news |title=Hammarby will build new stadium |url=http://www.eufootball.biz/Stadia-Facilities/280607-Swedish-Hammarby-will-build-new-stadium.html |publisher=euFootball.BIZ |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2007-08-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713131116/http://www.eufootball.biz/Stadia-Facilities/280607-Swedish-Hammarby-will-build-new-stadium.html  |archivedate = 2007-07-13[/tpl] The last football game at Söderstadion was played on the 23rd of june 2013 when Hammarby IF played against Ängelholms FF in the 13th round of Superettan.

The stadium is mentioned by its old name in the movie My Life as a Dog (1985), where the main character tells the audience of a motorcycle accident that occurred during a motorcycle show performed there. The stadium is located just next to the Ericsson Globe. It is most easily reached from the Stockholm metro stations Gullmarsplan or Globen.
