[[Shoot Me Down]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 singles, Boy Kill Boy songs

"Shoot Me Down" was the fourth separate single to be released from Boy Kill Boy's debut album Civilian, and the sixth if you included the re-released singles. A portion of the royalties from the single went towards the War Child charity. It featured four new b-sides. The CD contained the Live Lounge cover of Nelly Furtado's "Maneater", while the 7"'s had new b-sides "Dukes Of John Moon" and "Repair".
The video is directed by Caswell Coggins, and is viewable on the band's MySpace. http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=1275503569
The single performed poorly in the chart entering at a low number 66, and then not charting the next week.
