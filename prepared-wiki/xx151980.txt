[[Peschardt's People]]

CATEGORIES: 2006 British television programme debuts, BBC World News programmes

Peschardt's People is a documentary television series, hosted by Michael Peschardt, that premiered on BBC World on 1 April 2006. In the series, Peschardt interviews famous and not so famous personalities from the Asia-Pacific region. In order to be featured in the series, Peschardt has said that his subjects "must have something extraordinary about their lives". The basic format of the show is that Peschardt's guests show him some of the places that are important to them: their favourite cities, their favourite beaches, their favourite restaurants, where they work, where they grew up, where they live. Each episode is filmed entirely on location. Although Peschardt has stated that he does not interview politicians, he later interviewed former Member of Parliament Georgina Beyer. More than 150 interviews have been broadcast since its launch.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/4473066.York_to_feature_in_BBC_s_Peschardt___s_People_TV_series/|title=BBC journalist Michael Peschardt in York to film Peschardt's People programme featuring Diane Wei Liang|last=Catton|first=Richard|date=3 July 2009|work=The Press|accessdate=7 March 2010[/tpl]
