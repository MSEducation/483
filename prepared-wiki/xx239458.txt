[[Foundationalism (international relations)]]

CATEGORIES: International relations theory

Foundationalism in international relations theory concerns whether beliefs about the world can be tested against objective procedures.  Foundationalists believe that all claims (about some features of the world) can be judged to be either true or false.Smith, Steve, Ownens Patrica, "Alternative approaches to international relations theory" in "The Globalisation of World Politics", Baylis, Smith and Owens, OUP, 4th ed, p177 Those who oppose this position are considered to be "anti-foundationalists".
