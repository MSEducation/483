A mycorrhiza (Gk. μυκός, mykós, "fungus" and  ριζα, riza, "roots",[tpl]Cite journal |first=A. B. |last=Frank |year=1885 |title=[tpl]lang|de|Über die auf Würzelsymbiose beruhende Ehrnährung gewisser Bäum durch unterirdische Pilze[/tpl] |journal=[tpl]lang|de|Berichte der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft[/tpl] |volume=3 |issue= |pages=128–145 [/tpl] pl. mycorrhizae or mycorrhizas) is a symbiotic (generally mutualistic, but occasionally weakly pathogenic) association between a fungus and the roots of a vascular plant.[tpl]Cite book |last=Kirk |first=P. M. |first2=P. F. |last2=Cannon |first3=J. C. |last3=David |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=J. |last4=Stalpers |year=2001 |title=Ainsworth and Bisby’s Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=9th |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, UK |isbn= [/tpl]
In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's roots, either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM), or extracellularly as in  ectomycorrhizal fungi. They are an important component of soil life and soil chemistry.

==Mutualist dynamics==

Mycorrhizae form a mutualistic relationship with the roots of most plant species. While only a small proportion of all species has been examined, 95% of those plant families are predominantly mycorrhizal.[tpl]Cite book |last=Trappe |first=J. M. |year=1987 |title=Phylogenetic and ecologic aspects of mycotrophy in the angiosperms from an evolutionary standpoint |work=Ecophysiology of VA Mycorrhizal Plants, G.R. Safir (EDS) |publisher=CRC Press |location=Florida [/tpl] They are named after their presence in the plant's rhizosphere (root system).

===Sugar-water/mineral exchange===

This mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose.[tpl]cite journal|author=Harrison MJ|year= 2005|title=Signaling in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis|journal=Annu Rev Microbiol.|volume=59|pages=19–42|pmid=16153162 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123749[/tpl] The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium's higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients due to the comparatively large surface area of mycelium: root ratio, thus improving the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.[tpl]cite journal|author=Selosse MA, Richard F, He X, Simard SW|year= 2006|title=Mycorrhizal networks: des liaisons dangereuses?|journal=Trends Ecol Evol.|volume=21|pages=621–628|pmid=16843567 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2006.07.003|issue=11[/tpl]
Plant roots alone may be incapable of taking up phosphate ions that are demineralized in soils with a basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access these phosphorus sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize.[tpl]cite journal|author=Li H, Smith SE, Holloway RE, Zhu Y, Smith FA.|year= 2006|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute to phosphorus uptake by wheat grown in a phosphorus-fixing soil even in the absence of positive growth responses|journal=New Phytol.|volume=172|pages=536–543|pmid=17083683 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01846.x|issue=3[/tpl] Nature, according to C.Michael Hogan, has adapted to this critical role of phosphate, by allowing many plants to recycle phosphate, without using soil as an intermediary. For example, in some dystrophic forests large amounts of phosphate are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake.C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

In some cases, the transport of water, carbon, and nutrients could be done directly from plant to plant through mycorrhizal networks that are underground hyphal networks created by mycorrhizal fungi that connect individual plants together.Simard, S.W.; Beiler, K.J.; Bingham, M.A.; Deslippe, J.R.; Philip, L.J. and Teste, F.P. 2012.

Suillus tomentosus, a fungus, produces specialized structures, known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae, with its plant host lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia).  These structures have in turn been shown to host nitrogen fixing bacteria which contribute a significant amount of nitrogen and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.

===Mechanisms===

The mechanisms of increased absorption are both physical and chemical. Mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root, and thus can explore a greater volume of soil, providing a larger surface area for absorption. Also, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi is different from that of plants (including organic acid excretion which aids in ion displacement[tpl]dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]). Mycorrhizas are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33b.htm |title=Botany online: Interactions - Plants - Fungi - Parasitic and Symbiotic Relations - Mycorrhiza |publisher=Biologie.uni-hamburg.de |accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl]

===Disease and drought resistance and its correlation to Mycorrhizae===

Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens. Prof. Dr. Anton Muhibuddin from University of Brawijaya (UB) - Indonesia found that AMF (Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Fungi) was significantly correlated with soil water content and soil chemical fertility variable such as, organic carbon, total phosphorus and CEC, however it was not significantly correlated with pH. AMF was also significantly correlated with soil biological fertility variable such as, soil fungi and soil bacteria, including soil disease. Furthermore, AMF was significantly correlated with soil physical variable, but only with water level and not with aggregate stability.,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/qnrwj34011g842p2/ |title=Abstract |publisher=SpringerLink |accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usask.ca/biology/kaminskyj/arctic.html |title=Dr. Susan Kaminskyj: Endorhizal Fungi |publisher=Usask.ca |accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl] and are also more resistant to the effects of drought.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/Faculty/davies/research/mycorrhizae.html |title=Dr. Davies Research Page |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last=Lehto |first=Tarja |year=1992 |title=Mycorrhizas and Drought Resistance of Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

===Colonization of barren soil===

Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients.Root fungi turn rock into soil Planet Earth Online 3 July 2009 The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in early succession or on degraded landscapes.[tpl]cite journal|author=Jeffries, P; Gianinazzi, S; Perotto, S; Turnau, K; Barea, J-M |year= 2003|title= The contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sustainable maintenance of plant health and soil fertility|journal=Biol.

Richardson |title=Ecology and biogeography of Pinus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |year=2000 |page=336 |isbn=0-521-78910-9[/tpl]

===Resistance to toxicity===

Fungi have been found to have a protective role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and contaminated soils. Pine trees inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth. One study discovered the existence of Suillus luteus strains with varying tolerance of zinc. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of Suillus bovinus conferred resistance to plants of Pinus sylvestris. This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.

==Occurrence of mycorrhizal associations==

At around 400 million years old, the Rhynie chert contains the earliest fossil assemblage yielding plants preserved in sufficient detail to detect mycorrhizas - and they are indeed observed in the stems of Aglaophyton major.
Mycorrhizas are present in 92% of plant families studied (80% of species), with arbuscular mycorrhizas being the ancestral and predominant form, and indeed the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the plant kingdom. The structure of arbuscular mycorrhizas has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record,[tpl]cite journal|author=Remy W, Taylor TN, Hass H, Kerp H |year=1994|title= 4 hundred million year old vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae|journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|volume=91|pages=11841–11843|pmid=11607500|doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.25.11841|issue=25|pmc=45331|bibcode=1994PNAS...9111841R[/tpl] with both the development of ectomycorrhizas, and the loss of mycorrhizas, evolving convergently on multiple occasions.

==Types of mycorrhiza==

Mycorrhizas are commonly divided into ectomycorrhizas and endomycorrhizas. The two types are differentiated by the fact that the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane.  Additionally, many plants in the order Ericales form a third type, ericoid mycorrhizas, while some members of the Ericales form arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhizas.Allen, Michael F. 1991. The ecology of mycorrhizae. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.Harley, J.L. and S.E. Smith 1983. Mycorrhizal symbiosis (1st ed.). Academic Press, London. All orchids are myco-heterotrophic at some stage during their lifecycle and form orchid mycorrhizas with a range of basidiomycete fungi.

===Endomycorrhiza===

Endomycorrhizas are variable and have been further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas.[tpl]Cite book |last=Peterson |first=R. L. |first2=H. B. |last2=Massicotte |lastauthoramp=yes |first3=L. H. |last3=Melville |year=2004 |url=http://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/books/books/9780660190877.html |title=Mycorrhizas: anatomy and cell biology |publisher=National Research Council Research Press |isbn=978-0-660-19087-7 [/tpl]  Arbuscular mycorrhizas, or AM (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, or VAM), are mycorrhizas whose hyphae enter into the plant cells, producing structures that are either balloon-like (vesicles) or dichotomously branching invaginations (arbuscules). The fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. the interior of the cell), but invaginate the cell membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them.
Arbuscular mycorrhizas are formed only by fungi in the division Glomeromycota. Fossil evidence and DNA sequence analysis[tpl]cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=L. |last2=Bousquet |first2=J. |last3=Lévesque |first3=R. C. |last4=Lalonde |first4=M. |author-separator=, |author-name-separator= |year=1993 |title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |issue=6424 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1038/363067a0 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S[/tpl] suggest that this mutualism appeared 400-460 million years ago, when the first plants were colonizing land. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are found in 85% of all plant families, and occur in many crop species. The hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce the glycoprotein glomalin, which may be one of the major stores of carbon in the soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have (possibly) been asexual for many millions of years and, unusually, individuals can contain many genetically different nuclei (a phenomenon called heterokaryosis).[tpl]cite journal |last1=Hijri |first1=M. |last2=Sanders |first2=IR. |year=2005 |title=Low gene copy number shows that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inherit genetically different nuclei |doi=10.1038/nature03069 |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7022 |pages=160–163 |pmid=15650740 |bibcode = 2005Natur.433..160H [/tpl]

===Ectomycorrhiza===

Ectomycorrhizas, or EcM, are typically formed between the roots of around 10% of plant families, mostly woody plants including the birch, dipterocarp, eucalyptus, oak, pine, and rose families, orchids,[tpl]cite web |url=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2011/07/12/orchids.and.fungi.an.unexpected.case.symbiosis |title=Orchids and fungi: An unexpected case of symbiosis|date=July 12, 2011 |work= |publisher=American Journal of Botany |accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl] and fungi belonging to the Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota. Some EcM fungi, such as many Leccinum and Suillus, are symbiotic with only one particular genus of plant, while other fungi, such as the Amanita, are generalists that form mycorrhizas with many different plants.  An individual tree may have 15 or more different fungal EcM partners at one time. Thousands of ectomycorrhizal fungal species exist, hosted in over 200 genera. A recent study has permitted to conservatively estimate global ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness around 7750 species, although, on the basis of estimates of knowns and unknowns in macromycete diversity, a final estimate of ECM species richness would likely be between 20000 and 25000.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Rinaldi |first1=A.C. |last2=Comandini |first2=O.|last3=Kuyper |first3=T.W. |year=2008 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity: separating the wheat from the chaff |journal=Fungal Diversity |volume=33 |pages=1–45|url=http://www.fungaldiversity.org/fdp/sfdp/33-1.pdf [/tpl]
Ectomycorrhizas consist of a hyphal sheath, or mantle, covering the root tip and a Hartig net of hyphae surrounding the plant cells within the root cortex. In some cases the hyphae may also penetrate the plant cells, in which case the mycorrhiza is called an ectendomycorrhiza. Outside the root, Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium forms an extensive network within the soil and leaf litter.
Nutrients can be shown to move between different plants through the fungal network. Carbon has been shown to move from paper birch trees into Douglas-fir trees thereby promoting succession in ecosystems.[tpl]cite journal |last=Simard |first=Suzanne W. |last2=Perry |first2=David A. |last3=Jones |first3=Melanie D. |last4=Myrold |first4=David D. |last5=Durall |first5=Daniel M. |last6=Molina |first6=Randy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Net transfer of carbon between ectomycorrhizal tree species in the field |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6642 |year=1997 |pages=579–582 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v388/n6642/full/388579a0.html |doi=10.1038/41557 [/tpl]  The ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor has been found to lure and kill springtails to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, Eastern White Pine inoculated with L. bicolor was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails.Fungi kill insects and feed host plants BNET.com[tpl]cite journal |last1=Klironomos |first1=J. N. |last2=Hart |first2=M. M. |year=2001 |title=Animal nitrogen swap for plant carbon |journal=Nature |volume=410 |issue=6829 |pages=651–652 |doi=10.1038/35070643 |pmid=11287942 [/tpl]
The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete  Laccaria bicolor, has been published.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=F. |year=2008 |title=The genome of Laccaria bicolor provides insights into mycorrhizal symbiosis |doi=10.1038/nature06556 |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7183 |pages=88–92 |pmid=18322534 |first2=A. |last3=Ahrén |first3=D. |last4=Brun |first4=A. |last5=Danchin |first5=E. G. J. |last6=Duchaussoy |first6=F. |last7=Gibon |first7=J. |last8=Kohler |first8=A. |last9=Lindquist |first9=E. |display-authors=2 |last2=Aerts |bibcode=2008Natur.452...88M[/tpl] An expansion of several multigene families occurred in this fungus, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication.  Laccaria bicolor is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast,  Laccaria bicolor possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots.

===Ericoid mycorrhiza===

Ericoid mycorrhizas are the third of the three more ecologically important types. They have a simple intraradical (grow in cells) phase, consisting of dense coils of hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don't extend very far into the surrounding soil. They might form sporocarps (probably in the form of small cups), but their reproductive biology is little understood.
Ericoid mycorrhizas have also been shown to have considerable saprotrophic capabilities, which would enable plants to receive nutrients from not-yet-decomposed materials via the decomposing actions of their ericoid partners.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Read |first=D.

==Discovery==

Associations of fungi with the roots of plants have been known since at least the mid-19th century. However early observers simply recorded the fact without investigating the relationships between the two organisms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rayner|first=M. Cheveley|title=Obligate Symbiosis in Calluna vulgaris|journal=Annals of Botany|year=1915|volume=29|issue=113|pages=97-134|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dMrzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=Mycorrhiza+Kamienski&hl=en&ei=n7lCTrW7J5PYiAKC4bmZAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Mycorrhiza%20Kamienski&f=false[/tpl] This symbiosis was studied and described by Franciszek Kamieński in 1879–1882.Kamieński, F. (1882). "Les organes végétatifs de Monotropa hypopitys L.". Mémoires de la Société nat. des Sciences naturelles et mathém. de Cherbourg, ser. 3, tom. 24. Further research was carried out by Albert Bernhard Frank, who introduced the term mycorrhiza in 1885.[tpl]cite journal | last = Frank |first=A.B. | year = 1885 | title = Über die auf Wurzelsymbiose beruhende Ernährung gewisser Bäume durch unterirdische Pilze | url = | journal = Ber.
