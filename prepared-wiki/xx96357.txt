[[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]]

CATEGORIES: Economic geology, Geology societies, Petroleum in the United States, Scientific societies

The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) is one of the world's largest professional geological societies with over 31,000 members as of 2007. The AAPG works to "advance the science of geology, especially as it relates to petroleum, natural gas, other subsurface fluids, and mineral resources; to promote the technology of exploring for, finding, and producing these materials in an economically and environmentally sound manner; and to advance the professional well-being of its members."AAPG website Mission Statement retrieved 14 March 2014 The AAPG was founded in 1917 and is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma; currently almost one-third of its members live outside the United States.
AAPG publishes the AAPG Explorer magazine and AAPG Bulletin scientific journal, holds an annual meeting including a technical conference and exhibition, sponsors other conferences and continuing education for members around the world such as ongoing Geosciences Technology Workshops, and provides various other services to its members. The organization also includes divisions focused on particular aspects of the profession.  These include the Division of Environmental Geosciences, Division of Professional Affairs, and the Energy and Minerals Division. The association membership has included Harrison "Jack" Schmitt, a U.S. astronaut who walked on the moon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.searchanddiscovery.net/documents/2004/schmitt/index.htm |title=Mining the Moon, by Harrison H.

==Awards==

At its annual conventions and international conferences AAPG recognizes the distinguished contributions in the field of petroleum geosciences with various awards, including the Sidney Powers Memorial Award, Michel T. Halbouty Outstanding Leadership Award, Grover E. Murray Memorial Distinguished Educator Award, Wallace Pratt Memorial Award, and Ziad Rafiq Beydoun Memorial Award.AAPG Awards The AAPG IBA award is given immediately following the IBA competition that is held at that year's annual convention.

===AAPG IBA (Imperial Barrel Award)===

AAPG promotes student involvement in the profession by holding an annual Imperial Barrel Award competition where geoscience graduate students are encouraged to explore a career in the energy industry. In this global competition, university teams analyze a dataset (geology, geophysics, land, production infrastructure, and other relevant materials) and deliver their results in a 25 minute presentation. The students' presentations are judged by industry experts, providing the students a real-world, career-development experience.AAPG IBA official website
IBA offers students and their faculty advisor a chance to win accolades for themselves and cash prizes for their schools, and winning teams travel free to the annual AAPG convention to network with both future colleagues and future employers.

==Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America==

The Correlation of Stratigraphic Units of North America (COSUNA) was a project of the AAPG which resulted in the publication of sixteen correlation charts depicting modern concepts of the stratigraphy of North America.

==Global warming controversy==

In 2006 the AAPG was criticized for selecting Michael Crichton for their Journalism Award for Jurassic Park and "for his recent science-based thriller State of Fear", in which Crichton exposed his skeptical view of global warming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aapg.org/explorer/2006/04apr/honorees.cfm|series=37 to be Honored in Houston|title=Journalism award[/tpl] Daniel P. Schrag, a geochemist who directs the Harvard University Center for the Environment, called the award "a total embarrassment" that he said "reflects the politics of the oil industry and a lack of professionalism" on the association's part.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/national/09prize.html?ex=1297141200&en=0d93dce0782d23dd&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=Truth? Fiction? Journalism? Award Goes to . . . |accessdate=2007-07-27 |work=The New York Times | first=Cornelia | last=Dean | date=2006-02-09[/tpl] The AAPG's award for journalism lauded "notable journalistic achievement, in any medium, which contributes to public understanding of geology, energy resources or the technology of oil and gas exploration." The name of the journalism award has since been changed to the "Geosciences in the Media" Award.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aapg.org/explorer/president/2006/06june.cfm |title=President Reflects On Past Fiscal Year |accessdate=2007-07-27 |work=[/tpl]
The criticism drew attention to the AAPG's 1999 position statementAAPG Climate Change Policy statement 1999 formally rejecting the likelihood of human influence on recent climate.  The Council of the American Quaternary Association wrote in a criticism of the award that the "AAPG stands alone among scientific societies in its denial of human-induced effects on global warming."http://www.agu.org/fora/eos/pdfs/2006EO360008.pdf
As recently as March 2007, articles in the newsletter of the AAPG Division of Professional Affairs stated that "the data does not support human activity as the cause of global warming"http://dpa.aapg.org/correlator/2007/spring/contamination.cfm and characterize the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports as "wildly distorted and politicized."http://dpa.aapg.org/correlator/2007/spring/myths.cfm

===2007 AAPG revised position===

Acknowledging that the association's previous policy statement on Climate Change was "not supported by a significant number of our members and prospective members",Climate :03:2007 EXPLORER AAPG's formal stance was reviewed and changed in July 2007.
The new statement formally accepts human activity as at least one contributor to carbon dioxide increase, but does not confirm its link to climate change, saying its members are "divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic CO2 has" on climate. AAPG also stated support for "research to narrow probabilistic ranges on the effect of anthropogenic CO2 on global climate."[tpl]cite web | title=Position Statement: Climate Change | url=http://dpa.aapg.org/gac/statements/climatechange.pdf | publisher=American Association of Petroleum Geologists | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-12-30|format=PDF[/tpl] 
AAPG also withdrew its earlier criticism of other scientific organizations and research stating, "Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS, and AMS. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models."

==Affiliated organizations==

Organizations may request affiliation with AAPG if they meet a set of criteria including goals compatible with those of AAPG; membership of at least 60% professional geologists with degrees; dissemination of scientific information through publications or meetings; and membership not restricted by region.[tpl]cite web|title=Information Regarding Affiliated Society Status|url=http://www.aapg.org/member/affiliate.cfm|work=Membership|publisher=AAPG|accessdate=4 February 2014[/tpl]
