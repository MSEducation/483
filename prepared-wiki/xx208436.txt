As described by one insect-breeding hobbyist, this species:
 ...is one of the most impressive of all mimic species. It takes the form of a leaf one step further than any other species, and has the largest hood of all leaf species. They take the form of a flat stance, and spend most of their time low-lying, to help blend in with their background. This mantis species is rare in captivity, and only experienced breeders will have these available/have reared them successfully in the past.http://www.insectstore.com/choeradodis_stallii_tropical_shield_mantis.php Choeradodis Stallii - Tropical Shield Mantis 
Nymphs of this species are born with a bright red color distinguishing it from other Choeradodis. Even at early instars, it displays somewhat of a hood. Each time the mantis moults, it grows more greenish and the hood grows larger until it reaches adulthood.http://www.insectstore.com/choeradodis_stallii_tropical_shield_mantis.php Choeradodis Stallii - Tropical Shield Mantis
