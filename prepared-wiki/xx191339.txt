==Critical reception==

Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, saying that what makes the single work is McDonald's "endearing style, made so apparent with the mega success of 'Amazed'." She says that McDonald "projects a sincerity that propels the lyrical content nicely" and that the "crisp production" highlights the playing.Billboard, April 15, 2000
