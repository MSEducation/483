Breadon Field was a minor league ballpark in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, located on the east side of MacArthur Road, about 0.5 mile north of the U.S. Route 22 interchange. It was named for St. Louis Cardinals owner Sam Breadon, who built the ballfield in 1948. In 1958, it was purchased by Max Hess, Jr, owner of the Allentown Hess Brothers department store. After the last team moved out after the 1960 season, and several attempts to obtain another minor league team failed, the facility was torn down in 1964.
After being razed, the former baseball field eventually was sold by Hess in October 1965.  The land was undeveloped for about a decade, going through several owners and eventually being incorporated into a larger tract.  It was developed into the Lehigh Valley Mall, which opened in 1976.  The site of Breadon Field is located approximately where the entrance road from MacArthur Road enters the mall parking lot.
