The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, usually called the AP Stylebook, is a style and usage guide used by newspapers and in the news industry in the United States. The book is updated annually by Associated Press editors, usually in June. 
Reporters, editors and others use the AP Stylebook as a guide for grammar, punctuation and principles and practices of reporting. Although some publications use a different style guide, the AP Stylebook is considered a newspaper industry standard and is also used by broadcasters, magazines and public relations firms, in part because its style guidelines offer short-form advantages over other  style manuals designed to save scarce print space, such as dropping the Oxford comma and using figures for all numbers above nine.Lamb, David. "Understanding 'Style'". Retrieved 2 September 2013. It includes an A-to-Z listing of guides to capitalization, abbreviation, spelling, numerals and usage.
Example: If the title of governor is used before a name, it should be capitalized and abbreviated e.g. Gov. Janet Napolitano, but when it's used generically by itself or after the name it should be lowercase and not abbreviated.

==Organization==

The stylebook is organized into sections:
A reference section for reporters covering business and financial news including general knowledge of accounting, bankruptcy, mergers and international bureaus.
For instance, it includes explanations of five different chapters of bankruptcy.
Includes terminology, statistics, organization rules and guidelines commonly referenced by sports reporters.
Example: The correct way to spell and use basketball terminology e.g. half-court pass, field goal and goaltending.
A specific guide on how to use punctuation in  journalistic materials, this section includes rules regarding hyphens, commas, parentheses and quotations. 
Example: In a series use commas to separate items but no comma before a conjunction. e.g. We bought eggs, milk and cheese at the store.
An overview of legal issues and ethical expectations for those working in the journalism industry.
Example: The difference between slander and libel. Slander is spoken; libel is written, to start with. 
The simple formula of what to include when writing a photo cutline.
A key with editing symbols to assist the journalist with the proofreading process.
Example: When a word is circled it means that the word should be abbreviated, or that an abbreviation should be unabbreviated.
This provides second reference materials for information not included in the book. Example: Use Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Wiley, Hoboken, N.J. as first reference after the AP Stylebook for spelling, style, usage and foreign geographic names.

==History==

The AP Stylebook in its modern form started in 1953. The 1953 publication focused on "where the wire set a specific style";[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jour.sc.edu/news/CSJ/CSJJuly07.html |title=School of Journalism and Mass Communications |publisher= University of South Carolina  |date= |accessdate=2011-03-21[/tpl]  for nearly a quarter century it assumed its reader had a "solid grounding in language and a good reference library" and thus omitted any guidelines in those broader areas. In 1977, prompted by AP Executive News Editor Louis Boccardi's request for "more of a reference work," the organization started expanding the book. That year's book was produced jointly with competitor United Press International.Introduction to the UPI Stylebook from United Press International's UPIU website, a social media platform for journalism students and "aspiring journalists." In 1989, Norm Goldstein became the AP Stylebook editor, a job he held until the 2007 edition. After the publication of the final edition under his editorship, Goldstein commented on changes:
 
 I think the difference...now is that there is more information available on the Internet, and I'm not sure, and at least our executive editor is not sure, how much of a reference book we ought to be anymore. I think some of our historical background material like on previous hurricanes and earthquakes, that kind of encyclopedic material that's so easily available on the Internet now, might be cut back.
Associated Press editors Darrell Christian, Sally Jacobsen and David Minthorn have led the Stylebook since Goldstein's retirement,.[tpl]cite web|author=AP |url=http://www.apstylebook.com/?do=product&pid=978-0-917360-53-4 |title=AP Stylebook Online 2011 |publisher=Apstylebook.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501193737/http://apstylebook.com/?do=product&pid=978-0-917360-53-4| archivedate= 1 May 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The most recent print edition is the 2013 AP Stylebook, available spiral bound directly from AP or as a perfect-bound paperback sold by Basic Books.

==Revision process==

The stylebook is updated annually by Associated Press editors, usually in June, and at this time edits and new entries may be added. In 2008, 200 new entries were added, including words and phrases like “podcast”, “text messaging”, “social networking” and “high-definition”.  The 2009 edition added the entries “Twitter” and “texting”. This is done to keep the stylebook up to date with technological and cultural changes.
