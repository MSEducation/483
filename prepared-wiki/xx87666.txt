As part of the extension of the electrified network from St Albans, the station was relocated eastwards in 2002 and renamed Watergardens. The new station was to be named Sydenham, which name was built into the brickwork of the station building. However, naming rights were sold to the adjacent Watergardens Town Centre, so the station was renamed..
