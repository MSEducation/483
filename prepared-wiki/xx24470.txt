==Biography==

The place and date of Celebrían's birth are not specified.Unfinished Tales, p. 234  In the version of their history that describes Galadriel and Celeborn as rulers of Eregion in the Second Age, Galadriel and Celebrían left Eregion for Lórinand as Sauron's influence over Eregion grew, sometime between [tpl]ME-date|SA|1350[/tpl] and [tpl]ME-date|SA|1400[/tpl].Unfinished Tales, p. 237. According to one account, Celebrían and her parents later dwelt for many years in Rivendell (Imladris),Unfinished Tales, p. 240. where she wed Elrond in [tpl]ME-date|TA|109[/tpl].The Lord of the Rings, Appendix B.

In [tpl]ME-date|TA|2509[/tpl], on a trip from Rivendell to Lórien, Celebrían was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass on Caradhras in the Misty Mountains.  She was captured and tormented and received a poisoned wound.  She was rescued by her sons and healed by Elrond, but "after fear and torment"[tpl]ME-ref|PoMe|pp. 235-6[/tpl] she could no longer find joy in Middle-earth, so she passed to the Grey Havens and over the Sea in the following year.
Tolkien said that "after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the Three Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last to depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían."The Peoples of Middle-earth, p. 243. Thus Elrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, but they were sundered forever from their daughter Arwen.
