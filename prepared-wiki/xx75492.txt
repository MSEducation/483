[[Tamba Province]]

CATEGORIES: Former provinces of Japan

[tpl]nihongo|TambaSpelling note: A modified Hepburn romanization system for Japanese words is used throughout Western publications in a range of languages, including English.  Unlike the standard system, the "''n''" is maintained even when followed by "homorganic consonants" (e.g., ''shinbun'', not ''shimbun'').  In the same way that Wikipedia has not yet adopted a consensus policy to address spelling variations in English (e.g., ''humour'', not ''humor''), variant spellings based on place of articulation are unresolved, perhaps unresolvable -- as in ''Tamba'' Province vs. ''Tanba'' Province, which are each construed as technically correct. Province|丹波国|Tamba no kuni[/tpl] was an old province of Japan.  The ambit of its borders encompassed both the central part of modern Kyoto Prefecture and the east-central part of Hyōgo Prefecture.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Tamba" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 943|page=943[/tpl]. 
It and the neighbouring Tango Province were collectively known as [tpl]nihongo|Tanshū|丹州[/tpl]. Besides Tango, Tamba bordered on Harima, Ōmi, Settsu, Tajima, Wakasa, and Yamashiro Provinces.
The ancient provincial capital is believed to be in the area of modern Kameoka.

==Historical record==

In the 3rd month of the 6th year of the Wadō era (713), Tango Province (丹後国) was administratively separated from Tamba.  In that same year, Empress Gemmei's Daijō-kan continued to organize other cadastral changes in the provincial map of the Nara Period.
In Wadō 6, Mimasaka Province (美作国) was sundered from Bizen Province (備前国); and Hyūga Province (日向国) was divided from Osumi Province (大隈国).Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, p. 64.  In Wadō 5 (712), Mutsu Province (陸奥国) had been severed from Dewa Province (出羽国).
After being governed by a succession of minor daimyo, the region was eventually conquered by Oda Nobunaga in the Sengoku Period.  He assigned the province to one of his generals, Akechi Mitsuhide, who would become the central figure in Nobunaga's assassination in 1582.
A town in this region also named Tamba was merged with several other towns in 2005 to create Kyōtamba (Kyō + Tamba).
