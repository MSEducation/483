Saint Caprasius, sometimes Caprasius of Lérins ([tpl]lang-fr|Caprais[/tpl]) (died 430) was a hermit who lived in Lérins, Provence.  He was joined by Saint Honoratus and Honoratus' brother Venantius there; Honoratus and Venantius were two youths who wished to become hermits as well.  The three decided to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit the holy places of Palestine and the Lavra of Syria and Egypt.San Caprasio di Lérins  However, Venantius died at Methoni, Messenia and Caprasius and Honoratus cut short their voyage.St. Caprasius - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online 
Caprasius and Honoratus returned to Gaul, where they established themselves in the hills near Fréjus before returning to Lérins, where they wished to imitate the Desert Fathers.  There they were joined by many others, and the hermits were inspired by the monastic rule of Saint Pachomius.San Caprasio di Lérins  Lérins Abbey grew up on the site of this community.  According to one scholar, Caprasius may not have been the official leader of the community at Lérins, since he may have been advanced in years at this time or else lacked the charisma of Honoratus.San Caprasio di Lérins

==Veneration==

Hilarius of Arles, who had been a monk at Lérins before becoming bishop of Arles, composed a laudatio in honor of Caprasius after the latter’s death, which is the main source for Caprasius’ life.San Caprasio di Lérins  
Now, what remain of his body is preserved in the Abbey of S. Caprasio, in Aulla, north Tuscany.
Caprasius should not be confused with another French saint of the same name, the martyr Caprasius of Agen.
