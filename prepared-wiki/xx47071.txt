[[Rauma (river)]]

CATEGORIES: Rauma, Norway, Rivers of Møre og Romsdal, Rivers of Oppland

Rauma is a river that runs through the Romsdalen valley in Møre og Romsdal and Oppland counties in Norway.  It runs for [tpl]convert|68|km[/tpl] from the lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Lesja Municipality to the town of Åndalsnes in Rauma Municipality. The river was once famous for its salmon-fishing, but since an infection with Gyrodactylus salaris, only 5-10% of the original stock survives. The salmon runs up to the "Slettafoss", a [tpl]convert|16|m[/tpl] high combination of waterfalls and rapids more than [tpl]convert|42|km[/tpl] upriver from the estuary.
The Romsdalen valley and Rauma river are regarded as one of the most beautiful river valleys in Norway. The river runs very clear with a green tint and the mountains tower some [tpl]convert|1500|to|1800|m[/tpl] above the river in the lower and middle parts of the valley.  The Reinheimen National Park and the Trollveggen cliff are both located along the southwestern shores of the river through Rauma municipality.  The Romsdalsalpene mountains surround the river and the valley, including the mountains Store Trolltind, Store Venjetinden, Trollryggen, and Romsdalshornet.  The Rauma Line railroad follows the river through the valley on its way north to Åndalsnes.  The railroad crosses the river on the Kylling Bridge at the village of Verma.
Rauma was classified as a protected watercourse in 1992, and the only main tributary affected by hydroelectric power is the river Verma with the more than [tpl]convert|300|m|adj=on[/tpl] tall Verma waterfalls. The biggest tributaries are Ulvåa and Istra. Istra runs through the Ister valley, well known for the Trollstigen road in its upper parts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Rauma/elv|title=Rauma – elv|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]
The meaning of the name Rauma is unknown (it is probably very old).
