Stanchester Academy, formerly Stanchester Community School, is an academy for children between the ages of 11 and 16 in Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, England.  [tpl]As of|2012|1[/tpl] it had 863 pupils, and was headed by Judith Mcblain.   It was originally a "Secondary Modern" School, becoming a "Comprehensive" School in 1974 as a result of the abandonment of Grammar School education in the Yeovil area by the then Conservative controlled Somerset County Council. In August 2011, the school became an academy, and since 1 September 2013, it has been headed by Mr. Jason Beardmore. 
Stanchester now has a house system that started in September 2008.  These houses have been named after parts of the school badge in Latin, Sagitta (the arrow), Avis (the birds), Arbor (the tree) and Arcus (the archer).

==Selection of head boy and girl==

Stanchester has 48 Senior Students (Prefects) including the Head Boy and Head Girl. Senior Students are elected by first being nominated, then having two members of staff signatures next to their names in the staff room, then by handing in a manifesto. Those who make it past this round are then elected by the students and staff. The Head Boy or Head Girl is chosen by an interview with the head teacher, two of the governors and the out-going Head Boy and Head Girl. Two are then chosen as Head Boy and Head Girl and the two runners up are given the position of Deputy Head Boy and Deputy Head Girl.
