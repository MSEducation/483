==Sustainability==

Great Lakes Brewing Company has undertaken a number of initiatives to promote sustainability, including recycling promotional materials to create fuel for heating an outdoor structure, the use of straw-bale construction (incidentally the first straw-bale structure in Cleveland), the composting of leftovers from the brewery's restaurant, and the use of local and organic food.  The brewery also provides barley left over from the brewing process to local farmers for use as feed and to local bakers who use it to produce bread and pretzels."Local Brewery Gives Barley To Farmers, Grain To Bakers" msnbc.com: NewsNet5.com, Feb. 26, 2009.  In addition, the delivery trucks are equipped to use biodiesel and are fueled with left-over vegetable oil from the restaurant.  The brewery also uses outside air for cooling during winter months, rather than conventional refrigeration units."Unconventional brewery pours over strategies; Brothers push sustainability in Cleveland.(Pat Conway and Dan Conway of Great Lakes Brewing Co.)", Waste News, Feb. 19th, 2007.  The organization is growing, with 5800 members in 2008.
