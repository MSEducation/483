CATEGORIES: Forms of Vishnu, Hindu philosophical concepts, Vaishnavism

In Hinduism, an avatar [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|ə|t|ɑr[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA-hns|əʋˈt̪aːr|lang[/tpl], from Sanskrit अवतार [tpl]IAST|avatāra[/tpl] "descent") is a deliberate descent of a deity to Earth, or a descent of the Supreme Being (e.g., Vishnu for Vaishnavites), and is mostly translated into English as "incarnation", but more accurately as "appearance" or "manifestation".[tpl]cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&pg=PA4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6[/tpl]Introduction to World Religions, by Christopher Hugh Partridge, pg. 148, at Books.Google.com

Shiva and Ganesha are also described as descending in the form of avatars. The various manifestations of Devi, the Divine Mother principal in Hinduism, are also described as avatars or incarnations by some scholars and followers of Shaktism.[tpl]cite book|last=Hawley|first=John Stratton|author2=Vasudha Narayanan|title=The life of Hinduism|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|page=174|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7DLj1tYmoTQC&pg=PA174[/tpl] The avatars of Vishnu carry a greater theological prominence than those of other deities, which some scholars perceive to be imitative of the Vishnu avatar lists.
In Sikhism, an avatar is a deliberate descent of a soul to earth in any form.Page 792, Line 7, Bhagat Kabir Guru Granth Sahib believes in the existence of the Dasavatara. In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh wrote three composition on historical avatars which include Vishnu Avatar, Brahma Avatar, and Rudra Avatar.Dasam Granth Sahib

==Etymology and meaning==

The Sanskrit noun [tpl]IAST|avatāra[/tpl] is derived from the verbal root [tpl]IAST|tṝ[/tpl] "to cross over", joined with the prefix [tpl]IAST|ava[/tpl] "off, away, down". The word does not occur in the Vedas, but is recorded in [tpl]IAST|Pāṇini[/tpl] (3.3.120). [tpl]IAST|Avatāra[/tpl] was initially used to describe different deities, then around the 6th century AD it began to be used primarily to describe the manifestations of Vishnu.Sheth, p. 116. While earlier texts mention deities taking on different forms, the Bhagavad Gita (4.5-9) is the first text to discuss the doctrine associated with the term even though the word avatāra itself is not mentioned.Sheth, pp. 98, 116.
According to some scholars like Mercy Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, and Noel Sheth, the common translation "incarnation" is somewhat misleading as the concept of an avatar corresponds more closely to the view of Docetism in Christian theology, as different from the idea of God 'in the flesh' in mainstream Christology.Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, One gospel – many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology, Rodopi, 2003, ISBN 978-90-420-0897-7, p. 111.Sheth, p. 108.

===Meaning in Sikhism===

In Sikhism, every soul that has taken form or has been born on earth is called avatar. Guru Granth Sahib believed in the existence of Dasavtara, who were kings of their times who tried their best to bring revolution in the world. Guru Granth Sahib states:
ਹੁਕਮਿ ਉਪਾਏ ਦਸ ਅਉਤਾਰਾ ॥ 
हुकमि उपाए दस अउतारा ॥ 
By Hukam (Supreme Command), He created His ten incarnations,Page 1037, Line 5, Guru Nanak
ਦਸ ਅਉਤਾਰ ਰਾਜੇ ਹੋਇ ਵਰਤੇ ਮਹਾਦੇਵ ਅਉਧੂਤਾ ॥ 
दस अउतार राजे होइ वरते महादेव अउधूता ॥ 
ਅਵਤਰਿ ਆਇ ਕਹਾ ਤੁਮ ਕੀਨਾ ॥ 
अवतरि आइ कहा तुम कीना ॥ 
Since your take form (birth), what have you done?
Gurmat defines 'avatar' as one who has taken avatar/birth onto this mortal earth. It is quite clear from this line.

==Avatars of Vishnu==

The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti or the one and only supreme God for followers of Vaishnavism.
Vishnu's avatars typically descend for a very specific purpose. An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu—as bringing dharma, or righteousness, back to the social and cosmic order:
 
 

The descents of Vishnu are also integral to His teaching and tradition, whereas the accounts of other deities are not so strictly dependent on their avatar stories. Although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avatars, within the Vaishnavism branch of Hinduism Narayana, Vasudeva, and Krishna are also seen as names denoting divine aspects which descend as avatars.
The Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though there are ten incarnations (Dashavatara), that are widely seen as his major appearances. Krishna and Rama are the two mostly widely known and worshiped avatars of Vishnu, with their stories told in the two major Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.[tpl]cite book|last=King|first=Anna S.|title=The intimate other: love divine in Indic religions|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2005|pages=32–33|isbn=978-81-250-2801-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0FvH1aCXETwC&pg=PA32[/tpl] Different lists of Vishnu's avatars appear in different texts, including: the dasavatara from the Garuda Purana; lists of twenty-two, twenty-three, and sixteen avatars in the Bhagavata Purana;[tpl]cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vibhuti Bhushan|title=Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early mediaeval period, Volume 1|publisher=BRILL|year=1973|pages=4–5|isbn=978-90-04-03610-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nAQ4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA4[/tpl] thirty-nine avatars in the Pañcaratra[tpl]cite book|last=Schrader|first=Friedrich Otto |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya saṃhitā|publisher=Adyar Library|year=1916|page=42|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OlgLAQAAIAAJ[/tpl] the dasavatara again in Agni Purana; the first eight of the dasavatara in Padma Purana. The commonly accepted number of ten was fixed well before the 10th century CE. In addition, various Vaishnava saints and founders are considered to be partial avatars.Sheth, p. 100.
The various avatars categorized in many different ways. For example: Purusavatara is the first avatara; Gunavataras are represented by the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) who each preside over one of the Guṇas (rajas, sattva, and tamas); Lilavataras are the well-known ones, and include Avesavataras (beings into whom part of God Himself has entered) and saktyamsavesa (into whom only parts of His power enter); Kalpa-, Manvantara-, and Yuga-avataras descend during different cosmic ages.Sheth, pp. 100–101.
Some Vaishnavism schools consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars (Krishnaism).

===Dashavatara===

The ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the Dasavatara (a Sanskrit compound meaning "ten avatars"). This list is included in the Garuda Purana (1.86.10"11).Garuda Purana (1.86.10-11)
The first four are said to have appeared in the Satya Yuga (the first of the four Yugas or ages in the time cycle described within Hinduism). The next three avatars appeared in the Treta Yuga, the eighth descent in the Dvapara Yuga and the ninth in the Kali Yuga. The tenth, Kalki, is predicted to appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.Matchett, p. 86.

===In the Bhagavata Purana===

As many as forty specific avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana, though the book adds that the number is innumerable.[tpl]cite book|last=Rukmani|first=T. S.|title=A critical study of the Bhagavata Purana, with special reference to bhakti|publisher=Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series|location=Varanasi|year=1970|series=Chowkhamba Sanskrit studies|volume=77|page=4[/tpl] Twenty-two avatars of Vishnu are listed numerically in the first book:Bhag-P 1.3 Canto 1, Chapter 3
Besides these, another four avatars are described later on in the text as follows:

===In Dasam Granth===

24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh:

Before describing these avatars, the composers have written that these tried to equate themselves with god and unable to know secrets of almighty. But Dasam Granth is controversial among Sikh scholars and few of them believe it to be the work of Guru Gobind Singh.

===Other Vaishnava avatars===

There are many senses and shades of meaning of the term avatar within Hinduism.

====Purusha avatars====

Purusha avatars are sometimes described as the original avatars of Vishnu within the Universe:Avatar – Categories of Incarnations[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]gaudiya.com – theology[tpl]cite book|last=Mittal|first=Sushil|title=The Hindu World|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-67414-6|pages=164[/tpl]

====Guna avatars====

The personalities of the Trimurti (Hindu trinity) are also sometimes referred to as Guna avatars, because of their roles of controlling the three modes (gunas) of nature, even though they have not descended upon an earthly planet in the general sense of the term 'avatar'.

====Manvantara avatars====

Manvantara avatars are beings responsible for creating progeny throughout the Universe. There are said to be unlimited numbers of these avatars.Avatar – Categories of Incarnations,by Atmatattva Das, 06/17/2005[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=January 2010[/tpl]
"During the hundred years of Brahmā's life, there are 504,000 manvantara-avatāras."Śrī Caitanya Caritāmṛta Madhya 20.322

====Shaktyavesa and Avesa avatars====

Avataric incarnations are classified as two kinds
When Vishnu himself descends, he is called sakshat or shaktyavesa-avatara, a direct incarnation of God. But when he does not incarnate directly, but indirectly empowers some living entity to represent him, that living entity is called an indirect or avesa avatar.Teachings of Lord Chaitanya – Avatars[tpl]Verify credibility|date=January 2010[/tpl]
There are said to be a great number of avesa avatars. Examples include Narada Muni, Sugata Buddha, and Parashurama. Parashurama is the only one of the traditional ten avatars that is not a direct descent of Vishnu.
According to the Sri Vaishnavism sect of Hinduism, there are two types of primary or direct avatars, Purna avatars and Amsarupavatars:
The avesa or indirect avatars are generally not worshiped as the Supreme being. Only the direct, primary avatars are worshiped in this way. In practice, the direct avatars that are worshiped today are the Purna avatars of Narasimha, Rama and Krishna. Among most Vaishnava traditions, Krishna is considered to be the highest Purna avatar. However, followers of Chaitanya (including ISKCON), Nimbarka, and Vallabha Acharya differ philosophically from other Vaishnavas, such as Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya, and consider Krishna to be the ultimate Godhead, not simply an avatar. That said, all Hindus believe that there is no difference between worship of Vishnu and His avatars as it all leads to Him. According to Madhvacharya (chief proponent of Dvaita or school of differential monism), all avatars of Vishnu are alike in potency and every other quality. There is no gradation among them, and perceiving or claiming any differences among avatars is a cause of eternal damnation. See Madhva's commentary on Katha Upanishad.

====Avatars of Krishna====

Krishna is believed to have incarnated as humans in legends.

==Avatars of Ganesha==

The Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[tpl]cite book|last=Grimes|first=John A.|title=Gaṇapati: song of the self|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1995|page=105|isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aoqB4n95pSoC&pg=PT105[/tpl] The two upapuranas – Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana – detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect – exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.
Four avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana:Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose – to slay demons.Grimes, pp. 100–105.
The Mudgala Purana describes eight avatars of Ganesha:Phyllis Granoff, "[tpl]IAST|Gaṇeśa as Metaphor[/tpl]," in Robert L. Brown (ed.) Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God, pp. 94–5, note 2. ISBN 0-7914-0657-1

==Avatars of Shiva==

Although Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the idea is not universally accepted in Saivism.[tpl]cite book |last=Parrinder| first= Edward Geoffrey |title=Avatar and incarnation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1982 |page= 88 |isbn=0-19-520361-5 [/tpl] As an avatar requires residence in a womb, Shiva as ayonija (not of a womb) cannot manifest himself as an avatar.

When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha. The story concludes with Narasimha becoming a devotee of Shiva after being bound by Sharabha.Soifer, pp. 91–92. However, Vaishnava followers including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayindra Tirtha (1539–95) refute this Shaivite view of Narasimha based on their reading of Sattvika Puranas and Śruti texts.[tpl]cite book|last=Sharma|first= B.

Other stated avatars of Shiva, according to some sources, are 8th century non-dualist Vedanta philosopher (Advaita Vedanta) Adi Shankara. He was named "Shankara" after Lord Shiva and is considered by some to have been an incarnation of the godPadma Purana 6.236.7-11 and Virabhadra who was born when Shiva grabbed a lock of his matted hair and dashed it to the ground. Virabhadra then destroyed Daksha's yajna (fire sacrifice) and severed his head as per Shiva's instructions.[tpl]cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|page = 859[/tpl]
In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh have mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.Composition 10, Rudra Avtar

==Avatars of Devi==

Avatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous—much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Cheever Mackenzie|title=The triumph of the goddess: the canonical models and theological visions of the Devī-Bhāgavata Purāṇa|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1990|page=32|isbn=978-0-7914-0363-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=erENsMcblGAC&pg=PA32[/tpl] Like Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as Sita and Radha – the consorts of Rama and Krishna avatars.Hindu Avatāra and Christian Incarnation: A Comparison, Noel Sheth Philosophy East and West, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp. 98, 117.
