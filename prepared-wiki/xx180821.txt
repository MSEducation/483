KEGX owners New Northwest Broadcasters in 2010 defaulted and this station along with the entire Tri-Cities, WA cluster went into receivership. KEGX (and the other stations) continued to operate in that arrangement until Townsquare media announced purchase of the frequency on December 1, 2010. In July 2011 the FCC blocked Townsquare's acquisition of the former New Northwest operation in Kennewick, including KEGX.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbr.com/radio/fcc-blows-up-townsquare-washington-station-migrations.html |title=FCC blows up Townsquare Washington station migrations), WA [/tpl]

As KHWK the station primarily had a country format. A noteworthy short lived incarnation was an attempt to operate a CHR format and directly compete with then KIOK (OK95).
As KOTY-FM it operated with a country format up until 1993 becoming KEGX "Eagle 106.5."
