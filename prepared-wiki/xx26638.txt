</ref> A 2009 ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, "[[Not All Dogs Go to Heaven]]" included the main ''The Next Generation'' cast and featured Wil Wheaton in character as Wesley, being bullied by [[Patrick Stewart]] as infantile and annoying.
Some fans disliked the idea of a young boy who seems to constantly save the whole ship as a deus ex machina plot device. Commentators have observed at least seven times in which Wesley, "who has trouble getting into the Starfleet Academy" and is on a ship "filled with Starfleet's best and brightest crew members", has come up "with the needed solution".Phil Farrand, "Updated Conundrum Tote Board" The Nitpicker's Guide for Next Generation Trekkers, Vol. 2 New York: Dell (1995): 319
