Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|CVG|KCVG[/tpl], sometimes called the Greater Cincinnati Airport, is a Class B international airport located in Hebron, Kentucky, United States, and serves the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area. Despite being located in Boone County, the airport operations are governed by the neighboring Kenton County Airport Board. The airport's code, CVG, comes from the nearest major city at the time of its opening, Covington, Kentucky. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport covers an area of [tpl]convert|8000|acre|km2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| title=The Greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport| url=http://www.nkyviews.com/boone/boone_airport.htm|publisher=nkyviews.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl] It is the busiest airport in Kentucky.

==History==

President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved preliminary funds for site development of the Greater Cincinnati Airport February 11, 1942. This was part of the Army Air Corps program to establish training facilities during World War II. At the time, air traffic in the area centered around Lunken Airport just southeast of central Cincinnati.[tpl]cite web| title=Detailed History| url=http://www.cvgairport.com/about/history2.html | publisher=cvgairport.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101204233340/http://www.cvgairport.com/about/history2.html |archivedate=December 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl] Lunken opened in 1926 and was located in the Ohio River Valley. Due to its location, the airport frequently experienced fog, and the 1937 flood completely submerged its runways and two-story terminal building.[tpl]cite web|title=Lunken Airport|first=Larry|last=Stulz|work=Cincinnati-Transit.net|date=February 14, 2008|url=http://www.cincinnati-transit.net/lunken.html[/tpl]  While federal officials wanted an airfield site that would not be prone to flooding, Cincinnati officials hoped to build Lunken into the premier airport of the region.[tpl]cite news| title=Flood sank Lunken plans| url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/ourhistory/2010/12/28/flood-sank-lunken-plans/ | publisher=Cincinnati.com| work=Cincinnati Enquirer-Our History| author=Steve Kemme| date=December 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl]
A coalition of officials from Boone, Kenton and Campbell Counties in Kentucky took advantage of Cincinnati's short-sightedness and lobbied Congress to build an airfield there.http://eviljwinter.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/mtm-cincinnati-why-is-cincinnati-airport-in-kentucky/  Boone County officials offered a suitable site on the provision that Kenton County paid the acquisition cost. In October 1942, Congress provided $2 million to construct four runways.
The field officially opened August 12, 1944, with the first B-17 bombers beginning practice runs on August 15. As the tide of the war had already turned, the Air Corps only used the field until 1945 before it was declared surplus. On October 27, 1946, a small wooden terminal building opened and the airport prepared for commercial service.
The first airplane, an American Airlines DC-3 from Cleveland, Ohio, landed at the airport January 10, 1947, at 9:53 am. A Delta Air Lines flight followed moments later.[tpl]cite news| title=Cincinnati's Century of Change: Timeline |author=Donna M.

As late as November 1959 the airport had four [tpl]convert|5500|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] runways at 45-degree angles, the north–south runway eventually being extended into today's runway 18C/36C.

===Jet age===

On December 16, 1960, the jet age arrived in Cincinnati when a Delta Air Lines Convair 880 from Miami completed the first scheduled jet flight. The airport needed to expand and build more modern terminals and other facilities; the original Terminal A was expanded and renovated. The north–south runway was extended [tpl]convert|3100|to|8600|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. In 1964, the board approved a $12 million bond to expand the south concourse of Terminal A by [tpl]convert|32000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] and provide nine gates for TWA, American, and Delta. A new east–west runway crossing the longer north–south runway was constructed in 1971 south of the older east–west runway. In the mid-1980s, Delta created a hub in Cincinnati and constructed Terminal 3 with its three midfield concourses. This hub eventually grew to be Delta's second largest, handling over 600 Delta and Delta Connection flights in 2005.

===Delta hub cuts===

In 2008, Delta merged with Northwest Airlines and cut flight capacity from the Cincinnati hub by 22 percent with an additional 17 percent reduction in 2009.[tpl]cite news| author=Kelly Yamanouchi| publisher=ajc.com| url=http://www.ajc.com/business/cincinnati-hub-is-105747.html?cxtype=rss_business_87628| title= Cincinnati hub is shrinking| work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| date=August 2, 2009| accessdate=August 2, 2009[/tpl]  Delta announced additional cuts in February 2010 by eliminating five destination cities, which left CVG with 63 destinations between mainline and connection flights.[tpl]cite news| title=Why CVG lost half of all flights| author=James Pilcher| url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20100524/EDIT03/5230393/Why-CVG-lost-half-of-all-flights| date=May 23, 2010| work=Cincinnati Enquirer| publisher=Cincinnati.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl] Many businesses in Cincinnati have urged Delta to restore the service level it had in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) while some, such as Chiquita Banana, have already relocated to cities with more available flights.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/05/23/4057117/protesters-expected-at-chiquitas.html Flights at CVG are scheduled in morning and afternoon blocks, in which very large numbers of flights are scheduled to depart around the same time. The only remaining intercontinental service by Delta is a daily departure to Paris in the evening. In addition to serving the heavy international travel demand of local companies such as P&G and GE Aviation, the daily Paris flight is also sustained in great part because it ferries jet engine parts between factories in Cincinnati and France due to GE Aviation's presence. Each year the flight carries [tpl]convert|4200000|lb|kg[/tpl] of engine parts.Nicas, Jack and Susan Carey. "The World's Oddest Air Routes." The Wall Street Journal. October 16, 2012.

===Comair ends service===

In July 2012, Delta announced their wholly owned and CVG-based subsidiary, Comair, would cease all operations by October of the same year. However, it said "the discontinuation of Comair's operations will not result in any significant changes to Delta's network, which has enough flexibility to accommodate these changes".[tpl]cite web|title=Comair to Cease Operations|accessdate=July 28, 2012|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=1676|date=July 27, 2012[/tpl] Comair is now defunct, leaving all Delta Connection flights operated exclusively by third party regional carriers.

==Facilities==

The airport's terminal/remote-concourse configuration, combined with simultaneous triple landing/takeoff capabilities, makes CVG a particularly efficient airport for flight operations. CVG is the smallest domestic hub of Delta Air Lines, and was the central hub of Delta's wholly owned subsidiary airline, Comair, which provided regional jet service under the Delta Connection banner.  As such, the airport serves an important role in Delta's Midwest hub-and-spoke system. In recent years, Delta Air Lines has considerably pared the number of flights out of the Cincinnati hub and in August 2008 announced it would be moving all of its Comair flights to Concourses A and B and closed all operations in Concourse C in January 2009.[tpl]cite news|title=Delta to close concourse in Cincinnati|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2008/08/25/daily15.html|work=Dayton Business Journal|publisher=bizjournals.com|first=Lisa|last=Biank Fasig|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=June 2, 2011[/tpl]  In February 2010, Delta announced it would close Concourse A in May and further consolidate operations in the remaining concourse.
The airport has three terminals, though only one in use. Since January 2007, Terminal 1 houses only airport administrative offices. It is the original terminal and was built in 1960 and renovated in 1974. Designed by Heery & Heery, Terminals 2 and 3 were built in 1974 when additional expansion necessitated more gates.Cincinnati Airport to Open Its New Terminal Complex Terminal 3 was expanded specifically for Delta in 1987 and has three remote concourses.  Concourses B and C were completed in December 1994 as part of a $500 million expansion designed by Thompson, Hancock, Witte & Associates.CVG Detailed HistoryTHW Design – Architecture  Concourses A and B are connected to the main terminal by an underground train system.  Concourse C was reachable only by shuttle bus.  Concourse B is served by Delta and its regional affiliates. Terminal 3 houses the airport's only US Customs and Border Protection facilities in Concourse B. All international arrivals except, U.S. border preclearance are processed in the Mezzanine Level of Concourse B.
Concourse B in Terminal 3 is well known for its open spaces, high ceilings, large windows with views of the airfield, and natural lighting during the day.[tpl]cite news|last1= Naylor |first1= Brian |title= Cincinnati's Airport: Best In The U.S.? |url=http://www.npr.org/2013/09/02/217267752/cincinnatis-airport-best-in-the-u-s/| accessdate=27 November 2013 |newspaper=NPR News|date= 2 September 2013[/tpl] All Delta and Delta Connection flights operate from Concourse B.
In May 2012, Terminal 2 was officially closed and all non-Delta operations were consolidated in a newly renovated Concourse A. The renovation was in response to civic and business leader's concerns about the loss of flights to and from the airport.[tpl]cite news|title=Renovated Concourse Opens at Cincinnati Airport|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57434621/renovated-concourse-opens-at-cincinnati-airport/|work=CBS News|date=May 15, 2012|accessdate=May 15, 2012[/tpl] Terminal 2 will be demolished at a date that has not been set yet.

==Employment==

In addition to hundreds of ground staff employees, Delta has a flight attendant base and a pilot base for the McDonnell Douglas MD-88, and Boeing 737–800. In total, over 1,000 people are employed at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

==SkyClub==

Delta operates one SkyClub in Concourse B and also operated a Business Elite lounge near Gate B14 until summer of 2008. Delta formerly operated a SkyClub in Concourse A. Though the lounge was closed, the furniture and space are now used as a lounge for pilots.

==Main Terminal (formerly called Terminal 3)==

===Concourse A===

Operated by Delta Air Lines until 2010, Concourse A underwent an extensive renovation before re-opening on May 15, 2012, to serve passengers on Air Canada, Allegiant Airlines, American Airlines, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and US Airways, most of which formerly used Terminal 2, which is now closed. As such, ticketing, security screening and baggage claim for all airlines now take place in the newly renamed Main Terminal (Terminal 3).http://www.cvgairport.com/terminals/future.html

===Concourse B===

Concourse B is, like all concourses of Terminal 3, designed and originally purposed for Delta and its affiliates, including Cincinnati based Delta subsidiary, Comair. The concourse now houses all Delta and Delta Connection flights with a total of 39 gates. Also, U.S. Customs and Border Protection are contained in Concourse B.

===Concourse C===

Concourse C, which once housed all Delta Connection flights, opened in September 1994http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Comair-Holdings-Inc-Company-History.html and closed in 2009 due to Delta Air Lines cutting flights from the hub. Concourse C is an island and was only accessible by passengers from other terminals and ticketing facilities via buses. Delta has a lease on the concourse until 2025.

===Security Checkpoint===

The main terminal security checkpoint is on the ticketing level. This new, expandable checkpoint opened in November 2009. After clearing security, passengers can take escalators or elevators down to the Cincinnati Airport People Mover that departs to all gates. Arriving passengers exit the terminal by elevator or escalator up to the baggage claim level and ground transportation.

According to a study commissioned by CVG, 18% of Cincinnati-area residents use one of five nearby airports – Dayton, Louisville, Port Columbus, Indianapolis, or Blue Grass (Lexington) – instead of CVG because passengers can find fares up to 50% lower at these nearby airports.

===Industrial murals===

The airport is home to 14 large Art Deco murals created for the train concourse building at Cincinnati Union Terminal during the station's construction in 1932. Mosaic murals depicting people at work in local Cincinnati workplaces were incorporated into the interior design of the railroad station by Winold Reiss, a German-born artist with a reputation in interior design.
When the train concourse building was designated for demolition in 1972, a "Save the Terminal Committee" raised funds to remove and transport the 14 murals in the concourse to new locations in the Airport. They were placed in Terminal 1, and in Terminals 2 and 3, which were then being constructed as part of a major airport expansion and renovation.
The murals were also featured in a scene in the film Rain Man starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. In addition, a walkway to one of the terminals at CVG was featured in the scene in the film when Hoffman's character, Raymond, refused to fly on a plane.
