The convection–diffusion equation is a combination of the diffusion and convection (advection) equations, and describes physical phenomena where particles, energy, or other physical quantities are transferred inside a physical system due to two processes: diffusion and convection. Depending on context, the same equation can be called the advection–diffusion equation, drift–diffusion equation, Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), or (generic) scalar transport equation.Computational Fluid Dynamics in Industrial Combustion by Baukal and Gershtein, p67, google books link.

===Common simplifications===

In a common situation, the diffusion coefficient is constant, there are no sources or sinks, and the velocity field describes an incompressible flow (i.e., it has zero divergence). Then the formula simplifies to:
In this form, the convection–diffusion equation combines both parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.

===Stationary version===

==Derivation==

The convection–diffusion equation can be derived in a straightforward way from the continuity equation, which states that the rate of change for a scalar quantity in a differential control volume is given by flow and diffusion into and out of that part of the system along with any generation or consumption inside the control volume:
i.e., the flux of the diffusing material (relative to the bulk motion) in any part of the system is proportional to the local concentration gradient. Second, when there is overall convection or flow, there is an associated flux called advective flux:
The total flux (in a stationary coordinate system) is given by the sum of these two:
Plugging into the continuity equation:

Typically, the average velocity is directly proportional to the applied force, giving the equation:http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/~kosztin/PHYCS498NSM/LectureNotes/chp4.pdfThe Theory of Polymer Dynamics by Doi and Edwards, p46-52, google books link

===Derivation of Einstein relation===

==As a stochastic differential equation==

The Langevin equation describes advection, diffusion, and other phenomena in an explicitly stochastic way. One of the simplest forms of the Langevin equation is when its "noise term" is Gaussian; in this case, the Langevin equation is exactly equivalent to the convection–diffusion equation. However, the Langevin equation is more general.

==Numerical solution==

The convection-diffusion equation can only rarely be solved with a pen and paper. More often, computers are used to numerically approximate the solution to the equation, typically using the finite element method. For more details and algorithms see: Numerical solution of the convection–diffusion equation.

==Similar equations in other contexts==

The convection–diffusion equation is a relatively simple equation describing flows, or alternatively, describing a stochastically-changing system. Therefore, the same or similar equation arises in many contexts unrelated to flows through space.

==In semiconductor physics==

In semiconductor physics, this equation is called the drift–diffusion equation. The word "drift" is related to drift current and drift velocity. The equation is normally written:
where
The diffusion coefficient and mobility are related by the Einstein relation as above:
where kB is Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature.
The drift current and diffusion current refer separately to the two terms in the expressions for J, i.e.:
