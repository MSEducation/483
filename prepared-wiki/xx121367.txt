==History==

Aiani was the capital of Elimiotis, a kingdom and region of Upper Macedonia, which became part of Macedon.
Since 1983, systematic excavations in the area have brought to light finds that attest the existence of an organised city from the late 6th century BC to 100 BC. These are now housed in the Aiani Archaeological Museum. The excavations in the city of Aiani, brought to light the oldest pieces of matt-painted (black and white) pottery ever found. Some of the matt-painted pottery dates back to the 15th-14th century BC (Μycenaean era). Amongst the archaic pottery, some of the oldest samples of writing were found. Amongst them we have names inscribed like ΔΟΛΙΟ (DOLIO) and ΘΕΜΙΔΟΣ (THEMIDOS), which prove that the society of that region of Macedonia, spoke and wrote Greek before the 5th century BC.Macedonia: Hellenism in Macedonia, Britannica OnlineThe Late Bronze Age in Aiani, Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory A single example of linear writing similar to that of southern Greece has been found, but its significance still remains unknown.G.
