==Biography==

Salameh was born in the Palestinian town of Qula during the British mandate, near the city of Jaffa, to a wealthy family in 1940. He was the son of Shaykh Hassan Salameh, who was killed in action by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, north of Jaffa. Ali Salameh was educated in Germany and is thought to have received his military training in Cairo and Moscow[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl].
He was known for flaunting his wealth, being surrounded by women and driving sports cars, and had a very popular appeal among Palestinian young men; his nickname underlined his popularity — the "Red Prince."  He served as the secretary chief of Fatah.[tpl]cite news|title=Other Voices: Time for Arafat to retire|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-478849311.html|accessdate=3 October 2013|newspaper=Arab American News|date=27 March 1998|author=Ali Baghdadi[/tpl][tpl]Subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] After the Munich Massacre during the 1972 Olympic Games, he was hunted by the Israeli Mossad during Operation Wrath of God. In 1973, Mossad killed an innocent Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Bouchiki, in what became known as the Lillehammer affair in Norway, mistaking Bouchiki for Salameh, and resulting in the arrest of some of the Israeli agents.
As a result of the failure of Lillehammer and his alleged CIA protection, Salameh felt relatively safe, and hence did not act like a man on the run. Having lived under cover in various parts of the Middle East and Europe, in 1978 he married Georgina Rizk, a Lebanese celebrity who had been Miss Universe seven years earlier in 1971. The couple spent their honeymoon in Hawaii and then stayed at Disneyland, California. When Rizk became pregnant, she returned to her flat in Beirut where Salameh also rented a separate apartment. Rizk was six months pregnant at the time of his death.[tpl]cite news|title=How MOSSAD got the Red Prince|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19790201&id=3pQuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=a6EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=7100,5559702|accessdate=3 October 2013|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette[/tpl] By a prior marriage he was a grandson-in-law of Mohammad Amin al-Husayni.

According to several sources, Salameh served as a secret contact between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1970 until his death, guaranteeing not to assassinate US citizens in exchange for financial and political support. However, when asked by the Israelis, the relationship was denied by US officials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041112/news_lz1e12ignatiu.html|title=In the end, CIA-PLO links weren't helpful|author=David Ignatius|date=12 November 2004|work=U-T San Diego[/tpl] He helped protect US citizens in Beirut, and his role was to facilitate contacts between the Palestinians and the US, in hope of obtaining US support for the Palestinians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A34478-2001Sep14?language=printer|title=Penetrating Terrorist Networks|author=David Ignatius|date=16 September 2001|work=Washington Post|page=B07[/tpl]

==Death==

It is believed[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tomgrossmedia.com/mideastdispatches/archives/000634.html|title=Munich (3): BBC set to name woman agent who killed Olympics massacre mastermind|date=24 January 2006[/tpl] a Mossad agent, pseudonymously known as "Erika Chambers", a British citizen, took part in Salameh's assassination.  She travelled to the Middle East with a charity supporting Palestinian refugees and arranged a meeting with Salameh in Beirut, where Salameh was being harbored by the Lebanese government. Chambers learned Salameh's daily routine.
On 22 January 1979, Salameh was in a convoy of two Chevrolet station wagons headed from Rizk's flat to his mother's for a birthday party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/11/20/60II/main318655.shtml|title=An Eye For An Eye|work=CBS News|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=University of Southampton New Reporter|date=8 March 1992|volume=9|issue=17|series=People[/tpl] Chambers was on her balcony painting, with her red Volkswagen parked below on Rue Verdun. As Salameh's convoy passed the Volkswagen at 3:35 pm and turned onto Rue Madame Curie,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.military.com/opinion/0,15202,105948,00.html|title=Conspiracy Theory|author=John Weisman|date=18 July 2006|accessdate=18 July 2012[/tpl] 100 kg of explosive attached to the car by a fellow Mossad agent was remotely exploded, either by Chambers or on her notification to another Mossad agent.
The detonation left Salameh conscious, but severely wounded and in great pain, having pieces of steel shrapnel embedded in his head and throughout his body. He was rushed to the American University Hospital, where he died on the operating table at 4:03pm.[tpl]cite book|title=One day in September|author=Simon Reeve|date=2000-09-01|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=978-1559705479[/tpl] Salameh's four bodyguards were also killed in the explosion.[tpl]cite news|title=Munich massacre leader killed in Beirut explosion|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wQ5eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nl8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1417,3042234&dq=ali+hassan+salameh&hl=en|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Observer Reporter|date=23 January 1979|agency=AP|location=Beirut[/tpl] Four bystanders were also killed.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946209,00.html|title=Death of a Terrorist|journal=Time Magazine|date=5 February 1979|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl] In addition, at least 16 people were injured in the blast. Immediately following the operation, the three Mossad officers escaped as well as up to 14 other Mossad agents believed to have been involved in the operation.
