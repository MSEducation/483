Madeley Junction is a railway junction situated between Shifnal and Telford Central on the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line in Shropshire, England.
The junction was controlled from Madeley Junction Signal Box until 2012, which was formerly located in the vee of the junction where the line from Wolverhampton diverges south towards Lightmoor and west towards Telford Central. Prior to its closure, a resignalling scheme saw its area of control extended on 16 December 2002 to cover Wellington, and again on 23 October 2006 with the abolition of Cosford, Codsall and Lightmoor Junction Signal Boxes. This scheme saw the replacement of the traditional mechanical lever frame with a WestCAD VDU control system.
In 2011 Network Rail put forward proposals to close the signal box and transfer control of its lines to the West Midlands Signalling Centre.Network Rail accessed 22 April 2011[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] 
Closure of the signal box occurred in November 2012. Madeley Junction Signal box was demolished on 17 November 2012 and all control transferred to West Midlands Signalling Center in Saltley Birmingham.
