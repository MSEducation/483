[[Cantenna]]

CATEGORIES: Wireless networking, Radio frequency antenna types

A cantenna (a portmanteau blending the words can and antenna) is a homemade directional waveguide antenna, made out of an open-ended metal can.
Cantennas are typically used to increase the range of (or discover) Wi-Fi networks.

==Construction==

The cylinder portion of the can may consist of metal-coated paperboard.
Although some designs are based on a Pringles potato chips can, this tube is too narrow to increase the signal by a useful amount.[tpl]cite web|title=PC FAQ's: Build a 'Cantenna' Aerial|url=http://www.pelaginox.com/pc/pc-cantenna.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411034630/http://www.pelaginox.com/pc/pc-cantenna.html|archivedate=2008-04-11[/tpl] However, a cantenna can be made from various cans or tubes of an appropriate diameter.Wlan antenna Waveguide type (includes table of suitable dimensions for cantenna) Some designs include a pole mount to elevate the cantenna.Cantenna build on a pole (includes construction plans)
At 2.4 GHz, losses can occur if the cable from the cantenna to the Wi-Fi circuitry is too long. A more efficient cantenna can be made by minimising this length or connecting the cantenna directly to the Wi-Fi circuitry.Amateurlogic Episode 3 (Construction details for a more efficient cantenna)

==Use==

Cantennas are typically used for extending a wireless local area network (WLAN).
The tiny design makes them ideal for mobile applications such as wardriving.
Cantennas can be used to increase cell phone range,MAKE: Blog: Cell phone - Cantenna diagram and parts list improve reception, and decrease noise.
A cantenna can be used as a satellite dish feed horn. The 5.5 GHz cantenna dimensions are almost perfect in that they make a perfect fit for the standard TV satellite dish. The resulting setup is a low-cost high-quality high-gain antenna.5.5 GHz cantenna as a satellite dish feed Such setups are widely used in wireless community networks for long-distance Wi-Fi links.
Cantennas may be used with other RF devices such as wireless security cameras.Cantenna.com User Guide
