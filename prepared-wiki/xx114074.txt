CATEGORIES: Preparatory schools in West Sussex

Stoke Brunswick School was a small co-educational day and boarding independent school for children aged 3 to 13 years, situated in Ashurst Wood, West Sussex, near the town of East Grinstead. It was the former junior school (after St. George's School in Ascot, Berkshire), of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (then known as Brunswick School and located in Hove, near Brighton). The last headmaster was Richard Taylor, who took over from Mark Ellerton in 2005. Before closing, the school had 138 pupils. 
Stoke Brunswick School closed in the summer of 2009 because the forecast pupil intake for September was "not adequate".
Despite their best efforts to secure the school's future, including a six figure financial pledge, the parents fell just short of numbers for it to continue.

==History==

The oldest wing of the building, in which the Headmaster resided, dates back to the 14th century and was a hunting lodge belonging to John of Gaunt. The rest of building, built in the 17th century, was originally situated in Cheshire and was called Dutton Hall. It was transported piece by piece to its current location, Homestall, in the 1930s by the Dewar family and became an all-boys school after WWII. The school became co-educational in 1964.
