The Brochet MB.70 was a two-seat light aircraft developed in France in the early 1950s for recreational flying and amateur construction.

==Design and development==

It was a high-wing braced monoplane of conventional configuration that seated the pilot and passenger in tandem within a fully enclosed cabin. It was fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage layout and was of all-wooden construction. Progress was hastened by the publication of a Service de l'Aviation Légère et Sportive requirement for a new light aircraft for French aeroclubs, and a series of development machines were built with a variety of different engines, eventually leading to the definitive Brochet MB.80.Simpson, 2005, p.71
