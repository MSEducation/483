Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint[tpl]cite web |title=Ron Weasley |publisher=Warner Bros. |url=http://harrypotter.warnerbros.co.uk/gobletoffire/master/index.html |accessdate=8 June 2011 (Note: Click appropriate actor's image, click "Actor Bio")[/tpl] (born 24 August 1988) is an English actor who rose to prominence playing Ron Weasley, one of the three main characters in the Harry Potter film series. Grint was cast as Ron Weasley at the age of 11, having previously acted only in school plays and at his local theatre group. From 2001 to 2011, he starred in all eight Harry Potter films alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson.
Beginning in 2002, Grint began to work outside of the Harry Potter franchise, playing a co-leading role in Thunderpants. He has had starring roles in Driving Lessons, a dramedy released in 2006, and Cherrybomb, a small budgeted drama of limited release in 2010. Grint co-starred with Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt in Wild Target, a comedy. His first project following the end of the Harry Potter series was the 2012 anti-war film, Into the White, in which he has a supporting role. In 2013, Grint's new film CBGB was released and he has been cast in CBS's new pilot Super Clyde. Grint made his stage debut in Jez Butterworth's Mojo in October 2013 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London.

==Early life==

Grint was born in Harlow, Essex. His mother, Joanne Grint (née Parsons), is a housewife, and his father, Nigel Grint, is a memorabilia dealer. Grint is the eldest of five siblings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/02/AR2006110200428.html |first=Michael |last=O'Sullivan |title=Rupert Grint: In the Driver's Seat Now |work=The Washington Post |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl] He attended St Joseph's Primary School in Hertford, a Roman Catholic primary school. While there, Grint took an avid interest in theatre. He started performing in school productions and joined the Top Hat Stage and Screen School, a local theatre group that cast him as a fish in Noah's Ark and a donkey in another nativity play. He continued performing in school plays as he moved up to Richard Hale School. However, Grint had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series. At the age of 16, he left school[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3666174/How-Harry-Potter-and-friends-grew-up.html |title=How Harry Potter and friends grew up |first=John |last=Hiscock |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |location=London[/tpl] to focus on his acting career. "I didn't really like school that much," the actor later commented.

==Career==

===Harry Potter (2001–11)===

Starting in 2000, casting began for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling novel written by author J. K. Rowling. Rowling personally insisted that the cast be British and assisted Susie Figgis and director Chris Columbus in casting the roles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034099p1.html |title=Chris Columbus Talks Potter |accessdate=6 June 2011 |first=Brian |last=Linder |date=30 March 2000 |work=IGN[/tpl] Grint chose to try out for the role of protagonist Ron Weasley, one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts, because he had ginger-coloured hair, and was a fan of the book series. Having seen a Newsround report about the open casting, he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the role. His attempt was successful as the casting team asked for a meeting with him.[tpl]cite news|last=Palmer|first=Martyn|title=When Danny Met Harry |work=The Times |location=UK |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=3 November 2001 |pages=28–30 (Times Magazine supplement)[/tpl] On 8 August 2000, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and an 11-year-old Grint were selected to play the roles of Harry, Hermione Granger, and Ron, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.warnerbros.com/pub/movie/releases/harrycast.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070404184713/http://movies.warnerbros.com/pub/movie/releases/harrycast.html|archivedate=4 April 2007 |publisher=Warner Bros. |title=Daniel Radcliffeyes, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson Bring Harry, Ron and Hermione to Life for Warner Bros.

Breaking records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings, it was the highest-grossing film of that year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2001&p=.htm |title=2001 Worldwide Grosses |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] With a total of US$974 million in its theatrical run, Philosopher's Stone stands as the second most commercially successful entry in the series. It was also critically well-received, scoring mainly positive reviews from critics. However, a number or critics found the adaption staying faithful to the book to be both its best and worst quality. Grint won a Satellite Award in the category of "Outstanding New Talent", and a Young Artist Award for "Most Promising Young Newcomer".
A year later, Grint again starred as Ron in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), the second instalment of the series. The film opened to positive reviews and critics generally enjoyed the lead actors' performances. Both Los Angeles Times and New York Magazine observed that Grint and his peers had matured between films,[tpl]cite news |title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051228225730/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan15nov15,0,1767241.story |archivedate=28 December 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2007 |date=15 November 2002 |first=Kenneth |last=Turan |work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] with the latter pointing out that Grint had become "more proficient" and said they missed "the amateurish ardour" the actor and Watson carried in Philosopher's Stone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/n_7986/ |title=Chamber Made |first=Peter |last=Rainer |work=New York Magazine |publisher=New York Media LLC |date=16 January 2003 |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was released on 31 May in the UK. The film sees all three of its lead characters hover on the brink of adolescence, "and while they look braver and more capable than before, the dangers they face seem far more grave and their own vulnerability more intense."[tpl]cite news |title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Film review |work=The New York Times |author=A.

In 2005, Grint reprised his role again for the fourth film in the series[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The adaptation, unlike previous films, explored romantic elements and included more humour. In a 2005 interview with IGN, all three lead actors singled out the humour as being a reason for the film's success.[tpl]cite web |title=Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/667/667146p2.html|date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=6 June 2011 |work=IGN[/tpl] This project was directed by Mike Newell. According to the actor, the director was "really loud and not afraid to swear at you, but he was really cool." Goblet of Fire stands as one of the best reviewed instalments within the series, and is noted for the maturity and sophistication of its characters, darker and more complex plotline, writing and performances of the lead actors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire/ |title=Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise, was released to cinemas in 2007. A huge financial success, Order of the Phoenix set a record worldwide opening-weekend gross of US$394 million, superseding Spider-Man 3 as the title holder.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/worldwideopenings.htm |title=All Time worldwide opening records |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=25 September 2007[/tpl] This entry was directed by a new filmmaker, David Yates,[tpl]cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/pr/?id=1657&p=.htm |title=David Yates to Direct 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' |work=Box Office Mojo |date=19 January 2005 |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] who would continue to direct all of the following movies.

On 15 July 2009, the series's sixth instalment, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released. This adaptation revolved around more being learnt about Lord Voldemort's dark past. It did considerably better financially than the previous film, again setting new box office records.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1616302/harry-potter-breaks-midnight-records.jhtml |title='Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' Breaks Midnight Records |work=MTV |date=15 July 2009 |first=Adam |last=Rosenberg |accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2604&p=.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |first=Brandon |last=Grey |title=Sixth ‘Harry Potter’ Posts Franchise-Best Opening Day |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl] In its total theatrical run, Half-Blood Prince totalled in US$933 million ticket sales. Also, Half-Blood Prince remains one of the most positively reviewed entries within the series among film critics, who praised the film's "emotionally satisfying" story, direction, cinematography, visuals and music.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince/news/1831803/tomatometer_watch_how_good_is_harry_potter_and_the_half-blood_prince/ |title=How Good is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? |first=Jen |last=Yamato |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince |title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=2 June 2011[/tpl] Grint observed a change in Ron in this entry, pointing out that his once insecure, often overshadowed character started to become more secure and even began to show a dark side of himself. The actor found it fun to personify a more emotional Ron. Between 2009 and 2010, his work received three nominations, including one win[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo.
Despite the success of the past films, the future of the franchise was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1553722/20070302/story.jhtml |title=Harry Potter Will Be Played by Daniel Radcliffe in Final Two Flicks |date=2 March 2007 |work=MTV |accessdate=28 May 2011[/tpl] However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments.[tpl]Cite news |title=Gang's all here |work=New York Times |date=24 March 2007 |first=Peter |last=Edidin[/tpl] For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=22200 |title=Potter Producer Talks Deathly Hallows |accessdate=6 June 2011 |date=14 March 2008 |first=Olly |last=Richards |publisher=Bauer Consumer Media |work=Empire[/tpl] with filming concluding in June 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641985/daniel-radcliffe-recalls-weeping-during-final-harry-potter-shoot.jhtml |first=Eric |last=Ditzian |title=Daniel Radcliffe Recalls 'Weeping' During Final 'Harry Potter' Shoot |work=MTV |date=21 June 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2011[/tpl] After completing the final film he said: "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over. ...

===Other work (2002–present)===

In 2002, Grint starred in his first non-Harry Potter film: Thunderpants, which revolves around Patrick (played by Bruce Cook) whose remarkable capacity for flatulence scores him a job as an astronaut. In this film, Grint portrayed the co-lead, Alan, an anosmic boy who is Patrick's only friend. It was generally ignored by critics and audiences alike. Most of the critics that did take notice of Thunderpants did not respond well to it, with one writing: "This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return."[tpl]cite news |title=Review: Thunderpants |first=Ian |last=Waldron-Mantgani |publisher=UK Critic |date=28 May 2002[/tpl] Another film he appeared in was Driving Lessons, a comedy-drama released in 2006, where he starred opposite Julie Walters. The film was met with a mixed reception by critics, but his portrayal of an oppressed teenaged boy was generally praised. "Grint, on the other hand, is a revelation", who "displays an innate naturalness mixed with personal charisma that turn a potentially pathetic Christian freak into a humorous, thoroughly likable – if more than a little awkward – young man", wrote Alt Film Guide's Andre Soares.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/film-reviews/driving-lessons-jeremy-brock/ |title=DRIVING LESSONS – Rupert Grint, Julie Walters |publisher=Alt Film Guide |date=28 September 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl]
In July 2008, it was announced that Grint would star in the independent  thriller Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon.
Grint found shooting this film very different from the Harry Potter films since he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day. Grint's character[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Malachy, a worker at Belfast[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] goes to great lengths to impress his boss's daughter, whom he is infatuated with.
