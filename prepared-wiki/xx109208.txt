State Route 165 (SR 165) is a state highway near the southern end of the U.S. state of Nevada. The road connects the town of Nelson to U.S. Route 95. The road originated in the 1940s and was one section of former State Route 60 until the 1970s.

Although the small community is still inhabited, the remains of many mining operations and abandoned structures can still be seen in the vicinity.[tpl]cite book|last=Moreno|first=Richard|title=Roadside History of Nevada|year=2000|publisher=Mountain Press Publishing Company|location=Missoula|isbn=0-87842-410-5|pages=259â€“260[/tpl]

==History==

The route first appears on state highway maps in 1941 as part of State Route 60, a three-pronged route with each spoke connecting to the town of Nelson.  The [tpl]convert|16|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] northwest leg connected to US 95 about [tpl]convert|4|mi|km[/tpl] south of Boulder City while the [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] southwest leg reached US 95 further south via the Nelson Cutoff Road. The third leg of SR 60 ran east from Nelson [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] to the Colorado River.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Road Map of the State of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/hmaps&CISOPTR=577&REC=15 |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |year=1941 |accessdate=28 June 2008[/tpl] Both the northwest and eastern legs of the route were completely paved by 1951.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/hmaps&CISOPTR=584&REC=3 |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |year=1951 |accessdate=28 June 2008[/tpl]
