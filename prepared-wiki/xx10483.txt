Robben Island ([tpl]lang-af|Robbeneiland[/tpl]) is an island in Table Bay, 6.9 km west of the coast of Bloubergstrand, Cape Town, South Africa. The name is Dutch for "seal island". Robben Island is roughly oval in shape, 3.3 km long north-south, and 1.9 km wide, with an area of 5.07 km². It is flat and only a few metres above sea level, as a result of an ancient erosion event. The island is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks belonging to the Malmesbury Group. 
Robben Island is internationally known for the fact that Nobel Laureate and former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island for 18 of the 27 years he served behind bars before the fall of apartheid.

==History==

Since the end of the 17th century, Robben Island has been used for the isolation of mainly political prisoners. The Dutch settlers were the first to use Robben Island as a prison. Its first prisoner was probably Harry die strandloper (Autshumao) in the mid-17th century. Among its early permanent inhabitants were political leaders from various Dutch colonies, including Indonesia, and the leader of the mutiny on the slave ship Meermin. 
After the British Royal Navy captured several Dutch East Indiamen at the battle of Saldanha Bay in 1781, a boat rowed out to meet the British warships. On board were the "kings of Ternate and Tidore, and the princes of the respective families". The Dutch had long held them on "Isle Robin", but then had moved them to Saldanha Bay.The New Annual Register, Or General Repository of History ...,  (October 1781), Vol. 2, p.90.
In 1806 John Murray opened a whaling station at a sheltered bay on the north-eastern shore of the island which became known as Murray's Bay, adjacent to the site of the present-day harbour named Murray's Bay Harbour which was constructed in 1939–40.[tpl]cite book|last=Peires|first=Jeffrey B.|title=The Dead Will Arise: Nongqawuse and the Great Xhosa Cattle Killing Movement of 1856–7|year=1989|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253205247|page=301|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=Xrey5fkzMkwC&dq[/tpl][tpl]cite book|editor=Deacon, Harriet|title=The Island: A History of Robben Island, 1488–1990|year=1996|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=9780864862990|url=http://books.google.co.za/books?id=z8k4sN5GSpYC|pages=4–5[/tpl]

The island was also used as a leper colony and animal quarantine station.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14426|title=London to Ladysmith via Pretoria|author=Winston Churchill|year=1900|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London|accessdate=2008-10-10|authorlink=Winston Churchill[/tpl] Starting in 1845 lepers from the Hemel-en-Aarde (heaven and earth) leper colony near Caledon were moved to Robben Island when Hemel-en-Aarde was found unsuitable as a leper colony. Initially this was done on a voluntary basis and the lepers were free to leave the island if they so wished.[tpl]cite book|last=Newman|first=George|title=Prize essays on leprosy|publisher=London: The Society|year=1895|page=194|url=http://www.archive.org/details/prizeessaysonlep00news[/tpl]  In April 1891 the cornerstones for 11 new buildings to house lepers were laid. After the introduction of the Leprosy Repression Act in May 1892 admission was no longer voluntary and the movement of the lepers was restricted. Prior to 1892 an average of about 25 lepers a year were admitted to Robben Island, but in 1892 that number rose to 338, and in 1893 a further 250 were admitted.[tpl]cite book|last=Newman|first=George|title=Prize essays on leprosy|publisher=London : The Society|year=1895|page=206|url=http://www.archive.org/details/prizeessaysonlep00news[/tpl]
During the Second World War the island was fortified and BL 9.2-inch guns and 6-inch guns were installed as part of the defences for Cape Town. 
Robben Island was used as a prison for political prisoners and convicted criminals from 1961. It was a maximum security prison for political prisoners until 1991. The medium security prison for criminal prisoners was closed in 1996.Chronology, Robben Island Museum website, retrieved 8 June 2013
In the South African general election, 2009, the Democratic Alliance won the island.

==Maritime peril==

Robben Island and nearby Whale Rock[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gCk6YV5AslIC|title=The India Directory, Or Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China, Australia and the Interjacent Ports|page=71|author=James Horsburgh|year=1852|publisher=W. H. Allen & Co.[/tpl] have been the nemeses of many a ship and its crew. The surf of the open Atlantic Ocean thunders continuously at its margins and any vessel wrecked on the reefs offshore is soon beaten to pieces and disappears. In the latter half of the 17th century a Dutch ship laden with gold coins earmarked for the payment of the salaries of employees of the Dutch East India Company in Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) disintegrated on these reefs a short distance offshore, in relatively shallow but very restless waters.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The gold today would be worth tens of millions of euros or US dollars. A few coins have washed ashore over the centuries but the treasure itself remains in the ocean. It is protected largely by the almost ceaseless and violent surf. Many other vessels have been wrecked around the island.

==Today==

Today the island is a popular tourist destination and was declared a World Heritage Site in 1999. It is reached by ferry from the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town and is open throughout the year, weather permitting, and tours of the island and prison are led by guides who were formerly prisoners there. Robben Island Museum (RIM) operates as a site or living museum.  All the land on the island is owned by the State, with the exception of the island church.

===Robben Island lighthouse===

Jan van Riebeeck first set a navigation aid at the top of Fire Hill (now Minto Hill), the highest point on the island. Huge bonfires were lit at night to warn VOC ships of the rocks that surround the island. The current Robben Island lighthouse, built on Minto Hill in 1864,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=_8BBAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA275|title=The Seaman's Guide to the Navigation of the Indian Ocean and China Sea|author=William Henry Rosser, James Frederick Imray|page=280|year=1867|accessdate=2008-10-04|publisher=J.

It is the only South African lighthouse to utilise a flashing light instead of a revolving light.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] Its light is visible for 24 nautical miles.Robben Island Lighthouse

===Moturu Kramat===

The Moturu Kramat, a sacred site for Muslim pilgrimage on Robben Island, was built in 1969 to commemorate Sayed Abdurahman Moturu, the Prince of Madura. Moturu, one of Cape Town's first imams, who was exiled to the island in the mid-1740s and died there in 1754. Muslim political prisoners would pay homage at the shrine before leaving the island.

==Animal life==

When the Dutch arrived in the area in 1652, the only large animals on the island were seals and birds, principally penguins. In 1654, the settlers released rabbits on the island to provide a ready source of meat for passing ships.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xzIPAAAAYAAJ|title=History of South Africa Under the Administration of the Dutch East India Company (1652 to 1795)|page=442|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein|year=1897|accessdate=2008-10-10|author=George McCall Theal[/tpl] The original colony of African Penguins on the island was completely exterminated by 1800. However the modern day island is once again an important breeding area for the species after a new colony established itself there in 1983.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/stats/adu/robben.htm|title=Robben Island|author=Les Underhill |publisher=Avian Demography Unit, University of Cape Town|accessdate=2008-10-12[/tpl] The colony has grown to 13,000 and is now the third largest for the species. The penguins are easy to see close up in their natural habitat and are therefore a popular tourist attraction.
Around 1958, Lieutenant Peter Klerck, a naval officer serving on the island, introduced various animals. The following extract of an article, written by Michael Klerck who lived on the island from an early age, describes the fauna life there:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.robbenisland.org|publisher=www.robbenisland.org|title=Robben Island: Childhood Memories—a personal reflection|author=Michael Klerck|accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl]

There may be 25,000 rabbits on the island. Humans are hunting and culling the rabbits to reduce their number.BBC News. Robben Island is 'under threat'. 31 October 2009.
