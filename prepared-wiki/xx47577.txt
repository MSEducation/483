Koreatown (Hangul: 맨해튼 코리아타운) is an ethnic Korean enclave in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, centered on the block of West 32nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.

==Historical background==

The Koreatown area of Manhattan is primarily a Korean business district, but in recent years, the district has seen an increase in Korean and European traffic as well,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/realestate/19livi.html?pagewanted=all|title=Living In Koreatown Exotic Flavor, Beyond Just the Food|first=Deborah|last=Baldwin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 17, 2008|accessdate=October 4, 2013[/tpl] and the resident Korean population in the area has grown concomitantly. There was never a formal plan or agreement to create a Korean commercial district in Manhattan. However, given the high tourist traffic stemming from its proximity to the Empire State Building, Macy's Herald Square, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Garment District, and the Flower District, amongst other Midtown Manhattan landmarks, it was an ideal[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] location for Korean immigrants to settle. Initiated by the opening of a Korean bookstore and a handful of restaurants in the 1980s, Koreatown sprang into being. With their success, an additional stream of Korean-owned businesses took root in the neighborhood, coinciding with increased immigration from Korea; and with rising demand for the prime location, overall property values in the area increased as well.

==Demography==

According to the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Manhattan (co-extensive with New York County) had nearly doubled to approximately 20,000 over the decade since the 2000 Census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36061lk.html|title=New York County, New York QuickLinks|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-05-21[/tpl] Along with the Koreatowns in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey (in Palisades Park and Fort Lee) and Long Island (Flushing, Queens) in New York, Manhattan's Koreatown serves as the nexus for an overall Korean American population of 218,764 individuals in the New York City Metropolitan Area,[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1|title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA CSA|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-06-29[/tpl] the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside of Korea.

==Korea Way==

The heart of Koreatown is the segment of 32nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, officially nicknamed "Korea Way". Though only one city block long, Korea Way features stores on multiple stories, with small, independently run establishments reaching up to the third or fourth floors, including restaurants, exuding an ambience of Seoul itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/1146050--seoul-searching-in-manhattan-s-koreatown|title=Seoul-searching in Manhattan’s Koreatown|publisher=Copyright 2001-2012, Free Daily News Group Inc|author=Rebecca Finkel|date=2012-06-20|accessdate=2012-10-03[/tpl] The New York City Korean Chamber of Commerce estimates there to be more than 100 small businesses on Korea Way.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-10-03/news/27076919_1_korean-barbecue-galbi-seoul|title=Your Nabe: From barbecue to karaoke, your guide to Koreatown|last=Yi|first=David|date=3 October 2010|work=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl]
