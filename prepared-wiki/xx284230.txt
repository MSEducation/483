==Education==

He obtained his PhD from Trinity College, Dublin in molecular genetics in 1983. Following post-doctoral research into foot-and-mouth disease virus at the Animal Virus Research Laboratory in Pirbright and molecular technologies at Corporate Research, Amersham International, he became a Senior Research fellow (1989) and a Senior Lecturer (1995) at the London Hospital Medical College.

==Career==

Following the merger with St Bartholomew's Medical College and Queen Mary University of London he was promoted to Reader in Molecular Medicine in 2002, followed by the award of a personal chair as Professor of Molecular Science in 2004 at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/faculties/fhsce/about/staff/a-z/stephen_bustin.html | title=Stephen Bustin | publisher=Anglia Ruskin University | accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]

==Research==

His research group’s general areas of interest are the small and large bowel, as well as colorectal cancer with particular emphasis on investigating the process of invasion and metastasis. An important aim is to translate molecular techniques into clinical practice by including molecular parameters into clinical tumor staging.[tpl]cite web | url=http://webinar.sciencemag.org/webinar/archive/future-qpcr | title=The future of qPCR | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science | date=30 September 2010 | accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] To this end, Bustin has published many papers on PCR techniques,[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nprot.2006.236[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1042/CS20050086[/tpl] in particular reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the subject of his most cited paper, published in 2000.[tpl]cite doi|10.1677/jme.0.0250169[/tpl]

==Autism omnibus trial==

Bustin testified on behalf of the Department of Justice in the autism omnibus trial about what he stated was the unreliability of the O'Leary lab's results with regard to testing for contamination. Bustin describes his conclusions with regard to the lab's alleged detection of measles virus RNA as follows: "My clear conclusion then was that O'Leary's results were caused by defective experimental technique and inappropriate interpretation of results, since he was detecting DNA, and measles virus does not exist as DNA."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/09/medical-research-mmr-vaccine | title=Fading Claims of MMR Link to Autism | publisher=The Guardian | date=8 December 2008 | accessdate=11 August 2013 | author=Bustin, Stephen[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/3562#.UqqNEWRDuAA | title=‘The MMR-autism theory? There’s nothing in it’ | work=Spiked Online | date=4 July 2007 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Fitzpatrick, Michael[/tpl] Bustin was described as "one of the most highly qualified and credible expert witnesses I Special Master have ever encountered." In addition to his testimony, Bustin published an analysis of Andrew Wakefield's 2002 study in the journal Molecular Pathology. This analysis, like Bustin's testimony, concluded that "The only conclusion possible is that the assays were detecting contaminating DNA. Since MeV is an RNA-only virus and never exists in DNA form, these data must be ignored and it is my opinion that the authors should withdraw this publication from the peer-reviewed literature."[tpl]cite doi|10.5772/52844[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=A History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | author=Feinstein, Adam | year=2010 | pages=227[/tpl]
