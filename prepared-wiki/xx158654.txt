==Route description==

MD 376 begins at an intersection with MD 818 (Main Street) in Berlin.  After intersecting the southern end of unsigned MD 377 (Williams Street), the state highway heads east as two-lane Bay Street east to U.S. Route 113 (Worcester Highway) and leaves the town of Berlin upon traversing Hudson Branch.  The highway's name changes to Assateague Road and MD 376 continues southeast through farmland and forest, intersecting Sinepuxent Road after crossing Trappe Creek.  The state highway spans Ayres Creek before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 611 (Stephen Decatur Highway) in Lewis Corner.
