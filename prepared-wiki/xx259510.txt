[[Oxidoreductase FAD-binding domain]]

CATEGORIES: Protein domains, Single-pass transmembrane proteins

 
The oxidoreductase FAD-binding domain  is an evolutionary conserved protein domain.
To date, the 3D-structures of the flavoprotein domain of Zea mays nitrate reductase[tpl]cite journal |author=Lindqvist Y, Schneider G, Campbell WH, Lu G |title=Crystal structure of the FAD-containing fragment of corn nitrate reductase at 2.5 A resolution: relationship to other flavoprotein reductases |journal=Structure |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=809–821 |year=1994 |pmid=7812715[/tpl] and of pig NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase[tpl]cite journal |author=Miki K, Nishida H, Inaka K, Yamanaka M, Kaida S, Kobayashi K |title=Crystal structure of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from pig liver at 2.4 A resolution |journal=Biochemistry |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=2763–2767 |year=1995 |pmid=7893687 |doi=10.1021/bi00009a004[/tpl] have been solved. The overall fold is similar to that of ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase:[tpl]cite journal |author=Karplus PA, Bruns CM |title=Structure-function relations for ferredoxin reductase |journal=J. Bioenerg.
