[[Flag of Niue]]

CATEGORIES: Niuean culture, National flags, Southern Cross Flags

The flag of Niue was adopted on October 15, 1975. It consists of the Union Jack in the upper left corner with a star in the middle of the Union Jack and four stars forming a diamond around it. It is very unusual for a flag based on a British ensign design, in having not only a yellow background, but also a defaced Union Jack in the canton.William Crampton (1994) The World of Flags, Rand Mcnally ISBN 0528837206

==Symbolism==

The symbolism represented by the flag is described in the Act.  The Union Jack symbolises the protection granted by the United Kingdom in 1900 after petitioning by the Kings and Chiefs of Niue.  The golden yellow is inspired by the bright sunshine of Niue and also said to symbolise the warm feelings of the Niuean people towards New Zealand and her people.  The association with New Zealand, which took over responsibility and administration of Niue in 1901, is also represented by the four small stars that depict the Southern Cross. Finally the blue disc containing a larger star represents the deep blue sea surrounding the self-governing island of Niue.
