The Peacock Throne (Hindustani: تخت طاؤس, मयूरासन: Mayūrāsana, [tpl]lang-fa|تخت طاووس[/tpl], Takht-i Tāvūs) was a famous jewelled throne that was the seat of the Mughal emperors of India. It was commissioned in the early 17th century by emperor Shah Jahan and was located in the Red Fort of Delhi. The original throne was subsequently captured and taken as a war trophy in 1739 by the Persian ruler Nader Shah, and has been lost ever since. A 2000 report by The Tribune, estimated the value of the Peakcock Throne at $810 million USD (Rs 4.5 billion).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000130/spectrum/main7.htm|title=As priceless as the Peacock Throne|author=K.R.N.

A replacement throne based on the original was commissioned afterwards and existed until the Indian rebellion of 1857.

==History==

Shah Jahan ruled in what is considered the Golden Age of the vast Mughal Empire, which covered almost all of the Indian subcontinent. It was ruled from the newly constructed capital of Shahjahanabad and the fabled imperial citadel Red Fort, with its marble and golden halls bedecked in jewels and silk, perfumed water fountains and canals running, surrounded by fragrant gardens. Sumptuous feasts, religious festivals, extravagant receptions for state guests, with innumerous artists and musicians, a large zenana and thousands of soldiers, courtiers and servants who ensured for a colourful and joyful life far away from everyday worries. The focus around which everything revolved was the emperor, where he gave audiences and received petitioners. The court and its ruler was a mirror image of paradise on earth, in the very centre of the empire. Amongst the various titles he carried, such as Great King (پادشاه, Badshah), he was also the Shadow of God (Zill-i-Allahi), making him the executor of God's will. The sovereign therefore also held a court of justice. It was therefore necessary to have a proper seat or Throne of Solomon (تخت سليمان, Takht-e-Sulaiman) to underscore his position of the just king. Just like Solomon's throne, the Peacock Throne was to be covered in gold and jewelled, with steps leading up to it, with the ruler floating above ground and closer to heaven. 
Since the imperial treasury at that point was full of precious jewels, Shah Jahan had ample resources and decided to put the jewels and pearls into a more public use. Said Gilani and his workmen from the imperial goldsmiths' department were commissioned with the construction of this new throne. It took seven years to complete. Large amounts of solid gold, precious stones and pearls were used, creating a masterful piece of Mughal workmanship that was unsurpassed before or after its creation. It was an opulent indulgence that could only be seen by a small minority of courtiers, aristocrats and visiting dignitaries. The throne was even for the Golden Age Mughal standards supremely extravagant and cost twice as much as the construction of the Taj Mahal.[tpl]cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url=[tpl]Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=207|plainurl=yes[/tpl] |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= [/tpl]http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book3.htm The appearance of the throne was in stark contrast to the older throne of Jahangir, a large rectangular slab of engraved black basalt constructed in the early 1600s, used by the father of Shah Jahan. 
It did initially not carry a name and was simply known as the "Jewelled Throne" or "Ornamented Throne" (Takht-Murassa). It received its name from later historians because of the peacock statues featured on it.
It was inaugurated with a triumphant ceremony on 22 March 1635, the seventh formal anniversary of 
Shah Jahan's accession.[tpl]cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url=[tpl]Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=205|plainurl=yes[/tpl] |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= [/tpl] The date was chosen by astrologers and was doubly auspicious, since it coincided exactly with Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan, and Nowruz, the Persian Spring festival. The emperor and the court were returning from Kashmir and it was determined that the third day of Nowruz would be the most auspicious day for him to enter the capital and take his seat on the throne.[tpl]cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url=[tpl]Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=205-207|plainurl=yes[/tpl] |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= [/tpl]Muhammad Baqir.

Muhammad Qudsi, the emperor's favourite poet, was chosen to compose twenty verses that were inscribed in emerald and green enamel on the throne. He praised the matchless skill of the artisans, the "heaven-depleting grandeur" of its gold and jewels, mentioning the date in the letters of the phrase "the throne of the just king".Aurang shahinshah adil (1+6+200+50+20, 300+1+5+50+300+1+5, 70+1+4+30=AH 1044)
Poet Abu-Talib Kalim was given six pieces of gold for each verse in his poem of sixty-three couplets.[tpl]cite book |last=Nicoll |first=Fergus |year=2009 |title=Shah Jahan |url=[tpl]Google books|KfkCTTcvKGwC|Shah Jahan|page=208|plainurl=yes[/tpl] |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978 0670083039 |accessdate= [/tpl]
The master goldsmith Said Gilani was summoned by the emperor and showered with honours, including with his weight in gold coins and given the title "Peerless Master" (Bibadal Khan). Gilani produced a poem with 134 couplets, filled with chronograms. The first twelve reveal the date of the emperor's birth, the following thirty-two the date of his first coronation, then the ninety couplets giving the date of the throne's inauguration.

After Shah Jahan's, his son Aurangzeb, who carried the title Alamgir, ascended the Peacock Throne. He was the last of the strong Mughal emperors and after his death in 1707, his son Bahadur Shah I reigned from 1707-1712. Bahadur Shah I was able to keep the empire stable and relaxed religious policy, however after his death the empire was in inexorable decline. A series of political instabilities, military defeats and court intrigues brought and fell a number of emperors: Jahandar Shah ruled for one year from 1712–1713, Farrukhsiyar from 1713–1719, Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II only for a couple of months in 1719. By the time Muhammad Shah came to power, Mughal power was in serious decline and the empire became more vulnerable. Nevertheless under the generous patronage of Muhammad Shah, the court at Delhi became again a beacon of the arts and culture. Administrative reforms could not however stop the later Mughal-Maratha Wars, which greatly sapped the imperial forces. It was only a question of time until forces from neighbouring Persia saw their chance to invade.
Nadir Shah's invasion of India culminated in the Battle of Karnal on February 13, 1739 and the defeat of Muhammad Shah. Nadir Shah entered Delhi and sacked the city, in which course tens of thousands of inhabitants were massacred. Persian troops left Delhi at the beginning of May 1739, taking with them the throne as a war trophy with many other treasures, amounting to a large reduction in Indian wealth and an irreplaceable loss of cultural goods and treasures. Among the known precious stones that Nadir Shah looted were the Akbar Shah diamond, Great Mogul diamond, Great Table diamond, Koh-i-Noor, Shah diamond, as well as the Samarian spinel and the Timur ruby. These stones were either part of the Peacock Throne or other thrones, or were in possession of the Mughal emperors. The Akbar Shah was said to form one of the eyes of a peacock,http://www.farlang.com/diamonds/streeter_great_diamonds/page_200 as well as the Koh-i-Noor.http://www.farlang.com/diamonds/streeter_great_diamonds/page_113 The Shah diamond was described by Tavernier as being on the side of the throne.http://www.farlang.com/diamonds/mccarthy-fire-earth/page_128 Many of these stones ended up becoming part of the Persian crown jewels or were taken later by the British colonialists.
When Nadir Shah was assassinated by his own officers on June 19, 1747, the throne disappeared, most probably being dismantled or destroyed for its valuables in the ensuing chaos.James Fraser. ''Narrative of a Journey into Khorasan in the years 1821 and 1822 (n.p., 1825), p. 43, cited in Baqir "Peacock Throne", 34-41 One of the unsubstantiated rumours claimed the throne was given to the Ottoman Sultan,Mehmet Onder - Antika - The Turkish Journal of Collectable Art, May 1985, Issue: 2 however in reality this could be a minor throne produced in Persia and given as a gift. Persian emperor Fath-Ali Shah commissioned the Sun Throne to be constructed in the early 19th century for him. The Sun Throne has the shape of a platform just like the Peacock Throne. Some rumours claim that parts of the original Peacock Throne were used in its construction, however there is no evidence to that. Over time the Sun Throne was erroneously referred to as the Peacock Throne, a term that was later appropriated initially by the West as a metonym for the Persian monarchy. No proofed parts of the original Peacock Throne survived and the throne has been lost forever. Only some of diamonds and precious stones that are attributed to it have survived and been re-worked.
A replacement throne was probably constructed after the Persian invasion for the Mughal emperor, which closely resembled the original.Swany, K.R.N. "As priceless as the Peacock Throne," The Tribune (India). January 30, 2000. The throne was located on the eastern side of the Divan-i-Khas, towards the windows. This throne however was also lost, possibly during or after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent looting and the large-scale destruction of the Red Fort by the occupying British colonialists. The marble pedestal on which it rested in the Divan-i-Khas has survived and can still be seen today.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdqTV5ut4m4
In 1908, the New York Times reported that Caspar Purdon Clarke, Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, obtained what was purported to be a marble leg from the pedestal of the throne.[tpl]cite news|author= |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1EFC395A17738DDDAF0A94DF405B888CF1D3 |title=INDIAN TREASURE FOR METROPOLITAN - Sir Purdon Clarke Has Purchased Pedestal of Peacock Throne of Great Mogul.

Where exactly these two pedestals originate from however and if they are connected to the Peacock Throne at all remains unclear.
Inspired by the legend of the throne, King Ludwig II of Bavaria installed a romanticised version of it in his Moorish Kiosk in Linderhof Palace, constructed in the 1860s.

==Description==

The contemporary descriptions that are known today of Shah Jahan's throne are from the historian Abdul Hamid Lahori, 'Inayat Khan, the French travellers François Bernier and Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. No known painting that would their descriptions exist of the throne.
Abdul Hamid Lahori (d. 1654) describes in the Padshahnama the creation of the throne under Shah Jahan:[tpl]cite book |last=Koch |first=Ebba |year=1997 |title=King of the world: the Padshahnama : an imperial Mughal manuscript from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle |url=[tpl]Google books|O4VIAQAAIAAJ|King of the world: the Padshahnama : an imperial Mughal manuscript from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle|page=|plainurl=yes[/tpl] |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |isbn=978-1898592105 |accessdate= [/tpl]

The following is the account given of the throne in the Shahjahannama of 'Inayat Khan:
[tpl]quote|The Nauroz of the year 1044 fell on the 'Id-i fitr, when His Majesty was to take his seat on the new jewelled throne. This gorgeous structure, with a canopy supported on twelve pillars, measured three yards and a half in length, two and a half in breadth, and five in height, from the flight of steps to the overhanging dome. On his Majesty's accession to the throne, he had commanded that eighty-six lakhs worth of gems and precious stones, and a diamond worth fourteen lakhs, which together make a crore of rupees as money is reckoned in Hindustan, should he used in its decoration. It was completed in seven years, and among the precious stones was a ruby worth a lakh of rupees that Shah 'Abbas Safavi had sent to the late Emperor, on which were inscribed the names of the great Timur Sahih-Kiran, etc.[tpl]cite book |last=Khan |first='Inayat |year=1990 |title=The Shah Jahan nama of 'Inayat Khan: an abridged history of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, compiled by his royal librarian : the nineteenth-century manuscript translation of A.R.

The French physician and traveller François Bernier described in his Travels in the Mogul Empire A.D. 1656-1668 the throne in the Diwan-i-Khas:

The French jeweller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier made sixth voyage to India between 1663 and 1668. It was a great privilege that he was invited to visit the court at Delhi by emperor Aurangzeb himself, where he remained as his guest for two months from September 12, 1665 to November 11, 1665.
The main purpose of Tavernier's invitation to court was for the emperor to inspect the jewels Tavernier had brought from the west, with an interest of purchasing them. During this visit Tavernier not only sold several jewels to the emperor and his uncle Jafar Khan, but established a close relationship with the emperor that allowed him to stay longer in Delhi. He was invited to stay on until the conclusion of the emperor's annual birthday celebrations, and he also got the opportunity to inspect the jewelled thrones in the Red Fort, including the Peacock Throne. He was also given the opportunity to inspect the valuable jewels and stones belonging to the emperor, but was not able to see those still kept by Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned at Agra Fort. A few months after Tavernier inspected the jewels in Aurangzeb's possession, Shah Jahan died in January 1666 and Aurangzeb claimed the remaining inheritance.
Tavernier gives a detailed description of the Peacock Throne in his book Les Six Voyages de J. B. Tavernier, published in 1676 in two volumes. His descriptions of the Peacock Throne are the most comprehensive account available to modern historians to date. The account of the throne appears in Chapter VIII of Volume II, in which he describes the preparations for the emperor's annual birthday festival, during which he is solemnly weighed every year in gold coins, and also about the splendour of his thrones and the magnificence of his court.

Tavernier however describes seeing the throne in what is probably the Diwan-i-Am. One of the theories is that the throne was sometimes moved between the two halls, depending on the occasion. He further describes five other thrones in the Diwan-i-Khas.

===Discrepancies in description===

The descriptions of Lahori from before 1648, and Tavernier's published in 1676 are generally in broad agreement on the most important features of the thrones, such as its rectangular shape, standing on four legs at its corners, the 12 columns on which the canopy rests, and the type of gemstones embedded on the throne, such as balas rubies, emeralds, pearls, diamonds and other coloured stones. There are however some significant differences in the two descriptions:
Apart from the significant differences between the two accounts given above, there are several details given in Lahori's account, which are not mentioned in Tavernier's, and vice versa.

===Lahori's description===

===Tavernier's description===

Tavernier was allowed to closely inspect the throne and the jewels and wrote the most known detailed description to date. 

===later Peacock Throne===

After the destruction caused by Nadir Shah, another throne was made for the Mughal emperor. Various 19th century Indian company paintings of this throne exist. It was located in the Diwan-i-Khas and could have been smaller in size than the original one made for Shah Jahan. However the appearance would have been similar, based on either the original plans or by memories and eye-witness accounts. It was made out of gold or was gilded, and studded with precious and semi-precious stones. Just like the original, it featured 12 columns. The columns carried a Bengali do-chala roof, which were graced with two peacock statues on the two ends, carrying a pearl necklace in the beak, and two peacocks at the top, also carrying pearl necklaces in their beacks. The two peacocks were in the centre underneath a flower bouquet made out of jewels or under a royal umbrella. This throne was protected by a canopy made out of precious and colourful textiles and gold and silver threads. The canopy was carried by four, slender columns or beams made out of metal. Underneatch the throne, colourful and precious carpets were laid out.
