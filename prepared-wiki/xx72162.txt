[[Role-playing video game]]

CATEGORIES: Role-playing video games, Video game genres, Video game terminology

A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer RPG or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a protagonist  (or several adventuring party members) immersed in a fictional world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing gamesAdams, Rollings 2003, p. 347 (such as Dungeons & Dragons) and use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. A common criteria for whether a game is an "RPG" is whether the game has a complex storyline, and whether the character goes through different places, fighting bosses and communicating with both friends and enemies.

==Characteristics==

Role-playing video games use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics as early pen-and-paper role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons.[tpl]cite web| author=McNaughton, M.; Schaeffer, J.; Szafron, D.; Parker, D.; Redford J. | year=2004| title=Code Generation for AI Scripting in Computer Role-Playing Games | publisher=American Association for Artificial Intelligence| url=https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2004/WS-04-04/WS04-04-026.pdf | format=PDF| accessdate=2009-10-10 [/tpl]
Generally, the player controls a central game character, or multiple game characters, usually called a party, and attain victory by completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline. Players explore a game world, while solving puzzles and engaging in tactical combat. A key feature of the genre is that characters grow in power and abilities, and characters are typically designed by the player. RPGs rarely challenge a player's physical coordination or reaction time, with the exception of action role-playing games.
Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting,Adams, Rollings 2003, p. 347-248 which is divided into a number of quests. Players control one or several characters by issuing commands, which is performed by the character at an effectiveness determined by that character's numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase each time a character gains a level, and a character's level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain amount of experience.[tpl]cite conference| author=Diveky, Marko; Bielikova, Maria| title=Generating Educational Interactive Stories in Computer Role-Playing Games| booktitle=Learning in the Synergy of Multiple Disciplines: 4th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, Proceedings| location=Nice, France | page=495| date=September 29 – October 2, 2009| publisher=Springer | isbn=3-642-04635-5 [/tpl]
Role-playing video games also typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what is found in other video game genres. This usually involves additional focus on the artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer-controlled non-player characters.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Cutumisu, Maria; Szafron, Duane; Schaeffer, Jonathan; McNaughton, Matthew; Roy, Thomas; Onuczko, Curtis; Carbonaro, Mike| title=Generating Ambient Behaviors in Computer Role-Playing Games| journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems | volume=21| issue=5 | pages=19–27 |date=September–October 2006 | doi=10.1109/MIS.2006.92[/tpl]

===Story and setting===

The premise of most-role-playing games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. The game world tends to be set in a fantasy or science fiction universe,Adams, Rollings 2003, p. 351 which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer to the present day or near future are possible.
A strong story often provides half the entertainment in the game. Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games. While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may make the decision to join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story.
Pen-and-paper role-playing games typically involve a player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and react to a player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs the function of the gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.[tpl]Cite book| author=Egenfeldt-Nielsen, Simon; Smith, Jonas Heide; Tosca, Susana Pajares | year=2008| title=Understanding Video Games: the Essential Introduction | page=48 | publisher=Taylor & Francis| isbn=0-415-97721-5 [/tpl]

===Exploration and quests===

Exploring the world is an important aspect of all RPGs. Players will walk through, talking to non-player characters, picking up objects, and avoiding traps. Some games such as NetHack, Diablo, and the FATE series randomize the structure of individual levels, increasing the game's variety and replayability. Role-playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons and include the game mechanic "permadeath" are called roguelikes, named after the 1980 video game Rogue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3123537|title=The Essential 50 Part 12 -- Rogue|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|publisher=1UP|accessdate=2009-03-01[/tpl]
The game's story is often mapped onto exploration, where each chapter of the story is mapped onto a different location. Unlike other linear games, RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.
The player typically must complete a linear sequence of certain quests in order to reach the end of the game's story. However, RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side-quests and character interactions. Quests of this sort can be found by talking to a non-player character, and there is no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these quests other than a missed opportunity. There is usually a reward for completing a side-quest, although quests in some games such as Arcanum or Geneforge can limit or enable certain choices later in the game.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Quests may involve defeating one or many enemies, rescuing a non-player character, item fetch quests, or locational puzzles such as mysteriously locked doors. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

===Items and inventory===

Players can find loot throughout the game world and collect it, such as clothing, weapons, and armor. Players can trade items for currency and better equipment. Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized trading screen. Purchased items go into the player's inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting the size of the player's inventory, thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time.Adams, Rollings 2003, p. 362 This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held.[tpl]Harvnb|Adams, Rollings|2006|Ref=adamsrollings_2006[/tpl]

===Character actions and abilities===

Most of the actions in an RPG are performed indirectly, with the player selecting an action and the character performing it by their own accord. Success at that action depends on the character's numeric attributes. Role-playing video games often simulate die-rolling mechanics from non-electronic role-playing games to determine success or failure. As a character's attributes improve, their chances of succeeding at a particular action will increase.
Many role-playing games allow players to play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it easier to get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.[tpl]cite web|last=Desslock|title=Baldur's Gate Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/baldursgate/review.html|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=30 November 2010[/tpl]
Although some single-player role-playing games give the player an avatar that is largely predefined for the sake of telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character's sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of theses traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities and strengths. Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with healing abilities, or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player's performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player's ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player's choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.Adams, Rollings 2003, pp. 358-361
Role-playing games frequently make use of magical powers, or equivalents such as psychic powers or advanced technology. These abilities are confined to specific characters such as mages, spellcasters, or magic-users. In games where the player controls multiple characters, these magic-users usually complement the physical strength of other classes. Magic can be used to attack, to defend, or to temporarily change an enemy or ally's attributes. While some games allow players to gradually consume a spell, as ammunition is consumed by a gun, most games offer players a finite amount of mana which can be spent on any spell. Mana is restored by resting or by consuming potions. Characters can also gain other non-magical skills, which stay with the character as long as he lives.

===Experience and levels===

Although the characterization of the game's avatar will develop through storytelling, characters may also become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills, weapons, and magic. This creates a positive-feedback cycle that is central to most role-playing games: The player grows in power, allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges, and gain even more power. This is part of the appeal of the genre, where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers. Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately, the player in a role-playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience.
Role-playing games usually measure progress by counting experience points and character levels. Experience is usually earned by defeating enemies in combat, with some games offering experience for completing certain quests or conversations. Experience becomes a form of score, and accumulating a certain amount of experience will cause the character's level to go up. This is called "levelling up", and gives the player an opportunity to raise one or more of his character's attributes. Many RPGs allow players to choose how to improve their character, by allocating a finite number of points into the attributes of their choice. Gaining experience will also unlock new magic spells for characters that use magic.
Some role-playing games also give the player specific skill points, which can be used to unlock a new skill or improve an existing one. This may sometimes be implemented as a skill tree. As with the technology trees seen in strategy video games, learning a particular skill in the tree will unlock more powerful skills deeper in the tree.
Three different systems of rewarding the player characters for solving the tasks in the game can be set apart: the experience system (also known as the "level-based" system), the training system (also known as the "skill-based" system) and the skill-point system (also known as "level-free" system)

===Combat===

Older games often separated combat into its own mode of gameplay, distinct from exploring the game world. More recent games tend to maintain a consistent perspective for exploration and combat. Some games, especially earlier video games, generate battles from random encounters; more modern RPGs are more likely to have persistent wandering monsters that move about the game world independently of the player. Most RPGs also use stationary boss monsters in key positions, and automatically trigger battles with them when the PCs enter these locations or perform certain actions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Combat options typically involve positioning characters, selecting which enemy to attack, and exercising special skills such as casting spells.
In a classical turn-based system, only one character may act at a time; all other characters remain still, with a few exceptions that may involve the use of special abilities. The order in which the characters act is usually dependent on their attributes, such as speed or agility. This system rewards strategic planning more than quickness. It also points to the fact that realism in games is a means to the end of immersion in the game world, not an end in itself. A turn-based system makes it possible, for example, to run within range of an opponent and kill him before he gets a chance to act, or duck out from behind hard cover, fire, and retreat back without an opponent being able to fire, which are of course both impossibilities. However, tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before; the player determines whether the loss of immersion in the reality of the game is worth the satisfaction gained from the development of the tactic and its successful execution. Fallout has been praised as being "the shining example of a good turn-based Combat System[tpl]sic[/tpl]".
Real-time combat can import features from action games, creating a hybrid action RPG game genre. But other RPG battle systems such as the Final Fantasy battle systems have imported real-time choices without emphasizing coordination or reflexes. Other systems combine real-time combat with the ability to pause the game and issue orders to all characters under his/her control; when the game is unpaused, all characters follow the orders they were given. This "real-time with pause" system (RTwP) has been particularly popular in games designed by BioWare. The most famous RTwP engine is the Infinity Engine. Other names for "real-time with pause" include "active pause", "semi real-time"[tpl]cite web| last =Babovic | first =Branislav | title =Combat Systems in RPG Games | publisher =ActionTrip | year =2000 | url =http://www.actiontrip.com/features/combatsystemsinrpggames.phtml | accessdate =2007-12-02 [/tpl] and "smart pause".[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Early Ultima games featured a RTwP system: they were strictly turn-based, but if the player waited more than a second or so to issue a command, the game would automatically issue a pass command, allowing the monsters to take a turn while the PCs did nothing. Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is another game which used this system.
There is a further subdivision by the structure of the battle system; in many early games, such as Wizardry, monsters and the party are arrayed into ranks, and can only attack enemies in the front rank with melee weapons. Other games, such as most of the Ultima series, employed duplicates of the miniatures combat system traditionally used in the early role-playing games. Representations of the player characters and monsters would move around an arena modeled after the surrounding terrain, attacking any enemies that are sufficiently near.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

===Interface and graphics===

Players typically navigate the game world from a first or third-person perspective in 3D RPGs. However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective is common in party-based RPGs, in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings.Adams, Rollings 2003, pp. 364-367 Role-playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information, and frequently make use of a windowed interface. For example, spell-casting characters will often have a menu of spells they can use. On the PC, players typically use the mouse to click on icons and menu options, while console games duplicate this functionality with the game controller. Older games often revealed calculations of the game as seen in Dungeons and Dragons games, although more recent games have removed this information to improve immersion.

==History and classification==

The role-playing video game genre began in the mid-1970s on mainframe computers, inspired by pen-and-paper role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons.[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007a|p=1|Ref=barton_3623[/tpl] Several other sources of inspiration for early role-playing video games also included tabletop wargames, sports simulation games, adventure games such as Colossal Cave Adventure, fantasy writings by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien,[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2008|p=13|Ref=barton_ddesktops[/tpl] traditional strategy games such as chess,[tpl]cite web|title=Pathway to Glory|author=Justin Leeper|date=December 17, 2004|work=GameSpy|url=http://uk.wireless.gamespy.com/n-gage/pathway-to-glory/574269p1.html|accessdate=2011-05-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hendricks|first=Fayyaad|title=A complete history of role-playing videogames: Part 1|url=http://www.el33tonline.com/past_editorial/2011/12/19/a_complete_history_of_roleplaying/|publisher=EL33TONLINE|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=19 December 2011[/tpl] and ancient epic literature dating back to Epic of Gilgamesh which followed the same basic structure of setting off in various quests in order to accomplish goals.[tpl]citation|author=Johansen Quijano-Cruz|year=2009|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/eludamos/index.php/eludamos/article/viewArticle/68/131|author=Chopin's Dream as Reality: A Critical Reading of Eternal Sonata|journal=Eludamos Journal for Computer Game Culture|volume=3|issue=2|pages=209–218|accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl]
After the success of role-playing video games such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, the role-playing genre eventually diverged into two styles, Japanese role-playing games and Western role-playing games, due to cultural differences, though roughly mirroring the platform divide between consoles and computers, respectively.[tpl]cite web|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/733 |title=Kawaisa!: A Naive Glance at Western and Eastern RPGs |publisher=Armchair Arcade |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-09-05[/tpl] Finally, while the first RPGs offered strictly a single player experience, the popularity of multiplayer modes rose sharply during the early to mid-1990s with action role-playing games such as Secret of Mana and Diablo.  With the advent of the Internet, multiplayer games have grown to become massively multiplayer online role-playing games, including Lineage, Final Fantasy XI, and World of Warcraft.

===Mainframe computers===

The role-playing video game genre began in the mid-1970s, as an offshoot of early university mainframe text-based RPGs on PDP-10 and Unix-based computers, such as Dungeon, pedit5 and dnd.[tpl]cite web|last=Martell|first=Carey|title=Interview with the creators of dnd (PLATO)|url=http://www.rpgfanatic.net/advanced_game_wiki_database.html?p=news&nrid=5049&game=dnd|publisher=www.rpgfanatic.net|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] In 1980, a very popular dungeon crawler, Rogue was released. Featuring ASCII graphics where the setting, monsters and items were represented by letters and a deep system of gameplay, it inspired a whole genre of similar clones on mainframe and home computers called "roguelikes".

===Personal computers===

One of the earliest role-playing video game on a microcomputer was Dungeon n Dragons, written by Peter Trefonas and published by CLOAD (1980). This early game, published for a TRS-80 Model 1, was just 16K long and included a limited word parser command line, character generation, a store to purchase equipment, combat, traps to solve, and a dungeon to explore.[tpl]cite web| last = Trefonas | first = Peter | title = Dungeons and Dragons | publisher = CLOAD | date = May 1980 | url = http://www.gametronik.com/site/rubriques/tandy/FAQs/CLOAD%20Magazine%201980-05%20(1980)(CLOAD%20Magazine%20Inc).pdf | accessdate = 2010-10-30[/tpl] Other contemporaneous CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Games) were Temple of Apshai and Akalabeth: World of Doom, the precursor to Ultima. Some early microcomputer RPGs (such as Telengard (1982) or Sword of Fargoal) were based on their mainframe counterparts, while others (such as Ultima or Wizardry, the most successful of the early CRPGs) were direct adaptations of D&D. They also included both first-person displays and overhead views, sometimes in the same game (Akalabeth, for example, used both perspectives). Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period, prior to the release of Ultima III: Exodus, one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development. For example, Wizardry featured menu-driven combat, Tunnels of Doom featured tactical combat on a special "combat screen", and Dungeons of Daggorath featured real-time combat which took place on the main dungeon map.[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007a|Ref=barton_3623[/tpl]
Starting in 1984 with Questron and 50 Mission Crush, SSI produced many series of CRPGs. Their 1985 game Phantasie is notable for introducing automapping and in-game scrolls providing hints and background information. They also released Pool of Radiance in 1988, the first of several "Gold Box" CRPGs based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. These games featured a first-person display for movement, combined with an overhead tactical display for combat. One common feature of RPGs from this era, which Matt Barton calls the "Golden Age" of computer RPGs, is the use of numbered "paragraphs" printed in the manual or adjunct booklets, containing the game's lengthier texts; the player could be directed to read a certain paragraph, instead of being shown the text on screen. The ultimate exemplar of this approach was Sir-Tech's Star Saga trilogy (of which only two games were released); the first game contained 888 "textlets" (usually much longer than a single paragraph) spread across 13 booklets, while the second contained 50,000 paragraphs spread across 14 booklets. Most of the games from this era were turn-based, although Dungeon Master and its imitators had real-time combat. Other classic titles from this era include The Bard's Tale, Wasteland, the start of the Might and Magic series and the continuing Ultima series.[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007b|Ref=barton_1706[/tpl]
Later, in the middle to late 1990s, isometric, sprite-based action-orientated RPGs became commonplace, with video game publishers Interplay Entertainment and Blizzard North playing a lead role with such titles as Fallout, the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, and Diablo. This era also saw a move toward 3D game engines with such games as Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven and The Elder Scrolls: Arena. TSR, dissatisfied with SSI's later products, such as Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager and Menzoberranzan, transferred the AD&D license to several different developers, and eventually gave it to BioWare, which used it in Baldur's Gate (1998) and several later games. By the 2000s, 3D engines had become dominant.[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007c|Ref=barton_1571[/tpl]

===Video game consoles===

The earliest RPG on a console was Dragonstomper on the Atari 2600 in 1982.[tpl]cite web| title =The History of Console RPGs | publisher =GameSpot | url =http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/first.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20100329135843/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/first.html | archivedate =2010-03-29 | accessdate =2007-10-24 [/tpl] Another early RPG on a console was Bokosuka Wars, originally released for the Sharp X1 computer in 1983Bokosuka Wars, GameSpot and later ported to the MSX in 1984, the NES in 1985 and the Sharp X68000 as New Bokosuka Wars. The game laid the foundations for the tactical role-playing game genre, or "simulation RPG" genre as it is known in Japan.Bokosuka Wars (translation), Nintendo It was also an early example of a real-time,Dru Hill: The Chronicle of Druaga, 1UP action role-playing game.[tpl]allgame|14762|Bokosuka Wars[/tpl]Gems In The Rough: Yesterday's Concepts Mined For Today, Gamasutra In 1986, Chunsoft created the NES title Dragon Quest (called Dragon Warrior in North America until the eighth game), which is regarded as the template for future role-playing video games released since then.[tpl]cite web| title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior | publisher=GameSpy | url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p1.html | accessdate=2005-05-29[/tpl]
In 1987, the genre came into its own with the release of several highly influential console RPGs distinguishing themselves from computer RPGs. Shigeru Miyamoto's Zelda II: The Adventure of Link for the Famicom Disk System was one of the earliest action role-playing games, combining the action-adventure game framework of its predecessor The Legend of Zelda with the statistical elements of turn-based RPGs.[tpl]cite web|author=Andrew Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|publisher=GameSpot|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes6.html|accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl] Most RPGs at this time were turn-based.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest 9: Sentinels of the Starry Skies|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Square-Enix|at=Iwata Asks Dragon Quest IX Video 4, As a Turn-based RPG|accessdate=2010-12-05[/tpl] Faxanadu was another early action RPG for the NES, released as a side-story to the computer action RPG Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu.[tpl]cite web|first=Andrew|last=Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs: Other NES RPGs|publisher=GameSpot|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes5.html|accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl] Square's Final Fantasy for the NES introduced side-view battles, with the player characters on the right and the enemies on the left, which soon became the norm for numerous console RPGs.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_1_2.html | title = The History of Final Fantasy - Final Fantasy (Part 2) |first= Andrew|last=Vestal | publisher = Gamespot | date = 1998-11-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-31 [/tpl] In 1988, Dragon Warrior III introduced a character progression system allowing the player to change the party's character classes during the course of the game.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Another "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day."[tpl]cite web|author=Andrew Vestal|title=The History of Console RPGs: Dragon Quest III|publisher=GameSpot|date=1998-11-02|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/rpg_hs/nes7.html|accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl] In 1989, Phantasy Star II for the Genesis established many conventions of the genre, including an epic, dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter, and a strategy-based battle system.The Greatest Games of All Time: Phantasy Star II, GameSpot
Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters. Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits, with many of them seeming to offer more of the traditional role-playing, with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs.Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford (2001), Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games, p. xxiv, Cengage Learning, ISBN 0-7615-3299-4 During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant, exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs than the other way around.The History of Computer Role-Playing Games Part III: The Platinum and Modern Ages (1994-2004) (Page 12), Gamasutra Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time, though computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the decade with interactive choice-filled adventures.Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford (2001), Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games, pp. xxiv & xxv, Cengage Learning, ISBN 0-7615-3299-4
The next major revolution came in the late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which is considered one of the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million,Final Fantasy VII: The Old Order Passeth, 1UP the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore,[tpl]Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=77|Ref=vintage_log[/tpl] much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds,[tpl]Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=78|Ref=vintage_log[/tpl] battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay,[tpl]Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=84|Ref=vintage_log[/tpl] effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and computer platforms.

===Cultural differences===

After the success of console role-playing games in Japan, the role-playing genre eventually began being classified into two fairly distinct styles: computer RPG and console RPG, due to stylistic, gameplay and/or cultural reasons; with the latter having become popularized and heavily influenced by early Japanese video games such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.[tpl]Harvnb|Vestal|1998a|p="Final Fantasy"|Ref=gspot_consolehist[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Vestal|1998a|p="Other Game Boy RPGs"|Ref=gspot_consolehist[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The original Dragon Quest game is often cited as the first role-playing video game, though it borrows heavily from the Wizardry and Ultima series. Also, in spite of coming after it, Western audiences consider Final Fantasy "more important".[tpl]cite web|first=William|last=Cassidy| title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior  | publisher=GameSpy | url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p1.html | accessdate=2005-05-29[/tpl]|group="Note"[/tpl] In the early 2000s, however, as the platform differences began to blur, computer RPGs and console RPGs were eventually classified as Western role-playing games (or WRPGs) and Japanese role-playing games (or JRPGs), respectively.
Though sharing fundamental premises, Western RPGs tend to feature darker graphics, older characters, and a greater focus on roaming freedom, realism, and the underlying game mechanics (e.g. "rules-based" or "system-based"); whereas Eastern RPGs tend to feature brighter, anime-like graphics, younger characters, faster-paced gameplay, and a greater focus on tightly-orchestrated, linear storylines with intricate plots (e.g. "action-based" or "story-based").[tpl]cite web|first=Mike|last=Fahey|url=http://kotaku.com/5546807/a-visual-guide-to-the-role+playing-game |title=A Visual Guide To The Role-Playing Game |publisher=Kotaku |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nzgamer.com/ps2/features/552/japanese-and-western-rpgs-the-differences.html |last=English|first=Sherrin |title=Japanese and Western RPGs - The Differences |publisher=NZGamer |accessdate=2010-09-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Joynt|first=Patrick|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3148996 |title=The Oblivion of Western RPGs: Is the PC RPG Dead? from |publisher=1UP.com |date=2006-03-29 |accessdate=2010-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Doucet|first=Lars|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20110412/7413/RPGs_and_Suckage.php|publisher=Gamasutra|date=April 12, 2011|title=RPGs and Suckage[/tpl] Further, Western RPGs are more likely to allow players to create and customize characters from scratch,[tpl]Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=79|Ref=vintage_log[/tpl] and since the late 1990s have had a stronger focus on extensive dialog tree systems (e.g. Planescape: Torment). On the other hand, Japanese RPGs tend to limit players to developing pre-defined player characters, and often do not allow the option to create or choose one's own playable characters or make decisions that alter the plot.[tpl]#tag:ref|This often gives an impression that JRPGs are similar to adventure games.[tpl]cite news | first = Eric | last = Frederiksen | title = An RPG is not an RPG When it's a JRPG | date = 2010-08-17 | url = http://kombo.com/features/An_RPG_is_not_an_RPG_When_it\'s_a_JRPG/ | work = Kombo.com | accessdate = 2010-09-02[/tpl]|group="Note"[/tpl] In the early 1990s, Japanese RPGs were seen as being much closer to fantasy novels, but by the late 1990s had become more cinematic in style (e.g. Final Fantasy series), while at the same time Western RPGs started becoming more novelistic in style (e.g. Planescape: Torment); by the late 2000s, Western RPGs had also adopted a more cinematic style (e.g. Mass Effect series).[tpl]cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title=Opinion: How Mass Effect challenged my definition of 'RPG'|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129583/Opinion_How_Mass_Effect_challenged_my_definition_of_RPG.php|publisher=Gamasutra[/tpl]
One reason given for these differences is that many early Japanese console RPGs can be seen as forms of interactive manga (Japanese comics) or anime wrapped around Western rule systems at the time,[tpl]cite web|last=English|first=Fox|title=The RPG Conundrum|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FoxEnglish/20110325/6963/The_RPG_Conundrum.php|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=March 25, 2011[/tpl] in addition to the influence of visual novel adventure games.[tpl]cite web|title=Extra Credits: Western & Japanese RPGs (Part 1)|url=http://extra-credits.net/episodes/western-japanese-rpgs-part-1/|work=Extra Credits|publisher=Penny Arcade|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=March 2012[/tpl] As a result, Japanese console RPGs differentiated themselves with a stronger focus on scripted narratives and character drama,[tpl]citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role-playing games|page=xxiv|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl] alongside streamlined gameplay. In recent years, these trends have in turn been adopted by Western RPGs, which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives, in addition to moving away from "numbers and rules" in favour of streamlined combat systems similar to action games. In addition, a large number of Western independent games are modelled after Japanese RPGs,[tpl]cite web|date=April 5, 2011|title=GamersGate Holding Indie 'JRPG' Sale|publisher=GameSetWatch|author=Eric Caoili|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/04/gamersgate_holding_indie_jrpg.php|accessdate=2011-05-19[/tpl] especially those of the 16-bit era, partly due to the RPG Maker game development tools.
Another oft-cited difference is the prominence or absence of kawaisa, or "cuteness", in Japanese culture, and different approaches with respect to character aesthetics. Western RPGs tend to maintain a serious and gritty tone, with predominantly male protagonists exhibiting overtly masculine physical features and mannerisms. JRPG protagonsists tend to be designed with an emphasis on aesthetic beauty, and even male characters are often androgynous or bishōnen in appearance. JRPGs often have cute (and even comic-relief type) characters or animals, juxtaposed (or clashing) with more mature themes and situations; and many modern JRPGs feature characters designed in the same style as those in anime. The stylistic differences are often due to differing target audiences: Western RPGs are usually geared primarily towards teenage to adult males, whereas Japanese RPGs are usually intended for a much larger demographic,[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2008|p=223|Ref=barton_ddesktops[/tpl] including female audiences, who, for example, accounted for nearly a third of Final Fantasy XIII's fanbase.[tpl]cite web|title=A Closer Look At Final Fantasy XIII-2′s Performance In Japan|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/12/22/a-closer-look-at-final-fantasy-xiii-2s-performance-in-japan/|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=5 April 2012|author=Ishaan|date=December 22, 2011[/tpl]
Modern Japanese RPGs are more likely to feature turn-based battles; while modern Western RPGs are more likely to feature real-time combat. In the past, the reverse was often true: real-time action role-playing games were far more common among Japanese console RPGs than Western computer RPGs up until the late 1990s, due to gamepads usually being better suited to real-time action than the keyboard and mouse.[tpl]Harvnb|Loguidice|Barton|2009|p=43|Ref=vintage_log[/tpl]: "Action-oriented RPGs were far more plentiful on consoles than computers. ... Brenesal’s comment brings us to an important point regarding computer and console games: modern computers are far more likely to have mice and keyboards than game pads, a factor with serious implications for gameplay. Game pads are designed with arcade-like gameplay in mind; keyboards and mice are primarily intended for productivity." There are of course exceptions, such as Final Fantasy XII (2006) and Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner (1995 onwards), two modern Eastern RPGs that feature real-time combat; and The Temple of Elemental Evil (2003), a modern Western RPG that features turn-based combat.
Some journalists and video game designers have questioned this cultural classification, arguing that the differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that role-playing games should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: RPGs.[tpl]cite web|last=Glasser|first=AJ|title=Editorial: Where culture fits into games|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/216689/editorial-where-culture-fits-into-games/|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=September 24, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100929093616/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/216689/editorial-where-culture-fits-into-games/|archivedate=2010-09-29[/tpl] Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while "users like to categorise" Japanese RPGs as "turn-based, traditional styles" and Western RPGs as "born from first-person shooters," there "are titles that don't fit the category," pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted that there have been "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," but that "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience."[tpl]cite web|last=Jenkins|first=David|title=The Last Story Hironobu Sakaguchi interview - remaking the JRPG|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/891132-the-last-story-hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-remaking-the-rpg|work=GameCentral|publisher=Metro (British newspaper)[tpl]![/tpl]Metro|accessdate=1 March 2012|date=23 February 2012[/tpl] Xeno series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, but just because you cram something into a little box doesn't mean it belongs there."[tpl]cite web|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|title=What Xenoblade Chronicles Gets Right|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9098338|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=April 5, 2012[/tpl] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are "too linear," pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommon.[tpl]cite web|last=Doerr|first=Nick|title=Bethesda is sticking to RPGs for now|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/20/bethesda-is-sticking-to-rpgs-for-now/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=26 April 2012|date=February 20, 2007[/tpl] Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally "not true" and "never was," pointing to classic examples from both genres.

====Criticisms====

Due to the cultural differences between Western and Japanese variations of role-playing games, both have often been compared and critiqued by those within the video games industry and press.
In the late 1980s, when traditional American computer RPGs such as Ultima and Defender of the Crown were ported to consoles, they received mixed reviews from console gamers, as they were "not perceived, by many of the players, to be as exciting as the Japanese imports," and lacked the arcade and action-adventure elements commonly found in Japanese console RPGs at the time.[tpl]citation|first=Roe R.|last=Adams|work=Computer Gaming World|date=November 1990|issue=76|pages=83–84 84|title=Westward Ho! (Toward Japan, That Is): An Overview of the Evolution of CRPGs on Dedicated Game Machines|quote=Last year also saw the coattail effect of traditional bestselling CRPGs being ported over onto dedicated game machines as the new market of machines blossomed into money trees. Games like Ultima, Shadowgate, and Defender of the Crown appeared to mixed reviews. These stalwarts of computer fame were not perceived, by many of the players, to be as exciting as the Japanese imports.[/tpl] In the early 1990s, American computer RPGs also began facing criticism for their plots, where "the party sticks together through thick and thin" and always "act together as a group" rather than as individuals, and where non-player characters are "one-dimensional characters," in comparison to the more fantasy novel approach of Squaresoft console RPGs such as Final Fantasy IV.[tpl]cite journal|author=Sandy Petersen|title=Reviews: Final Fantasy II|journal=Dragon (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Dragon|year=1993|month=November|issue=199|pages=56 & 58|url=http://dnd.ezael.net/~olep/Drmg199.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2012[/tpl] However in 1994, game designer Sandy Petersen noted that, among computer gamers, there was criticism against cartridge-based console JRPGs being "not role-playing at all" due to popular examples such as Secret of Mana and especially The Legend of Zelda using "direct" arcade-style action combat systems instead of the more "abstract" turn-based battle systems associated with computer RPGs. In response, he pointed out that not all console RPGs are action-based, pointing to Final Fantasy and Lufia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Eye of the Monitor|author=Petersen, Sandy|journal=Dragon|issue=208|date=August 1994|page=61|authorlink=Sandy Petersen|quote=Not long ago, I received a letter from a DRAGON® Magazine reader. This particular woman attacked the whole concept of cartridge-based role-playing games very vigorously, claiming that games such as Zelda are not role-playing at all. Presumably, she thinks they are arcade games. Zelda has some features of the classic arcade game: combat is direct. Each push of the button results in one swing of the sword, which if it connects, harms or kills an enemy. In standard computer roleplaying games, at least until recently, combat is more abstract. ... But all that is changing. ... Ultima VIII requires you not only to control your character's every move in combat, but also his dodging of enemy blows, whether he kicks or stabs, etc. ... The two forms of play: "arcade" and "role-playing" seem to be mixing more and more in computer and cartridge games. We'll see how far this trend goes, but I suspect there will always be a place for a game which is totally cerebral in combat, instead of relying on reflexes. For every Zelda, or Secret of Mana, there'll be a Final Fantasy II or Lufia.[/tpl] Another early criticism, dating back to the Phantasy Star games in the late 1980s, was the frequent use of defined player characters, in contrast to the Wizardry and Gold Box games where the player's avatars (such as knights, clerics, or thieves) were blank slates.[tpl]cite web|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=5 WAYS JAPANESE GAMING STILL RULES: ATELIER TOTORI|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-feature5-ways-japanese-gaming-still-rules-atelier-totori/|work=Electronic Gaming Monthly|accessdate=31 December 2011|date=December 27, 2011[/tpl]
Yet as Japanese console RPGs became increasingly more dominant in the 1990s,[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007c|p=12|Ref=barton_1571[/tpl] and became known for being more heavily story and character-based, American computer RPGs also began to face criticism for having characters devoid of personality or background, due to representing avatars which the player uses to interact with the world, in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted characters with distinctive personalities. American computer RPGs were thus criticized for lacking "more of the traditional role-playing" offered by Japanese console RPGs, which instead emphasized character interactions.[tpl]citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role playing games|page=xxiv|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl] In response, North American computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the 1990s with interactive choice-filled adventures.[tpl]citation|title=Neal Hallford & Jana Hallford|year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GslPb621eXQC|title=Swords & circuitry: a designer's guide to computer role playing games|pages=xxiv & xxv|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-7615-3299-4|accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl]

However, in recent years, some have also criticized Western RPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action Christian Nutt of GameSpy states that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has come at the expense of plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems.Nutt It has also been argued that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself.Nutt Tom Battey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for "lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice."[tpl]cite web|last=Snell|first=Dave|title=Why I´m bored with Bioware|url=http://www.gamezone.com/editorials/why_im_bored_with_bioware|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=September 27, 2010[/tpl] Western RPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in "narrative strength" or "mechanical intricacy" due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.[tpl]cite web|last=St. Clair|first=Pride|title=Why I Hate Big-Name, Open Ended WRPGs|url=http://geek.pikimal.com/2012/04/18/why-i-hate-big-name-open-ended-wrpgs/|publisher=Pikimal|accessdate=19 April 2012|date=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
Despite the criticisms leveled at both variations, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally not true, noting various similarities between several Western titles (such as Lands of Lore, Betrayal at Krondor, and Dragon Age) and several classic Eastern titles (such as Final Fantasy and Phantasy Star), noting that both the Western and Japanese titles share a similar emphasis on linear storytelling, pre-defined characters and "bright-colored" graphics.[tpl]cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title=East Is West: How Two Classic RPGs Prove the Stereotypes False|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/02/16/east-is-west-how-two-classic-rpgs-prove-the-stereotypes-false/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=February 16, 2012[/tpl]
Controversy
In what is viewed as the largely secular nature of Japanese culture has resulted in heavy usage of themes, symbols, and characters taken from a variety of religions, including Christianity and Japanese Shinto. This tends to be problematic when JRPGs are exported to Western countries where the topics of religion and blasphemy remain sensitive, such as the United States. It is not unusual for a JRPG to exhibit elements that would be controversial in the West, such as Xenogears or Final Fantasy Tactics featuring antagonists that bear similarities to the Abrahamic God and the Catholic Church, respectively;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3155815 |author=Kalata, Kurt|title=Cultural Differences|publisher=1up.com |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl] and Nintendo has made efforts in the past to remove references such as these prior to introducing their games into the North American market.

===Relationship to other genres===

Unlike action games, RPGs seldom test a player's physical skill. Combat is typically a tactical challenge rather than a physical one, and games involve other non-action gameplay such as choosing dialog options, inventory management, or buying and selling items.
Although RPGs share some combat rules with wargames, RPGs are about a small group of individual characters.[tpl]cite web | last =Kaiser | first =Rowan | title =How Mass Effect challenged my definition of 'RPG' | publisher =Gamasutra | date =March 1, 2012 | url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129583/Opinion_How_Mass_Effect_challenged_my_definition_of_RPG.php | accessdate = 2012-03-02[/tpl] Wargames tend to have large groups of identical units, as well as non-humanoid units such as tanks and airplanes. Role-playing games do not normally allow the player to produce more units. However, the Heroes of Might and Magic series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large amounts of troops in large battles.
RPGs rival adventure games in terms of their rich storylines, in contrast to genres that do not rely upon storytelling such as sports games or puzzle games. Both genres also feature highly detailed characters, and a great deal of exploration. However, adventure games usually have a well-defined character, whereas while RPGs may do so, many allow the player to design their characters. Adventure games usually focus on one character, whereas RPGs often feature an entire party. RPGs also feature a combat system, which adventure games usually lack. Whereas both adventure games and RPGs may focus on the personal or psychological growth of characters, RPGs tend to emphasize a complex eternal economy where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes.
Gameplay elements strongly associated with this genre, such as statistical character development, have been widely adapted to other video game genres. For example, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, an Action-adventure game, uses resource statistics (abbreviated as "stats") to define a wide range of attributes including stamina, weapon proficiency, driving, lung capacity, and muscle tone, and uses numerous cutscenes and quests to advance the story. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, a real-time strategy game, features heroes that can complete quests, obtain new equipment, and "learn" new abilities as they advance in level.
According to Satoru Iwata, president of Nintendo, turn-based RPGs have been unfairly criticized as being outdated. According to Yuji Horii, creator of the popular Dragon Quest series and Ryutaro Ichimura, producer of Square Enix, turn-based RPGs allow the player time to make decisions without feeling rushed or worry about real-life distractions. According to Iwata, action-based RPGs can frustrate players if they are unable to keep up with the battles.

====Action RPGs====

Typically action RPGs feature each player directly controlling a single character in real time, and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction kept to a minimum. Early action RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980s Nihon Falcom titles such as the Dragon Slayer and Ys series, which feature hack and slash combat where the player character's movements and actions are controlled directly, using a keyboard or game controller, rather than using menus.[tpl]cite web | last = Bailey | first = Kat | title = Hack and Slash: What Makes a Good Action RPG? | publisher = 1UP.com | date = May 18, 2010 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9030743 | accessdate = 2011-07-11[/tpl] This formula was refined by the action-adventure game, The Legend of Zelda (1986), which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs, including innovations such as an open world, nonlinear gameplay, battery backup saving,[tpl]cite web|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda|publisher=GameSpot|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|accessdate=2010-01-24[/tpl] and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen.Kurt Kalata, Dragon Slayer, Hardcore Gaming 101[tpl]cite web|title=Hydlide|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/hydlide/hydlide.htm|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|last2=Greene|first2=Robert[/tpl] The game was largely responsible for the surge of action-oriented RPGs released since the late 1980s, both in Japan and North America.[tpl]Cite book|first=Matt|last=Barton|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IMXu61GbTqMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Dungeons & Desktops: The History of Computer Role-Playing Games |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |isbn = 1-56881-411-9 | pages=182 & 212[/tpl] The Legend of Zelda series would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat-heavy, turn-based combat towards real-time action combat in the following decades.[tpl]citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first=Bill|last=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=Focal Press|year=2009|isbn=0-240-81146-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC|page=317[/tpl]
A different variation of the action RPG formula was popularized by Diablo (1996), where the majority of commands—such as moving and attacking—are executed using mouse clicks rather than via menus, though learned spells can also be assigned to hotkeys. In many action RPGs, non-player characters serve only one purpose, be it to buy or sell items or upgrade the player's abilities, or issue them with combat-centric quests. Problems players face also often have an action-based solution, such as breaking a wooden door open with an axe rather than finding the key needed to unlock it, though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such as a "lockpicking" skill and puzzle-solving.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
One common challenge in developing action RPGs is including content beyond that of killing enemies. With the sheer number of items, locations and monsters found in many such games, it can be difficult to create the needed depth to offer players a unique experience tailored to his or her beliefs, choices or actions. This is doubly true if a game makes use of randomization, as is common. One notable example of a game which went beyond this is Deus Ex (2000) which offered multiple solutions to problems using intricately layered story options and individually constructed environments. Instead of simply bashing their way through levels, players were challenged to act in character by choosing dialog options appropriately, and by using the surrounding environment intelligently. This produced an experience that was unique and tailored to each situation as opposed to one that repeated itself endlessly.
Action RPGs were much more common on consoles rather than computers. Though there had been attempts at creating action-oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, often in the vein of Zelda, very few saw any success, with the 1992 game Ultima VII being one of the more successful attempts in North America.[tpl]citation|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|first=Bill|last=Loguidice|first2=Matt|last2=Barton|publisher=Focal Press|year=2009|isbn=0-240-81146-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M_bFdsP9L7oC| page=43[/tpl] On the PC, Diablos effect on the market was significant from the late 1990s. It had many imitators and its style of combat went on to be used by many games that came after. For many years afterwards, games that closely mimicked the Diablo formula were referred to as "Diablo clones";[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007c|p=8|Ref=barton_1571[/tpl] and three of the four titles in the series are still sold together as part of the Diablo Battle Chest over a decade later. Other examples of action RPGs for the PC include Dungeon Siege (2002), Sacred (2004), Torchlight (2009), Din's Curse (2010) and Hellgate: London (2007)—the last of which was developed by a team headed by former Blizzard employees, some of whom had participated in the creation of the Diablo series;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluesnews.com/a/686|title=Flagship Studios Opens with a Splash|publisher=Flagship Studios|date=2003-11-22|accessdate=2008-07-16[/tpl] and like Diablo and Rogue before it, Torchlight, Dins Curse, Hellgate: London and Fate (2005) all made use of procedural generation to generate game levels.[tpl]cite web | last = Donlan | first = Christian | title = Torchlight PC Hands On | publisher = Eurogamer | date = September 14, 2009 | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/torchlight-hands-on | accessdate = 2011-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Peeler | first = Steven | title = Din's Curse random dungeons | publisher = Soldak Entertainment | year = 2009 | url = http://www.soldak.com/Blogs/Steven/Din-s-Curse-random-dungeons.html | accessdate = 2011-05-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Johnson | first = Andy | title = By the Numbers: The Lost Art of Procedural Generation | publisher = The Game Reviews | date = December 29, 2009 | url = http://www.thegamereviews.com/article-1639-By-the-Numbers-The-Lost-Art-of-Procedural-Generation.html | accessdate = 2011-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Kosak | first = Dave | title = Fate | publisher = GameSpy | date = May 18, 2005 | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/fate/616652p1.html | accessdate = 2011-07-14[/tpl]
Also included within this sub-genre are role-playing shooters, games which incorporate elements of role-playing games and shooter games (including first-person and third-person). Recent examples include the Mass Effect games,[tpl]cite web | last = Remo | first = Chris | title = Analysis: Mass Effect 2's Surprising Genre Experiment | publisher = Gamasutra | date = January 29, 2010 | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26955/Analysis_Mass_Effect_2s_Surprising_Genre_Experiment.php | accessdate = 2011-07-11[/tpl] Borderlands 2 (2012), and The 3rd Birthday (2010).

====Tactical RPGs====

A number of early Western role-playing video games used a highly tactical form of combat, including parts of the Ultima series, which introduced party-based, tiled combat in Ultima III: Exodus (1983),[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2007a|p=4|Ref=barton_3623[/tpl] Ultima III would go on to be ported to many other platforms and influence the development of later titles,[tpl]Harvnb|King|Borland|2003|Ref=borlanddd[/tpl] as did Japan's Bokosuka Wars released that same year.[tpl]cite web|title=Bokosuka Wars|url=http://www.gamespot.com/x1/strategy/bokosukawars/index.html|publisher=GameSpot[/tpl] Conventionally, however, the term tactical RPG (known as simulation RPG in Japan) refers to the distinct subgenre that was born in Japan; the early origins of tactical RPGs are difficult to trace from the American side of the Pacific where much of the early RPG genre developed.[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2008|p=12|Ref=barton_ddesktops[/tpl] Tactical RPGs are descendents of traditional strategy games, such as chess, and table-top role-playing and strategic war games, such as Chainmail, which were mainly tactical in their original form.[tpl]cite web|last=Bailey|first=Kat|title=1UP's RPG Blog : Active Time Babble XXI: Tactical RPGs & Ys Seven|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9042222|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=12 May 2011|quote=The roots of tactical RPGs go back to tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons and old-school wargames; in other words, the roots of gaming itself.[/tpl] The format of a tactical CRPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance, pacing and rule structure.
Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time-consuming and extremely difficult.

====MMORPGs====

Though many of the original RPGs for the PLATO mainframe system in the late 1970s also supported multiple, simultaneous players,[tpl]Harvnb|Barton|2008|pp=37–38|Ref=barton_ddesktops[/tpl] the popularity of multiplayer modes in mainstream RPGs did not begin to rise sharply until the early to mid-1990s.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] For instance, Secret of Mana (1993), an early action role-playing game by Square, was one of the first commercial RPGs to feature cooperative multiplayer gameplay, offering two-player and three-player action once the main character had acquired his party members.[tpl]cite web|title=Secret of Mana|first=Justin|last=Lee|date=February 15, 2004|publisher=GameSpy|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/halloffame/february04/secretofmana/index.shtml|accessdate=2010-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Secret of Mana Review|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|publisher=IGN|date=October 13, 2008|url=http://www.wii.ign.com/articles/919/919126p1.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100317124407/http://wii.ign.com/articles/919/919126p1.html|archivedate=2010-03-17|accessdate=2010-01-24[/tpl] Later, Diablo (1996) would combine CRPG and action game elements with an Internet multiplayer mode that allowed up to four players to enter the same world and fight monsters, trade items, or fight against each other.
Also during this time period, the MUD genre that had been spawned by MUD1 in 1978 was undergoing a tremendous expansion phase due to the release and spread of LPMud (1989) and DikuMUD (1991).  Soon, driven by the mainstream adoption of the Internet, these parallel trends merged in the popularization of graphical MUDs, which would soon become known as massively multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs,[tpl]Cite book| last = Castronova | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Castronova | title = Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-226-09627-0 | pages = 10, 291 | quote = 10 The ancestors of MMORPGS were text-based multiuser domains (MUDs) ... 291 Indeed, MUDs generate perhaps the one historical connection between game-based VR and the traditional program ...[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| last = Bainbridge | first = William Sims | authorlink = William Sims Bainbridge | title = Berkshire Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction | publisher = Berkshire Publishing Group | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-9743091-2-5 | volume = 3 | page = 474 | quote = Developers had long considered writing a graphical MUD. ... the last major 2D virtual environment in the West marked the true beginning of the fifth age of MUDs: Origin Systems' 1997 Ultima Online (UO).[/tpl] beginning with games like Meridian 59 (1995), Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds (1996), Ultima Online (1997), Lineage (1998), and EverQuest (1999), and leading to modern phenomena such as RuneScape (2001), Final Fantasy XI (2003), Eve Online (2003) and World of Warcraft (2004).
Though superficially similar, MMORPGs lend their appeal more to the socializing influences of being online with hundreds or even thousands of other players at a time, and trace their origins more from MUDs than from CRPGs like Ultima and Wizardry. Rather than focusing on the "old school" considerations of memorizing huge numbers of stats and esoterica and battling it out in complex, tactical environments, players instead spend much of their time forming and maintaining guilds and clans. The distinction between CRPGs and MMORPGs and MUDs can as a result be very sharp, likenable to the difference between "attending a renaissance fair and reading a good fantasy novel".
Further, MMORPGs have been criticized for diluting the "epic" feeling of single-player RPGs and related media among thousands of concurrent adventurers. Stated simply: every player wants to be "The Hero", slay "The Monster", rescue "The Princess", or obtain "The Magic Sword". But when there are thousands of players all playing the same game, clearly not everyone can be the hero.[tpl]Harvnb|King|Borland|2003|pp=255–257|Ref=borlanddd[/tpl] "Thousands of players have gathered online in massively multiplayer worlds, but that meant that thousands of people might be vying for the status of hero. Too many heroes mean that nobody, or only the few, can be special. Fighting even the most dangerous of monsters gives less of an epic thrill when it is clear that it will simply regenerate after you have killed it, and when 13 parties of adventurers are waiting behind you in line for their turn. There is only one Frodo in the Lord of the Rings, one Avatar in the land of Brittania." This problem became obvious to some in the game EverQuest, where groups of players would compete and sometimes harass each other in order to get monsters in the same dungeon to drop valuable items, leading to several undesirable behaviors such as kill stealing, spawn camping, and ninja looting.[tpl]cite web | last = MacLellan | first = Jon | title = Please?

Lastly, there exist markets such as Korea and China that, while saturated with MMORPGs, have so far proved relatively unreceptive to single-player RPGs. For instance, Internet-connected personal computers are relatively common in Korea when compared to other regions—particularly in the numerous "PC bangs" scattered around the country where patrons are able to pay to play multiplayer video games—possibly due to historical bans on Japanese imports, as well as a culture that traditionally sees video games as "frivolous toys" and computers as educational.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Stewart | first = K. | last2 = Choi | first2 = HP | title = PC-Bang (Room) Culture: A Study of Korean College Students' Private and Public Use of Computers and the Internet | journal = Trends in Communication | page = 65 | year = 2003 | url = http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3958007063689222609&hl=en&as_sdt=800000&sciodt=800000 | accessdate = 2010-10-12[/tpl] As a result, some wonder whether the stand-alone, single-player RPG is still viable commercially—especially on the personal computer—when there are competing pressures such as big-name publishers' marketing needs, video game piracy, a change in culture, and the competitive price-point-to-processing-power ratio (at least initially) of modern console systems.[tpl]cite web | last = Wilson | first = Jason | title = The Future of Single-Player RPGs | publisher = 1UP.com | date = December 30, 2009 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3176786 | accessdate = 2010-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Crigger | first = Lara | title = Chasing D&D: A History of RPGs | publisher = 1UP.com | year = 2008 | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168091 | accessdate = 2010-11-09[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Though things like downloadable content can stem piracy to some degree, and MMO and single-player RPGs may to some degree attract different audiences—and thus not interfere with each other financially.|group="Note"[/tpl]

====Hybrid genres====

Finally, a steadily increasing number of other non-RP video games have adopted aspects traditionally seen in RPGs, such as experience point systems, equipment management, and choices in dialogue, as developers push to fill the demand for role-playing elements in non-RPGs.[tpl]cite web | title = Are Hybrid RPGs Just Poor-Man's RPGs? | publisher = Tales of the Rampant Coyote | date = October 23, 2006 | url = http://rampantgames.com/blog/2006/10/are-hybrid-rpgs-just-poor-mans-rpgs.html | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote = The core elements of a computer roleplaying game are pretty simple and straightforward. You basically have a task resolution system for an individual unit based on its statistics. Mix this with the ability to modify those stats through circumstances, equipment, spells, level increase or whatever. (...) Modern computer RPGs tend to be a bit more complex than this. (...) Hybrid RPG can emphasize some other element of gameplay that are FAR less development-intensive than pure roleplaying games. Thus they are cheaper and easier to make. Does this make them the "poor-man's RPG?" Meaning a poor / inexpensive substitution for the real thing? (...) Maybe.[/tpl] The blending of these elements with a number of different game engines and gameplay styles have created a myriad of hybrid game categories formed by mixing popular gameplay elements featured in other genres such as first-person shooters, platformers, and turn-based and real-time strategy games. Examples include first-person shooters such as parts of the Deus Ex (starting in 2000) and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (starting in 2007) series;[tpl]cite web | last = Martin | first = Joe | title = Spector tried to buy Deus Ex rights | publisher = bit-tech.net | date = November 3, 2009 | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2009/11/03/spector-tried-to-buy-deus-ex-rights/1 | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote=Deus Ex, often considered one of the best PC games ever made, is a FPS/RPG hybrid about uncovering an international conspiracy in a near-future, cyber-punk setting.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Boske | first = John | title = Deus Ex: Invisible War - We Wanted Orange, We Got Lemon-Lime | publisher = RPGamer | url = http://www.rpgamer.com/games/deus/deusex2/reviews/deusex2strev1.html | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote=How do you beat your own record?
