Mohawk Airlines operated in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, primarily the states of New York and Pennsylvania, from the mid-1940s until its acquisition by Allegheny Airlines in 1972. At its height it employed over 2,200 personnel and pioneered several aspects of regional airline operations,[tpl]cite web|last=Biographical History|accessdate=November 19, 2013|title=Mohawk Airlines records|url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/m/mohawk_air.htm|work=Special Collections Research Center|publisher=Syracuse University Libraries[/tpl]   including being the first airline in the United States to hire an African American flight attendant. In 1958 Mohawk moved their headquarters from Ithaca to  Oneida County Airport in the Town of Whitestown, New York, near Utica."World Airline Directory." Flight International.

==History==

The airline began in 1945, as Robinson Airlines out of Ithaca Municipal Airport near Ithaca, New York, flying single engine, three passenger Fairchild F-24s. In the 1950s all flights were on Douglas DC-3s; the Convair CV-240, CV-440s, and Martin 4-0-4s were added later. The airline tried helicopter service between New York and Catskill Mountains resorts with limited success. (The July 1954 OAG shows 13 flights a week each way between Newark and Liberty Airport [tpl]coord|41.80|-74.70|display=inline[/tpl]; fare $18 one way plus tax.)
In August 1953 it scheduled flights to 15 airports, and in May 1968 to 38, from Boston and Washington, D.C. to Detroit.
In 1952 Robert Peach purchased Robinson, and the name became Mohawk Airlines that August after a customer contest. In 1958 the airline moved its headquarters to Utica, NY, in the Mohawk Valley.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
When hired by Mohawk Airlines on February 11, 1958, Ruth Carol Taylor, became the first African-American flight attendant in the United States.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/NEWS/2005/11/16_black_fa.asp | accessdate=September 19, 2009 | title=Alaska's World: "Promoting Diversity: Flight attendants reach out to black community during trip to Harlem" | date=November 16, 2005| first=Don | last=Conrad| publisher=Alaska Airlines[/tpl] Six months after breaking one historic barrier, Ruth Taylor's career ended due to another discriminatory barrier: the airline's marriage ban, a common practice among airlines of the day. Airlines often dismissed flight attendants who married or became pregnant.NY Times, 17Mar2012
In 1961 Mohawk was the first airline to use a centralized computer-based reservation service, and in 1965 they were the first regional airline to use flight simulators. Mohawk upgraded their fleet with the British Aircraft Corporation's BAC 1-11 in 1965, becoming the first regional airline to fly jets. 
By 1969 Mohawk had retired all piston aircraft and flew mainly the BAC 1-11 and turboprop Fairchild Hiller FH-227.
From 1968 to 1971 labor and economic issues bled Mohawk financially. Unable to pay creditors at the end of that period, Mohawk entered merger discussions with Allegheny Airlines, and the merger was completed in 1972. The company became USAir in 1979, changing their name to US Airways in the late 1990s. When US Airways and America West Airlines merged in 2005, they chose to continue with the more recognized name: US Airways.

==Accidents and incidents==

On July 2, 1963, at Rochester, New York, Mohawk Airlines Flight 121 (a Mohawk Airlines Martin 4-0-4) attempted to take-off into a thunderstorm. Its wing-tip hit the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled, killing seven people.
On June 23, 1967, Mohawk Airlines Flight 40 (a BAC 1-11) flying from Elmira, New York to Washington, D.C., had a fire in the rear of the aircraft that eventually destroyed the vertical tail, causing all loss of pitch control. The cause was a non-return valve failure in the APU unit, resulting in hydraulic fluid's igniting. The aircraft crashed near Blossburg, Pennsylvania, killing all 34 people on board.
On November 19, 1969, Mohawk Airlines Flight 411 (a Fairchild Hiller FH-227B) crashed into Pilot Knob on the east shore of Lake George, New York, on approach to Warren County Airport, Glens Falls, New York, killing all 14 passengers on board.
On March 3, 1972, Mohawk Airlines Flight 405 (another FH-227) crashed into a house in Albany, New York on approach to Albany County Airport. The crew had difficulty getting the cruise lock to disengage in one of the engines. While the crew attempted to deal with the problem, the aircraft crashed short of the airfield, killing 16 of the 48 people in the aircraft and one person on the ground. The lone surviving crew member was a stewardess, Sandra Quinn.
