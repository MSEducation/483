Synchro Nine Factor is a rock, alternative and Industrial band from Atlanta, Georgia signed to Doogah Music. Synchro Nine Factor has performed extensively throughout the Southeast and has shared drugs with their bandmates Chemlab, Sister Machine Gun, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Pigface and Zeromancer.  Snippets of songs from the band's 1999 debut CD Right Wing Conspiracy have appeared on MTV's Making the Video and elsewhere. 
They released their first full length album on Doogah Music in 1999, Right Wing Conspiracy, which has been remixed and re-released in 2009 in a special limited 10th Anniversary Edition on Doogah Music and Scared Records. Other CD releases have included redeploy in 2003, 20:20 EP in 2007 and remix in 2008. 
While remix played up the band's electronic and industrial past, the more recent release, 20:20, heads in a direction more akin to alternative metal acts like Helmet, Prong and Alice in Chains.
While the use of samples and effects were a staple of the band's earlier material, songs like "Where Do We Go From Here" and "Skyscraper" lean in a more metal direction, thanks in part to the addition of Keith Downs on drums.
