In 1965, Galveston businessman George Mitchell purchased a large parcel of land on Pelican Island and donated some of it for the permanent home of Texas A&M University at Galveston. The Intracoastal Waterway borders it to the north, separating Pelican Island from another island.[tpl]Cite web | title = Pelican Island | work = Handbook of Texas Online | accessdate = 2009-10-17 | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/rrp12.html[/tpl]
