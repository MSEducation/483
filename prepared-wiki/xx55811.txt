[[Argument from free will]]

CATEGORIES: Arguments against the existence of God, Free will

The argument from free will (also called the paradox of free will, or theological fatalism) contends that omniscience and free will are incompatible, and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory.See the various controversies on God's Omniscience, and in particular on the critical notion of ForeknowledgeStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Foreknowledge and Free WillInternet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Foreknowledge and Free Will The argument may focus on the incoherence of people having free will, or else God himself having free will. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination, and often seem to echo the dilemma of determinism.

==Omniscience and free will==

Some arguments against God focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing free will. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of predestination.
Moses Maimonides formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full exercise by God of his omniscience and genuine human free will, his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Foreknowledge and Free Will and specifically Section 6: The Modal Fallacy
Various means of reconciling God's omniscience (possession of all possible knowledge) with human free will have been proposed:

===Counters reconceptualizing free will===

===Counters reconceptualizing omniscience===

===="God is outside of time"====

A proposition first offered by BoethiusConsolatio Philosophiae, Boethius, book 5:4 and later by Thomas AquinasSee also Divine Providence versus the concept of Fate and C. S. Lewis, suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book Mere Christianity, Lewis argues that God is actually outside of time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
An obvious criticism of God being outside of time is that this does not seem to grant free will. Predestination, regardless of how God perceives time, still seems to mean a person's actions will be determined. A logical formulation of this criticism might go as follows:

==God's free will==

Dan Barker suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God" The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God by Dan Barker Freethought Today, August 1997 http://archive.is/20120707232742/http://ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/august97/barker.html on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having freewill and that if God does not have freewill God is not a personal being.
Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is omniscientsee e.g. Richard Swinburne Does God Exist? of The Catechism of the Catholic Church but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
If omniscient is used in the first sense then the argument's applicability depends on what God chooses to know, and therefore it is not a complete argument against the existence of God. In both cases the argument depends on the assumption that it is logically possible for God to know every choice that he will make in advance of making that choice.
The compatibilist school of thought holds that free will is compatible with determinism and fatalism and therefore does not accept the assumptions of Barker's argument.
