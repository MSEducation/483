After fighting at First Manassas, the unit was assigned to General Pickett's, Garnett's, and Hunton's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. It was active in the campaigns of the army from Williamsburg to Gettysburg except when it served with Longstreet at Suffolk. The 28th moved to North Carolina, then was on detached duty at Richmond. It fought at Cold Harbor, endured the battles and hardships of the Petersburg trenches, and was engaged in various conflicts around Appomattox.
