The Jamaican Owl (Pseudoscops grammicus) is a medium-sized tawny colored owl that is endemic to the island of Jamaica. It is considered by some the only member of its genus Pseudoscops, while other authorities include in it the Striped Owl.  It has dark brown barring, flecking and streaks and its amber facial disk is rimmed in black-flecked white. It has hazel eyes, long ear tufts and a grayish-yellow bill. It mainly uses open habitats with scattered clumps of trees, generally in lowlands. It is nocturnal and eats mainly large insects, spiders, amphibians, lizards, birds and rodents. It lays its eggs in tree cavities. This species is common and widespread throughout its limited range, but some populations are at risk from habitat loss.
