Veronica Lake (November 14, 1922U.S. Census, April 1, 1930, State of Washington, County of Kings, enumeration district 1657, page 8-B, family 151, Constance Ockelman (sic), age 7 years, born in Seattle. Her father, Harry Ockelman, Jr., is listed as unmarried in the 1920 U.S. Census of Pennsylvania. – July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage and television actress.
Lake won both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her role in Sullivan's Travels and for her femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. By the late 1940s however, Lake's career had begun to decline in part due to her struggles with mental illness and alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several guest-starring roles on   television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film Footsteps In the Snow, but the role failed to revitalize her career.
Lake released her memoirs, Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake, in 1970. She used the money she made from the book to finance a low-budget horror film Flesh Feast. It was her final onscreen role. Lake died in July 1973 from hepatitis and acute kidney injury at the age of 50.

==Early life==

Lake was born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, Harry E. Ockelman, was of German-Danish descent,[tpl]cite book|last=Parrish|first=Robert James|title=The Paramount Pretties|date=1972|publisher=Arlington House|isbn=0-025-08170-5|page=410[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Thomas|first=Calvin Beck|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|date=1978|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=0-025-08170-5|page=169[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Burroughs Hannsberry|first=Karen|title=Femme Noir: Bad Girls of Film|date=1998|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-40429-9|page=300[/tpl] and worked for an oil company aboard a ship. He died in an industrial explosion in Philadelphia in 1932. Lake's mother, Constance Charlotta (née Trimble; 1902–1992), of Irish descent, married Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist, also of Irish descent, in 1933, and Lake began using his surname.[tpl]cite journal|date=May 17, 1943|title=I, Veronica|journal=Life|publisher=Time, Inc.|volume=14|issue=20|page=78|issn=0024-3019|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=veronica%20lake&f=false[/tpl] The Keanes lived in Saranac Lake, New York where Lake went to St. Bernard's School for a time. She was sent to Villa Maria, an all-girls Catholic boarding school in Montreal, Canada, from which she was expelled. The Keane family later moved to Miami, Florida where  Lake attended Miami High School, where she was known for her beauty. She had a troubled childhood and was diagnosed as schizophrenic, according to her mother.[tpl]harv|Chierichetti|2004|p=70[/tpl]

==Career==

In 1938, the Keanes moved to Beverly Hills where Constance Keane enrolled Lake in the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting (now the Beverly Hills Playhouse). She first began working in films as an extra.[tpl]cite journal|date=May 17, 1943|title=I, Veronica|journal=Life|publisher=Time, Inc.|volume=14|issue=20|page=77|issn=0024-3019|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=veronica%20lake&f=false[/tpl] Her first appearance on screen was for RKO, playing a small role among several coeds in the 1939 film, Sorority House. Similar roles followed, including All Women Have Secrets and Dancing Co-Ed. During the making of Sorority House, director John Farrow first noticed how her hair always covered her right eye, creating an air of mystery about her and enhancing her natural beauty. While still a teenager, Lake was introduced to the Paramount producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr. He changed her name to Veronica Lake because the surname suited her blue eyes.
RKO subsequently dropped her contract. A small role in the comedy Forty Little Mothers brought unexpected attention. In 1941 she was signed to a long-term contract with Paramount Pictures.

===Success===

Lake's breakthrough role was in the 1941 war drama I Wanted Wings. The film was a major hit in which Lake played the second female lead. It was during the filming of I Wanted Wings that Lake developed her signature look. Lake's long blonde hair accidentally fell over her right eye during a take and created a "peek-a-boo" effect. The hairstyle became Lake's trademark and was widely copied by women.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19730708&id=zb4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5468,1042862|title='Peek-a-Boo' Star Veronica Lake Hepatitis Victim|date=July 8, 1973|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|page=6-A|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] She followed up with starring roles in more popular movies, including Sullivan's Travels, This Gun for Hire, I Married a Witch,  and So Proudly We Hail!. René Clair, the director of I Married a Witch, said of Lake "She was a very gifted girl, but she didn't believe she was gifted."[tpl]harv|Terkel|1999|p=168[/tpl]
For a short time during the early 1940s, Lake was considered one of the most reliable box office draws in Hollywood. At the peak of her popularity, she earned $4,500 a week.
She became known for onscreen pairings with actor Alan Ladd which began with the 1942 hit This Gun for Hire.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19480303&id=ASgcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-lcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6715,318905|title=Ladd, Lake Together In 'Saigon'|date=March 3, 1948|newspaper=The Deseret News|page=13|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] Initially, the couple was teamed together merely out of physical necessity: Ladd was just [tpl]convert|5|ft|5|in|m[/tpl] tall and the only actress then on the Paramount lot short enough to pair with him was Lake, who stood just [tpl]convert|4|ft|11+1/2|in|m|sigfig=3[/tpl]. They became a popular onscreen duo and would make four more films together including the film noirs The Glass Key (1942), The Blue Dahlia (1946) and ''Saigon. 
During World War II, Lake changed her trademark peek-a-boo hairstyle at the insistence of the government to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-10-12-veronica-lake_x.htm|title=Veronica Lake's remains resurface|date=October 12, 2004|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=June 2, 2008[/tpl] Although the change helped to decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery, doing so may have damaged Lake's career.[tpl]harv|Starr|2003|pp=128–129[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Brenner|first=John Lanouette|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19670826&id=9K0rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kf0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=7213,5706895|title=Veronica Lake Gives Telegraph Exclusive Personal Interview|date=August 26, 1967|newspaper=The Telegraph|page=9|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] She also became a popular pin-up girl for soldiers during World War II and traveled throughout the United States to raise money for war bonds. 

===Decline===

Although popular with the public, Lake had a complex personality and acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with. Eddie Bracken, her co-star in Star Spangled Rhythm (in which Lake appeared in a musical number) was quoted as saying, "She was known as 'The Bitch' and she deserved the title."[tpl]harv|Donnelley|2003|p=392[/tpl][tpl]harv|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=480[/tpl] Joel McCrea, her co-star in Sullivan's Travels, reportedly turned down the co-starring role in I Married a Witch, saying, "Life's too short for two films with Veronica Lake."Robert Osborne, Turner Classic Movies, October 6, 2010 During filming of the 1946 film The Blue Dahlia, screenwriter Raymond Chandler referred to her as "Moronica Lake".[tpl]harv|Hiney|1999|p=154[/tpl]
Lake's career faltered with her unsympathetic role as Nazi spy Dora Bruckman in 1944's The Hour Before the Dawn. Scathing reviews of The Hour Before the Dawn included criticism of her unconvincing German accent. She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, and a growing number of people refused to work with her. To boost her career, Paramount tried Lake in a series of comedies.[tpl]cite news|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|title=Change of Pace in Roles Beckons Veronica Lake: Star to Pause at Career's Crossroads Roles to Shift for Veronica|date=July 8, 1945|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|page=C1[/tpl] Few were successful but she was in the popular thriller The Blue Dahlia (1946), in which she again co-starred with Alan Ladd.  Paramount decided not to renew her contract in 1948. 
After a single film for 20th Century Fox, Slattery's Hurricane in 1949, her career collapsed. By the end of 1951 she had appeared in one last film Stronghold (which she later described as "a dog"). Lake and her second husband, André de Toth, filed for bankruptcy that same year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LncoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GMgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4541,6166208&dq=veronica+lake+andre+de+toth&hl=en|title=Veronica Lake Says She's Bankrupt|date=August 17, 1951|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|page=1|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl] The IRS later seized their home for unpaid taxes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R3EzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5u4HAAAAIBAJ&pg=3658,602906&dq=veronica+lake+tax+seized&hl=en|title=Actress Loses Home For Not Paying Tax|date=April 7, 1951|newspaper=Lodi News–Sentinel|page=8|accessdate=January 10, 2013[/tpl]
Lake then turned to television and stage work. She performed in summer stock and in stage roles in England.[tpl]cite news|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1oIyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=frcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=894,6028745&dq=veronica+lake+autobiography+brood&hl=en|title=What Ever Happened to Veronica Lake?|date=March 14, 1971|work=The Palm Beach Post|page=C6|accessdate=January 11, 2013[/tpl] In October 1955 she collapsed in Detroit where she had been appearing on stage in The Little Hut.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19551028&id=-TlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nZUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4458,4305402|title=Veronica Lake In Hospital|date=October 28, 1955|newspaper=The Age|page=1|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl]

==Later years==

After her third divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. In 1962, a New York Post reporter found her working as a barmaid at the all-women's Martha Washington Hotel in Manhattan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ToaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BScEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7223,662510&dq=veronica+lake&hl=en|title=Veronica Lake is a Waitress Now|date=March 22, 1962|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|page=11|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] The reporter's widely distributed story led to speculation that Lake was destitute. After the story ran, fans of Lake sent her money which she returned out of "a matter of pride". Lake vehemently denied that she was destitute and stated, "It's as though people were making me out to be down-and-out. I wasn't. I was paying $190 a month rent then, and that's a long way from being broke."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=757&dat=19730709&id=rrhNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yUQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4092,661735|title=Actress Veronica Lake Dies In Vermont Hospital|date=July 9, 1973|newspaper=The Virgin Island Daily News|page=2|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] The story did revive some interest in Lake and led to some television and stage appearances, most notably in the off-Broadway revival of the musical Best Foot Forward.
In 1966, she had a brief stint as a TV hostess in Baltimore, Maryland, along with a largely ignored film role in Footsteps In the Snow. She also continued appearing in stage roles. By the late 1960s, Lake had moved to England. Her memoirs, Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake, were released in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States the following year. In the book, Lake discusses her career, her failed marriages, her romances with Howard Hughes, Tommy Manville and Aristotle Onassis (whom she claimed proposed to her), her alcoholism, and her guilt over not spending enough time with her children. In the book, Lake stated that her mother pushed her into a career as an actress. Looking back at her career, Lake wrote, "I never did cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair." She also laughed off the term "sex symbol" and instead referred to herself as a "sex zombie". Also in 1969, Lake portrayed the role as Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire on the English stage. She won rave reviews for her performance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19730708&id=ncEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=smYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7411,3142317|title=Peek-A-Boo Veronica Lake Dies At 51|date=July 8, 1973|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|page=9-A|accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl] With the proceeds from her autobiography, she co-produced and starred in her final film, Flesh Feast (1970), a low-budget horror movie with a Nazi-myth storyline.
Lake then moved to Ipswich, England, where she met and married Royal Navy captain Robert Carleton-Munro, in June 1972. The marriage lasted just one year and Lake returned to the United States in June 1973. She went to the Virgin Islands to await her divorce decree when she fell ill.

==Personal life==
