[[Metacyclic group]]

CATEGORIES: Group theory, Properties of groups, Solvable groups

In group theory, a metacyclic group is an extension of a cyclic group by a cyclic group. That is, it is a group G for which there is a short exact sequence
where H and K are cyclic. Equivalently, a metacyclic group is a group G having a cyclic normal subgroup N, such that the quotient G/N is also cyclic.

==Properties==

Metacyclic groups are both supersolvable and metabelian.
