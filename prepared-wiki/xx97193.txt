The Lipizzan or Lipizzaner ([tpl]lang-hu|Lipicai[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sl|Lipicanec[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|Lipizzano[/tpl], [tpl]lang-hr|Lipicanac[/tpl], [tpl]lang-cz|Lipicán[/tpl]), is a breed of horse closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, where they demonstrate the haute école or "high school" movements of classical dressage, including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the "airs above the ground." The horses at the Spanish Riding School are trained using traditional methods based on classical dressage that date back hundreds of years.
The Lipizzan breed dates back to the 16th century, when it was developed with the support of the Habsburg nobility. The breed takes its name from one of the earliest stud farms established, located near the Karst Plateau village of Lipica (spelled "Lipizza" in Italian), in modern-day Slovenia. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the War of the First Coalition, World War I and World War II. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. Along with the Disney movie, Lipizzans have also starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books and other media.
Today, eight stallions are recognized as the foundation bloodstock of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived. 

==History==

The ancestors of the Lipizzan can be traced to approximately A.D. 800.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.equiworld.net/uk/horsecare/Breeds/lipizzaner/index.htm|title=The Lipizzaner|accessdate=2008-09-17|author=|publisher=Equiworld |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430120418/http://www.equiworld.net/uk/horsecare/Breeds/lipizzaner/index.htm |archivedate = 2008-04-30[/tpl] The earliest predecessors of the Lipizzan originated in the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed on native Spanish stock. The result was the Andalusian horse and other Iberian horse breeds.Jankovich, They Rode Into Europe, p. 77[tpl]cite web|title=Andalusian|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|work=Breeds of Livestock|publisher=Oklahoma State University|accessdate=2008-11-05[/tpl]
By the 16th century, when the Habsburgs ruled both Spain and Austria, a powerful but agile horse was desired both for military uses and for use in the fashionable and rapidly growing riding schools for the nobility of central Europe. Therefore, in 1562, the Habsburg Emperor Maximillian II brought the Spanish Andalusian horse to Austria and founded the court stud at Kladrub. In 1580, his brother, Archduke Charles II, established a similar stud at Lipizza (now Lipica), located in modern-day Slovenia, from which the breed obtained its name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan.org/aboutlipizzans.html|title=Lipizzan Origins|accessdate=2008-09-17|author=|publisher=Lipizzan Association of North America[/tpl] The name of the village itself derives from the Slovenian word lipa, meaning "linden tree."[tpl]cite book|author=Snoj, Marko|year=2009. |title=Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen|publisher=Modrijan and Založba ZRC|pages=234–235[/tpl]
Spanish, Barb, and Arabian stock were crossed at Lipizza, and succeeding generations were crossed with the now-extinct Neapolitan breed from Italy and other Baroque horses of Spanish descent obtained from Germany and Denmark.  While breeding stock was exchanged between the two studs, Kladrub specialized in producing heavy carriage horses, while riding and light carriage horses came from the Lipizza stud.
Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, became the main stud for the horses used in Vienna. Breeding became very selective, only allowing stallions that had proved themselves at the Riding School to stand at stud, and only breeding mares who had passed rigorous performance testing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.piber.com/index.php?id=283|title=The Lipizzan Horses|accessdate=2008-09-17|publisher=Piber Stud|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928121149/http://www.piber.com/index.php?id=283|archivedate=2007-09-28[/tpl]

===Foundation horses===

Today, a maximum of eight foundation lines for Lipizzans are recognized by various registries, which refer to them as "dynasties."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan-online.com/main.asp?kat1=85&kat2=565&kat3=&vid=1|title=Breed Standards|accessdate=2014-04-29|publisher=Lipizzan International Federation[/tpl] They are divided into two groups.  Six trace to classical foundation stallions used in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Lipizza stud, and two additional lines were not used at Lipizza but were used by other studs within the historic boundaries of the Habsburg Empire.
The six "classical dynasties" are:
There are two additional stallion lines found in Croatia, Hungary, and other eastern European countries as well as in North America. They are accepted as equal to the 6 classical lines by the Lipizzan International Federation (LIF). These are:
There are several other stallion lines that have died out over the years, but were used in the early breeding of the horses.Dolenc, Lipizzaner, p. 49 In addition to the foundation stallion lines, there were 20 "classic" mare lines, fourteen of which exist today.Dolenc, Lipizzaner, p. 51 However, there are up to 35 mare lines recognized by various Lipizzan organizations.
There are traditional naming patterns for both stallions and mares, required by Lipizzan breed registries. Stallions traditionally are given two names, with the first being the line of the sire and the second being the name of the dam. For example, "Maestoso Austria" is a horse sired by Maestoso Trompeta out of a mare named Austria. The horse's sire line tracing to the foundation sire Maestoso. The names of mares are chosen to be "complementary to the traditional Lipizzan line names" and are required to end in the letter "a".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan.org/rules.html|title=Rules/Evaluations|accessdate=2008-09-17|publisher=Lipizzan Association of North America[/tpl]

===Spanish Riding School===

The world-famous Spanish Riding School uses highly trained Lipizzan stallions in public performances that demonstrate classical dressage movements and training.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srs.at/en/tradition/the-school-stallions/|title=The Stallions|publisher=Spanish Riding School|accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl] In 1572 the first Spanish Riding Hall was built, during the Austrian Empire, and is the oldest of its kind in the world.Podhajsky, The Complete Training of Horse and Rider, p. 249 The Spanish Riding School, though located in Vienna, Austria, takes its name from the original Spanish heritage of its horses. In 1729 Charles VI commissioned the building of the Winter Riding School in Vienna and in 1735, the building was completed that remains the home of the Spanish Riding School today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srs.at/en/tradition/the-spanish-riding-school/ |title=The Spanish Riding School|accessdate=2012-03-16|publisher=Spanish Riding School[/tpl]

===Wartime preservation===

The Lipizzans endured several wartime relocations that prevented extinction of the breed. The first came in March 1797 during the War of the First Coalition, when the horses were evacuated from Lipica. During the journey, 16 mares foaled. In November 1797, the horses returned to Lipica, but the stables were in ruins. They were rebuilt, but in 1805, the horses were evacuated again when Napoleon invaded Austria. They remained away from the stud for two years, returning April 1, 1807. However, following the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, the horses were evacuated three more times during the unsettled period in Austria, resulting in the loss of many horses and the destruction of the studbooks covering the years prior to 1700. The horses finally returned to Lipica for good in 1815, where they remained for the rest of the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lif.eu.com/|title=Lipizzan Horse History|publisher=Lipizzan International Federation|accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl]
The first evacuation of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when the horses were evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.uslr.org/LipizzanBreedHistory.htm|title=Lipizzan Breed History |publisher=United States Lipizzan Registry|accessdate=2008-12-06[/tpl] Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided up between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslovia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.piber.com/en/tradition/history/|title=History|accessdate=2011-12-08|publisher=Piber Stud[/tpl]
During World War II, the high command of Nazi Germany transferred most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock was taken from Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared the city and the head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger of being destroyed. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were in danger from the advancing Soviet army, which might have slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.[tpl]cite journal|title=Operation Cowboy |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007241/index.htm|author=Davis, Susan|date=October 16, 1995|journal=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl]
The rescue of the Lipizzans by the United States Army, made famous by the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions, occurred in two parts: The United States Third Army under the command of General George S. Patton, was near St. Martins in the spring of 1945 and learned that the Lipizzan stallions were in the area.[tpl]cite journal|title=The 2005 Lipizzaner Tour of the Spanish Riding School|author=Sosby, Brian|journal=Equestrian|date=October 2005|accessdate=2008-11-24| url=http://www.usef.org/_staffIframes/pressbox/images/magazine/pdf/6dfc4245ac3b9df1210bce4ed7554fa8.pdf[/tpl] Patton himself was a horseman, and like Podhajsky, had competed in the Olympic Games. On May 7, 1945, Podhajsky put on an exhibition of the Spanish Riding School stallions for Patton and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and at its conclusion requested that Patton take the horses under his protection.Patton, The Patton Papers, p. 697
Meanwhile, the Third Army's United States Second Cavalry, a tank unit under the command of Colonel Charles Reed, had discovered the horses at Hostau, where there were also 400 Allied prisoners of war, and had occupied it on April 28, 1945. "Operation Cowboy", as the rescue was known, resulted in the recovery of 1,200 horses, including 375 Lipizzans, Patton learned of the raid, and arranged for Podhajsky to fly to Hostau.Hirshson, General Patton, p. 635 On May 12, American soldiers began riding, trucking and herding the horses 35 miles across the border into Kotztinz, Germany. The Lipizzans were eventually settled in temporary quarters in Wimsbach, until the breeding stock returned to Piber in 1952, and the stallions returned to the Spanish Riding School in 1955.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srs.at/en/tradition/the-history/|title=The History|accessdate=2011-12-08|publisher=Spanish Riding School[/tpl] In 2005, the Spanish Riding School celebrated the 60th anniversary of Patton's rescue by touring the United States.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_May_5/ai_n13672464|title=After 15 Year Absence Legendary Lipizzaner Stallions of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna Set Return for U.S. Tour|journal=Business Wire|date=2005-05-05|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl]
The Lipik stable in Croatia had been taken by the Serbs to Novi Sad, Serbia during the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995). The horses remained there until 2007,[tpl]cite news | url = http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/i-lipicance-ubijaju-zar-ne | language = Croatian | newspaper = Globus | title = Pomor u zajednici bijelih griva - I Lipicance ubijaju, zar ne? | author = Boris Orešić | date = 2010-12-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101130727/http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/i-lipicance-ubijaju-zar-ne|archivedate=2011-01-01[/tpl] when calls began to be made for them to be returned to their country of origin. In October 2007, 60 horses were returned to Croatia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan.org/pressreleases/bosnia_serbian_lipizzans.html|title=Croatian Lipizzaners Return Home|publisher=Lipizzan Association of North America|accessdate=2014-04-29[/tpl]

===Modern breed===

The Lipizzan breed suffered a setback to its population when a viral epidemic hit the Piber Stud in 1983. Forty horses and eight percent of the expected foal crop were lost. Since then, the population at the stud has increased, with 100 mares at the stud as of 1994 and a foal crop of 56 born in 1993. In 1994, the pregnancy return increased from 27% to 82% as the result of a new veterinary center.Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p. 129 In 1996, a study funded by the European Union Indo-Copernicus Project assessed 586 Lipizzan horses from eight stud farms in Europe, with the goal of developing a "scientifically-based description of the Lipizzan horse". In addition, a study was conducted of the mtDNA of 212 of the same horses. The horses studied were found to contain 37 of the 39 known mtDNA haplotypes known in modern horses, meaning that they show a high degree of genetic diversity. This was not an unexpected conclusion to the study, as it was known that the mare families of the Lipizzan included a large number of different breeds, ranging from many European breeds to Arabians and Thoroughbreds.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.uslipizzan.org/files/ml-mtdna-genetics-article.pdf|title=Mitochondrial DNA Genetics of Lipizzans|author=Kelly, Jeff and Kelly-Simmons, Lisa|journal=USLF News|date=Winter 2012|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=History of Lipizzan horse maternal lines as revealed by mtDNA analysis|journal=Genet.

The Lipizzan International Federation (LIF) is the international governing organization for the breed, composed of many national and private organizations representing the Lipizzan. The organizations work together under the banner of the LIF to promote the breed and maintain standards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan-online.com/main.asp?kat1=85&kat2=603&kat3=&vid=1|title=Gründung|language=German|publisher=Lipizzan International Federation|accessdate=2014-04-26[/tpl] As of 2012, there were almost 11,000 Lipizzans registered with the LIF residing with private breeders in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The largest number are in Europe, with almost 9,000 registered horses, followed by the Americas, with just over 1,700, and Africa and Australia with around 100 horses each. The nine state studs that are part of the LIF represent almost one-quarter of the horses in Europe. Sâmbăta de Jos, in Romania, has the greatest number of horses, with 400, followed by Piber in Austria (360), Lipica in Slovenia (358), Szilvásvárad in Hungary (262), Monterotondo in Italy (230), Đakovo-Lipik in Croatia (220) and Topoľčianky in Slovakia (200). The other two studs are smaller, with Vučijak in Bosnia having 130 horses and Karađorđevo in Serbia having just 30.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lipizzan-online.com/main.asp?kat1=64&kat2=543&kat3=&vid=1|title=Purebred Lipizzans Registered by Members of Lipizzan International Federation|date=October 2012|publisher=Lipizzan International Federation|accessdate=2014-04-28|author=Manz, Christian G.M.[/tpl] Educational programs have been developed in order to promote the breed and foster adherence to traditional breeding objectives. The Lipizzan today competes successfully in dressage and driving, as well as retaining their classic position at the Spanish Riding School. 
Because of the status of Lipizzans as the only breed of horse developed in Slovenia, via the Lipica stud, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://networkeurope.radio.cz/feature/slovenia-banks-on-the-euro|publisher=Network Europe|title=Slovenia Banks on the Euro|author=Manske, Michael|accessdate=2008-09-24[/tpl] Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan as one of their mounts.Lipizzan horses used by Mounted Carabinieri Regiments In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the animal in the care of the stud farm.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-10-22-2561594197_x.htm|title=Slovenia Gives Britain's Queen a Lipizzaner Horse|accessdate=2011-12-08|last=Vukic |first=Snjezana | work = USA Today | agency= Associated Press |date=2008-10-22[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Most Lipizzans measure between [tpl]hands|14.2|and|15.2[/tpl]. However, horses bred that are closer to the original carriage-horse type are taller, approaching [tpl]hands|16.1[/tpl].Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p.111. Lipizzans have a long head, with a straight or slightly convex profile. The jaw is deep, the ears small, the eyes large and expressive and the nostrils flared. They have a neck that is sturdy, yet arched and withers that are low, muscular and broad. They are a Baroque-type horse, with a wide, deep chest, broad croup and muscular shoulder. The tail is carried high and well set. The legs are well-muscled and strong, with broad joints and well-defined tendons. The feet tend to be small, but are tough.Bongianni, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies, Entry 37.
Lipizzan horses tend to mature slowly. However, they live and are active longer than many other breeds, with horses performing the difficult exercises of the Spanish Riding School well into their 20s and living into their 30s.

===Color===

Aside from the rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, including Lipizzans, are born dark—usually bay or black—and become lighter each year as the graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Contrary to popular belief, Lipizzans are not actually true white horses. A white horse is born white, has pink skin and often has blue eyes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php|title=Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|work=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory|publisher= University of California, Davis |accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl]
Until the 18th century, Lipizzans had other coat colors, including dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray was the color preferred by the royal family, and so the color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, it came to be the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/lipizzan/index.htm|title=Lipizzaner|publisher=Oklahoma State University|work=Breeds of Livestock|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl] However, it is a long-standing tradition for the Spanish Riding School to have at least one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.Swinney, Horse Breeds of the World, p.52.

==Training==

The traditional training methods for Lipizzans were developed at the Spanish Riding School and are based on the principles of classical dressage, which is in turn based on the writings of Xenophon, a Greek commander whose works were rediscovered in the 16th century.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.chronofhorse.com/article/xenophon-forefather-dressage|title=Xenophon, Forefather Of Dressage|author=Gibbon, Abby|date=September 29, 2011|publisher=Chronicle of the Horse|accessdate=2014-04-22[/tpl] His thoughts on horses' mental attitude and psyche are still considered standards today. Other writers and equestrians who strongly influenced the training methods in place today at the Spanish Riding School include Federico Grisone, the founder of the first riding academy in Naples, who lived during the 16th century; and Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de la Guérinière, two Frenchmen from the 17th and 18th centuries. The fundamentals taught to the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish Riding School were passed down via an oral tradition until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the School in 1898. Alois Podhajsky, whose works, written in the mid-20th century, serve as textbooks for many dressage riders today, was another significant influence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spanische-hofreitschule.com/index.php?id=329|title=Classical Equitation|publisher=Spanish Riding School|accessdate=2009-01-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060522133309/http://www.spanische-hofreitschule.com/index.php?id=329|archivedate=2006-05-22[/tpl] The principles taught at the Spanish Riding School are based on practices taught to cavalry riders to prepare their horses for warfare.Podhajsky, The Complete Training of Horse and Rider, p. 24
Young stallions come to the Spanish Riding School for training when they are four years old. Full training takes an average of six years for each horse, and schooling is considered complete when they have mastered the "School Quadrille". There are three fundamental skill sets taught to the stallions, which are:
Although the Piber Stud trains mares for driving and under saddle, the Spanish Riding School exclusively uses stallions in its performances.

=="Airs above the ground"==

The "airs above the ground" or exercises above the ground are the difficult "high school" dressage movements made famous by the Lipizzans.Podhajsky, The Complete Training of Horse and Rider, p. 268 They include:

==In popular culture==

Lipizzans have starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books and other media.
The 1940 film Florian stars two Lipizzan stallions. It was based on a 1934 novel written by Felix Salten. The wife of the film's producer owned the only Lipizzans in the US at the time that the movie was made.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lipizzan.org/merchandisepages/florianvideo.html|title=Florian|accessdate=2008-09-17|publisher=Lipizzan Association of North America[/tpl] The rescue during World War II of the Lipizzan stallions is depicted in the 1963 Walt Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. The movie was the only live-action, relatively realistic film set against a World War II backdrop that Disney has ever produced.Brode, From Walt to Woodstock, p.169. In the feature film Crimson Tide, a discussion between the two main characters over whether Lipizzans came from Spain or Portugal, and whether they are born white or black, is used to represent the film's suppressed racial conflict and the dividing of the world between two main powers during the Cold War.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs29/feat_peransonandhuber_scott.html|title=World Out of Order: Tony Scott’s Vertigo|last1=Huber | first1=Christoph |first2=Mark |last2=Peranson|accessdate=2008-09-18|journal=Cinema Scope|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090211232400/http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs29/feat_peransonandhuber_scott.html|archivedate=2009-02-11[/tpl]
