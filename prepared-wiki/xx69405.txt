Seth spent part of his youth in London and returned to India in 1957. He received primary education at Welham Boys' School and then moved to The Doon School.

==Career==

===Work themes===

A polyglot, Seth detailed in an interview (in the year 2005) in the Australian magazine Good Weekend that he has studied several languages, including Welsh, German and, later, French in addition to Mandarin, English (which he describes as "my instrument" in answer to Indians who query his not writing in his native Hindi, which he reads and writes in the Dēvanāgarī script) and Urdu, which he reads and writes in Nasta'liq script. He plays the Indian flute and the cello and sings German lieder, especially Schubert.

===Business acumen===

Seth's former literary agent Giles Gordon recalled being interviewed by Seth for the position:
Vikram sat at one end of a long table and he began to grill us. It was absolutely incredible. He wanted to know our literary tastes, our views on poetry, our views on plays, which novelists we liked.[tpl]citation |title=A suitable joy |date=27 March 1999 |url=HTTP://guardianship/Saturday_review/story/0,,306943,00.html |periodical=The Guardian |accessdate=2007-09-05 |first=Jeremy |last=Gavron |location=London[/tpl].
Seth later explained to Gordon that he had passed the interview not because of commercial considerations, but because unlike the others he was the only agent who seemed as interested in his poetry as in his other writing. Seth followed what he has described as "the ludicrous advance for that book" (£250,000 for A Suitable BoyVikram Seth writes Suitable Boy sequel in The Guardian 3  July 2009) with £500,000 for An Equal Music and £1.4 million for Two Lives.[tpl]citation |title=Seth to get at least $3 million advance |first=Shyam |last=Bhatia |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=2007-09-05 |periodical=Rediff.com |url=HTTP://www.rediff.com/news/2003/sep/01seth.htm?zcc=rl[/tpl]. He prepared an acrostic poem for his address at Gordon's 2005 memorial service.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
