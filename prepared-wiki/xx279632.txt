[[International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice in Kashmir]]

CATEGORIES: Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir

International People's Tribunal on Human Rights and Justice in Kashmir (IPTK) is an initiative formed by Indian human rights activists for the purpose of probing human right violations in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and bridging the gap between Indian and Kashmiri citizens. It was first convened in 2008 by Pervez Imroz, Angana P. Chatterji, Gautam Navlakha and Zaheer-Ud-Din.[tpl]cite news|author=Mallika Kaur Sarkaria|title=On trial: human rights in Kashmir|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-237943395.html|publisher=Kennedy School Review [tpl]Subscription required|via=HighBeam[/tpl]|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=22 March 2009[/tpl] Chatterji served as convener until December 2012. http://kashmirprocess.org/conveners.html

==Background==

The Tribunal was first envisioned in 2006 when Parvez Imroz, a human rights activist, invited Angana Chatterji to Kashmir. From 2006-2008, Chatterji studied the Kashmir issue and interviewed the locals. Mallika Kaur, a scholar of Harvard Kennedy School, while explaining the need of the Tribunal, said that there was no such mechanism for investigating the human right abuses in this hypermilitarized region.
The Tribunal's mandate does not include finding political solutions to resolve the Kashmir issue. Instead it includes recording and investigating crimes committed only in the part of Kashmir administered by India. According to Mallika Kaur the Tribunal did not include the Pakistani-administered Kashmir because it was set up by Indian citizens and access across the heavily guarded border is not possible. The Tribunal was also mandated to investigate how the violations of human rights by the militants intersect with those security forces.http://www.kashmirprocess.org/premise.html

==Findings==

In December 2009 the International People's Tribunal released a report titled Buried Evidence.[tpl]cite journal|title=The SHRC report on Jammu and Kashmir's enforced disappearances and mass graves puts the State and Central governments on the spot|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282003800.htm|accessdate=9 August 2013|magazine=Frontline|author=Shujaat Bukhari|volume=28|issue=20|date=24 September 2011[/tpl] The Tribunal alleges that the insurgency from 1989-2009 has caused more than 70,000 deaths. According to Angana P. Chatterji, the convener of the Tribunal, they investigated fifty killings by the Indian Security Forces; except one all were declared militant. Of those who were killed in these incidents 39 were Muslims, four were Hindus and rest were of undetermined religious background. The Tribunal found that only one of those killed was a militant and the rest were killed in staged encounters.[tpl]cite book|title=South Asian Feminisms|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223517-9-5|pages=181-204|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=wOr5rxXE5UcC&pg=PT188|author=Angana P.

In December 2012 IPTK along with Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons released a report Alleged Perpetrators â€“ Stories of Impunity in Jammu and Kashmir, which alleged involvement of about 500 Indian Armed Forces officials in human rights abuses in Kashmir.[tpl]cite news|title=Indian officials accused of Kashmir rights abuses|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20624798|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=6 December 2013|agency=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Report Alleges Abuse by Indian Officials in Kashmir|journal=Impunity Watch|date=7 December 2012|url=http://impunitywatch.com/report-alleges-abuse-by-indian-officials-in-kashmir/|accessdate=9 August 2013|author=Karen Diep|publisher=Syracuse University College of Law[/tpl] Those accused included three Brigadier rank officers of Indian Army.[tpl]cite news|title=Top Army, police officials involved in human rights abuse in Kashmir|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/top-army-police-officials-involved-in-human-rights-abuse-in-kashmir/article4171847.ece|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=7 December 2012|author=Ahmed Ali Fayyaz[/tpl] The access to the official record available with the police along with interviewing the affected families helped in preparing the report, which took over two years to get completed. The report that alleges that the perpetrators of crimes in Kashmir are decorated instead of prosecuted, analysed 214 cases of abuse and further mentions 8,000 forced disappearances and 70 killings.[tpl]cite news|title=Kashmir's tempestuous human right abuses|url=http://www.agoracosmopolitan.com/news/editorial/2013/04/08/5679.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=The Canadian - Agora Cosmopolitan|date=8 April 2013|author=Ameer Tarin[/tpl]

==Activities==

In 2008 the Tribunal officials came under attack in the valley allegedly from Indian security forces. Besides spying and harassment of the tribunal, grenades were hurled at Parvez Imroz's residence in Kashmir on 30th June. The tribunal in a memorandum submitted to the government said that the use of landmines by the Indian Security Forces in the valley imperils the lives of civilian population.[tpl]cite book|title=Landmine Monitor 2009|year=2009|publisher=Mines Action|location=Canada|isbn=978-0-9738955-5-1|pages=931-932|month=October[/tpl] In June 2010 the tribunal presented its finding to the British Parliamentary Group on Kashmir (APPG-K).[tpl]cite news|title=Angana Chatterji and Kashmir Tribunal at UK Parliament|url=http://alumni.ciis.edu/newsletter/index.asp?id=124|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=California Institute of Integral Studies Newsletter[/tpl] The IPTK in November 2010 presented a memorandum along with other human rights organizations. The memorandum asked the US President Barack Obama as well as the international community to play their part in settling the Kashmir dispute that has been lingering on for six decades. Moreover it asked Obama to raise the issue of Kashmir with Indian premier Manmohan Singh and to not jeopardize this issue on the cost of improving relations with India.[tpl]cite news|title=Civil Society Groups Seek Obama's Intervention in Kashmir Resolution|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20101104123445kash.nb/topstory.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=News Blaze|date=4 November 2010|author=Fayaz Wani[/tpl]

==Reception==

The local people of the Kashmir valley including the Hindu pandits welcomed the Tribunal and offered their help even when they were threatened. The people according to Imroz were content that this issue is being taken up internationally. The European Parliament supported the Tribunal by inviting them to testify before Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights at Brusselshttp://kashmirprocess.org/press/20080717_EPHR_PR.html and adopting a resolution on allegations of mass graves http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0366+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN in 2008.
