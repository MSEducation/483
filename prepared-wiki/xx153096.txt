CATEGORIES: British campaign medals, Australian campaign medals, New Zealand campaign medals

The General Service Medal (1918 GSM) was instituted to recognise service in minor Army and Air Force operations for which no separate medal was intended. It was equivalent to the 1915 Naval General Service Medal.  Both these medals were replaced by the General Service Medal in 1962.

==Clasps==

Seventeen clasps were approved for the 1918 GSM. These clasps comprise of small metal bars into which the name of the relevant campaign or theatre of operations was moulded. The clasps were then attached to the medal's suspension bar. The 1918 GSM was never awarded without a clasp.
