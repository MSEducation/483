Arthur Frederick Dicks (1935–1994) was a designer working in the field of theatre and dance, as well as an accomplished actor and artist. He became the first head of design at NIDA, (National Institute of Dramatic Art) in Australia.
Born in London, Dicks lived through the Blitz, and was eventually rehoused in the country when his home was destroyed. In his teens he became involved in repertory theatre and acted with Laurence Olivier and Judi Dench; some of these actors he stayed in contact with for the rest of his life. As well as working on his drama skills, he began work as an artist for a prestigious advertising agency.
He decided to travel in his twenties and ended up in New York where he went to work for a leading fashion magazine. An assignment in Louisiana in 1951 led to his taking a yearlong break in New Orleans, living in the Pontalba Apartments and a friend's plantation house at White Castle, where he began a series of travel painted diaries.
By the mid-1950s he was back in London where he signed up with the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was assigned to bomb disposal and sent to Iraq. Again he did many detailed drawings and photos of his travels.
After the RAF, Dicks returned to London where he married and returned to the theatre.  Both he and his wife acted all over the United Kingdom. They also had a daughter.  He often not only acted but was involved in designing the sets and costumes. This new direction saw him working as a set and costume designer in England, USA and Africa, spending some time in Nairobi.
By the mid-1960s Dicks arrived in Hollywood with introductions to David Niven and the English set of actors. He quickly started work with designer Bill Travilla and liaised with Edith Head on two productions as well. By now he had two daughters, but his wife and children returned to London.
