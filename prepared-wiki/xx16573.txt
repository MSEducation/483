Roseann "Rosie" O'Donnell (born March 21, 1962)[tpl]cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/rosie-odonnell-9542144|work=The Biography Channel|publisher=A+E Television Networks|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl] is an American comedian, actress, author and television personality. She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, LGBT rights activist, television producer and collaborative partner in the LGBT family vacation company R Family Vacations.
O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show Star Search in 1984. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and from 1996 to 2002, she hosted The Rosie O'Donnell Show, which won multiple Emmy awards. During this time, she wrote her first memoir, Find Me, and developed the nickname "Queen of Nice" as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her For All Kids foundation and promoted other charity projects, encouraging celebrities on her show to also take part. 
O'Donnell came out, stating "I'm a dyke!" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to gay adoption issues. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She was named "Person of the Year" in a 2002 cover story by The Advocate with an in-depth interview by the magazine's editor-in-chief, Judy Wieder. In May 2003, she became a regular contributor to the magazine. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues.
In 2006, O'Donnell became a moderator on The View. Her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies, including an on-air dispute regarding the Bush administration's policies with the Iraq War, resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007, O'Donnell released her second memoir, Celebrity Detox, which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at The View. From 2009 to 2011, she hosted Rosie Radio on Sirius XM Radio. In 2011, O'Donnell signed on with the OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network to return to daytime TV with The Rosie Show. The network cancelled the show due to low ratings on March 16, 2012, and the last show aired on March 29, 2012.

==Early life==

O'Donnell, the third of five children, was born and raised in Commack, Long Island, New York.[tpl]cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell|url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/0,,,00.html|work=People (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]People|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell Biography (1962–)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Rosie-O-Donnell.html|work=Film Reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl] She is the daughter of Roseann Teresa (née Murtha), a homemaker, and Edward Joseph O'Donnell, an electrical engineer who worked in the defense industry. O'Donnell's father had immigrated from County Donegal, Ireland during his childhood, and her mother was Irish American; O'Donnell was raised Catholic.[tpl]cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert|title=Rosie: The Rosie O'Donnell Story|publisher=Carroll & Graf|date=January 1998|page=12|isbn=0-7867-0542-6[/tpl][tpl]cite episode|title=Rosie O'Donnell|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|first=James (host)|last=Lipton|network=Bravo|date=23 October 2005|season=11|number=20[/tpl] Four days before her 11th birthday, on March 17, 1973, O'Donnell's mother died of breast cancer. While she attended Commack High School, O'Donnell was voted homecoming queen, prom queen, senior class president and class clown. It was during high school that she began exploring her interest in comedy, beginning with a skit performed in front of the school in which she imitated Gilda Radner's character Roseanne Roseannadanna. After graduating in 1980, O'Donnell briefly attended Dickinson College, later transferring to Boston University, before ultimately dropping out of college.

As part of her playful banter with her studio audience, O'Donnell often launched koosh balls at the crowd and camera.[tpl]cite book|last=Chetwynd|first=Josh|title=The Secret History of Balls: The Stories Behind the Things We Love to Catch, Whack, Throw, Kick, Bounce and Bat|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4YXTQxelfmYC&pg=PT65|accessdate=February 18, 2014|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-51487-0|page=65|quote=Comedian Rosie O'Donnell made flinging Koosh Balls into her audience a staple on her talk show, which aired from 1996 to 2002.[/tpl] She also professed an infatuation with Tom Cruise.
With New York City as the show's homebase, O'Donnell displayed her love of Broadway musicals and plays by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket giveaways.
After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of gun control and a major figure in the Million Mom March.[tpl]cite news|last=Paulson|first=Amy|title='Million Mom March' organizers hope to spur congressional action on gun legislation|work=CNN|date=May 8, 2000|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/08/million.mom/index.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014[/tpl] During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, "You are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison."[tpl]cite web|last=Gallant|first=Paul|last2=Eisen|first2=Joanne|last3=Kopel|first3=Dave|title=Her Own Bodyguard|work=National Review|date=January 24, 2002|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopelprint012402.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014[/tpl] O'Donnell previously had remarked, "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem."[tpl]cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen|title=A Bodyguard for Rosie's Kid|publisher=People|date=September 11, 1998|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,617858,00.html|accessdate=July 20, 2007[/tpl] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of "assault weapons." She said at the end of the segment the conversation had "not gone the way I had hoped" and added "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize, because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today."[tpl]cite web|title=TRANSCRIPT: Tom Selleck Visits "The Rosie O'Donnell Show"|publisher=NRA Winning Team|url=http://www.nrawinningteam.com/norosie.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first =Otherone|title=Transcript of Tom Selleck & Rosie O'Donnell's NRA Discussion|publisher=JLRweb|url =http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302075026/http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|archivedate=March 2, 2008[/tpl] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" from the song "Anything You Can Do" and agreed to perform "My Defenses Are Down" instead.[tpl]cite news|title=Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie|work=People|date=March 1, 1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,616006,00.html|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl]
Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with Kmart as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she shouldn't be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally which she supports. Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract.[tpl]cite news|last=Fink|first=Mitchell|last2=Rubin|first2=Lauren|title=Rosie Sticks to Her Guns by Unloading Kmart Gig|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/rosie-sticks-guns-unloading-kmart-gig-article-1.857102|accessdate=February 15, 2014|newspaper=Daily News (New York)[tpl]![/tpl]Daily News|date=November 19, 1999|location=New York[/tpl] In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a concealed firearm permit. O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by Warner Bros. requested the gun. O'Donnell stated that because of threats, she and her family need protection, which she attributes to her "tough gun-control rhetoric".[tpl]cite web|last=J.A.|first=Johnson Jr.|title=Rosie's Bodyguard Applies for Gun Permit|publisher=The Stamford Advocate|date=May 25, 2000|url=http://www.network54.com/Forum/33620/message/959280480/Rosie+O'Donnell's+Bodyguard+Applies+for+Gun+Permit|accessdate=June 16, 2007[/tpl]
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the performing arts. She announced that she would donate 1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to "give till it hurts".[tpl]cite news|title=O'donnell donates $1 million in aid|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/2001/09/20/usn_millionin.shtml|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=Amarillo Globe-News|date=September 20, 2001|agency=Associated Press[tpl]![/tpl]AP[/tpl]
In 2002, she left her talk show.[tpl]cite news|last=Williams|first=Jeannie|title=Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm|accessdate=February 18, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 27, 2002[/tpl] The show was replaced by The Caroline Rhea Show, with comedian Caroline Rhea, which ran for one additional season.

===The View===

In September 2006, O'Donnell replaced Meredith Vieira as a co-host and moderator of The View, a daytime women-oriented talk show.[tpl]cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|title=Rosie O'Donnell to Join the Cast of 'The View'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/arts/television/29rosi.html|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 29, 2006[/tpl] Star Jones, a co-host on the show, quit, with some speculating Jones's conservative views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been through gastric bypass surgery, rather than dieting and exercise alone as Jones had insisted, which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two. (Jones later confirmed that surgery was involved.) O'Donnell is credited with keeping the show's "buzz factor up"."The Future of The View" TV Guide, June 3, 2006. Retrieved on June 5, 2007. She is also credited with making it more news-focused, though it still embraced the "fluff" of daytime TV talk shows (celebrities, fashion and food).[tpl]cite news|last=Tucker|first=Ken|title=The View Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20013740,00.html|accessdate=February 15, 2014|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 2, 2007[/tpl] Despite an overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27% during O'Donnell's first year on The View.[tpl]cite news|last=Adalian|first=Josef|title=O'Donnell brings big ratings to 'The View'|url=http://variety.com/2006/scene/news/o-donnell-brings-big-ratings-to-the-view-1117955333/|accessdate=February 15, 2014|newspaper=Variety (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Variety|date=December 7, 2006[/tpl] The show was the fourth-most-watched in all of daytime in the key demographic of women ages 18–49, and scored record ratings in the total viewer category with an average of 3.4 million viewers—up 15% versus the same time in 2005. O'Donnell moderated the opening "Hot Topics" portion of the show, where news items were discussed. O'Donnell gave the show a more political slant, and she and fellow comic Joy Behar often gave strong opinions against former President Bush's domestic and foreign policies, including the Iraq War. As a conservative counterpoint, Elisabeth Hasselbeck would usually support the Bush administration's policies and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take.
Encouraged by the show to be outspoken, O'Donnell sometimes provoked debate, at one time stating "radical Christianity is just as threatening as radical Islam."[tpl]cite news|last=Barrick|first=Audrey|title=Rosie O'Donnell's Remarks on 'Radical Christianity' Draw Fire|url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/rosie.odonnells.remarks.on.radical.christianity.draw.fire./2433.htm|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Christian Today|date=September 20, 2006[/tpl] O'Donnell, who was raised Roman Catholic, was accused of "serial anti-Catholicism" and called a bigot by Catholic League president William Donohue for what he claimed were "relentless and profoundly ignorant attacks on the Roman Catholic Church and its teachings."[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] On the February 24, 2003 episode of Phil Donahue's talk show, O'Donnell referred to the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston resulting in $157 million awarded to 983 claimants,[tpl]cite news|last=Mozingo|first=Joe|title=Disagreements persist despite abuse settlement|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/16/local/me-priests16/2|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 16, 2007[/tpl] stating "I hope the Catholic Church gets sued until the end of time.

O'Donnell condemned many of the Bush administration's policies, especially the war in Iraq and the resulting occupation.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Donnell|first=Rosie|title=Burned Up and Burned Out by Politics|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rosie-odonnell/burned-up-and-burned-out-_b_84868.html|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=February 4, 2008[/tpl] She consistently brought up recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as "the most-discussed moment of her professional life." On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead.

On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticims; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, "Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?"

O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera now showed a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer "had to prepare that in advance ... I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel."

Kopko in 2000.[tpl]cite news|last=Paik|first=Felicia|title=Private Properties|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB949622673396879408|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 4, 2000[/tpl] 

===Coming out===

In her January 31, 2002, appearance on the sitcom Will & Grace, she played a lesbian mom. A month later as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at Caroline's Comedy Club O'Donnell came out as a lesbian, announcing "I'm a dyke!" "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody."[tpl]cite news|last=Williams|first=Jeannie|title=Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 27, 2002[/tpl] The announcement came two months before the end of the hosting of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the gay adoption issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents. 
Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, episode of PrimeTime Thursday. O'Donnell told USA Today that she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, "I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me." She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who face having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law won't let them adopt because Florida bans gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him."[tpl]cite news|last=Musto|first=Michael|title=NY Mirror|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-03-05/columns/ny-mirror/full/|accessdate=March 8, 2014|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=March 5, 2002[/tpl] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair.

Her decision to go to San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against then-President George W. Bush over his support for the Federal Marriage Amendment. She said in 2004, "We were both inspired to come here after the sitting president made the vile and hateful comments he made ... One thought ran through my mind on the plane out here – with liberty and justice for all."[tpl]cite web|author=Gordon, David Gordon; O'Driscoll, Sean|title=Rosie O'Donnell Weds Longtime Girlfriend|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=August 13, 2004|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/|accessdate=July 14, 2007[/tpl] The couple was married by San Francisco Treasurer Susan Leal, one of the city's highest ranking lesbian officials and was serenaded by the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus. O'Donnell said during the trial over Rosie magazine she had decided to marry Carpenter, in part because even though they acted as spouses they legally were no closer than friends: "We applied for spousal privilege and were denied it by the state. As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of gay marriage."
