==Development==

Brenda Lee, who was born in Atlanta, Georgia, thought about recording a Gospel album, since she "grew up in the church and gospel music." According to her, Gospel music is her "heritage" and "roots in music". All of the songs chosen for the album are songs she grew up with. As she started recording, she decided to invite some artist friends to sing with her. Provident Music liked the idea and they decided to do it.
According to Brenda Lee, all the friends she called agreed to appear on the album, which made her feel "very blessed and very fortunate. It just all came together perfectly."Brenda Lee Interview on Country Stars Central
