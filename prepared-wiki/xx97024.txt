A Change of Seasons is an EP by progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on September 19, 1995 through East West Records. It comprises the 23-minute title track and a collection of bonus live covers performed at a fan club concert at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, England.
The title track, which was recorded at BearTracks Studios in New York, includes samples from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society and from the 1648 Robert Herrick poem, To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time,http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/herrick/tovirgins.htm was originally to be released on the 1992 album Images and Words.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/28.aspx |title=A change of Seasons in Images and Words | work= About Mike - FAQ |publisher=Mikeportnoy.com |first=Mike|last=Portnoy |date= |accessdate=30 September 2013[/tpl] The lyrics, written by drummer Mike Portnoy, were not inspired by the movie but rather the death of his mother.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/30.aspx |title=Did the movie Dead Poet's Society influence the song A Change of Seasons? | work= About Mike - FAQ |publisher=Mikeportnoy.com |first=Mike|last=Portnoy |date= |accessdate=30 September 2013[/tpl] A Change of Seasons was also the first Dream Theater release featuring Derek Sherinian on keyboards.

Note that this is considered an EP only in name: at 57:30, it is much longer than a standard EP, or, indeed, many LPs. In fact, it is longer than Dream Theater's first two albums. Portnoy has said "It was important for us and the label for it not to be perceived as the latest studio record. That's why we tagged it an EP."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/30.aspx#306 |title=Dream Theater - A Change of Seasons EP | work= About Mike - FAQ |publisher=Mikeportnoy.com |first=Mike|last=Portnoy |date= |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl]
