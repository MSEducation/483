This page seeks to list and compare hardware devices that are shipped with Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 operating system. HTC Corporation, Samsung, LG, Dell, Fujitsu, Nokia, Acer, Alcatel and ZTE have all released Windows Phone-based devices.
The list contains devices that have been confirmed and officially announced by their manufacturers.

==Released==

===Windows Phone 7.0===

First generation devices come with Windows Phone 7 preinstalled and can be updated to Windows Phone 7.5 "Mango".  All devices in this list feature a 1Â GHz single-core processor, 512 MB of RAM, a 480 x 800 WVGA resolution screen, a back camera of 5 megapixels and a built-in digital compass. There are two exceptions, however; the Dell Venue Pro does not feature a compass, while the HTC 7 Mozart includes an 8 MP back camera instead of 5 MP.

===Windows Phone 7.5===

Second generation Windows Phone comes pre-installed with the Windows Phone 7.5 "Mango" version of Windows Phone or later. All devices in this list feature a single-core processor, a 480 x 800 WVGA resolution screen, and (except for the HTC Radar) a built-in digital compass. Due to the change of requirements, some second generation devices have lower-speed processors or less than 512 MB of RAM.

===Windows Phone 7.8===
