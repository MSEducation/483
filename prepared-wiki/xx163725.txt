Hou Lan ([tpl]zh|t=侯覽|s=侯览[/tpl], Pinyin Hóu Lǎn) was a eunuch of the late Han Dynasty, who served Emperor Ling of Han. After Emperor Ling died and was succeeded by his son Liu Bian in 189, He Jin, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao invaded the capital for the purpose of defeating the Ten Attendants, leading to He Jin's beheading in the palace courtyard by the Ten Attendants.
