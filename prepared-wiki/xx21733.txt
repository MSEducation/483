Tryptophan (IUPAC-IUBMB abbreviation: Trp or W; IUPAC abbreviation: L-Trp or D-Trp; sold for medical use as Tryptan)[tpl]cite web | author=IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title=Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | work=Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology etc | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate=2007-05-17[/tpl] is one of the 22 standard amino acids and an essential amino acid in the human diet, as demonstrated by its growth effects on rats. It is encoded in the standard genetic code as the codon UGG. Only the L-stereoisomer of tryptophan is used in structural or enzyme proteins, but the R -stereoisomer is occasionally found in naturally produced peptides (for example, the marine venom peptide contryphan).[tpl]cite journal |author=Pallaghy PK, Melnikova AP, Jimenez EC, Olivera BM, Norton RS|title=Solution structure of contryphan-R, a naturally-occurring disulfide-bridged octapeptide containing D-tryptophan: comparison with protein loops|journal= Biochemistry |volume= 38 |issue= 35 |pages= 11553–9 |year= 1999 |pmid= 10471307 | doi = 10.1021/bi990685j[/tpl] The distinguishing structural characteristic of tryptophan is that it contains an indole functional group.

==Isolation==

The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901[tpl]cite journal | author = Hopkienns FG, Cole SW | title = A contribution to the chemistry of proteids: Part I.

==Biosynthesis and industrial production==

Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Radwanski ER, Last RL | title = Tryptophan biosynthesis and metabolism: biochemical and molecular genetics | journal = Plant Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 921–34 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7640526 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.7.7.921 | pmc = 160888 [/tpl] The latter condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. After ring opening of the ribose moiety and  following reductive decarboxylation, indole-3-glycerinephosphate is produced, which in turn is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine.
The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified  bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry either mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ikeda M | title = Amino acid production processes | journal = Adv. Biochem. Eng.

==Function==

For many organisms (including humans), tryptophan is an essential amino acid. This means that it is essential for human life, cannot be synthesized by the organism, and therefore must be part of our diet. Amino acids, including tryptophan, act as building blocks in protein biosynthesis.  In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds (see also figure to the right):
The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood[tpl]cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Widner B, Murr C, Sperner-Unterweger B, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with decreased plasma tryptophan |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=367–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11336160 |doi=10.1080/003655201300051135[/tpl] and depression.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Sperner-Unterweger B, Widner B, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with early signs of mental depression |journal=Eur. J. Med. Res. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=295–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9620891 |doi=[/tpl] The authors did not find reduced tryptophan in lactose maldigestion. [tpl]cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Widner B, Murr C, Sperner-Unterweger B, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with decreased plasma tryptophan |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=367–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11336160 |doi=10.1080/003655201300051135[/tpl]
In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gollnick P, Babitzke P, Antson A, Yanofsky C | title = Complexity in regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 47–68 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16285852 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.39.073003.093745 | url =  [/tpl] Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.  So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop and, when the cell's tryptophan levels are reduced, transcription from the trp operon resumes. The genetic organisation of the trp operon thus permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels.

==Dietary sources==

Tryptophan is a routine constituent of most protein-based foods or dietary proteins.  It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, spirulina, bananas, and peanuts.Tryptophan background Despite popular belief[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] that turkey has a particularly high amount of tryptophan, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is typical of most poultry.[tpl]cite web|title= USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22 |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture | author = Joanne Holden, Nutrient Data Laboratory, Agricultural Research Service | url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/ndl | accessdate = 2009-11-29[/tpl] There is also a myth that plant protein lacks tryptophan; in fact, tryptophan is present in significant amounts in almost all forms of plant protein, and abundant in some.

===Use as a dietary supplement and drug===

There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet,[tpl]cite journal | author = Soh, Nerissa L.

===Metabolites===

A metabolite of tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), has been suggested as a treatment for epilepsy[tpl]cite journal |author=Kostowski W, Bidzinski A, Hauptmann M, Malinowski JE, Jerlicz M, Dymecki J|title=Brain serotonin and epileptic seizures in mice: a pharmacological and biochemical study|journal= Pol J Pharmacol Pharm |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages= 41–7 |year= 1978 |pmid= 148040[/tpl] and depression, since 5-HTP readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and in addition is rapidly decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT).[tpl]cite journal |author=Hardebo JE, Owman C|title=Barrier mechanisms for neurotransmitter monoamines and their precursors at the blood-brain interface|journal= Annals of Neurology |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–31 |year= 1980 |pmid= 6105837|doi=10.1002/ana.410080102[/tpl]  Clinical trials, however, are regarded inconclusive and lacking.[tpl]cite journal |author=Turner EH, Loftis JM, Blackwell AD|title=Serotonin a la carte: supplementation with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan|journal= Pharmacol Ther |volume= 109 |issue= 3 |pages= 325–38 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16023217 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.06.004[/tpl]  Serotonin has a relatively short half-life since it is rapidly metabolized by monoamine oxidase.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

It is marketed in Europe for depression and other indications under the brand names Cincofarm and Tript-OH. In the United States, 5-HTP does not require a prescription, as it is covered under the Dietary Supplement Act.  Since the quality of dietary supplements is now regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers are required to market products whose ingredients match the labeling, but are not required to establish efficacy of the product.[tpl]cite web | url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/dietarysupplements/ | title = Dietary Supplements: Background Information | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = | pages = | archiveurl = | achivedate = | accessdate = 2011-05-10 [/tpl]

===Tryptophan supplements and EMS===

There was a large tryptophan-related outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in 1989, which caused 1,500 cases of permanent disability and at least thirty-seven deaths.

Most tryptophan was banned from sale in the US in 1991, and other countries followed suit.UK Committee On Toxicity Of Chemicals In Food, Consumer  Products And The Environment COT Statement on Tryptophan and the Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome June 2004, updated December 2005  In February 2001, the FDA loosened the restrictions on marketing (though not on importation).
The specific cause of the EMS outbreak remains unknown, but regulators' best estimate is that it was caused by one or impurities in certain batches produced by Showa Denko.

===Turkey meat and drowsiness===

A common assertion is that heavy consumption of turkey meat results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey.[tpl]cite web |first=Anne Marie |last=Helmenstine |title=Does Eating Turkey Make You Sleepy? |publisher=About.com |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/holidaysseasons/a/tiredturkey.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-13[/tpl]  However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable to that contained in most other meats. Furthermore, post-meal drowsiness may have more to do with what else is consumed along with the turkey and, in particular, carbohydrates.[tpl]cite journal | author = | title = Food & mood.

Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan (an aromatic amino acid) into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in the uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).[tpl]cite journal | author = Pardridge WM, Oldendorf WH | title = Kinetic analysis of blood–brain barrier transport of amino acids | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta | volume = 401 | issue = 1 | pages = 128–36 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1148286 | doi = 10.1016/0005-2736(75)90347-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Maher TJ, Glaeser BS, Wurtman RJ | title = Diurnal variations in plasma concentrations of basic and neutral amino acids and in red cell concentrations of aspartate and glutamate: effects of dietary protein intake | journal = Am.

The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into melatonin by the pineal gland. Hence, this data suggests that "feast-induced drowsiness"— or postprandial somnolence — may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which, via an indirect mechanism, increases the production of sleep-promoting melatonin in the brain.
