==History==

===1993-2004===

Take-Two was founded in 1993 by Ryan Brant, the son of Peter Brant, newsprint heir and co-owner of Interview. In March 1998, Take-Two strengthened itself in a number of areas by acquiring the BMG Interactive unit from Bertelsmann AG for approximately $14.2 million. Take 2 published a game called "Rats!" in 1998, developed by Tarantula Games. Later BMG Interactive was re-formed into Rockstar Games in late 1998.[tpl]cite web |last=Sinclair |first=Brendan |url=http://www.rockstarbase.com/games/history-rockstar-games |title=The History of Rockstar Games |publisher=Rockstarbase |accessdate=March 30, 2013[/tpl]

===Attempted takeover by Electronic Arts===

In mid-February 2008, rival game company Electronic Arts (EA) made a [tpl]US$|25[/tpl] per share all cash transaction offer to the board of Take-Two, subsequently revising it to [tpl]US$|26[/tpl] per share after being rejected and making the offer known to the public.[tpl]cite web |last=Crecente |first=Brian |url=http://kotaku.com/360123/ea-makes-offer-to-buy-take-2 |title=Top: EA Makes Offer to Buy Take 2 |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=February 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2009[/tpl] Rumors of a buyout had been floating around the internet several weeks prior.[tpl]cite web |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |url=http://kotaku.com/336364/analyst-convinced-that-take+two-will-be-swallowed |title=Take-two Interactive: Analyst "Convinced" That Take-Two Will Be Swallowed |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=December 20, 2007 |accessdate=March 24, 2009[/tpl] Stocks went up by 54% on Monday, following the Sunday announcement, closing over the [tpl]US$|26[/tpl] offer price, whilst EA's own stock prices went down by 5%, the largest loss in over a year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/technology/story.html?id=335770 |title=Electronic Arts plays risky game in bid for Take-Two |publisher=Financialpost.com |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080508014914/http://www.financialpost.com/trading_desk/technology/story.html?id=335770 |archivedate=May 8, 2008[/tpl]
According to Game Informer's April 2008 issue, EA CEO John Riccitiello said that EA considered a deal for Take-Two in the previous spring but axed it at the last minute. Take-Two's board of directors declined the cash deal. However, EA was still pursuing the acquisition of Take-Two, stating in a letter, "If you are unwilling to proceed on that basis, however, we may pursue other means, including the public disclosure of this letter, to bring our offer and the compelling value it represents to the attentions of Take-Two's shareholders." Later, Take-Two released a statement explaining why the company has rejected the offer, "In addition to undervaluing key elements of our business, EA's proposal fails to recognize the value we are building through our ongoing turnaround efforts, which will further revitalize Take-Two."
Take-Two offered to discuss the offer after Grand Theft Auto IV[tpl]'[/tpl]s release on April 29, 2008. An acquisition would have ended EA's main competition in sports video games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2A100172-EC7A-4F39-86A8-F2E19ED59BA4.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430150712/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/2A100172-EC7A-4F39-86A8-F2E19ED59BA4.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008 |title=EA Makes Play For Take-Two Interactive |publisher=Gameinformer.com |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2009[/tpl] The bid expired May 15, 2008, however EA extended the offer until June 16, 2008, at the same price of [tpl]US$|25.74[/tpl] per share. Take-Two's position did not change and on September 14, 2008, EA announced that they decided to let the [tpl]US$|2 billion[/tpl] offer to buy Take-Two expire.
