The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston, Texas. The team is a member of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Texans joined the NFL in 2002 as an expansion team after Houston's previous franchise, the Houston Oilers, moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they are now the Tennessee Titans.Houston Texans History The team majority owner is Bob McNair.

==Franchise history==

In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville where they were renamed Tennessee Titans. Given the Cleveland Browns had just suffered a controversial relocation to become the Baltimore Ravens, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the following three years, and probably add another expansion team to even out the franchises at 32. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise along with Toronto and Los Angeles (which had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. In association with Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. The expansion team was originally awarded to Los Angeles on March 16, 1999, but given the city had problems in providing an acceptable ownership team and stadium deal, both of whom had been promised in Houston for two years, in October the NFL instead awarded the 32nd team to Houston, at the cost of $700 million.[tpl]cite web|title=Texans Team History|publisher=HoustonTexans.com|url=http://www.houstontexans.com/team/history.html|accessdate=5 January 2011[/tpl]
The Houston Texans joined the league at the 2002 NFL season, playing at the newly founded Reliant Stadium. While the team struggled in early seasons, luck started to change once native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006. The Texans finished with a .500 season (8 wins and 8 defeats) in both 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009–10 NFL playoffs with a 9–7 result in 2009. In 2010, the team started the season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second part of the season, finishing 6–10. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator of the Texans, and the improved defense led to the AFC South title.Texans have climbed to the top of NFL, The Boston Globe The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in the first round of the 2011-12 NFL playoffs,[tpl]cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCATRE80700P20120108|title=Foster powers Texans to win over Bengals|work=Reuters Canada|publisher=Thomson Reuters|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl] before a 20–13 defeat to the Ravens in the semifinals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.masnsports.com/dan_kolko/2012/01/ravens-slip-past-texans-20-13-advance-to-afc-championship.html|title=Ravens slip past Texans 20–13, advance to AFC Championship|first=Dan|last=Kolko|date=January 15, 2012|accessdate=January 15, 2012|work=MASN Sports|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Sports Network[/tpl] The division title repeated in the 2012 NFL season, and again the Texans fell in the second round after defeating the Bengals, this time with a loss to the New England Patriots.

==Team identity==

===Nickname===

On March 2, 2000, Houston NFL 2002 announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, Toros, and Apollos. The list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. An online survey regarding the name generated more than 65,000 responses in just seven days.
On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally on Texas Avenue. McNair explained that the name evoked "someone who's powerful, independent, courageous and hard-working".[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LOCAL/southwest/09/07/hci.texans/|work=The Houston Chronicle|title=It's official: Houston Texans|author=McClain, John|date=September 7, 2000[/tpl] The name had previously been the name of a defunct World Football League franchise, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer, and the nickname Texans was also used by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, the Dallas Texans of the AFL. The nickname "Texans" was more recently used by the now-defunct Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio. Owner Bob McNair did have to make a deal with Chiefs' owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans nickname for his new team.

===Logos and Uniforms===

Along with the team name, McNair also unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as "Deep Steel Blue", "Battle Red" and "Liberty White". A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.
The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wear all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007 the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look (this uniform combination was not well-received and has since been retired). In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys.
In 2002 the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season.

==Rivalries==

The Texans are the youngest franchise in the NFL, having only been competing in the League since 2002. For most of that time, they were considered perennial bottom-dwellers in the AFC South. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises.
However, there are a few franchises for whom Texans fans hold special animosity. The Tennessee Titans, formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in the 1990s, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival. The Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans have never defeated in Indianapolis (compiling an all-time record of 0–12 there), are also rivals to the Texans.
More recently, Houston has defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild-Card Round of the playoffs in two consecutive seasons, forming a potential future rivalry with that franchise, one with similarities to the former AFC Central rivalry between the Bengals and Oilers.

==Statistics==

===Win-loss record===

As of the end of the 2013 season, the Texans' overall regular season win-loss record is 79–113 (.411).  They are 2–2 (.500) all-time in playoff games. The Texans posted their best-ever season record in 2012 finishing at 12–4.  The team's worst-ever seasons on record are 2–14 in both 2005 and 2013.
The Texans participated in the playoffs for the first time at the end of the 2011 season, after having clinched the South Division title and qualifying as the AFC's third seed.  In the Wildcard Round they hosted a playoff game for the first time, defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 31–10.  The following weekend they were defeated 20–13 by the Baltimore Ravens on the road in the Divisional Round.
In 2012, the Texans won the AFC South Division and were seeded third once again.  They again beat the Cincinnati Bengals at home in the Wildcard Round, this time by a score of 19–13. On the road in the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots the Texans were defeated 41–28.

===Notable records vs opponents===

As members of the AFC South, the Texans play six of their sixteen games each season against other AFC South teams.  The Texans have a cumulative record of 26–46 (.361) against their three divisional rivals.  This includes lifetime records of 13–11 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, 9–15 against the Tennessee Titans, and 4–20 against the Indianapolis Colts (including an 0-12 mark on the road).  The Texans have fared better against the rest of their conference, posting a record of 33–39 (.458) against AFC teams from divisions other than the South.  The Texans are 20–28 (.417) against NFC teams.
As of the end of 2013, there are two teams against which the Texans have never lost: the Chicago Bears (3–0) and Miami Dolphins (7–0). There are also two teams which the Texans have never beaten: the Minnesota Vikings (0–3) and Philadelphia Eagles (0–3). The Eagles are on the Texans' schedule for 2014. The Texans will play against the Dolphins in 2015, and against the Bears and the Vikings, both NFC North teams, in 2016. Since the Dolphins are the only one of these four mentioned teams in the same conference as the Texans (AFC), they will be able to play each other far more often (Click here for more information on the NFL's scheduling formula).
