The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving filter feeding shark and the largest known extant fish species. The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m (41.50 ft) and a weight of more than  21.5 metric tons (47,000 lb), and unconfirmed reports of considerably larger whale sharks exist. Claims of individuals over 14 m (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 mt (66,000 lb) are not uncommon. The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom, most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate, rivalling many of the largest dinosaurs in weight. It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the family, Rhincodontidae (called Rhiniodon and Rhinodontidae before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The species originated about 60 million years ago.
The whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea, with a lifespan of about 70 years. Whale sharks have very large mouths, and as filter feeders, they feed mainly on plankton. The BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish. The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm.Jurassic Shark (2000) documentary by Jacinth O'Donnell; broadcast on Discovery Channel, 5 August 2006
The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6-m-long specimen in Table Bay, South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elasmo-research.org/education/topics/ng_rhincodon_or_rhiniodon.htm|title=Rhincodon or Rhiniodon?

==Distribution and habitat==

The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm-temperate seas. Primarily pelagic, seasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as the southern and eastern parts of South Africa; Saint Helena Island in the South Atlantic Ocean; Gladden Spit in Belize; Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia; Great Rann of Kutch in India; Útila in Honduras; Southern Leyte; Donsol, Pasacao and Batangas in the Philippines; off Isla Mujeres and Isla Holbox in Yucatan, Mexico; Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia; Nabire National Park in Indonesia; Nosy Be in Madagascar Off Tofo Reef near Inhambane in Mozambique, and the Tanzanian islands of Mafia, Pemba, Zanzibar and, very rarely, Eilat, Israel and Aqaba, Jordan. Although typically seen offshore, it has been found closer to land, entering lagoons or coral atolls, and near the mouths of estuaries and rivers. Its range is generally restricted to about 30° latitude. It is capable of diving to depths of at least [tpl]convert|1,286|m|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]cite journal|last=Brunnschweiler|first=Juerg M.|coauthors=Baensch, H., Pierce, S.J., Sims, D.W.|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=February 2009|volume=74|issue=3|pages=706–714|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02155.x[/tpl] and is migratory.[tpl]cite web|author=Ed.

==Description==

Whale sharks have a mouth that can be [tpl]Convert|1.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. Its mouth contains between 300 to 350 rows of tiny teeth and 10 filter pads which it uses to filter feed.[tpl]cite web|author=Compagno, L.J.V.|title=Species Fact Sheet, Rhincodon typus|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=19 September 2006|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2801/en[/tpl] Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills. Its head is wide and flat with two small eyes at the front. Whale sharks are grey with a white belly. Their skin is marked with pale yellow spots and stripes which are unique to each individual. The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides.  Its skin can be up to [tpl]Convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] thick. The shark has a pair of dorsal fins and pectoral fins. Juveniles' tails have a larger upper fin than lower fin, while the adult tail becomes semilunate. The whale shark's spiracles are just behind its eyes.
The whale shark is the largest noncetacean animal in the world. The average size of adult whale sharks is estimated at [tpl]Convert|9.7|m|ft|2|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|9|t|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | page = 256 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9[/tpl] The largest verified specimen was caught on 11 November 1947, near Baba Island, in Karachi, Pakistan. It was [tpl]Convert|12.65|m|ft|2|abbr=on[/tpl] long, weighed more than [tpl]Convert|21.5|t|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], and had a girth of [tpl]Convert|7|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Stories exist of vastly larger specimens – quoted lengths of [tpl]Convert|18|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|45.5|t|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] are not uncommon in the popular literature, but no scientific records support their existence. In 1868, the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles, but claimed to have observed specimens in excess of [tpl]Convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl], and tells of shark specimens surpassing [tpl]Convert|21|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl].
In a 1925 publication, Hugh M. Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919. The shark was too heavy to pull ashore, but Smith estimated the shark was at least 17 m long, and weighed around 37 t. These measurements have been exaggerated to 43 t and a more precise 17.98 m in recent years. A shark caught in 1994 off Tainan County, southern Taiwan, reportedly weighed [tpl]Convert|35.8|t|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Mollet, H.F. 2008.

In 1934, a ship named the Maurguani came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean, rammed it, and the shark became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with 4.6 m on one side and 12.2 m on the other.[tpl]cite book|author=Maniguet, Xavier |title=The Jaws of Death: Shark as Predator, Man as Prey|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FgFFAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Limited|isbn=978-0-00-219960-5[/tpl] No reliable documentation exists for these claims and they remain "fish stories".

==Diet==

The whale shark is a filter feeder – one of only three known filter feeding shark species (along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark). It feeds on macroalgae, plankton, krill, Christmas Island red crab larvae [tpl]cite news|author=Morelle, Rebecca |title=Shark-cam captures ocean motion|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 July 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7727136.stm | date=17 November 2008[/tpl] and small nektonic life, such as small squid or vertebrates. It also feeds on small fish and the clouds of eggs and sperm during mass spawning of fish. The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills.  In both cases, the filter pads serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by cross-flow filtration, in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat.[tpl]cite journal|last=Motta|first=Philip J.|coauthors=et al.|title=Feeding anatomy, ﬁlter-feeding rate, and diet of whale sharks Rhincodon typus during surface ram ﬁlter feeding off the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico|journal=Zoology|year=2010|volume=113|pages=199–212|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2009.12.001|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-srv%2Fnation%2Fpdfs%2FSharkfeedingpaper.pdf[/tpl] This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimises fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed "coughing", presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin, R. Aidan.|title=Elasmo Research|publisher=ReefQuest|accessdate=17 September 2006|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/d_filter_feeding.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Whaleshark/whaleshark.html|title= Whale shark|publisher = Icthyology at the Florida Museum of Natural History|accessdate=17 September 2006[/tpl]
The whale shark is an active feeder, targeting concentrations of plankton or fish. It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position. This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark, which does not pump water. Instead, it swims to force water across its gills.

==Behavior toward divers==

Despite its size, the whale shark does not pose significant danger to humans. They are docile fish and sometimes allow swimmers to catch a ride,[ref]

The shark is seen by divers in many places, including the Bay Islands in Honduras, Thailand, the Philippines, the Maldives, the Red Sea, Western Australia (Ningaloo Reef, Christmas Island), Taiwan, Panama (Coiba Island), Belize, Tofo Beach in Mozambique, Sodwana Bay (Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park) in South Africa, the Galapagos Islands, Isla Mujeres and Bahía de los Ángeles in Mexico, the Seychelles, West Malaysia, islands off eastern peninsular Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Oman, Pakistan, Fujairah, and Puerto Rico.

==In captivity==

Two whale sharks were featured as the main attraction of Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan and as of 2005, three whale sharks were in captivity at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Japan. The Ioworld Aquarium in Kagoshima, Japan, also features a single adult whale shark as a major attraction. One was also on display in the Taiwan, Kenting National Museum of Biology and Aquarium and 5 are on display at the Yantai Aquarium in China. Four whale sharks, two males,Taroko and Yushan,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/06/01/aquarium.whale.sharks.ap/index.html|title= Aquarium gains two new whale sharks|date=1 June 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=1 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070603085148/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/06/01/aquarium.whale.sharks.ap/index.html |archivedate = 3 June 2007[/tpl] and two females, Alice and Trixie, live in the Georgia Aquarium, in Atlanta, USA. Two male whale sharks, Ralph and Norton, died in captivity at the Georgia Aquarium on 11 January 2007, and 13 June 2007, respectively. The two females were added on 3 June 2006 and two more males in 2007. All six whale sharks were imported from Taiwan, where whale sharks are called tofu sharks because of the taste and texture of the flesh; the fishery from which they came has since closed. Two whale sharks live at Polar Ocean World in Qingdao, China. One whale shark was at the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai, but was released in March 2010.[tpl]cite news|title=Dubai hotel releases whale shark back into wild|url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9EH2LF80&show_article=1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100322192024/http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9EH2LF80&show_article=1|archivedate=2010-03-22|publisher=Associated Press (AP)|date=18 March 2009[/tpl]

==Reproduction==

Neither mating nor pupping of whale sharks has been observed.
The capture of a female in July 1996 that was pregnant with 300 pups indicated whale sharks are ovoviviparous.[tpl]cite journal |author=Joung, Shoou-Jeng et al.|title=The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is a livebearer: 300 embryos found in one ‘megamamma’ supreme |journal=Environ.

On 7 March 2009, marine scientists in the Philippines discovered what is believed to be the smallest living specimen of the whale shark. The young shark, measuring only [tpl]convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], was found with its tail tied to a stake at a beach in Pilar, Philippines, and was released into the wild. Based on this discovery, some scientists no longer believe this area is just a feeding ground; this site may be a birthing ground, as well.  Both young whale sharks and pregnant females have been seen in the waters of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, where numerous whale sharks can be spotted during the summer.[tpl]cite web|last=Tan|first=Jose Ma.

==Conservation status==

The whale shark is targeted by commercial fisheries in several areas where they seasonally aggregate. The population is unknown and the species is considered vulnerable by the IUCN.[tpl]IUCN2011.1|assessors=Norman, B.|year=2005|id=19488|title=Rhincodon typus|downloaded=18 August 2011[/tpl] It is listed, along with six other species of sharks, under the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf |title=Memorandum of understanding on the conservation of migratory sharks |publisher=Convention on migratory species |page=10 |accessdate=13 February 2012[/tpl] In 1998, the Philippines banned all fishing, selling, importing, and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes,Whale Sharks Receive Protection in the Philippines.

Sightings confirmed that the whale sharks were unable to avoid the oil slick, which was situated on the surface of the sea where the whale sharks feed for several hours at a time. No dead whale sharks were found.Handwerk, Brian (24 September 2010) Whale Sharks Killed, Displaced by Gulf Oil? National Geographic News.
