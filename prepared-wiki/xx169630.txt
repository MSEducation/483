==Early career==

Schmittou was a teacher in the Nashville public school system from 1961 to 1968. During that time he coached high school basketball and football. He also worked for several years as a territorial scout for the Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball team.
In 1968, he became the head baseball coach and head football recruiter at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Through 1978, he led his teams to over 300 wins, including four consecutive Eastern Division Championships and the overall SEC baseball championships in 1973 and 1974; both years he was named SEC Coach of the Year.

==Minor League Baseball==

In 1978, Schmittou put together a group of investors including country stars Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, Conway Twitty, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge Boys) in order to purchase a minor league baseball team. He called the team the Nashville Sounds, and built a new ballpark, Herschel Greer Stadium, which held 10,700 fans. The Sounds were a part of the Double-A Southern League and were affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds. 
During the first year of play, the Sounds drew in over 380,000 fans, leading the league in attendance. The Sounds would be a major draw for years to come. Their success has been attributed to Schmittou's business philosophy of selling tickets at low prices and making profits from souvenirs, concessions, etc."25 for 25: Stars in the Baseball America Universe."
