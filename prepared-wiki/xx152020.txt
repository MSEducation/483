==Career==

Kara began her broadcast career with a job at Radio Disney out of Dallas, Texas the fall after she graduated from high school.  She interned for eight months before landing the more permanent jobs of writer, producer, voice actress and children's voice director. In July 1997, she became co-host of the "Squeege and Kara Show" on syndicated Radio Disney with friend and fellow voice actor Kyle Hebert.The Geek Fighters Interview.

During the latter part of her Radio Disney tenure, Edwards started working for Funimation Studios as a freelance voice actress. Her first role was as Lime in the Dragon Ball Z episode "A Girl Named Lime". In March 2002, Kara was hired as a producer and occasional "sidekick" for the Sander Walker in the Morning radio show on WSSS 104.7 FM in Charlotte, North Carolina. She stayed in this position until October 31, 2003. After that morning's airing finished, the entire Sander Walker show cast and crew were informed that WSSS was switching its format to Christmas music around the clock, and subsequently were all terminated. Kara was not off the airwaves for long, however. In February 2004, she became the co-host of the Jeff Roper Morning Show syndicated from WSOC 103.7 FM, also out of Charlotte. In January 2005, Jeff Roper left WSOC to take a morning job at WWNU 92 FM in Columbia, South Carolina.  WSOC management assigned Kara to take up co-hosting duties with Rob Tanner as part of the new Tanner in the Morning show. The show's mix of regional humor and parodies made it one of the higher-rated morning shows in the Charlotte area's country music radio market, and Kara continued her co-hosting duties for nearly two years. She also met and began dating Charlotte CBS affiliate WBTV meteorologist Chris Suchan.  They were married in April, 2006. They were later divorced. Suchan now works at KCTV in Kansas City. Although Kara enjoyed her radio work, she had begun to feel more and more strongly about voice acting.  In August 2006, Kara and fellow Funimation actors Sean Schemmel, Chris Sabat, and Jason Liebrecht attended the Wizard World Comics Convention in Chicago, Illinois. When Dragon Ball fans waited in line up to five hours to get her autograph, Kara began seriously considering making voice acting her full-time job.
A few weeks later, Kara brought her feelings to WSOC management during a monthly performance strategy meeting and told them of her desire to go into voice-acting full-time and leave her position as co-host. WSOC and the Tanner show staff accepted Kara's decision, and her departure was handled amicably.
As of today, she is living in Dallas doing commercial and documentary voiceover, but occasionally returns to Funimation to reprise her Dragon Ball roles in recent projects. She is also heard performing roles in other anime.Kara Edwards Voice Over Talent, young, real, animation. Karaedwardsvo.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-03.
