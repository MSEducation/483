INXS (pronounced "in excess", [tpl]respell|in-ex|ESS|'[/tpl]) were an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales.[tpl]Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop |url= |last=McFarlane |first=Ian |authorlink= Ian McFarlane |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=1999 |chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'INXS' |chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040930213309/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=950 |isbn=1-86448-768-2 |accessdate=16 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | archiveurl = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/14231/20120727-0512/www.howlspace.com.au/en2/inxs/inxs.htm | url = http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/inxs/inxs.htm | title = INXS | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | authorlink1 = Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Howlspace – The Living History of Our Music.

Initially known for their new wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.
In the early 1980s, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success elsewhere with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, "The One Thing". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single "Original Sin" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single. They would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings through later in the 1980s and the 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X; and the singles "What You Need", "Need You Tonight", "Devil Inside", "New Sensation", and "Suicide Blonde".[tpl]Cite book |title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992  |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, Sydney |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 [/tpl] NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.[tpl]cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=INXS discography |publisher=Australian Charts Portal |accessdate=16 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=inxs|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History – INXS – Albums|work=Billboard |accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl]
In the 1990s, INXS brought a new audience following Hutchence's romance with pop singer, Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the UK. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are, in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States. Michael Hutchence was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS, a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune, and the release of "Pretty Vegas" and "Afterglow" as singles, and its album Switch.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards|pure_url=yvrcres[/tpl] |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard albums|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl]
In late 2010, they recorded and released Original Sin, a tribute album, featuring guest artists such as Kavyen Temperley (of Eskimo Joe) and Ben Harper. In September 2011 the band announced that Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin had replaced Fortune as their lead vocalist ahead of a planned tour of South America, Australia & Europe later in the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/inxs/59440|title=INXS unveil Snow Patrol collaborator Ciaran Gribbin as their new singer |date= 26 September 2011|work=NME|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years===

The origins of the band began with Andrew Farriss convincing his fellow Davidson High School classmate, Michael Hutchence, to join his band, Doctor Dolphin.[tpl]Cite book |title=Burn : The life and times of Michael Hutchence and INXS |last=St John |first=Ed |publisher=Bantam Books, Sydney |year=1998 |isbn=0-7338-0182-X [/tpl] The band contained two other classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders and a bass player, Garry Beers and Geoff Kennely, from a nearby high school, Forest High School. In 1977, Tim Farriss, Andrew's older brother, invited Andrew, Hutchence and Beers to join him and his schoolmate Kirk Pengilly. Tim and Pengilly had been playing together since 1971 as either an acoustic duo, Kirk and Tim, or as a four-piece band called Guinness (named after their bass player's dog[tpl]Cite book |title=INXS Story to Story: The official autobiography |last=Bozza |first=Anthony |publisher=Bantam Books, Sydney |year=2005 |isbn=0-593-05517-9 [/tpl]). Together with younger brother Jon Farriss they formed the Farriss Brothers, who consisted of Garry Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Geoff Kennelly on drums, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelhutchenceinfo.com/biography.htm |title=Biography – Michael Kelland John Hutchence|publisher=michaelhutchenceinfo.com |accessdate=5 March 2008[/tpl] The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at Whale Beach,[tpl]Cite book |url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an41896781 |title=Molly Meldrum presents 50 years of rock in Australia |last=Jenkins |first=Jeff |coauthors=Ian Meldrum |year=2007 |publisher=Wilkinson Publishing |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-1-921332-11-1 |accessdate=17 November 2008 [/tpl] 40 km (25 mi) north of Sydney. Andrew Farriss remembers:
The parents of the Farriss boys relocated to Perth, Western Australia in 1978, taking Jon to continue his schooling and, as soon as Hutchence and Andrew finished school, the rest of the band followed. They briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing "We Are the Vegetables", before returning to Sydney ten months later, where they recorded a set of demos. At a chance meeting in the car park of the Narrabeen Antler, a pub in Narrabeen on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, New South Wales. Tim was approached by Gary Morris, the manager of Midnight Oil.
The band began to regularly support Midnight Oil and other local bands. Morris advised that a member of the Oils crew had come up with a new name and suggested they change it to INXS. The name INXS was inspired by English band XTC and Australian jam makers IXL.[tpl]quote|"I saw a commercial for a brand of jam called IXL. Their ad featured a guy who said, 'I excel in all I do.' I'd recently seen the English band XTC when they toured Australia, and I loved their name: XTC – Ecstasy. In that moment, I put all those thoughts together. The name needed to be letters, but make a word. I put the IXL jam commercial together with XTC and the concept of a band that was inaccessible and I had it: INXS|Gary Morris[/tpl] Pengilly explained that Morris had some other ideas:
[tpl]quote|Gary Morris was a great marketer, and I think he also had this idea of us being 'inaccessible'. He said we could be on stage in a cage of lights. It was a mystery thing ... He told us that unless we wanted to change our ways and become the world's biggest Christian band, he could no longer manage us ... He wanted us to write songs about Christ and to promote a drug-and-alcohol-free and no-sex-before-marriage, proper Christian lifestyle. He was very convincing and for a moment I think we might have done it. Then he got on to strange terrain.|Kirk Pengilly[/tpl][tpl]quote|We thought that would be a bit much – but it was a good name.|Tim Farriss[/tpl]
The band's first performance as INXS was on 1 September 1979 at the Ocean Beach Hotel in Umina[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/artists/1458/inxs/bio |title=INXS bio |publisher=Take 40 |accessdate=17 November 2008 [/tpl] on the Central Coast of New South Wales and by the end of 1979, after passing on the Christian band image, they hired Chris "CM" Murphy as their manager and continued taking on the Oz pub circuit.[tpl]Cite book |last=St John |first= Ed |coauthors=INXS |title=INXS: The Official Inside Story of a Band on the Road |year=1992 |publisher=Mandarin |page=20 |isbn=1-86330-207-7[/tpl]
Murphy was an adept business manager and negotiator. By early 1980 the band had signed a five-album record deal with a Sydney independent label, Deluxe Records, run by Michael Browning, a former manager of AC/DC.

===1980s===

====From "Simple Simon" to Shabooh Shoobah====

INXS released their first single, "Simple Simon"/"We Are the Vegetables", in Australia and France in May 1980.[tpl]Cite book |last=St John |first= Ed |coauthors=INXS |title=INXS: The Official Inside Story of a Band on the Road |year=1992 |publisher=Mandarin |page=74 |isbn=1-86330-207-7 [/tpl] The single had its debut TV performance on Simon Townsend's Wonder World. Their self-titled debut album, INXS, was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in Annandale, Sydney, it was co-produced by the band and Duncan McGuire (ex-Ayers Rock), with all songs attributed to the entire band, at the insistence of Murphy. Deluxe gave them a budget of $10,000 to record the album, so to keep within the budget they had to record from midnight to dawn, usually after doing one or more performances earlier that night. The album was released in October 1980. It featured "Just Keep Walking" which was their first Australian Top 40 single, with the album peaking in the Top 30 of the Kent Music Report for Australian albums. The album eventually went gold (selling over 35,000 units) but it took a number of years to do so.
These early records demonstrated their new wave/ska/pop style, and were followed by near constant touring with almost 300 shows during 1981 as the band developed their status as a live act.
In 1981, they signed Gary Grant as their tour manager, who then became co-manager a year later. Between touring commitments, the band released their third single in May 1981, "The Loved One", which was a cover of a 1966 song by Australian group The Loved Ones. The song was recorded at Studios 301 in Sydney, produced by Richard Clapton, and peaked in the Top 20.
The success of the single led to Clapton and the band returning to Studio s 301 between July and August 1981 to create an album. In October 1981, their second album Underneath the Colours was released and became a hit in Australia peaking at No. 15.
Soon after recording sessions had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Beers, Jon and Andrew Farriss played on Clapton's solo album, The Great Escape. Hutchence recorded "Speed Kills", written by Don Walker of Cold Chisel for the soundtrack of the film Freedom directed by Scott Hicks. It was his first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982. In January, INXS toured New Zealand as support act for Cold Chisel. Band manager, Murphy, became convinced their future no longer lay with Deluxe Records. RCA (who distributed Deluxe) had employed, music lover Rockin Rod Woods, who had been promoting Eric Clapton, Split Enz and some of the worlds biggest acts.
Woods was passionate about the band and brought key music people along to their gigs. He encouraged RCA to sign them worldwide because Murphy had played him some demos of future songs. Deluxe had been unable to attract international interest, and decided to record a new song, "The One Thing" at their own expense, with Mark Opitz at Paradise Studios. The song turned out so well that Murphy hired Opitz to produce three more songs. Murphy approached WEA Australia with copies of the song, leading to INXS signing a recording deal in July 1982 with WEA for releases in Australia, South East Asia, Japan and New Zealand, Atco Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) for North America and Polygram for Europe and the UK.
Murphy and the band weren't entirely convinced that Opitz could produce an entire album that would attract international interest, so prior to recording their third album Pengilly, Hutchence and Andrew Farriss visited the UK and USA, with a view to selecting a suitable producer, only to find that no one they wanted was available and that most people advised them that Opitz's work on their single was as good as they could wish for.
In mid-1982, they commenced recording at Rhinoceros Studios, with Opitz.
In October 1982, Shabooh Shoobah was released internationally on Atlantic/Atco Records, peaking at No. 52 on the US Billboard 200 and No. 46 on the Hot Pop Albums chart. In Australia it peaked at No. 5 and remained in the albums charts for 94 weeks. The single "The One Thing" brought them their first Top 30 hit in United States peaking at No. 30 on 28 May 1983,[tpl]Cite book |last=Whitburn |first= Joel |title=Billboard Hot 100 Charts: The Eighties |year=1991 |publisher=Record Research Inc. |isbn=0-89820-079-2[/tpl] it was a Top 20 hit in Canada, and peaked at No. 14 in Australia on 23 August 1982. "One Thing" was their first video to air on the fledgling MTV and significantly added to the ultimate success of the single.
INXS undertook their first US performance in San Diego in March 1983, to a crowd of 24 patrons. Their first tour was as support for Adam and the Ants, then support for Stray Cats, The Kinks, Hall & Oates followed by The Go-Go's. INXS played alongside many of their contemporaries on New Wave Day in May 1983, at the US Festival in Devore, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/recordings/1983/83-05-28_SanBerdino/83-05-28_SanBerdino.html |title=The Clash US Festival May 28th 1983|publisher=blackmarketcash.com|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl] It was during this time that Grant, their co-manager, relocated permanently to New York to ensure a continual presence in the northern hemisphere. The band remained on the road in the US for most of the year, including support for Men at Work and by mid-1983 were headlining venues such as The Ritz in New York.

====From "Original Sin" to Listen Like Thieves====

Following a performance in Toronto, Canada, the band was approached by producer Nile Rodgers, and by September 1983, recorded "Original Sin", originally titled "Brand New Day", at New York's Power Station Studios.
Three tracks from Shabooh Shoobah were featured in the soundtrack for the 1984 film Reckless.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/review/product/6301977602 |title=Highly Overlooked 80s movie|date=26 September 2006|author=Kathy Curtis|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 March 2008[/tpl] The band then travelled to the UK to begin sessions on their fourth album with Nick Launay at the Manor Studios in Oxford.
The album The Swing released in April 1984, received more significant attention from around the world, as "Original Sin" became their first No. 1 single and was a highly popular song worldwide with fans and reviewers.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t374177|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Original Sin > Song Review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Ned Raggett|accessdate=7 March 2008[/tpl] During 1984 it was No. 1 in Australia (for two weeks in January) as well as in Argentina and France, No. 6 in New Zealand, No. 11 in Canada, No. 23 in Switzerland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=INXS&titel=Original+Sin&cat=s |title=INXS – Original Sin|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=7 March 2008[/tpl] No. 31 in the Netherlands and No. 58 in the U.S. Yet "Original Sin" was largely ignored in the UK, where INXS was described in New Musical Express as a "depressingly definitive example of excruciating, boring, incredibly unimaginative MTV rock",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/htok.htm |title=Memorable Music Oz Rock – Marcia Hines to Karen Knowles |publisher=Memorable TV |accessdate=20 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id203.htm |title=Albums of 1985 |publisher=The Eighties Club |accessdate=20 November 2008 [/tpl] and INXS didn't have any Top 50 chart success until the 1985 album Listen Like Thieves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/artisinfo.php?id=4510 |title=INXS Singles and Albums Charts |publisher=Chart Stats |accessdate=20 November 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
During 1984, INXS toured non-stop performing across Europe, the UK, the US and Australia and by December 1984, The Swing, was double platinum, making it, at the time, one of the five biggest domestic albums in the history of Australian music. In March 1985 the band re-entered Sydney's Rhinoceros Studios to record their next album, together with producer Chris Thomas (Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd, The Pretenders, Elton John).
As the band were finishing the recording sessions, Thomas told the band that the album was not good enough and still had no "killer" track:
Andrew produced a demo tape of a funk song he had been working on "Funk Song No. 13" and evolved it into "What You Need".[tpl]quote|Then Andrew brought in three demos – two songs that had been completed and he played me a thing that was just this riff – dink, dink, dink-a-dink-and it was great. I thought, 'I could listen to that groove for ten minutes!' I said, 'Let's work with that groove.' So we went with that and in just two days it turned into the song that eventually broke them, "What You Need".|Chris Thomas[/tpl]
Whilst the band was recording, WEA released Dekadance, a limited edition 12" Vinyl and cassette only EP of INXS remixes from their albums The Swing and Shabooh Shoobah.
On 19 May 1985, INXS won seven awards at the 1984 Countdown Music and Video Awards ceremony. They performed "Burn for You", dressed in Akubras (hats) and Drizabones (outdoor coats/oilskin jackets). They performed five songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert, in conjunction with the Live Aid benefit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/ozforafrika-uk.html |title=Oz for Africa |publisher=liveaid.free.fr |accessdate=12 March 2008 [/tpl] Two INXS songs, "What You Need" and "Don't Change", were also in the BBC broadcast and are contained on Live Aid's four DVD boxed set released in 2004.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sanity.com.au/product/product.asp?sku=1181339 |title=Live Aid 4 DVD |accessdate=12 March 2008 |publisher=Sanity[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
INXS had started out as a new wave act, gradually moved in a more straight-ahead rock-oriented direction through the first half of the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id242.htm |title=A Decade in the Life of INXS|publisher=Eighties Club|accessdate=7 March 2008[/tpl] Listen Like Thieves was released in October 1985, was approved of by critics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/inxs/albums/album/148097/review/5944088/listen_like_thieves |title=INXS: Listen Like Thieves|work=Rolling Stone |author=Parke Puterbaugh|date=5 December 1985|accessdate=7 March 2008[/tpl] reaching No. 3 on the Australian charts and No. 11 on the US charts. With the release of Listen Like Thieves, the band had developed a rock sound influenced by Led Zeppelin and XTC, but remained true to the band's original roots in Aussie pubs. It was also the first album to feature songs written by a combination of band members, with Andrew Farris and Hutchence becoming the primary songwriters in the years to follow. The first US single from the album, "This Time", stalled at No. 81 in late 1985, but the next single, "What You Need", released there in early 1986, became a top five Billboard hit, bringing INXS their first break-out US success. The single was also a top 20 hit in Canada, reached No. 2 in Australia (September 1985) but only No. 51 on the UK charts.
The British press dismissed the album, with New Musical Express calling the band 'INX-cusable' and a reviewer declaring Listen Like Thieves to be a 'complete and utter turkey'. In the United States however Rolling Stone Magazine wrote "INXS rocks with passion and seals the deal with a backbeat that'll blackmail your feet."
In August 1985, they toured ahead of the album's release, touring South America before returning to Melbourne to play for Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Wales at a concert in Australia, it was filmed and later released on home video entitled Living INXS,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0288058/ |title=Living INXS|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=27 November 2008[/tpl] an edited version of the concert was played on MTV in the US in 1985 on their Saturday night concert series. In November, December, January, and February INXS toured North America, Europe, and New Zealand. The band then took a two-month break, with Andrew Farriss writing and producing "You're Gonna Get Hurt" for Jenny Morris (who had previously been a backing vocalist with the band),[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120220031633/http://hem2.passagen.se/honga/database/m/morrisjenny.html |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/m/morrisjenny.html |title=Jenny Morris Discography|publisher=Australian Rock Database.

In May 1986, the band returned to the United States and over the next six months performed 32 European shows, including support for Queen at their Live at Wembley '86 concert on 12 July 42 US shows and 12 Australian shows. America's influential Musician magazine calling them "the best live band in the world."

====From "Good Times" to Kick====

Whilst supposedly taking an eight-month break before beginning work on a new album, their manager Murphy decided to stage a series of major outdoor concerts across Australia, featuring INXS, Jimmy Barnes, Models, The Divinyls, Mental as Anything, The Triffids and I'm Talking. To promote the tour INXS recorded two songs with Jimmy Barnes of Cold Chisel: The Easybeats cover "Good Times" and "Laying Down the Law" which Barnes co-wrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=420342641&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=10&start=1 |title=ACE Title Search – 'Laying Down the Law' |publisher=ASCAP |accessdate=20 November 2008 [/tpl] "Good Times" was used as the theme song for the Australian Made series of concerts in the summer of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film The Lost Boys and its soundtrack,[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r115920|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=The Lost Boys > Overview |last=LaVeck |first=Theresea E. |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=20 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/soundtrack |title=Lost Boys Soundtrack|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=27 November 2008[/tpl] allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the US on 1 August 1987.
After the success of "What You Need" and Listen Like Thieves, the band knew their new material would have to be even better, according to Pengilly, [tpl]quote|We wanted an album where all the songs were possible singles.|Kirk Pengilly[/tpl] They recorded Kick in Sydney and Paris, it was produced by Thomas again, but Atlantic Records was not happy with the result, as manager Chris Murphy remembers:
Despite Atlantic's protests, Kick was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity, it peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=Discographie INXS |publisher=Austrian Charts Portal |accessdate=20 November 2008 |language=German[/tpl] It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles, "New Sensation", "Never Tear Us Apart", "Devil Inside" and No. 1 "Need You Tonight". "Need You Tonight" peaked No. 2 on the UK charts, No. 3 in Australia, and No. 10 in France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lescharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=Discographie INXS |publisher=French Charts Portal |accessdate=20 November 2008 |language=French[/tpl] They toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track "Mediate" (which played after the video for "Need You Tonight") replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for "Subterranean Homesick Blues", even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988 the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for "Need You Tonight/Mediate" winning in 5 categories.
During 1989, Hutchence collaborated with Ian 'Ollie' Olsen on a side project, Max Q, the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein's film Dogs in Space. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but soon returned to the studio to record their follow-up album to Kick.

Welcome to Wherever You Are, produced by Mark Opitz and released in August 1992, was an experimental album using sitars and a 60-piece orchestra while adding a much more "raw" sound to their music.

===1997 to 2003: transitional years===

After Hutchence's death, INXS did not perform publicly for almost a year and then only made a few one-off performances with different guest singers until 2000. On 28 November 1998, they played at the Mushroom 25 Concert with Jimmy Barnes fronting for two songs: "The Loved One" and "Good Times". On 12 June 1999, they headlined the opening of Stadium Australia in Sydney, with US singer-songwriter Terence Trent D'Arby and Russell Hitchcock as guest vocalist, they performed "New Sensation", "Kick", "Never Tear Us Apart" and "What You Need".
Former lead singer of Australian band Noiseworks, Jon Stevens began singing with INXS in May 2000. They played as one of the headline acts at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and then toured through South America and Europe. Stevens was officially named a member of INXS in 2002 and they started recording new material in November. Stevens left in October 2003 to pursue a solo career, only recording a contractual obligation song called "I Get Up." This was not officially released as a charting single due to it being part of the game EA Sports Rugby 2004. All sales of this single were not tallied in comparison to the ARIA charts of the time. The song was used in the Rugby Union World Cup 2003 and the EA Sports Rugby 2004 video game.

===2004 to 2005: Rock Star: INXS===

INXS returned to the news in 2004, when it was announced that a new reality television program titled Rock Star: INXS would feature a contest to find a new lead vocalist for the band. The show, which had its debut on the CBS network 11 July 2005, (on Global in Canada, VH1 in the UK and FOX8 in Australia), featured 15 contestants vying for the position of lead singer. The show was executive produced by Survivor's Mark Burnett and hosted by Brooke Burke and Jane's Addiction and former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro.
On 20 September 2005, J. D. Fortune (born Jason Dean Bennison, but uses his mother's maiden name) of Salt Springs, Nova Scotia, Canada won the eleven-week competition, which culminated in his singing the Rolling Stones's "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and INXS' "What You Need" in the finale of the show to become the new lead singer of INXS. With Fortune they recorded their 2005 album, Switch produced by Guy Chambers and went on a world tour in 2006. Runner-up Marty Casey was the opening act during the first leg of the tour, along with his band, The Lovehammers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockbandlounge.com/rock-star-inxs/jd-fortune.asp |title= J.D. Fortune:: Rock Star INXS|publisher=Rock Band Lounge|accessdate=5 March 2008[/tpl]
During the Rock Star: INXS competition, the contestants were challenged to write the lyrics and melody to music written by Andrew Farriss. Originally this challenge was divided up into two teams. When Fortune did not see eye-to-eye with his team (that included Casey), he decided to venture out on his own and write his own lyrics. At first Fortune's move seemed to have doomed his chances to win the competition (because it was perceived he couldn't work in a team), but it was this move that resulted in his creation of the lyrics to "Pretty Vegas". This song became a favourite of both fans and INXS and played a major role in Fortune being able to win the competition.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] "Pretty Vegas" was released 4 October 2005 and reached No. 5 on the iTunes Store ranking of daily most downloaded songs on its first day. It peaked at No. 9 in Australia, No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became a huge radio airplay hit (going platinum and reaching number one) in Fortune's native Canada.
