[[GiveWell]]

CATEGORIES: Charity review websites, Non-profit organizations based in the United States

GiveWell is an American non-profit charity evaluator created in 2007 by two former Bridgewater Associates investment analysts, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld.Patricia Illingworth, Thomas Pogge, Leif Wenar. Giving Well: The Ethics of Philanthropy, Oxford University Press US, 2011. Pg. 124Peter Singer. The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty, Random House, 2009. Ch. 6, Pg. 81-104

==Philosophy==

===Focus on identifying outstanding charities===

GiveWell staff have expressed the view that it is preferable to donate to one outstanding charity (or a few outstanding charities) that can do real good with one's money rather than donate to a mediocre charity or split one's charitable donations between multiple charities.Funding the right program, Giving 101 section of GiveWell website To this end, GiveWell focuses its resources on identifying outstanding charities that are proven, cost-effective, scalable, and transparent.
Generally, GiveWell focuses on preparing detailed reviews only for those charities that, based on their preliminary investigations, hold clear promise of being outstanding. For instance, in their 2011 international aid process review they write: "Our focus is on finding outstanding charities rather than completing an in-depth investigation for each organization we consider. For that reason, we rely on heuristics, or meaningful shortcuts, to distinguish between organizations and identify ones that we think will ultimately qualify for our recommendations."
Unlike other charity evaluators such as Charity Navigator, GuideStar, Philanthropedia and Great Nonprofits, GiveWell is not focused on rating large numbers of charities. This makes GiveWell of limited use for people who are already strongly in favor of donating to a specific charity and want to get ratings and reviews for it. In this respect, GiveWell is quite similar to Giving What We Can, though the latter focuses on a much smaller set of recommended charities and does not publish so many detailed reviews.

===Burden of proof on charities===

GiveWell staff believe that the burden of proof for establishing success should fall on the charity. For this reason, when charities do not clearly disclose information or provide evidence that their programs are having the desired positive impact, GiveWell staff assume, for the purpose of their reviews, that the charity is not having the desired positive impact. As noted in the previous section, charities that don't have any data or evidence indicating positive impact rarely even get a full review from GiveWell.
In one of the sections of their Giving 101 basicsAccomplishing Nothing, Giving 101 section of GiveWell website they write: "Conventionally, most people expect that charities are probably accomplishing good unless there's proof that money is being misappropriated. We disagree: we think that charities can easily fail to have impact, even when they're doing exactly what they say they are."

===Greater focus on developing world charities===

Addressing a United States audience, GiveWell staff write in their Giving 101 sectionYour dollar goes further overseas, Giving 101 section of GiveWell website that the best charities working in the developing world provide much greater value for donor money than the best charities operating in the United States (and other developed world countries). For this reason, GiveWell focuses its resources on investigating the top charities in the developing world, and most of its top-rated charities have been operating there. However, GiveWell does investigate promising US charities. In the past, GiveWell has recommended some US charities for US-specific categories. US charities that have been recommended by GiveWell include KIPP (Houston branch) and Nurse-Family Partnership.

===Focus on room for more funding===

One of the key ways that GiveWell seeks to distinguish itself from other charity evaluators is through its focus on scalability, which it calls "room for more funding" â€” how many more funds can the charity absorb, what activities will it use those funds for, and can the success of present activities be extrapolated to future activities? GiveWell has published a guide on room for more funding[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability|title = Guide to "room for more funding" analysis|publisher = GiveWell|accessdate = 2012-12-09[/tpl] and has a number of blog posts on the topic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/category/room-for-more-funding/|title = Blog category room for more funding|publisher = GiveWell|accessdate = 2012-12-09[/tpl]

===Skepticism of fundraising and promotional materials===

GiveWell staff are skeptical of many of the metrics quoted by charities in their fundraising and promotional materials. For instance, in a joint press release with Great Nonprofits and Philanthropedia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/01/the-worst-way-to-pick-a-charity/|title = The worst way to pick a charity|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden |date = 2009-12-01|accessdate = 2013-09-21|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl] they explain why the "overhead ratio" is a bad way to measure the effectiveness of charities.
GiveWell staff are also skeptical of anecdotal evidence, particularly when such evidence is unaccompanied by quantitative data.

==Operations==

===Funding and operating partnerships===

Operating costs are not funded by the individual donors GiveWell seeks to direct but rather by private donor groups including The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.GiveWell Story, GiveWell website. GiveWell also announced a close partnership with Good Ventures in June 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/|title = GiveWell and Good Ventures|author = Holden|date = 2012-06-28[/tpl]

===Identifying candidate charities===

GiveWell uses a number of sources to identify candidate charities for further investigation and rating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/international/process/2011|title = 2011 international aid process review|publisher=GiveWell|accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl] They accept charity name submissions from charities, donors, and others. In addition, GiveWell also uses as a starting point the lists of grantees of impact-focused foundations and grantmaking bodies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Children's Investment Fund Foundation, Mulago Foundation, Skoll Foundation, Jasmine Social Investments, and Peery Foundation. They consider charities that are participating jointly with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab and Innovations for Poverty Action in the evaluation of their programs. GiveWell staff also consider domain-specific charity lists, winners of various awards, and lists of charities highlighted by other charity evaluators and donor groups.

===Investigating and rating charities===

GiveWell investigates charities empirically, under the assumption that different charities face different burdens of proof, depending on the amount of data available.Jason Saul (2011). The End of Fundraising: Raise More Money by Selling Your Impact, John Wiley and Sons, 2011. Pg. 130 They consider many financial issues in the process of attempting to sort charities by their overall utility based on each charity's reach and impact.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.givewell.org/about |title=About |publisher=GiveWell |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13[/tpl]
GiveWell identifies top charities in many domains, including education, health, and economic empowerment based on a number of criteria.GiveWell Criteria, GiveWell website.
A charity must be a few things to rank highly with GiveWell: Proven, not by anecdotes and stories, but by systematic and representative data (with domain-specific metrics); Cost-effective for their domain, although these estimations are necessarily rough, and cross-comparison for this criteria is difficult; Scalable and able to use increased funding effectively, since charities can become over funded; and Transparent, since charity organizations must be trustworthy and willing to demonstrate their effectiveness to donors that do not want to waste their money.
GiveWell ascribes a large amount of weight to the idea that a charity should publish 'monitoring and evaluation reports', based on the belief that this means that the charity is committed to actually testing its own impact and effectiveness. Similarly, it is considered promising if the charity has chosen a sort of program that has been proven to be effective.
GiveWell provides a regularly updated list of top-rated charities in each of these areas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities|title= GiveWell's top rated charities|publisher =  GiveWell|accessdate = 2012-11-27[/tpl]
Since 2011, GiveWell staff have been performing site visitsSite visits page on GiveWell website for all potential top-rated charities and posting, where possible, audio and photographs of their visits. In addition, GiveWell regularly publishes updates on the activities of all current and past top-rated charities. The frequency of updates on each charity may vary between 3 months and 1 year depending on the nature of its activities and the amount of money that was moved to the charity.

===Investigating causes and background research===

In order to evaluate programs operated by charities, GiveWell staff need some background knowledge on the general efficacy of various types of program. Some of the sources that GiveWell uses to build this background knowledge are:[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/program-evaluation|title = Criteria for Program Evaluation|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl]
GiveWell staff also offer commentary on programs that are not seeking funds and that GiveWell is not planning to evaluate, if understanding these programs helps with a better understanding of the causes that GiveWell is investigating. Examples include GiveWell backgrounders and blog posts on the Millennium Villages Project,Millennium Villages Project blog post by GiveWell, microfinance,GiveWell introduction to microfinanceGiveWell blog category microfinance charities and meta-aid questions.GiveWell blog category meta-aid questions

===GiveWell Labs===

In September 2011, GiveWell announced GiveWell Labs,Announcing GiveWell Labs, a blog post by GiveWell which they described as "an arm of our research process that will be open to any giving opportunity, no matter what form and what sector." In subsequent blog posts, GiveWell provided more details about GiveWell Labs,GiveWell Labs category on the GiveWell blog and there is now a separate page on the GiveWell website with details about GiveWell Labs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/about/labs|title=GiveWell Labs Overview|publisher=GiveWell[/tpl] GiveWell Labs aims to directly make large grants to charities that have huge potential upside. In 2013, GiveWell started publishing shallow overviews (see the section #Shallow overviews for more) as part of its work on GiveWell Labs.

==Recommendations==

===Top causes===

GiveWell has concentrated on categories of impact: developing-world health, developing-world poverty, U.S. early childhood care and education, U.S. K-12 education, and employment assistance in New York City. It provides a regularly updated list of top-rated charities in each of these areas.
GiveWell recommends international-health causes because the problems to be addressed are more straightforward and very cheap."Want to Change People's Lives? Give Internationally" by Holden Karnofsky

===Top-rated charities===

GiveWell's top recommended charities at end-of-year are given in the table below. The official list is typically released in the last week of November, which is the week after Thanksgiving in the United States.

===Quick grants===

On September 27, 2012, GiveWell announced its first "Quick Grant" recommendation: it recommended that partner organization Good Ventures make a grant of $100,000 to the U.S. Cochrane Center, part of the Cochrane Collaboration. The idea behind "Quick Grants" was that GiveWell could recommend to specific large donors to quickly grant a sum of money to an organization that was in urgent need of funds, even though GiveWell had not had time to investigate the organization thoroughly enough to put it in GiveWell's list of recommended charities.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/good-ventures/quick-grant-to-the-us-cochrane-center/501025546593009|title = "Quick Grant" to the US Cochrane Center|publisher = Good Ventures|date = 2012-09-27|accessdate = 2012-09-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/09/27/us-cochrane-center-uscc-gets-our-first-quick-grant-recommendation/|title = US Cochrane Center (USCC) gets our first "quick grant" recommendation|publisher = GiveWell|date = 2012-09-27|accessdate = 2012-09-28[/tpl]

===Guidelines for charity evaluation===

In addition to providing rankings for charities overall, GiveWell provides detailed reviews of each of its top-rated charities, a list of all charities that it has considered along with reviews of many of these,[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/charities|title = Charities|publisher = GiveWell|accessdate = 2012-11-27[/tpl] a list of Giving 101 basics[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/giving101|title = Giving 101|publisher = GiveWell website[/tpl] and suggestions for individuals on how to do research and what questions to ask when evaluating charities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/researching-charities-on-your-own|title = Researching charities on your own|publisher = GiveWell|accessdate = 2012-11-27[/tpl]
Previously, GiveWell also published a list with the top charity in each of the causes it was investigating. However, this list was removed in GiveWell's November 2012 refresh of its top charity list.

===Shallow overviews===

As part of its work related to GiveWell Labs, GiveWell publishes shallow overviews of general causes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/shallow/|title = Shallow investigations of new causes|publisher = GiveWell (as part of GiveWell Labs)|accessdate = 2013-09-21[/tpl] These are distinct from its charity recommendations and reviews. The first shallow overview appears to have been published in April 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/shallow/migration|title = Seasonal migration within low-income countries|publisher = GiveWell|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2013-09-21[/tpl] but GiveWell appears to have first officially announced shallow overviews in a blog post in May 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/|title = Refining the Goals of GiveWell Labs|date = 2013-05-30|accessdate = 2013-09-21|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl] As of September 2013, shallow investigations have been conducted in the areas of anthropogenic climate change, detection of near-Earth asteroids, migration (intra-country and international), volcanoes, geoengineering, nuclear security, business environment, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. GiveWell staffer Holden Karnofsky discussed more about the purpose of shallow overviews in a conversation with Giving What We Can representatives and other effective altruists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jefftk.com/p/flow-through-effects-conversation|title = Flow Through Effects Conversation|date = 2013-08-31|accessdate = 2013-09-21|publisher = GiveWell|last = Kaufman|first = Jeff[/tpl]

===Non-recommended charities===

GiveWell generally does not focus much effort on, and does not publish detailed reviews of, charities that they do not believe hold the promise of being outstanding. However, GiveWell staff do occasionally comment critically on celebrated charities that they think do not live up to the hype. These include Kiva, Grameen Foundation, Heifer International, Smile Train, UNICEF, Acumen Fund, the Robin Hood Foundation, the Millennium Villages Project, the Worldwide Fistula Fund, and the Carter Center.Celebrated charities we don't recommend, GiveWell blog
In the wake of the scandal surrounding Greg Mortenson's book Three Cups of Tea and his non-profit Central Asia Institute, GiveWell staff wrote a blog postGiveWell blog post on Three Cups of Tea scandal explaining how the scandal vindicated GiveWell's focus on outstanding charities with a proven track record, in contrast with the approach used by GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

===Disaster relief===

GiveWell's overall top-rated charity recommendations have not been in the area of disaster relief and GiveWell staff have made the case against disaster relief being the focus of charitable donations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2008/08/29/the-case-against-disaster-relief/|title = The case against disaster relief|date = 2008-08-29|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl] However, GiveWell also publishes analyses of disaster relief efforts and recommendations within the disaster relief category after major disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/disaster-relief/haiti-earthquake|title = Ratings of disaster relief charities one year after the Haiti earthquake|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl] the 2011 Japan Earthquake and tsunami,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/disaster-relief/Japan-Earthquake-March-2011|title = Japan disaster relief|publisher=GiveWell[/tpl] and the East Africa/Somalia famine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/donate-to-somalia|title=Donating to Somalia|publisher=GiveWell[/tpl] In addition, GiveWell has a blog category devoted to disaster relief.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/category/disaster-relief/|title = Blog category disaster relief|publisher=GiveWell[/tpl] Among the charities that GiveWell has recommended in the context of disaster relief are Doctors without Borders, Partners in Health, and Direct Relief International.

==Reception and impact==

===Money moved and web traffic===

Around February of every year, GiveWell publishes a complete self-evaluation in a series of blog posts. In addition, GiveWell publishes quarterly reports (in the form of blog posts) about its web traffic and money moved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/category/self-evaluation/|title = GiveWell blog category self-evaluation|publisher = GiveWell|accessdate = 2013-03-12[/tpl] They also provide an updated summary of their money moved statistics on their Impact page.[tpl]cite web|url=http://givewell.org/about/impact|title = Impact|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl]

===Partnerships with philanthropies and use by other charity recommenders===

In June 2012, GiveWell announced a close partnership with Good Ventures, a philanthropic organization with similar aims that was co-founded by Cari Tuna and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.
In March 2010, GiveWell announcedGiveWell announcement on participation in TakeAction@GuideStar a partnership with GuideStar through GiveWell's participation, along with Great Nonprofits and Philanthropedia, in the TakeAction@GuideStar program. This program allows donors to see detailed information from GiveWell, Great Nonprofits, or Philanthropedia, where available, when looking up a charity on GuideStar.
GiveWell does not have a formal relationship with charity evaluator Giving What We Can, but Giving What We Can does reference (and occasionally critique) GiveWell's reviews of the charities that it recommends.
The website The Life You Can Save, based on an eponymous book by Peter Singer, bases its recommendations of top-rated charities on the recommendations provided by GiveWell and Giving What We Can.

===Reception of GiveWell's 2013 recommendations===

On December 3, 2013, Good Ventures (an effective philanthropy organization that works in close collaboration with GiveWell) announced a grant of USD 2 million to GiveDirectly, so that only USD 500,000 of the minimum target specified by GiveWell for GiveDirectly was not yet raised. Good Ventures also announced that it would match up to USD 5 million in funds donated to GiveDirectly till January 31, 2014 (with a limit of matching USD 100,000 per individual donor), suggesting that the actual amount needed from individual donors to achieve GiveWell's minimum target would be USD 250,000 (assuming no very large donors).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/our-giving-season-plans|title = Our Giving Season Plans|last = Tuna|first = Cari|publisher = Good Ventures|accessdate = December 3, 2013|date = December 3, 2013[/tpl] GiveWell wrote a blog post responding to the Good Ventures announcement, stating that they had recommended the grant but not the donation matching.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/|title = Good Ventures Matching Gift to GiveDirectly and Grants to Top Charities|date = December 3, 2013|accessdate = December 3, 2013|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell[/tpl]
Carl Shulman wrote on his personal blog that, judging from GiveWell's explanation for its 2013 end-of-year recommendations, the optimal course for donors may be to hold onto their money for giving in 2014 or 2015 rather than donate to GiveDirectly, despite its being the most highly recommended by GiveWell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-cuff-thoughts-on-givewells-2013.html|title = Off-the-cuff thoughts on GiveWell's 2013 recommendations|last = Shulman|first = Carl|date = December 3, 2013|accessdate = December 3, 2013[/tpl] Shulman's reasoning was that the quality of top recommendations for GiveWell would probably be much higher in 2014 or 2015. He cited two main reasons: Against Malaria Foundation may be able to resume bednet distribution, and GiveWell Labs might be able to make recommendations by 2015. He followed up with a post with more detailed reasoning on the role that Good Ventures funding to GiveWell's recommended charities played in affecting the value of marginal donations and room for more funding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/donor-advised-fund-using-future.html|title = How to think about displacing Good Ventures in funding GiveWell Labs?|last = Shulman|first = Carl|date = December 12, 2013|accessdate = March 25, 2014|last = Shulman|first = Carl[/tpl]
Effective giving advocacy group and charity evaluator Giving What We Can published a blog post on December 12, 2013, stating that they continued to recommend Against Malaria Foundation as their top charity, despite it getting delisted by GiveWell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-12-12/why-we-continue-to-recommend-the-against-malaria-foundation|title = Why we continue to recommend the Against Malaria Foundation - See more at: http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-12-12/why-we-continue-to-recommend-the-against-malaria-foundation|publisher = Giving What We Can|last = Mogensen|first = Andreas|date = December 12, 2013|accessdate = December 21, 2013[/tpl]
