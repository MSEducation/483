[[Centimetre of water]]

CATEGORIES: Units of pressure

A centimetre of water (US spelling centimeter of water, abbreviated cmH2O or cm H2O) is a less commonly used unit of pressure derived from pressure head calculations using metrology. It is frequently used to measure the central venous pressure, the intracranial pressure while sampling cerebrospinal fluid, as well as determining pressures during mechanical ventilation or in water supply networks (then usually in metres water column).  It is also a common unit of pressure in the speech sciences.
It is defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water of 1 cm in height at 4 °C (temperature of maximum density) at the standard acceleration of gravity. That is [tpl]nowrap|999.9720 kg/m3 @ 4 °C[/tpl] × [tpl]nowrap|9.80665 m/s2[/tpl] / 100 = [tpl]nowrap|1 cmH2O (4°C)[/tpl] = [tpl]nowrap|98.0638 Pa[/tpl]. Using the approximation [tpl]nowrap|1000 kg/m³[/tpl] instead results in [tpl]nowrap|98.0665 Pa[/tpl].
This unit is commonly used to specify the pressure to which a CPAP machine is set after a polysomnogram.
