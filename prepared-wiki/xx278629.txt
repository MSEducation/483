Nicholas Schmidt called Nicolas or Nic (November 8, 1860 - ?) was an American machinist, merchant, banker and brewer from Marathon City, Wisconsin who served three terms as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly."Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848â€“1999 State of Wisconsin Legislative Bureau.

==Background==

Schmidt was born in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia on November 8, 1860, son of Nicholas and Margaret Schmidt, and attended public school, but not high school. While training as a locksmith and machinist he attended night school to make up for his lack of a high school education. He traveled extensively in Europe while working in his trade before emigrating to the United States in 1880 alone, leaving behind his parents and four sisters (the youngest of whom later came to the United States and lived in Minnesota). His first home in the U.S. was in West Point, Nebraska, where he worked for six months. Homesick, he started to return to his homeland; but upon reaching Chicago, friends there persuaded him to remain there, working at his trade and again attending night school (to master the English language),  until 1887, when a work accident left him with a damaged shoulder blade which made it impossible for him to continue work as a machinist, and he was forced to seek other work. He spent six years "in the flour, feed, coal and wood business" in Chicago, and later sold real estate there.
While in Chicago Schmidt married at Chicago Mary Friedl, who died there, after having borne four children: Frederick M., Charles N., Thomas E., and
Arthur, who was to die at Marathon City at the age of eleven. On May 2, 1899, Schmidt re-married to one Berta Gunjen, like himself a native of Germany.

In 1902 he bought the Marathon City Brewery; he moved to Marathon City and took control of the brewery in September of that year. In 1905 it became a public company, but he remained as president, treasurer and manager until December 31, 1910, when he gave up the management of the business for health reasons. During this time he helped organizing the State Bank of Marathon City, of which he was the first president, remaining so until December, 1911. He was one of the main organizers of the Marathon City Telephone Company and was like its first president, and also help organize the Marathon Excelsior Manufacturing Company and the Marathon Lumber Company. By 1913, his role in each of these companies was primarily as a stockholder.Marchetti, Louis.
