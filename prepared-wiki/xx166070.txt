Burning Japan Live is a live album by former Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Trapeze vocalist/ bassist Glenn Hughes. It was recorded at the Club Chitta' in Kawasaki city, Japan on Tuesday the 24th of May and Wednesday the 25th of May 1994 in support of the studio album From Now On....

==History==

This was the first official live solo album to be released by Hughes. It features a set-list of fifteen songs, four from his 1994 solo album From Now On..., three songs from the Hughes/Thrall album and seven Deep Purple numbers. It also features a never before heard song entitled Still In Love With You, on which Hughes plays keyboards.
Hughes’ band for the concerts was the same as the band that played on From Now On..., including Europe members Mic Michaeli, John Levén and Ian Haugland (who only performed on the bonus tracks from From Now On...).
It is of note that a live version of the track Kiss Of Fire (from the first Phenomena album) was recorded during the same performance and included on the Talk About It EP.
There is an error in the sleeve notes for the album; they mistakenly credit the tracks This Time Around and Owed To G to Bolin/Hughes/Paice, when they should read Hughes/Lord and Bolin, respectively.
