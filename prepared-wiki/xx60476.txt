Knight of Shadows is the ninth book in the Amber saga by Roger Zelazny and published in November 1989.
Merlin continues to attempt to solve the mysteries in his life: Why did Julia turn against him? And how did she get involved with Jurt, who is raging against him a ruthless vendetta?
After being trapped in a strange world peopled with ghosts induced by the Pattern, Merlin discovers that he is involved in a superpower quarrel between Amber's  Pattern and the Logrus of Chaos.
In this book, Merlin describes Corwin's voice as "the voice which had once told me a very long story containing multiple versions of an auto accident and a number of genealogical gaffes." The "genealogical gaffes" here refers to a number of inconsistencies in the first series (the Corwin Cycle) regarding the parentage of Corwin's various siblings.
