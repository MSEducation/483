He was suspected of involvement in South America's Operation Condor, but was acquitted.

==Italy activity==

===Founder of Avanguardia Nazionale in 1960===

Delle Chiaie began as member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI, the neo-Fascist party). However he rejected the participation of the MSI in elections, preferring to take the battle to the streets. After participating to the foundation of the Centri Studi Ordine Nuevo with members of the MSI, he created the small Gruppi di Azione Rivoluzionari (GAR) at the end of the 1950s. Involved in various political actions, such as protesting against Eisenhower's visit to Italy or fighting against Italian Communist Party members, he already maintained close international links, notably with the Austrian Konrad Windisch, leader of the neo-Nazi Kameradschaftsring Nationaler Jugendverbände (KNJ).Stefano Delle Chiaie, Massimiliano Griner, Umberto Berlenghini (2012), L'aquila e il condor, p.17-18, Sperling & Kupfer editori, 2012 He then formed, in 1960, the National Vanguard ("Avanguardia Nazionale") as a street-fighting group.

==Activity in South America==

Stefano delle Chiaie was described by the CIA as being the most wanted rightist terrorist in 1983, was suspected of a lot of irregular activity, but was always acquitted on appeal.
In the course of  his activities Delle Chiaie was also known by a number of aliases, the most notable of which were ALFA and Alfredo Di Stéfano, after the celebrated footballer of the same name.
Delle Chiaie has since spent most of his time working in Latin America.
Stefano Delle Chiaie took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's "Aginter Press" founded in António de Oliveira Salazar's Portugal in 1965.
As cited in The Fourth Reich: Klaus Barbie and the neo-Fascist connection, by Magnus Linklater, Isable Hilton, and Neal Archerson, Delle Chiaie was one of the orchestrators of the "Cocaine Coup" in Bolivia, along with the German war criminal Klaus Barbie, that brought General Garcia Meza to power in the early 1980s.
His international activities started early. He first took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's "Aginter Press", founded in Salazar's Portugal in 1965. After assisting Borghese during his 1970 attempted coup in Italy, he escaped to Franquist Spain — as would Vincenzo Vinciguerra — and met with future members of the GAL death squad. He was then present at the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre in Argentina,[tpl]cite news | title=Las Relaciones secretas entre Pinochet, Franco y la P2 - Conspiración para matar | publisher=Nizkor Project | date=February 4, 1999|url=http://www.derechos.org/sorin/doc/p2.html[/tpl] and then met with DINA US agent Michael Townley in 1975 to prepare Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton's (failed) assassination. In 1976, he participated in the Montejurra terrorist incident against left-wing Carlists in Spain, before leaving for Latin America.
In South America, he took part in the 'Cocaine Coup' of Luis García Meza Tejada, when a notoriously corrupt military regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980, with assistance from the Argentine SIDE which had called for on 70 foreign agents. He later worked for the new government in training its soldiers. Stefano Delle Chiaie later declared in a 1983 interview to a Spanish reporter:
 "I was decided to give my hand to the creation of an international revolutionary movement... Therefore, when the opportunity of a national revolution appeared in Bolivia, we were there to shoulder our comrades. We were neither repressors nor narco-terrorists, but political militants."Hearing of Stefano Delle Chiaie on 22 July 1997 before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino 
Judge Baltazar Garzón's investigations demonstrated that he had worked both for Pinochet's political police, the DINA, for the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) and for Hugo Banzer's dictatorship in Bolivia.
Delle Chiaie had met in Madrid with Pinochet during Franco's funeral in 1975, beginning his involvement with the Chilean regime and his part in Operation Condor. According to lawyer Alun Jones, representant of the Spanish justice during Spain's request to Great Britain for the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, Pinochet met with Delle Chiaie in Madrid to plan an attack against Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party. The plan either failed because of Altamirano's awareness and personal caution, or because some intelligence agency — it is not known from which country — may have made him aware of the threats on his personal life.
According to Le Monde diplomatique, Delle Chiaie met with Abdullah Çatlı in Latin America and during a visit of the Turkish "Grey Wolves" member in Miami in September 1982. Abdullah Çatlı "is reckoned to have been one of the main perpetrators of underground operations carried out by the Turkish branch of the Gladio organisation and had played a key role in the bloody events of the period 1976-80 which paved the way for the military coup d’état of September 1980".Turkey’s pivotal role in the international drug trade, Le Monde diplomatique, July 1998 [tpl]en icon[/tpl]/[tpl]fr icon[/tpl]
During a 1997 hearing before the Commission on terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino, Stefano Delle Chiaie went on speaking about a "black fascist International" and his hopes of creating the conditions of an "international revolution." He talked about the World Anticommunist League, but said that after attending a meeting in Paraguay, he left it. He claimed that the latter was a front for the CIA. He only admitted having taken part in the New European Order (NOE) organization, and denied having worked with the International Anticommunist Alliance around 1974.
According to CIA documents, in Madrid, Stefano Delle Chiaie also met with Michael Townley, a DINA agent, and Virgilio Paz Romero, a Cuban based in Miami, with connections in Chile, to prepare, with the help of Franco's secret police, the murder of Bernardo Leighton, a Chilean Christian Democrat. On October 6, 1975 Leighton and his wife were severely injured by gunshots while in exile in Rome.Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973 by Peter Kornbluh, National Security Archive
Delle Chiaie, along with fellow neo-fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, also testified in Rome in December 1995 before judge María Servini de Cubria that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004Vital rights ruling in Argentina, BBC, August 24, 2004 [tpl]en icon[/tpl]) and Michael Townley (a United States-born secret police officer) were directly involved in this assassination.Arancibia, "clave" en la cooperación de las dictaduras, La Jornada, May 22, 2000 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
