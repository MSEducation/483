Kavitrayam is a Telugu expression for trinity of poets. Kavitrayam popularly refers to the poets who translated the great epic Mahabharata into Telugu. The trinity consists of Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada.

Thus Nannayya made Telugu more Sanskritized. Thus lot of Nannayya's time was gone in building a scaffold for the great activity. He was able to translate the first 2½ parvas (chapters) into Telugu.

==Thikkana==

He belonged to Paturu, kovur talukNellore, a territory in 13th century's Orugallu kingdom.  Thikkana took over the task from Nannayya. He could almost complete task by translating from 4th to 18th chapters of the book. He could start the task right from day one, because Telugu was considerably an improved language by his times. However, he never attempted the 3rd chapter, thus leaving the task incomplete.
