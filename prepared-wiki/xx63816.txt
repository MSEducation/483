[[Fock state]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Quantum optics, Quantum field theory

A Fock state (also known as a number state), in quantum mechanics, is any element of a Fock space with a well-defined number of particles (or quanta). These states are named after the Soviet physicist, V. A. Fock.

==Definition==

A more mathematical definition is that Fock states are those elements of a Fock space which are eigenstates of the particle number operator.  Elements of a Fock space which are superpositions of states of differing particle number (and thus not eigenstates of the number operator) are, therefore, not Fock states.  Thus, not all elements of a Fock space are referred to as "Fock states." 
Fock states form the most convenient basis of the Fock space. They are defined to obey the following relations in the bosonic algebra:

==Energy eigenstates==

Fock states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of the field:

==Vacuum fluctuations==

The electrical and magnetic fields and the vector potential have the mode expansion of the same general form:
Thus it is easy to see that the expectation values of these field operators vanishes in the vacuum state:
However, it can be shown that the expectation values of the square of these field operators is non-zero. Thus there are fluctuations in the field about the zero ensemble average. These vacuum fluctuations are responsible for many interesting phenomenon including the Lamb shift in quantum optics.

==Multi-mode Fock states==

The creation and annihilation operators operate on the multi-mode state by only raising or lowering the number state of their own mode:
We also define the total number operator for the field which is a sum of number operators of each mode:
The multi-mode Fock state is an eigenvector of the total number operator whose eigenvalue is the total occupation number of all the modes
The multi-mode Fock states are also eigenstates of the multi-mode Hamiltonian

==Source of single photon state==

Single photons are routinely generated using single emitters (atoms, Nitrogen-vacancy center
