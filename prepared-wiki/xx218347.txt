Volumes 1 & 2 is the first full length album by The Desert Sessions. It features the seven tracks found on the original 10 inch singles, plus three bonus tracks.
This album differs from subsequent collaborative Desert Sessions in that it was recorded solely by Josh Homme's band The Acquitted Felons playing for three days straight on psilocybin mushrooms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]

==Track listing==

Tracks marked with a * are CD only bonus tracks and do not appear on the individual vinyl versions.
The two "Girl Boy Tom" tracks are actually part of a single song. "Monkey in the Middle" is crammed between the two tracks with a fade out from "Girl Boy Tom" and fade back into "Girl Boy Tom". Thus the title "Monkey in the Middle" is a sort of play on titles, being the monkey in the middle.
