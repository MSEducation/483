She also won nine Grand Slam women's doubles titles, winning a calendar-year doubles Grand Slam in 1998, and one Grand Slam mixed doubles title.
Hingis set a series of "youngest-ever" records before ligament injuries in both ankles forced her to withdraw temporarily from professional tennis in 2002 at the age of 22. After several surgeries and long recuperations, Hingis returned to the WTA tour in 2006. She then climbed to world no. 6 and won three singles titles.

She made her professional debut in October 1994, two weeks after her 14th birthday. She ended the year ranked World No. 87, and in January 1995, she became the youngest player to win a match at a Grand Slam tournament when she advanced to the second round of the Australian Open.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7073957.stm|title=Martina Hingis's career in photos|publisher=BBC Sport  |date=7 November 2007|accessdate=31 October 2008[/tpl]

==Grand Slam success and period of dominance==

In 1996, Hingis became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time, when she teamed with Helena Suková at Wimbledon to win the women's doubles title at age 15 years and 9 months.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/hingis-to-miss-wimbledon-651558.html|title=Hingis to miss Wimbledon|author=John Roberts|date=21 May 2002|accessdate=31 October 2008 |work=The Independent  | location=London[/tpl] She also won her first professional singles title that year at Filderstadt, Germany. She reached the singles quarterfinals at the 1996 Australian Open and the singles semifinals of the 1996 US Open. Following her win at Filderstadt, Hingis defeated the reigning Australian Open champion and co-top ranked (with Steffi Graf) Monica Seles in the final at Oakland. Hingis then lost to Graf at the year-end WTA Tour Championships.
In 1997, Hingis became the undisputed World No. 1 women's tennis player. She started the year by winning the warm-up tournament in Sydney. She then became the youngest Grand Slam singles winner in the 20th century by winning the Australian Open at age 16 years and 3 months (beating former champion Mary Pierce in the final). In March, she became the youngest top ranked player in history. In July, she became the youngest singles champion at Wimbledon since Lottie Dod in 1887 by beating Jana Novotná in the final. She then defeated another up-and-coming player, Venus Williams, in the final of the US Open. The only Grand Slam singles title that Hingis failed to win in 1997 was the French Open, where she lost in the final to Iva Majoli. She won the Australian Open women's doubles with Natasha Zvereva.
In 1998, Hingis won all four of the Grand Slam women's doubles titles, only the fourth in women's tennis history to do so,Martina Hingis News and Trivias at. Celebritywonder.com. Retrieved on 30 July 2011. (the Australian Open with Mirjana Lučić and the other three events with Novotná), and she became only the third woman to hold the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles simultaneously. She also retained her Australian Open singles title by beating Conchita Martínez in straight sets in the final. Hingis, however, lost in the final of the US Open to Lindsay Davenport. Davenport ended an 80-week stretch Hingis had enjoyed as the No. 1 singles player in October 1998, but Hingis finished the year by beating Davenport in the final of the WTA Tour Championships.
1999 saw Hingis win her third successive Australian Open singles crown as well as the doubles title (with Anna Kournikova). She then reached the French Open final and was three points away from victory in the second set before losing to Steffi Graf. After a shock first-round 6–2, 6–0 loss to Jelena Dokić at Wimbledon,[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/1999/wimbledon/news/1999/06/22/vicario_advance/ |publisher=CNN | title=Qualifier Dokic crushes world No. 1, 6–2, 6–0 | date=22 June 1999 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] Hingis bounced back to reach her third consecutive US Open final, where she lost to 17-year-old Serena Williams. Hingis won a total of seven singles titles that year and reclaimed the No. 1 singles ranking. She also reached the final of the WTA Tour Championships, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.
In 2000, Hingis again found herself in both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian Open. This time, however, she lost both. Her three-year hold on the singles championship ended when she lost to Davenport. Later, Hingis and Mary Pierce, her new doubles partner, lost to Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. Hingis captured the French Open women's doubles title with Pierce and produced consistent results in singles tournaments throughout the year. She reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before losing to Venus Williams. Although she did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament, she kept the year end No. 1 ranking because of nine tournament championships, including the WTA Tour Championships where she won the singles and doubles titles.

==Injuries and hiatus from tennis==

In 2001, Switzerland, with Hingis and Roger Federer on its team, won the Hopman Cup.
Hingis was undefeated in singles during the event, defeating Tamarine Tanasugarn, Nicole Pratt, Amanda Coetzer, and Monica Seles.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/switzerland-win-hopman-cup-705774.html |work=The Independent  | location=London | title=Switzerland win Hopman Cup | date=6 January 2001 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl]
Hingis reached her fifth consecutive Australian Open final in 2001, defeating both of the Williams sisters en route, before losing to Jennifer Capriati. She briefly ended her coaching relationship with her mother Melanie early in the year[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/1323400.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Mum's the word for Hingis | date=10 May 2001 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] but had a change of heart two months later just before the French Open. 2001 was her least successful year in several seasons, with only three tournament victories in total. She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.
Coming back from injury, Hingis won the Australian Open doubles final at the start of 2002 (again teaming with Anna Kournikova) and reached a sixth straight Australian Open final in singles, again facing Capriati. Hingis led by a set and 4–0 and had four match points but lost 4–6, 7–6, 6–2. In May 2002, she needed another ankle ligament operation, this time on her left ankle. After that, she continued to struggle with injuries and was not able to recapture her best form.
In February 2003, at the age of 22, Hingis announced her retirement from tennis, due to her injuries and being in pain.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/2735931.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Hingis quits tennis | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] "I want to play tennis only for fun and concentrate more on horse riding and finish my studies."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200302/s780193.htm |title=Hingis reiterates retirement decision. 10/2/2003.

During this segment of her tennis career, Hingis won 40 singles titles and 36 doubles events. She held the World No. 1 singles ranking for a total of 209 weeks (fourth most following Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert). In 2005, Tennis magazine put her in 22nd place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the TENNIS era.

==Return to the game==

===2005===

In February 2005, Hingis made an unsuccessful return to competition at an event in Pattaya, Thailand, where she lost to Germany's Marlene Weingärtner in the first round. After the loss, she claimed that she had no further plans for a comeback.
Hingis, however, resurfaced in July, playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles in World Team Tennis and notching up singles victories over two top 100 players and shutting out Martina Navratilova in singles on 7 July. With these promising results behind her, Hingis announced on 29 November her return to the WTA Tour in 2006.

===2006===

At the Australian Open, Hingis lost in the quarterfinals to second-seeded Kim Clijsters. However, Hingis won the mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi of India. This was her first career Grand Slam mixed doubles title and fifteenth overall (5 singles, 9 women's doubles, 1 mixed doubles).
The week after the Australian Open, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Maria Sharapova in the semifinals of the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo before losing in the final to World No. 9 Elena Dementieva. Hingis competed in Dubai then, reaching the quarter-finals before falling to Sharapova. At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Hingis defeated World No. 4 Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round before again losing to Sharapova in the semifinals.
At the Tier I Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, Hingis posted her 500th career singles match victory in the quarterfinals, beating World No. 18 Flavia Pennetta, and subsequently won the tournament with wins over Venus Williams in the semifinals and Dinara Safina in the final. This was her 41st Women's Tennis Association tour singles title and first in more than four years. Hingis then reached the quarterfinals of the French Open before losing to Kim Clijsters.
At Wimbledon, Hingis lost in the third round to Ai Sugiyama.
Hingis's return to the US Open was short lived, however, as she was upset in the second round by World No. 112 Virginie Razzano of France.
In her first tournament after the US Open, Hingis won the second title of her comeback at the Tier III Sunfeast Open in Kolkata, India. She defeated unseeded Russian Olga Poutchkova in the final. The following week in Seoul, Hingis notched her 50th match win of the year before losing in the second round to Sania Mirza.
Hingis qualified for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships in Madrid as the eighth seed. In her round robin matches, she lost in three sets to both Justine Henin and Amélie Mauresmo but defeated Nadia Petrova.
Hingis ended the year ranked World No. 7. She also finished eighth in prize money earnings (U.S.$1,159,537). Hingis also ranked as number 7 on the Annual Top Google News Searches in 2006.Google Zeitgeist Highlights 2006 Searches. Digitaltrends.com (29 December 2006). Retrieved on 30 July 2011.

===2007===

At the Australian Open, Hingis won her first three rounds without losing a set before defeating China's Li Na in the fourth round. Hingis then lost a quarterfinal match to Kim Clijsters. This was the second consecutive year that Hingis had lost to Clijsters in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/jan/25/tennis.australianopen2007|title= Hingis comeback quest suffers repeat rebuff from Clijsters|accessdate=25 January 2007 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Steve|last=Bierley|date=25 January 2007[/tpl] and the third time in the last five Grand Slam tournaments that Clijsters had eliminated Hingis in the quarterfinals.
Hingis won her next tournament, the Tier I Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, defeating Ana Ivanovic in the final. This was Hingis's record fifth singles title at this event.
A hip injury that troubled her at the German Open caused her to withdraw from the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where she was the defending champion, and the French Open, the only important singles title that eluded her.
In her first round match at Wimbledon, Hingis saved two match points to defeat British wildcard Naomi Cavaday, apparently not having fully recovered from the hip injury that prevented her from playing the French Open.[tpl]cite news|url=http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-25/200706251182793470187.html|title=I'm Not a Contender, Says Hingis|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=5 January 2008|author=Kate Battersby|publisher=AELTC |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080125015438/http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-25/200706251182793470187.html  |archivedate = 25 January 2008[/tpl] In the third round, Hingis lost to Laura Granville of the United States, and stated afterwards she should not have entered the tournament.[tpl]cite news|url=http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-29/200706291183145043812.html |title=Injury-hit Hingis Regrets Playing|publisher=AELTC|date=29 June 2007|author=Kate Battersby|accessdate=5 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080125015442/http://championships.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/articles/2007-06-29/200706291183145043812.html  |archivedate = 25 January 2008[/tpl]
Hingis's next tournament was the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, in which Hingis lost in the third round to Belarussian teenager Victoria Azarenka. Hingis did not play any tournaments after the China Open, as she was beset by injuries for the rest of the year.
In November, Hingis called a press conference to announce that she was under investigation for testing positive for benzoylecgonine,http://www.itftennis.com/media/132758/132758.pdf a metabolite of cocaine.
Her urine sample contained an estimated 42 nanograms per millilitre of benzoylecgonine, less than half the level required for a positive confirmatory test for cocaine in the workplace under US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration guidelines.http://workplace.samhsa.gov/DrugTesting/pdf/2010GuidelinesAnalytesCutoffs.pdf  The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter mentions that "the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml." As the amount was so minute, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion.http://www.onthebaseline.com/2009/12/14/moving-forward-martina-hingis-talks-to-on-the-baseline-about-her-tennis-future/ In January 2008, an ITF tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7077525.stm|title=Hingis handed two-year suspension|date=4 January 2008|work=BBC Online|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]

==Retirement==

Having retired for the second time in 2007, Hingis played an exhibition match at the Liverpool International tournament on 13 June 2008. Although this event was a warm-up for Wimbledon, it was not part of the WTA Tour. In a rematch of their 1997 Wimbledon final,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.liverpooltennis.co.uk/tournament_news/article.asp?article=98|title=Czech Star Novotna Comes to Liverpool|publisher=Liverpool International Tennis 2008|date=4 April 2008[/tpl] Hingis defeated Jana Novotná.
In 2009 Hingis took part in the British television dancing competition Strictly Come Dancing (known as Dancing With The Stars in other parts of the world). Vowing to win the competition, she promised to apply the same gritty approach to the dance show that had taken her to five grand slams on the tennis court, asserting that "Everything I do I do to win; I am very competitive". She was the bookies' favourite for the competition,[tpl]cite web|author=Derek McGovern |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/08/26/eye-candy-means-not-just-brucie-on-bonus-115875-21624508/ |title=Strictly Come Dancing: Martina Hingis in sniff of win according to bookies |work=Daily Mirror  |accessdate=6 March 2011[/tpl] but she went out in the first week after performing a Waltz and a Rumba.[tpl]cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6841591.ece |work=The Times  | location=London | title=Martina Hingis is voted off Strictly Come Dancing | first=Sophie | last=Tedmanson | date=20 September 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] She also participated in a gameshow called "Beat The Star" where a female contestant had to beat Hingis in dropping more peas into a narrow bottle to win the prize money.

===2013===

Hingis won the Ladies' Invitation Doubles for a third year in a row at Wimbledon, again with Davenport. They beat Jana Novotná and Barbara Schett in the final. Hingis was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in July 2013, and in the same month, announced that she was coming out of retirement to play a doubles tournament, with Daniela Hantuchová as her partner, in Carlsbad California.  She was accepted as a wildcard entry.  She also played doubles in Toronto, Cincinnati, New Haven, and the US Open.

===2014===

Hingis returned to the WTA Tour at Indian Wells, partnering Sabine Lisicki in the doubles. They lost first round to 3-time Grand Slam finalists Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua in the match tie-break. At the 2014 Sony Open Tennis in Miami, Hingis/Lisicki scored their first win of 2014 with a straight sets victory over 6th seeded Czechs Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Safarova. The team reached the quarterfinals with a straight sets victory over Romanian Sorana Cirstea and Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for the loss of just three games. They next played and defeated Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova, the only other team who had not lost a set. Hingis and Lisicki then went on to reach the finals of the tournament, beating fifth seeds and Indian Wells finalists Cara Black and Sania Mirza in the semifinals in straight sets, Hingis' first since 2007. In the final, they defeated Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina in straight sets, marking Hingis' first title since she won the Qatar Ladies Open in 2007, partnered by Maria Kirilenko, and her first Premier Mandatory doubles title since winning the 2001 title in Moscow, partnered by Anna Kournikova. This was also her third win in Miami, having won her last title there in 1999.

==Playing style==

Hingis was renowned for her cerebral approach to the game of tennis and for her technical skills, enabling her to produce a wide array of shots with finesse.[tpl]Or|date=October 2012[/tpl] She lacked the power possessed by many of her contemporaries; therefore, she relied on low error-rates and good shot selection to keep opponents off-balance.[tpl]Or|date=October 2012[/tpl] She often used change of direction and pace to catch opponents off guard and sharp angles to open up the court. She was also well known for her ability to break long rallies by hitting accurate drop shots and coming to the net, where she was a skilled volleyer. A signature play of Hingis was the drop shot followed by a lob, often resulting in an easy volley or overhead to finish the point.[tpl]Or|date=October 2012[/tpl] Hingis often hit the ball extremely early by standing close to the baseline (or inside it) in order to take reaction time away from her opponent because she did not have sufficient power to hit winners past her opponents.[tpl]Or|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Hingis's strongest groundstroke was her two-handed backhand, which had an extremely low error-rate and great variety. Her backhand down-the-line was among her signature shots and often the shot she chose to hit with greater pace to surprise opponents during a rally.[tpl]Or|date=October 2012[/tpl]
