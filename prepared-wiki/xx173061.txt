[[Nether Skyborry]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Shropshire

Nether Skyborry is a hamlet consisting of six houses in Shropshire, England, one mile northwest of the town of Knighton. 
The Welsh border lies very close - the River Teme runs to the south of the hamlet. The Welsh border is just on the other side of the river (but no longer follows the exact course of the river).
The name "Skyborry" is an anglicisation of the Welsh for barn, ysgubor. "Nether" is English and means near or under.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Wiktionary|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nether| accessdate=1 February 2008[/tpl] The hamlet is downstream of the other hamlet with the Skyborry place name (Skyborry Green - less than [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] northwest) and it is sometimes referred to as "Lower Skyborry".
Nether Skyborry lies [tpl]convert|190|â€“|210|m[/tpl] above sea level, on the northern (English) slope of the Teme valley.
