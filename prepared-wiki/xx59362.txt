Mong Kok (also spelt Mongkok), is an area in the Yau Tsim Mong District on Kowloon West, Hong Kong. Before the 1994 merger, Mong Kok was part of the Mong Kok District. The Prince Edward area occupies the northern part of Mong Kok.
The district is characterized by a mixture of old and new multi-story buildings, with shops and restaurants at street level and commercial or residential units above. Major industries in Mong Kok are retail, restaurants (including fast food) and entertainment.
With its extremely high population density of 130,000 person per km2 or 340,000 person per mi2, Mongkok was described as the busiest district in the world by the Guinness World Records.[ref]

==Name==

The current English name is a transliteration of its older Chinese name 望角 (or 芒角), which is pronounced "Mong Gawk" in Cantonese and is named after its plentiful supply of ferns in the past when it was a coastal region. Its present Chinese name "旺角" is pronounced "Wong Gawk" in Cantonese. The name in Chinese means "prosperous corner and crowded corner".
The area was also called Argyle in English for some time in the past. This name was used for the MTR station in the area, when it was opened in 1979. Also, the office building 旺角中心, which was named after the area, is known in English as Argyle Centre instead of Mong Kok Centre.

The area of Mong Kok has changed significantly over the years. The heart of the present-day Mong Kok is along Argyle Street near Sai Yeung Choi Street whilst the proper Mong Kok was north of it, near present-day Mong Kok East Station of MTR. With cultivated lands, it was bounded south by Argyle Street, west by Coronation Road (present-day Nathan Road), and east by the hills. To its south is Ho Man Tin and west Tai Kok Tsui. Stream from the hills east offered water for cultivation.
