[[Concentration]]

CATEGORIES: Analytical chemistry, Chemical properties

In chemistry, concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration.[tpl]GoldBookRef | file = C01222 | title = concentration[/tpl] The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration.

==Qualitative description==

Often in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as "dilute" for solutions of relatively low concentration and "concentrated" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of solvent (for example, water). By contrast, to dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are fully miscible there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be saturated. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when supersaturation may occur. Instead, phase separation will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a suspension. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.

==Quantitative notation==

There are four quantities that describe concentration:

===Mass concentration===

The SI unit is kg/m3 (equal to g/L).

===Molar concentration===

The SI unit is mol/m3. However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm3) is used.

===Number concentration===

The SI unit is 1/m3.

===Volume concentration===

Being dimensionless, it is expressed as a number, e.g., 0.18 or 18%; its unit is 1.

==Related quantities==

Several other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. Note that these should not be called concentrations.

===Normality===

===Molality===

(Not to be confused with Molarity)
The SI unit for molality is mol/kg.

===Mole fraction===

The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole fractions.

===Mole ratio===

The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole ratios.

===Mass fraction===

The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass fractions.

===Mass ratio===

The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass ratios.

==Dependence on volume==

Concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion.
