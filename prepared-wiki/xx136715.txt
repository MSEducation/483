The pichi (Zaedyus pichiy) or dwarf armadillo is a small armadillo that is the only member of the genus Zaedyus. The range of the pichi is from central and southern Argentina (Patagonia), west to the Andean grasslands of Chile and south to the Strait of Magellan.
Its body is approximately [tpl]convert|1|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] long (260–335 mm) with a tail of 4-6 inches (100–140 mm). It has a dark brown head shield and carapace, thick dorsal plates, and well-developed claws. When threatened, the pichi wedges itself into its shallow burrow making it difficult for an attacker to drag it out because of its jagged scales and/ or roll up into a ball.
