[tpl]nihongo|Myōga|茗荷||[/tpl] Japanese ginger or myoga ginger is the species Zingiber mioga in the Zingiberaceae family. It is an herbaceous, deciduous, perennial native to Japan and southern part of Korea. Only its  edible flower buds and flavorful shoots are used in cooking.Matsuhisa, Nobu and Mark Edwards. (2007). Nobu West, p. 252.  Flower buds are finely shredded and used in Japanese cuisine as a garnish for miso soup, sunomono and dishes such as roasted eggplant. In Korean cuisine, flower buds are skewered alternately with pieces of meat and then are pan-fried.
A traditional crop in Japan, myōga has been introduced to cultivation in Australia and New Zealand for export to the Japanese market.
As a woodland plant, myoga has specific shade requirements for its growth.  It is frost-tolerant to 0°F/-18°C, and possibly colder.

Some constituents of myoga are cytotoxic, others have shown promise for potentially anti-carcinogenic properties.Ha Won Kim et al.
