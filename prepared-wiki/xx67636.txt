[[Oromëan]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth languages

In an older version of J.R.R. Tolkien's conception of the languages of Middle-earth as expounded in the Lhammas, Oromëan is the language family to which all Elvish languages, such as Quenya and Sindarin, belong. It is there contrasted with Aulëan, the language phylum of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves; and with the Melkian languages of Orcs, Balrogs and other monsters.
The Oromëan languages are so named because their ancestral language supposedly derives from the speech of Oromë, the Vala of the Forest, who was the first of the Valar to meet the Elves at Cuiviénen in Middle-earth.
This concept was later dropped.
