Horlicks is the name of a company and of a malted milk hot drink developed by the founders James and William Horlick. It is now manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Jamaica, and under licence in the Philippines and Malaysia.

==Manufacturing process==

Unlike similar drinks, such as Ovaltine, Horlicks is not a dry blend of malt extract and milk powders.
In the initial stage of manufacturing, milled malted barley and wheat flour are mashed together in hot water where the starch is converted into sugars. To this sugar solution dairy powders are added. The water content is then evaporated to form a syrup that is dried in vacuum band driers to form a cake. This cake is milled into the finished powder. This is then fortified with vitamins and minerals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==Sleep promotion==

Claims are often made by malted milk drinks such as Horlicks that they assist sleep, but these claims have been difficult to verify. According to GlaxoSmithKline: "While ... research indicates that Horlicks drinks can help you to sleep better, the exact way in which Horlicks works is not clear."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/never-mind-a-cosmopolitan-how-about-some-horlicks-547217.html|title=Never mind a Cosmopolitan, how about some Horlicks? |author=Terry Kirby|date=22 September 2004 |work=The Independent | accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl]
Malted drinks may help to stave off hunger overnight, which can lead to sounder sleep.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-506742/Is-bedtime-drink-bad-you.html|title=Is your bedtime drink bad for you?|author=Rachel Kaufman |date=8 January 2008 |work=The Daily Mail | accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl]

==Alternative word usage==

Usually taken to be a substitute for the profanity "bollocks".  This use was exploited by the company in a 1990s advertising campaign, in which a harassed housewife exclaims "Horlicks" in a context where a stronger term could have been expected, thus widening the term's exposure and usage for a while.
This substitution in the form of a singular noun is also used to refer to a minor disaster or shambles, as in 'to make a complete Horlicks of something'.http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-hor1.htm
For example, the term was used in July 2003 by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw ("a complete Horlicks"[tpl]cite news|title=Straw says dossier was 'embarrassing' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3015272.stm |date=24 June 2003 |accessdate=2007-08-12[/tpl]) to describe irregularities in the preparation and provenance of a dossier regarding weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

==Advertising==

In 1961, Horlicks ran a television advertising campaign that featured Scottish entertainer Billy Raymond and an actress. The theme of the advert was "Horlicks – the food drink of the night."
Horlicks was the sponsor of the Lum and Abner Show from 1934 to 1937.

==Around the world==

===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, Horlicks is known better as a café drink than as a sleeping aid. It is served at cha chaan tengs as well as fast-food shops such as Café de Coral and Maxim's Express. It can be served hot or cold, and is usually sweetened with sugar. It is made with warm milk, and ice is added to it if a cold drink is desired.

===India===

Horlicks came to India with The British Army; the end of World War I saw Indian soldiers of British Indian Army bringing it back with them as a dietary supplement. Punjab, Bengal and Madras Presidencies became early adopters of Horlicks and many well-to-do Indians took to drinking Horlicks as a family drink in early 1940s and 1950s. It became a sort of status symbol in upper middle class Indians and rich classes. The first flavour available in India, as in Britain, was malt.
India, where it has traditionally been marketed as The Great Family Nourisher, is the largest market for Horlicks.[tpl]cite news|last=Pinto|first=Viveat|title=GSK plays catch-up in foods & beverages|url=http://business-standard.com/india/news/gsk-plays-catch-up-in-foodsbeverages/414370/|newspaper=Business Standard|accessdate=20 June 2012|quote="Leading the charge is Horlicks, GSK’s Rs1,500-crore brand – easily the largest in its portfolio contributing 70 per cent to the brand’s revenues globally."[/tpl] The Indian formulation for Horlicks is slightly different than in most other countries, as there it is manufactured from buffalo milk rather than cows milk due to cultural concerns.Kitchen Lore: The History of Malted Milk Powder In 2003, the brand underwent a revamp which led to the introduction of new flavours such as vanilla, toffee, chocolate, honey, and elaichi (cardamom).[tpl]cite web|title=Revitalising Women's Horlicks in India|url=http://tejas-iimb.org/articles/29.php|publisher=Indian Institute of Management Bangalore|accessdate=20 June 2012|author=Moutusi Maity|coauthors=Arunava Saha Dalal, Giridhar Rao B.G., Navneet Chahal, Rohini Ramachandran, Suraj Holla Byndoor[/tpl] The current line-up of flavours include original (malt), chocolate and elaichi.[tpl]cite web|title=Horlicks Products [tpl]![/tpl] Horlicks|url=http://www.horlicksnutritionacademy.com/product1.html|publisher=GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare India Limited|accessdate=20 June 2012[/tpl] with the latest offering Horlicks Kesar Badaam added recently to the portfolio, providing a more specialized taste offering to the consumers.Horlicks Kesar Badaam is the fourth variant in the Horlicks.
