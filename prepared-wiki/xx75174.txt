==History==

The carrier was formed by the government of Tunisia as Société Tunisienne de l'Air in late 1948. The initial investment was FRF 60 million, with shareholding split between the government (35%), Air France (35%) and another interests (30%).[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=210[/tpl] Air France transferred some of its DC-3s and routes (which included Tunis–Bone–Algiers, Tunis–Ajaccio–Nice, Tunis–Bastia–Nice, Tunis–Rome and a cargo flight between Tunis and Marseilles)[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=210–211[/tpl] to the new airline for it to start operations;[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=210[/tpl] these commenced on [tpl]start date|1949|4|1|df=yes[/tpl]. The first managing director of the company was Rene Lefevre.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=211[/tpl]
The route network was expanded along the coast during the early 1950s. In 1951, Casablanca, Ghudamis and Tripoli were incorporated as destinations. In [tpl]MONTHNAME|5[/tpl] that year, a Tunis–Tripoli–Sabhah service was launched; it was routed via Sfax and Djerba in [tpl]MONTHNAME|9[/tpl]. The Ghudamis route was terminated in 1952, and the Casablanca run was taken over by Air France the same year. In 1953, the service to Marseilles was extended to Paris. In 1954, a Douglas DC-4 was leased from Air France an deployed on the route to Paris.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=211[/tpl] At [tpl]start date|1955|3[/tpl], the fleet comprised [tpl]cardinal to word|3[/tpl] DC-3s, [tpl]cardinal to word|1[/tpl] DC-4 and [tpl]cardinal to word|1[/tpl] Languedoc. During 1955, the carrier transported 92,344 passengers. At year end, the number of employees was 140. The airline had a revenue of £620,000 for 1955, and costs totalled to £550,000. In 1957 the Tunisian government became the largest shareholder (51%) and the stake held by Air France was reduced to 15%.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=211[/tpl]
The carrier took delivery of its first jet-powered aircraft, a Sud Caravelle III, on [tpl]date|1961-8-31[/tpl]. A new service to Frankfurt was inaugurated in [tpl]MONTHNAME|10[/tpl] but it was terminated in [tpl]MONTHNAME|3[/tpl] the following year due to poor economical performance. A second Caravelle was ordered in 1963 and entered service in [tpl]start date|1964|3[/tpl]. In cooperation with Lufthansa, flights to Frankfurt were restarted in [tpl]start date|1966|4[/tpl] using Caravelle equipment.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=211[/tpl] The Nord 262 was first put into service in 1969. The entrance of this aircraft into the fleet along with the airline already having two Caravelles in operation allowed the carrier to phase out a DC-3 and two DC-4s.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=212[/tpl]
The number of employees had grown to 888 by [tpl]start date|1970|3[/tpl]. At this time, the aircraft park, consisting of [tpl]cardinal to word|4[/tpl] Caravelles, [tpl]cardinal to word|2[/tpl] Cessna 402s, [tpl]cardinal to word|1[/tpl] DC-3 and [tpl]cardinal to word|1[/tpl] Nord 262, worked on domestic services and international routes to Algeria, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Libya, Morocco and Switzerland. Tunis Air took delivery of its first Boeing aircraft, a Boeing 727-200, on [tpl]date|1972-3-12[/tpl]; it was put on service on the Tunis–Paris run. On [tpl]start date|1972|4|1|df=y[/tpl], a Boeing 707 that was leased from Sabena was inaugurated the Tunis–London link. The same day, new services to Luxembourg and Jeddah were launched. Late in the year, a [tpl]ordinal to word|2[/tpl] Boeing 727 was ordered, for delivery in [tpl]start date|1973|7[/tpl]. In 1973, a [tpl]ordinal to word|3[/tpl] Boeing 727 was ordered for handover in [tpl]MONTHNAME|12[/tpl] that year. A [tpl]ordinal to word|4[/tpl] aircraft of the type was ordered in [tpl]YEAR|1974[/tpl] and a [tpl]ordinal to word|5[/tpl] in [tpl]YEAR|1975[/tpl] for delivery in [tpl]MONTHNAME|11[/tpl]. The gradual incorporation of the Boeing 727s permitted Tunisair to replace the Caravelles and to retire the remaining DC-3s.[tpl]sfn|Guttery|1998|p=212[/tpl]
