[[Flat racing]]

CATEGORIES: Horse racing

Flat racing is a form of Thoroughbred horse racing which is run over a level track at a predetermined distance. It differs from steeplechase racing which is run over hurdles. The race is a test of speed, stamina, and the skill of the jockey in determining when to restrain the horse or to impel it.
The flat races in Great Britain are run over a variety of distances from five furlongs (1,006 m) to over two miles (3,219 m) and are generally called sprints, middle distance or stayers races.
Racing takes place on a natural grass surface (turf) or on a synthetic surface (all-weather). Racing in Europe is generally on turf, while in the United States and Canada, the more important races are on dirt or all-weather. Indeed, nearly all North American races are flat races, as steeplechase racing is very infrequent and largely confined to short, specialized race meets. There, the term "flat racing" is rarely used, as the form is so predominant.
In Europe, the two most powerful "teams" are Coolmore Stud farm, most of whose horses are trained by Aidan O'Brien in County Tipperary in Ireland and owned by John Magnier and/or Michael Tabor, and the United Arab Emirates based Godolphin stables, owned by the Sheikh Mohammed and his brothers but based during the summer in Newmarket, England.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

==Flat racing in Great Britain==

Each classic is run once each year and is restricted to intact horses that are three years old (in other words, geldings are barred); two of them are further restricted to fillies only. There are five Classic races:
