===Army Chief of Staff===

During his tenure as Army Chief of Staff, Shinseki initiated an innovative but controversial plan to make the Army more strategically deployable and mobile in urban terrain by creating Stryker Interim-Force Brigade Combat Teams.[tpl]cite news|title=Army Takes on Critics of an Armored Vehicle|author=Thom Shanker|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B14F83E5B0C7A8EDDA90994DA404482|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 29, 2002|accessdate=March 20, 2011[/tpl] He conceived a long term strategic plan for the Army dubbed Objective Force, which included a program he designed, Future Combat Systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.ausa.org/WEBINT/DeptAUSANews.nsf/byid/CCRN-6CGLGV|title=Objective Force is Needed for Relevancy|date=April 1, 2001|work=AUSA News|publisher=Association of the United States Army|accessdate=March 20, 2011[/tpl] One other controversial plan that Shinseki implemented was the wearing of the Black Beret for all Army personnel.[tpl]cite news|title=Beret battle: Army approves color change|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/2001/03/16/usn_beretbattle.shtml|newspaper=Amarillo Globe=News|date=March 16, 2001|accessdate=March 20, 2011[/tpl] Prior to Shinseki implementing this policy, only the United States Rangers could wear the black beret. When the black beret was given to all soldiers and officers, the Rangers moved to the tan beret.
Shinseki publicly clashed with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during the planning of the war in Iraq over how many troops the United States would need to keep in Iraq for the postwar occupation of that country. As Army Chief of Staff, General Shinseki testified to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that "something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" would probably be required for postwar Iraq. This was an estimate far higher than the figure being proposed by Secretary Rumsfeld in his invasion plan, and it was rejected in strong language by both Rumsfeld and his Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, who was another chief planner of the invasion and occupation.[tpl]cite news|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/28/us/threats-responses-military-spending-pentagon-contradicts-general-iraq-occupation.html|title=Pentagon Contradicts General on Iraq Occupation Force's Size|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 28, 2003|accessdate=April 4, 2012[/tpl] From then on, Shinseki's influence on the Joint Chiefs of Staff reportedly waned.Shanker, Thom "New Strategy Vindicates Ex-Army Chief Shinseki", New York Times, January 12, 2007. Critics of the Bush Administration alleged that Shinseki was forced into early retirement as Army Chief of staff because of his comments on troop levels; however, his retirement was actually announced nearly a year before those comments.CNN Political Unit. CNN Political Unit debate fact check. CNN.com. October 9, 2004.
When the insurgency took hold in postwar Iraq, Shinseki's comments and their public rejection by the civilian leadership were often cited by those who felt the Bush administration deployed too few troops to Iraq.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111500800.html|title=Abizaid Says Withdrawal Would Mean More Unrest|first=Thomas E.|last=Ricks|coauthors=Ann Scott Tyson|work=Washington Post|date=November 16, 2006|page=A22|quote=General Eric Shinseki was right that a greater international force contribution, U.S. force contribution and Iraqi force contribution should have been available immediately after major combat operations.|accessdate=December 13, 2006[/tpl] On November 15, 2006, in testimony before Congress, CENTCOM Commander Gen.
