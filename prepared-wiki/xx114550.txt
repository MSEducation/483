Martha Jones is a fictional character played by Freema Agyeman in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its spin-off series, Torchwood. She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who, replacing Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). According to the character's creator and executive producer Russell T Davies in his non-fiction book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale, the character was developed from the beginning with the intention of appearing for a whole of the 2007 series, and to later make guest appearances in subsequent series and crossover appearances in the show's two spin-offs; Martha subsequently made guest appearances in Torchwood series two and in Doctor Who series four in 2008 and special episode The End of Time in 2010. Martha was also intended to make guest appearances in the 2009 series of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures, but could not due to the actress' other obligations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-medium-is-not-enough.com/2010/01/competition_and_review_doctor_who_the_writers_tale.php|work=The Medium is Not Enough|title=Competition and Review: Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale — The Final Chapter|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=1 July 2010[/tpl]
Within the series' narrative, Martha begins as a medical student who becomes the Doctor's time travelling companion after an incident at the hospital where she works. After well over a year (from the perspective of the Doctor and herself) of service at the Doctor's side, Martha parts from the Doctor's company as she recognizes how unhealthy their relationship has become. After returning to life on Earth, becoming engaged and finishing her medical degree, Martha finds a newfound level of independence when she is recruited into the paranormal military organisations UNIT, and briefly Torchwood. Having faced the end of the world single-handedly during her time with the Doctor, Martha is recognised for her skills both in the field and in medicine.

Martha Jones is introduced in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, first appearing in the episode "Smith and Jones". When the hospital she works at is teleported to the Moon, medical student Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as the Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, the Doctor invites her to join him for a supposed single trip in his time machine the TARDIS,[tpl]cite episode | title = Smith and Jones | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Charles Palmer, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 31 March 2007[/tpl] but later accepts her as his full-time "companion", admitting that she was "never just a passenger",[tpl]cite episode | title = The Lazarus Experiment | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Stephen Greenhorn, Director Richard Clark, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 5 May 2007[/tpl] and he even gives her the key to the TARDIS.[tpl]cite episode | title = 42 | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Chris Chibnall, Director Graeme Harper, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 19 May 2007[/tpl] Martha becomes frustrated because the Doctor is oblivious to her feelings for him, and she expresses concern that she is simply a rebound after the Doctor's painful loss of his previous companion, Rose (Billie Piper). When the amnesiac Doctor falls in love in the "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood" two-parter, a pained Martha claims "You had to go and fall in love with a human... and it wasn't me".[tpl]cite episode | title = Human Nature | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Paul Cornell, Director Charles Palmer, Producer Susie Liggat | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 26 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite episode | title = The Family of Blood | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Paul Cornell, Director Charles Palmer, Producer Susie Liggat | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 2 June 2007[/tpl] In the series finale, in which the Doctor's nemesis the Master (John Simm) takes over planet Earth, capturing both the Doctor and fellow companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha is left alone to save the world as the Doctor and Jack are captured but she manages to escape by teleporting away. On the run from the Master, she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which restores the incapacitated Doctor and reverses time, undoing the Master's actions. Able to remember the events during the Master's reign, Martha then leaves the TARDIS of her own accord, telling the Doctor that she can't waste her life pining for someone when the relationship cannot happen, but promises that she will see him again.[tpl]cite episode | title = Last of the Time Lords | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer Russell T Davies, Director Colin Teague, Producer Phil Collinson | network = BBC | station = BBC One | city = Cardiff | airdate = 30 June 2007[/tpl] Martha, as voiced by Freema Agyeman, also appears in the 2007 animated serial The Infinite Quest, which aired in twelve weekly segments during the run of the 2007 series.
The character reappears in the 2008 series of the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, which focuses on occasional Doctor Who companion Jack Harkness. First appearing in the episode "Reset" as part of a three-episode story arc, Martha has been temporarily drafted to the Torchwood organisation of alien-hunters by Captain Jack, requiring a medical expert on alien life. Through exposition, it is revealed that Martha has become a "medical officer" for international paranormal investigations agency UNIT since qualifying as a Doctor of Medicine. Martha briefly joins the Cardiff-based Torchwood Three as its medical officer following the death of Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), but later leaves the organisation in the episode "A Day in the Death" once she is satisfied that Owen is fit to return to duty following his resurrection. Later in the 2008 series, Martha returns to Doctor Who for a three-episode arc beginning with "The Sontaran Stratagem" and ending with "The Doctor's Daughter", in which she meets the Doctor's new companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate); in the first episode, a more assertive and engaged Martha summons the Doctor to Earth to help uncover a plot by the Sontarans. Agyeman appears in the role again for the final two episodes of the series, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", where she has been promoted to a US division of UNIT and is working on a top secret teleportation project based on Sontaran technology. She rallies alongside fellow companions Jack and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) in an effort to face the threat of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to destroy reality.[ref]
