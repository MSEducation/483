...ing ([tpl]ko-hhrm|아이엔지[/tpl]) is a 2003 South Korean film starring Im Soo-jung, Kim Rae-won and Lee Mi-sook.
The unusual title of this introspective and well-executed film refers to the present continuous tense in English. Directed with confidence and a clear-eyed perspective by Lee Eon-hee, it captures a sense of what it feels like to be on the inside of an everyday tragedy. At the same time, the film's warmth and humor help the viewer to appreciate the joy and poignancy of the present.[tpl]cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=...ing|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm03.html#ing|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-06-04[/tpl]

==Plot==

Min-ah (Im Soo-jung) is a young woman who has become reserved and aloof to the world as a result of her chronic illness and deformed hand. The film quietly portrays the unconventional, yet endearing relationship between Min-ah and her mother Mi-sook (Lee Mi-sook), as well as Min-ah's development as she is befriended by the high-spirited and carefree photographer Young-jae (Kim Rae-won) who moves into their apartment complex.[tpl]cite web|title=Korean Movie Synopsis: ...ing|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/CU/content/cms_view_301232.jsp|work=Korea Tourism Organization|accessdate=2012-06-04[/tpl]
