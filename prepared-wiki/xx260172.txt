Keep Your Head Down is the fifth Korean studio album (ninth overall) by South Korean pop duo TVXQ, released on January 5, 2011 by S.M. Entertainment. It is TVXQ's first album since the departure of former members Hero Jaejoong, Micky Yoochun, and Xiah Junsu in early 2010. Recording and writing for the album roughly began in the summer of 2010, but full production did not begin until August 2010, after U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin debuted their first performance as a duo at the SM Town Live '10 World Tour concert in Seoul, South Korea.
Bringing in a new line of producers, including E-Tribe and Outsidaz, Keep Your Head Down largely consists of dance-pop songs with urban and electronic arrangements. The album has been described by critics as fierce, dark, and powerful due to its SMP influence,[tpl]Cite news | work=Naver | url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=shm&sid1=106&oid=001&aid=0005849332 | title=TVXQ reaches 10 years old next year | date=2012-10-04 | accessdate=2014-01-09 | language=Korean[/tpl] an experimental genre that is defined by mixing the styles of orchestral pop, rock, hip hop, and contemporary R&B. Released in two different versions, the album spawned two promotional singles with one lead single, "Keep Your Head Down". Lyrically, the album explores dark themes of relationships, betrayal and self-empowerment.
In South Korea, the album debuted at number one on the Gaon Albums Chart for the week of January 8, 2011, and maintained its number-one position for a second week. By the end of the month, Gaon reported that 230,227 copies were shipped. By the end of the year, 263,412 copies of the album were sold in South Korea alone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://star.mk.co.kr/new/view.php?mc=ST&no=447887&year=2012|title=List of 2012 sales for S.M.

==Background and recording==

In July 2009, Hero Jaejoong, Micky Yoochun, and Xiah Junsu filed a lawsuit against their agency S.M. Entertainment, claiming that their 13-year contracts were excessively long and their profits were unfairly distributed.[tpl]cite web|title=TVXQ to Stick Together Despite Legal Dispute|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/08/178_49540.html|work=The Korea Times|date=August 3, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] In October 2009, the Seoul Central District Court granted the three members a temporary contract injunction, but the trio had to comply with S.M.

The song was produced by Yoo Young-jin, who also produced the album's third track "Maximum", a dance-pop song that was originally recorded by all five TVXQ members in 2009. Bringing in a new line of producers including E-Tribe and Outsidaz,[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.nate.com/view/20101123n05064 |title=동방신기, 2011년부터 2인조 체제 활동 "미래 가능성.." |trans_title=TVXQ to comeback in 2011, "future possibilities..." |date=November 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |work=Nate News |publisher=Newsen[/tpl] principal recording for Keep Your Head Down spanned three months.

==Reception and commercial performance==

Keep Your Head Down received generally positive reviews from music critics and K-pop fans, who have praised the album's "powerful" production and its cohesive blend of pop and R&B. The lyrics of "Keep Your Head Down", which talks about recovering from a relationship breakup, came under intense media scrutiny after it was claimed that it was written as a diss track to former members JYJ, who left the group in 2010. Several TVXQ and JYJ fansites also withdrew their support for the song. Yunho and Changmin clarified that the lyrics were misinterpreted, stating, "It's just a song about a man's anger towards the woman that threw him away. That's all."[tpl]cite news | work=''Allkpop | url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2011/01/tvxq-explains-the-meaning-behind-keep-your-head-down-on-entertainment-relay | title=TVXQ explains the meaning behind 'Keep Your Head Down' on 'Entertainment Relay' | date=2011-01-07 | accessdate=2014-01-25[/tpl]
