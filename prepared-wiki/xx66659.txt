thumb|Donald Duck and Friends, #317, June 2004 (Gemstone Publishing)Donald Duck is a comic book starring the Disney character Donald Duck and published by various publishers since 1952. Initially, the series was a "try out" magazine that featured Four Color Comics characters (not all of which owned by Disney) that didn't have their own titles. Donald Duck had appeared in all of the first twenty-five issues so it became solely dedicated to the Duck family starting with #26 in 1952. In 2003, it was renamed as Donald Duck and Friends.
