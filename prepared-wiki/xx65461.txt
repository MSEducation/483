==History==

===Origins===

G4S has its origins in a guarding business founded in Copenhagen in 1901 by Marius Hogrefe originally known as Kjøbenhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt (which translates as Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Night Watch) and subsequently renamed Falck.
In 2000 Group 4, a security firm formed in the 1960s, merged with Falck to form Group 4 Falck. In 2002 Group 4 Falck went on to buy The Wackenhut Corporation in the USA.

===2004 to 2010===

G4S was formed in July 2004, when Group 4 Falck’s security business merged with Securicor to create Group 4 Securicor and began trading on both the London and Copenhagen Stock Exchanges.Digital Look In 2005, Lars Nørby Johansen was succeeded as Chief Executive by Nick Buckles and, in 2006, the new G4S brand identity was rolled out across its business worldwide.Lars Nørby Johansen BloombergGroup 4 Securicor gets snappy with new 'G4S' logo B2B Marketing In the same year, Alf Duch-Pedersen succeeded Jorgen Philip-Sorensen to become the non-executive Chairman of the business.Group4 Securicor PLC: Board Changes FE Investegate
In 2006, 2007 and 2008 G4S was the subject of a global campaign by union workers alleging that its subsidiaries undermine labour and human rights standards. Some of these groups were organised under the banner of the SEIU-funded Focus on Group 4 Securicor. This group supported protests at Group 4 Securicor's annual general meeting in London in 2005.
The 2006 US State Department Report on Human Rights in Indonesia released in March 2006 featured the on-going dispute in Jakarta with Group4/Securicor. In July 2006 the Indonesian Securicor workers had a substantial win – but the campaigners continue to support other Group 4 Securicor workers. The company disputed these claims and pointed to its strong relationships with unions around the world, including the GMB in Britain.
In March 2008, it was announced that G4S were taking over Scottish Rock Steady Group – who steward at major sporting and music events mostly in the UK.

Furthermore, many investors and analysts questioned why the company would want to purchase a firm so far removed from its area of expertise.Has G4S Security Lost the Plot?, The Telegraph, October 2011 Alf Duch-Pedersen resigned as G4S chairman after the failure of this acquisition and was replaced by John Connolly.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/damianreece/9575148/The-women-who-should-be-on-the-Bank-of-Englands-list-to-be-the-next-Governor.html|title=The women who should be on the Bank of England’s list to be the next Governor|publisher=28 September 2012|accessdate=8 August 2013|location=London|first=Damian|last=Reece|date=28 September 2012[/tpl]

In April 2012, G4S released a statement detailing its activities in Israel - the provision of maintenance for some electronic security systems at a prison, a police station and a small number of checkpoints in the West Bank.Business & Human Rights Resource Centre

===Wackenhut subsidiary===

G4S subsidiary Wackenhut, in September 2005, faced allegations of security lapses at seven military bases where it was contracted to provide services. The company claimed the accusations were false and promoted by a union seeking to enrol its employees.
In March 2006, whistle-blowers employed at Wackenhut released information to the press revealing that the company cheated on an anti-terrorism drill at a US nuclear site. It also performed poorly on another drill at a separate location. The allegations claimed that Wackenhut systematically violated weapons inventory and handling policies and that managers showed new hires spots at the facilities where they could take naps and cut corners during patrols.
In July 2007, US Senator Bob Casey urged Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne to re-examine federal plans involving Wackenhut and its operations at US nuclear facilities, public transit systems and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. The Senator said the company was responsible for short-changing its employees.
In winter 2008, the New York Times reported that the Exelon Corporation would replace Wackenhut as an in-house security provider at ten US nuclear power plants. This followed the discovery of guards sleeping while on the clock.
On 24 January 2012, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that a Wackenhut security guard slept while on the job at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and had also used an unauthorised mobile telephone while inside the high-security facility. Photographs of the incidents were distributed to the publication, as well as the lab, Wackenhut and the US Department of Energy, which oversees the plant's operations. The facility houses approximately half a ton of Uranium 233, enough for nearly 250 improvised nuclear detonations. On July 28, 2012 the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory protected by a US subsidiary of G4S, was breached by three protesters, identified as Megan Rice, 82, Michael Walli, 63 and Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, who got as far as the outer wall of the uranium building and allegedly daubed it with slogans and splashed it with human blood.[tpl]cite news |title=How the US Turned Three Pacifists into Violent Terrorists |first=Fran |last=Quigley |url=https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/05/15-7 |newspaper=CommonDreams.org |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2013-05-18[/tpl]  The three form the anti-nuclear weapons activist group Transform Now Plowshares, a part of the Plowshares Movement.

===Death of Jimmy Mubenga===

In October 2010, three G4S-guards restrained and held down 46-year old Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga on departing British Airways flight 77, at Heathrow Airport. Security guards kept him restrained in his seat as he began shouting and seeking to resist his deportation. Police and paramedics were called when Mubenga lost consciousness. The aircraft, which had been due to lift off, then returned to the terminal. Mubenga was pronounced dead later that evening at Hillingdon hospital. Passengers reported hearing cries of "don't do this" and "they are trying to kill me." Scotland Yard's homicide unit began an investigation after the death became categorised as "unexplained". Three private security guards, contracted to escort deportees for the Home Office, were released on bail, after having been interviewed about the incident.
In February 2011, The Guardian reported that G4S guards in the United Kingdom had been repeatedly warned about the use of potentially lethal force on detainees and asylum seekers. Confidential informants and several employees released the information to reporters after G4S's practices allegedly led to the death of Jimmy Mubenga. An internal document urged management to "meet this problem head on before the worst happens" and that G4S was "playing Russian roulette with detainees' lives." The following autumn, the company once again faced allegations of abuse. G4S guards were accused of verbally harassing and intimidating
detainees with offensive and racist language.
In July 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced its conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence to bring any charges for Mr Mubenga's death" against G4S or any of its former employees.
On 9 July 2013 an inquest jury, in a nine-to-one decision, found that Mubenga's death was caused by the G4S guards "using unreasonable force and acting in an unlawful manner." The CPS has announced that it is reconsidering its decision not to bring criminal charges. 

===Unacceptable use of force by UK Border Agency===

In October 2012 the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick published his inspection report into the G4S managed Cedars Pre-Departure Accommodation UK Border Agency (UKBA).[tpl]cite news|title=Cedars pre-departure accommodation – an exceptional facility|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press-releases/hmi-prisons/cedars-pre-departure-accommodation-an-exceptional-facility|accessdate=2012-10-24|newspaper=Ministry of Justice|date=23 October 2012[/tpl] Whilst the majority of the report praised G4S and those working at the centre, noting that "Cedars is an exceptional facility and has many practices which should be replicated in other areas of detention", G4S were criticised for using "non-approved techniques" during one particular incident in which a pregnant woman's wheelchair was tipped up whilst her feet were held.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-20035679|publisher=BBC News|title=G4S used force on pregnant woman at Cedars centre|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl] The incident used "non-approved techniques" causing significant risk to the baby and was a "simply not acceptable" use of force. In response, G4S said its staff were trying to prevent injury and that the report also praised the staff for an "exceptional level of care."

===Fraud allegations===

In July 2013, British Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, asked the Serious Fraud Office to investigate G4S for overcharging for tagging criminals in England and Wales, claiming that it and rival company Serco charged the government for tagging people who were not actually being monitored, including tags for people in prison or out of the country, and a small number who had died, and had done so since 2005. G4S was given an opportunity to take part in a "forensic audit" but refused.[tpl]cite news|title=Tagging firm's 'overcharging' probed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23272708|accessdate=2013-07-11|publisher=BBC News|date=11 July 2013[/tpl]
