==Plot==

==Film adaption==

The 2012 film, Jack Reacher, was a film adaptation of the 2005 Reacher novel, One Shot.  The film starred Tom Cruise as Reacher and was presumably intended to be a tent-pole for a film series.  However, due to its lackluster run at the North American Box office, it was initially reported that a sequel would be unlikely.[tpl]cite web|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Tom Cruise's 'Jack Reacher' Unlikely to Get Sequel|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruises-jack-reacher-sequel-412465|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=December 9, 2013|date=January 14, 2013[/tpl] In February 2013, though, a sequel became more likely after the first film's gross surpassed $200 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=JACK REACHER Sequel Possibly in the Works at Paramount and Skydance|url=http://collider.com/jack-reacher-sequel/|work=Collider.com|accessdate=December 9, 2013|date=February 22, 2013[/tpl] In December 2013, it was announced that Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions are moving forward with the development of a second Reacher film adapted from Never Go Back.[tpl]cite web|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|title=Jack Reacher’s Back; Tom Cruise Developing New Bestseller ‘Never Go Back’|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/jack-reachers-back-tom-cruise-developing-new-bestseller-never-go-back/|work=Deadline.com|publisher=PMC (company)[tpl]![/tpl]Penske Media Corporation|accessdate=December 9, 2013|date=December 9, 2013[/tpl]
