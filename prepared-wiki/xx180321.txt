The Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company is an Ohio based fire truck manufacturer. The company was founded in 1910 by John P Ahrens and Charles H Fox and built its first motorized fire engine in 1911. By the end of the following year production of horse-drawn fire apparatus ceased completely. Since then, over 1500 pieces of fire apparatus were built until 1977. Ahrens-Fox fire engines were recognizable by the chrome sphere on the pump that was used to hold air and smooth the outgoing pressure from the pump.
During the year 1913 only, Ahrens-Fox built a 44 HP (following then-actual rating practice) automobile. Like at rival American LaFrance, the idea was to sell these cars to bigger fire brigades as car of duty for their chiefs. Also like at ALF, it was not successful for Ahrens-Fox either, although for Ahrens-Fox the results were more consequently; there was only one model, a huge six-cylinder called the E-C Battalion Roadster. It was guaranteed to go faster than 50 MPH, and featured a four speed gearbox. A small pickup bed was added for some items that were thought to be useful for the head of a fire brigade, and which were included in the base price. Only six of this roadster-pickups were built during 1913; it seems they all stayed in Cincinnati. Then, Ahrens-Fox abandoned the idea and never returned to it. 
Today the Ahrens-Fox name is licensed to HME, Incorporated, which also manufactured Hendrickson Trucks.
The old Ahrens-Fox factory at 214 East 14th Street in Over-the-Rhine has been converted into luxury condominiums.[tpl]cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qi-pyExEXlsC&lpg=RA1-PA2&dq=christ%20hospital%20cincinnati&pg=RA1-PA122#v=onepage&q=christ%20hospital%20cincinnati&f=false | title=The New Downtown | work=Cincinnati Magazine | date=Nov 2006 | accessdate=2013-05-16 | author=Vaccariello, Linda | pages=122[/tpl]
