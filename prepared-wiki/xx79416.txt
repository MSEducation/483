[[Galactosemia]]

CATEGORIES: Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism

Galactosemia (British Galactosaemia) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects an individual's ability to metabolize the sugar galactose properly. Galactosemia follows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance that confers a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for adequate galactose degradation.  
Friedrich Goppert (1870–1927), a German Physician,  first described the disease in 1917,[tpl]cite journal |author=Goppert F. |title=Galaktosurie nach Milchzuckergabe bei angeborenem, familiaerem chronischem Leberleiden |journal=Klin Wschr |volume=54 |issue= |pages=473–7 |year=1917 [/tpl] with its cause as a defect in galactose metabolism being identified by a group led by Herman Kalckar in 1956.[tpl]cite journal |author=Isselbacher KJ, Anderson EP, Kurahashi K, Kalckar HM |title=Congenital galactosemia, a single enzymatic block in galactose metabolism |journal=Science |volume=13 |issue=123 |pages=635–6 |year=1956 |pmid=13311516 |doi=10.1126/science.123.3198.635[/tpl]
Its incidence is about 1 per 60,000 births for people of European ancestry.  In other populations the incidence rate differs. Galactosemia is ten times more common within the Irish Traveller population.[tpl]cite journal |author=Murphy M, McHugh B, Tighe O, et al. |title=Genetic basis of transferase-deficient galactosaemia in Ireland and the population history of the Irish Travellers |journal=Eur.
