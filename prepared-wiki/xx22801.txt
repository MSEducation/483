The Group of Eight (G8) was the name of a forum for the governments of a group of eight leading industrialised countries, that was originally formed by six leading industrialised countries and subsequently extended with two additional members.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-think.t_4.html|title=Thinking Ahead: The 'One-Time' G-22 Looks Useful | publisher=nyt.com | accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl] Russia, which was invited to join as the last member, was excluded from the forum by the other members on March 24, 2014, as a result of its involvement in the 2014 Crimea crisis in Ukraine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/world/europe/obama-russia-crimea.html|title=Russia Is Ousted From Group of 8 by U.S. and Allies | newspaper=The New York Times | accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Thus the group now comprises seven nations and will continue to meet as the G7 group of nations.
The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6. The summit became known as the Group of Seven or G7  the following year with the addition of Canada. The G7 is composed of the seven wealthiest developed countries on Earth (by national net wealth or by GDP[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]), and it remained active even during the period of the G8. Russia was added to the group from 1998 to 2014, which then became known as the G8. The European Union is represented within the G8 but cannot host or chair summits.The EU had the privileges and obligations of membership but does not host/chair summits. It is represented by the Commission and Council presidents.

"G8" can refer to the member states in aggregate or to the annual summit meeting of the G8 heads of government. The former term, G6, is now frequently applied to the six most populous countries within the European Union. G8 ministers also meet throughout the year, such as the G7/8 finance ministers (who meet four times a year), G8 foreign ministers, or G8 environment ministers.
Collectively, in 2012 the G8 nations comprised 50.1% of 2012 global nominal GDP and 40.9% of global GDP (PPP). Each calendar year the responsibility of hosting the G8 is rotated through the member states in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The holder of the presidency sets the agenda, hosts the summit for that year, and determines which ministerial meetings will take place. Both France and the United Kingdom have expressed a desire to expand the group to include five developing countries, referred to as the Outreach Five (O5) or the Plus Five: Brazil (7th country in the world by nominal GDP ), People's Republic of China (2nd country in the world by GDP ), India (10th country in the world by GDP [tpl]cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc |title=GDP (current US$) | Data | Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]), Mexico, and South Africa. These countries have participated as guests in meetings which are sometimes called G8+5.
With the G-20 major economies growing in stature since the 2008 Washington summit, world leaders from the group announced at their Pittsburgh summit on September 25, 2009, that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/24/us.g.twenty.summit/index.html|title=Officials: G-20 to supplant G-8 as international economic council |publisher=CNN|date=2009-09-25|accessdate=2009-09-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1099172/G20-to-replace-the-G8|title=G20 to replace the G8|publisher=SBS|date=2009-09-26|accessdate=2009-09-26[/tpl]

==History==

The concept of a forum for the world's major industrialized countries emerged prior the 1973 oil crisis. On Sunday, March 25, 1973, Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and Britain (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. When running the idea past President Nixon, he noted that he would be out of town, and offered use of the White House; the meeting was subsequently held in the library on the ground floor.Shultz, George P., Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, 1993, p. 148  ISBN 0-684-19325-6 Taking their name from the setting, this original group of four became known as the "Library Group".Bayne, Nicholas et al. (2000). Hanging in There, p. 34. In mid-1973, at the World Bank-IMF meetings, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan to the original four nations, who agreed.Shultz, ibid. The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the "Group of Five."Farnsworth, Clyde H. "A Secret Society of Finance Ministers," New York Times.'' May 8, 1977.
The year that followed was one of the most turbulent of the post World War II era, The heads of state or government of the top ten industrial nations fell due to illness or scandal. There were two elections in the UK, two Chancellors of West Germany, three presidents of France, three Prime Ministers of Japan and Italy, two US Presidents and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada was forced into an early election. Of the members of the "Group of Five", all were new to the job with the exception of Prime Minister Trudeau.
As 1975 dawned, Schmidt and Giscard were now heads of government in their respective countries, and since they both spoke fluent English, it occurred to them that they, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and US President Gerald Ford could get together in an informal retreat and discuss election results and the issues of the day. So, in the late spring, President Giscard invited the heads of government from West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States to a summit in Château de Rambouillet; the annual meeting of the six leaders was organized under a rotating presidency, forming the Group of Six (G6). The following year, with Wilson out as Prime Minister of Britain, Schmidt and Ford felt an English speaker with more experience was needed, so Canada's Pierre Trudeau was invited to join the group   G8: The Most Exclusive Club in the World, Thomas S. Axworthy, The Canadian Encyclopedia, Historica Foundation of Canada, Toronto, Undated.Accessed07-12-2008. and the group became the Group of Seven (G7). The European Union is represented by the President of the European Commission and the leader of the country that holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The President of the European Commission has attended all meetings since first invited by the United Kingdom in 1977[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.Harry.g8.php| title = EU and the G8| accessdate = 2006-07-17| publisher = European Union|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226041143/http%3A//www.deljpn.ec.europa.eu/union/showpage_en_union.Harry.g8.php |archivedate = December 26, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] and the Council President now also regularly attends.
Following 1994's G7 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7 after the group's summits. This informal arrangement was dubbed the Political 8 (P8) – or, colloquially, the G7+1. At the invitation of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and President of the United States Bill Clinton,"Russia — Odd Man Out in the G-8", Mark Medish, The Globalist, 02-24-2006.Accessed: 07-12-2008 President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, later as a full participant. It was seen as a way to encourage Yeltsin with his capitalist reforms. Russia formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight, or G8.

===Food===

A major focus of the G8 since 2009 has been the global supply of food.[tpl]cite news|title=Cash-strapped G8 looks to private sector in hunger fight|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/g8-food-idUSL1E8GHE3520120518|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=18 May 2012[/tpl] At the 2009 L'Aquila summit, the G8's members promised to contribute $20 billion to the issue over three years.[tpl]cite news|last=Lief|first=Eric|title=Funding Food Security - A Financial Lens on the L’Aquila G8|url=http://www.stimson.org/spotlight/funding-food-security-a-financial-lens-on-the-laquila-g8/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Spotlight|date=15 September 2012[/tpl] Since then, only 22% of the promised funds have been delivered.[tpl]cite news|title=G8 leaders urged to live up to nutrition commitments|url=http://www.farminguk.com/news/G8-leaders-urged-to-live-up-to-nutrition-commitments_23529.html|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Farming UK|date=18 May 2012[/tpl]

===Crimean crisis and Russian suspension===

On March 2, 2014, the remaining non-Russian G8 members, the European Union, and the European Commission suspended the planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi and would instead meet as the G7 in Brussels,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-disturbing-g7-decision/article5836217.ece | title=A disturbing G7 decision | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=31 March 2014[/tpl] blaming Russia's role in the Crimean crisis.[tpl]cite news|title=Russia not suspended from G8: Merkel|url=http://thebricspost.com/russia-not-suspended-from-g8-merkel/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=The BRICS Post|date=19 March 2014[/tpl] Following the suspension of the summit, on March 18 the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius claimed that Russia was suspended from the G8; however, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal[tpl]cite news|title=Russia not suspended from G8 - French Foreign Ministry spokesman Read more: http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_03_18/Russia-not-suspended-from-G8-French-Foreign-Ministry-6347/|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_03_18/Russia-not-suspended-from-G8-French-Foreign-Ministry-6347/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=Voice of Russia|date=18 March 2014[/tpl] clarified that Russia would remain a G8 member, and only the meeting would be suspended.
While visiting Kiev, Ukraine on March 22, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that he supports expelling Russia from the G8 and expects to discuss the potential expulsion with other G7 leaders at an upcoming meeting in The Hague.[tpl]cite news|last=Parry|first=Tom|title=Stephen Harper says he'll push for Russia's expulsion from the G8|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-says-he-ll-push-for-russia-s-expulsion-from-the-g8-1.2583034|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=22 March 2014[/tpl] On March 24, G8 leaders met formally in The Hague, without Russia being present, and voted to officially suspend Russia's membership in the G8. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stated earlier that day that the G8 was an informal organization and membership was optional for Russia.

==Structure and activities==

By design, the G8 deliberately lacks an administrative structure like those for international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Bank. The group does not have a permanent secretariat, or offices for its members.
The presidency of the group rotates annually among member countries, with each new term beginning on 1 January of the year. The rotation order is: France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html|title=What is the G8?|author=G8 Research Group|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=2014-03-08[/tpl] The country holding the presidency is responsible for planning and hosting a series of ministerial-level meetings, leading up to a mid-year summit attended by the heads of government. The president of the European Commission participates as an equal in all summit events.Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan): Summit Meetings in the Past; European Union: "EU and the G8"
The ministerial meetings bring together ministers responsible for various portfolios to discuss issues of mutual or global concern. The range of topics include health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice and interior, terrorism, and trade. There are also a separate set of meetings known as the G8+5, created during the 2005 Gleneagles, Scotland summit, that is attended by finance and energy ministers from all eight member countries in addition to the five "outreach countries" which are also known as the Group of Five — Brazil, People's Republic of China, India, Mexico, and South Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.groupoffive.org/ |title=G5 Overview; Evolución del Grupo de los Cinco |publisher=Groupoffive.org |accessdate=2010-06-27[/tpl]

===Global energy===

At the Heiligendamm Summit in 2007, the G8 acknowledged a proposal from the EU for a worldwide initiative on efficient energy use. They agreed to explore, along with the International Energy Agency, the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 along with China, India, South Korea and the European Community established the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation, at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan holding 2008 G8 Presidency, in Aomori.The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC). June 8, 2008.
G8 Finance Ministers, whilst in preparation for the 34th Summit of the G8 Heads of State and Government in Toyako, Hokkaido, met on the 13 and 14 June 2008, in Osaka, Japan. They agreed to the “G8 Action Plan for Climate Change to Enhance the Engagement of Private and Public Financial Institutions.” In closing, Ministers supported the launch of new Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) by the World Bank, which will help existing efforts until a new framework under the UNFCCC is implemented after 2012. The UNFCCC is not on track to meeting any of its stated goals.[tpl]cite news|title=G8 Finance Ministers Support Climate Investment Funds|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/g8-finance-ministers-support-climate-investment-funds/|newspaper=IISD - Climate Change Policy & Practice|date=14 June 2008[/tpl]

===Annual summit===

==Member facts==

These G8 countries represent:

===With G8+5 and the G20===

==Cumulative influence of member nations==

Together the eight countries making up the G8 represent about 14% of the world population, but they represent about 60% of the World wealth and 60% of the gross world product[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.undp.org |title=United Nations Development Programme |publisher=Undp.org |accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl] as measured by gross domestic product, all eight nations being within the top 12 countries according to the CIA World Factbook. (see the CIA World Factbook column in List of countries by GDP (nominal)), the majority of global military power (seven are in the top 8 nations for military expenditure[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/spending.htm|title=World Wide Military Expenditures|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl]), and almost all of the world's active nuclear weapons. In 2007, the combined G8 military spending was US$850 billion. This is 72% of the world's total military expenditures. (see List of countries and federations by military expenditures) Four of the G8 members, the United Kingdom, United States, France and Russia, together account for 96–99% of the world's nuclear weapons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/nuclearweapons/nukestatus.html |title=Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl] (see List of states with nuclear weapons)

==Criticism==

Some criticism centres on the assertion that members of G8 do not do enough to help global problems such as Third World Debt, global warming and the AIDS epidemic—due to strict medicine patent policy and other issues related to globalization. In Unravelling Global Apartheid, the political analyst Titus Alexander described the G7, as it then was, as the 'cabinet' of global minority rule, with a coordinating role in world affairs.[tpl]cite book|last=Alexander|first=titus|title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: an overview of world politics|publisher=Polity Press|year=1996|pages=212–213[/tpl]
The conservative Heritage Foundation has criticized the G8 for advocating food security without making room for economic freedom.[tpl]cite news|last=Miller|first=Terry|title=G8 Food Security Agenda Should Encourage Greater Privatisation.|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/05/g8-food-security-agenda-should-encourage-greater-economic-freedom|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Heritage Foundation|date=17 May 2012[/tpl]

==Relevance==

The G8's relevance is unclear.[tpl]cite news|last=Lee|first=Don|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/06/world/fg-summit6|title=On eve of summit, G-8's relevance is unclear|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 6, 2008[/tpl] Critics argue that the G8 has now become unrepresentative of the world's most powerful economies. In particular, China has surpassed every economy but the United States,[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/16/news/international/japan_china/index.htm?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=China marches towards world's No. 2 economy | date=August 16, 2010[/tpl] while Brazil has surpassed Canada and Italy (according to the IMF). Also according to the International Monetary Fund and the CIA World Factbook, India has already surpassed Canada, Italy, Germany, France, and Japan in terms of purchasing power parity, although remaining on the 10th position when it comes to Real GDP. This has given rise to the idea of enlarging G8 to the G8+5, which includes these other economically powerful nations. Other critics assert, however, that the concept of a country's net wealth is different from the nation's GDP.
With Vladimir Putin not attending the 2012 G8 summit at Camp David, there is an argument[tpl]by whom|date=March 2014[/tpl] that the summit has generally outlived its usefulness as a viable international gathering of foreign leaders.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/14/welcome_to_the_new_world_order| title=Welcome to the New World Disorder| work=Foreign Policy| first=Ian| last=Bremmer| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16[/tpl] As a result of that decision, one Foreign Policy magazine contributor stated that Russia should be deleted from the G8 altogether.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/15/kick_russia_out_of_the_g_8| title=Kick Russia Out of the G-8| work=Foreign Policy| first=Anders| last=Aslund| date=May 15, 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://eurasia.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/15/putin_s_g8_snub_could_keep_the_us_and_russia_talking| title=Putin's G-8 snub could keep the U.S. and Russia talking| work=Foreign Policy| first=Ian| last=Bremmer| date=May 15, 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16[/tpl] However, another FP contributor commented that the G8 is still relevant, despite the increasing international power and prestige of the G-20 major economies leaders' summit.[tpl]cite news| url=http://bosco.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/16/three_cheers_for_homogeneity| title=Three cheers for homogeneity| work=Foreign Policy| first=David| last=Bosco| date=May 16, 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16[/tpl]

“Some people ask, does the G8 still matter, when we have a Group of 20? My answer is, yes. The G8 is a group of like-minded countries that share a belief in free enterprise as the best route to growth. As eight countries making up about half the world’s gross domestic product, the standards we set, the commitments we make, and the steps we take can help solve vital global issues, fire up economies and drive prosperity all over the world.”
