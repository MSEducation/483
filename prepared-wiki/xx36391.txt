Lascelles Abercrombie (also known as the Georgian Laureate, linking him with the "Georgian poets") (9 January 1881 – 27 October 1938) was a British poet and literary critic, one of the "Dymock poets".  He was born in Ashton upon MerseyChambers Biographical Dictionary, ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 4 and educated at Malvern College,Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature (1995) Merriam-Webster Inc. p.3. ISBN 978-0-87779-042-6 and at Owens College.
Before the First World War, he lived for a time at Dymock in Gloucestershire, part of a community that included Rupert Brooke and Robert Frost. Edward Thomas also visited. During these early years, he worked as a journalist, and he started his poetry writing. His first book Interludes and Poems (1908), followed by Mary and the Bramble (1910), and the poem Deborah, and finally the books Emblems of Love (1912) and Speculative Dialogues (1913). 
During World War I, he served as a munitions examiner, after which, he was appointed  to the first lectureship in poetry at the University of Liverpool. In 1922 he was appointed Professor of English at the University of Leeds in preference to J. R. R. Tolkien, with whom he shared, as author of The Epic (1914), a professional interest in heroic poetry.Humphrey Carpenter, J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography, 1977, 114. In 1929 he moved on to the University of London, and in 1935 to a prestigious readership at Oxford University.  He wrote a series of works on the nature of poetry, including The Idea of Great Poetry (1925) and Romanticism (1926). Abercrombie repeated in volume after volume the same view of the nature of poetry -- that it is the representation of the poet's own imaginative experience, conveyed by literary technique to the reader, in whom the same experience is then replicated. The lack of a discussion of such topics in English universities at the time meant that the limitations in this view were not pointed out, and Abercrombie lacked the stimulus of a critical response that would have helped him to amend and develop his theory. His critical studies of Hardy (1912) and Wordsworth (published posthumously) belonged to a much more familiar genre, and were remembered longer.
He also published several volumes of original verse, largely metaphysical poems in dramatic form, and a number of verse plays. His poems and plays were collected in 'Poems' (1930). In the same year he published separately his most ambitious poem, 'The Sale of Saint Thomas' in six 'Acts'.  A number of fellow poets and professors of literature (including Oliver Elton, Charles Williams and Una Ellis-Fermor) See See Oliver Elton, ‘Lascelles Abercrombie 1881-1938’, Proceedings of the Royal Academy 25 (1939), and Charles Williams, Poetry at Present (Oxford, 1930). In a letter of 1944 (cited by C.L. Sastri, Abercrombie’s Poems, Waltair 1971, 170-1) Una Ellis-Fermor described Abercrombie as ‘one of the finest metaphysical and religious poets of the country and this century’.  admired the sublimity of his themes and his ability to clothe metaphysical thought in vivid imagery.
Abercrombie is remembered today less for his writings than because of his close friendship with Edward Marsh, Rupert Brooke, and other 'Georgian' poets.
He was the brother of the architect Patrick Abercrombie and the father of the phonetician David Abercrombie and the cell biologist Michael Abercrombie.  A grandson, Jeff Cooper, produced an admirable bibliography of his grandfather, with brief but important notes, while a great-grandson of the poet is the author Joe Abercrombie.
