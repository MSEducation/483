==History==

The Landhi Dairy Colony (LDC), located in the suburbs of Karachi. It was established in 1958 within an area of [tpl]convert|752|acre|km2[/tpl] for 15,000 animals.
But, today it has about 1,500 farms spread over [tpl]convert|1600|acre|km2[/tpl]. It has a dairy animals population of about 400,000 (around 95% buffaloes and 5% cows, as well as an unknown number of sheep and goats), with a daily yield of about four million litres of milk and 7,200 tones of dung making it world's largest dairy colony. Buffaloes are the biggest source of milk here, just as they are in rest of Pakistan. Individual farmers often own up to 200 animals each (2010)
The majority of the milking animals in LDC are kept only for one lactation phase and consequently approximately 10 to 12 percent of the population is replaced every month. After the lactation period the majority of the animals are sold to breeders or for slaughter and only a few are kept by the dairy farmers for re-breeding. Most of the animals are brought to and from the animal rich districts of Punjab and Sindh.
 And it is Also Known as largest cattle colony of Asia

==Waste to energy project==

The first gobar gas-fired power plant (25 MW) in Landhi Bhains Colony is on the cards. This will not only take care of a part of Colony dung - turning a negative feature into a positive one - but also yield 1,500 tons of natural fertilizer daily.
The project will resolve a significant environmental problem and simultaneously produce badly needed electricity in the city of Karachi, which is an immediate and pressing need. The importance and scale of the project is underscored by the inauguration of the project by H.E. Mr. Phil Goff, Minister for Trade, Government of New Zealand together with the Karachi City Nazim, Syed Mustafa Kamal
On 15 April 2007 the inauguration of a project to convert the animal waste to fuel and fertiliser took place. The cattle produce 7,200 tons of waste per day, the lack of treatment caused enormous problems. The project prevented the dumping of waste in the sea and instead used the dung to produce methane gas for power generation (25 MW) as well as producing 1,400 tons of dried fertiliser per day.INAUGURATION_OF_LANDHI_CATTLE_COLONY_WASTE
The project was inaugurated by Phil Goff, the New Zealand Minister of Trade and the Karachi City nazim, Syed Mustafa Kamal. The project provides badly needed electricity to the city of Karachi as well as eliminating the environmental problems that had been caused by the waste.
