The Cayman Islands ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|ən[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|k|eɪ|'|m|æ|n[/tpl]) are a British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean Sea. The territory comprises the three islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica. The Cayman Islands are considered to be part of the geographic Western Caribbean Zone as well as the Greater Antilles. The territory is a major world offshore financial centre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html|title=Tax me if you can.

==History==

The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including pirates, refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from Oliver Cromwell's army in Jamaica.Robert Bauman, The Complete Guide to Offshore Residency (2007, ISBN 0-9789210-9-7), p. 115
The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.Keith Thompson, Life in The Caribbean (2010, ISBN 9987-16-015-8), p. 152
England took formal control of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the Treaty of Madrid of 1670. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the Governor of Jamaica in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html |title=Cayman Islands History |publisher=Gocayman.ky |date= |archivedate=2008-10-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012073753/http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html[/tpl] Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being slaves. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1834. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 slaves owned by 116 Caymanian families.The Cayman Islands Annual Report 1988 (Cayman Islands, 1988), p. 127
The islands continued to be governed as part of the Colony of Jamaica until 1962, when they became a separate Crown colony while Jamaica became an independent Commonwealth realm.Graeme R. Newman, Crime and Punishment Around the World: Africa and the Middle East, (2010, ISBN 0-313-35133-3), p. 82
The Cayman Islands historically have been a tax-exempt destination. On 8 February 1794, the Caymanians rescued the crews of a group of ten merchant ships, including HMS Convert, an incident that has since become known as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas.Lawson Wood, The Cayman Islands (2007, ISBN 1-84537-897-0), p. 12 Legend has it that King George III rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity, as one of the ships carried a member of the King's own family, his son Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. While this remains a popular legend, the story is not true.[tpl]Harvnb|Zayas|1914[/tpl]
However, whatever the history, in practice the government of the Cayman Islands has always relied on indirect and not direct taxes. The islands have never levied income tax, capital gains tax, or any wealth tax, making them a popular tax haven.Rajiv Biswas, International Tax Competition: A Developing Country Perspective (Commonwealth Secretariat, 2002, ISBN 0-85092-688-2, 2002), p. 38
On 11–12 September 2004 the island of Grand Cayman, which lies largely unprotected at sea level, was hit by Hurricane Ivan, creating an 8-ft storm surge which flooded many areas of Grand Cayman. An estimated 83% of the dwellings on the island were damaged including 4% requiring complete reconstruction. A reported 70% of all dwellings suffered severe damage from flooding or wind. Another 26% sustained minor damage from partial roof removal, low levels of flooding, or impact with floating or wind driven hurricane debris.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1143%2C5067689&_dad=portal&_schema=portal |title=Hurricane Ivan Remembered |publisher=Hazard Management Cayman Islands |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] Power, water and communications were disrupted for months in some areas, as Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the islands in 86 years.Keith Thompson, Caribbean Islands: The Land and the People (2010, ISBN 9987-16-018-2), p. 152 Grand Cayman began a major rebuilding process and within two years, its infrastructure was nearly returned to pre-hurricane status. Due to the tropical location of the islands, more hurricane or tropical systems have affected the Cayman Islands than any other region in the Atlantic basin; it has been brushed or directly hit, on average, every 2.23 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/caymanislands.htm |title=Grand Cayman's history with tropical systems |publisher=Hurricanecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Cayman Islands are in the western Caribbean Sea and are the peaks of a massive underwater ridge, known as the Cayman Ridge (or Cayman Rise). This ridge flanks the Cayman Trough, [tpl]convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] deepCayman Islands, World Resources Institute which lies [tpl]convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the south.Phillippe G.

All three islands were formed by large coral heads covering submerged ice age peaks of western extensions of the Cuban Sierra Maestra range and are mostly flat. One notable exception to this is The Bluff on Cayman Brac's eastern part, which rises to [tpl]convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, the highest point on the islands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/highlow.htm |title=World Atlas Highest and Lowest points |work=web page |publisher=Graphic Maps |accessdate=23 October 2011 [/tpl]

===Fauna===

The mammalian species in the islands include the introduced Central American agouti[tpl]MSW3 Hystricognathi | id = 13400244 | page = 1558[/tpl] and eight species of bats. At least three now extinct native rodent species were present up until the discovery of the islands by Europeans. A number of cetaceans are found in offshore waters.
Cayman avian fauna includes two endemic subspecies of Amazona parrots: Amazona leucocephala hesterna, or Cayman Brac parrot, native only to Cayman Brac, and Amazona leucocephala caymanensis or Grand Cayman parrot, which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of Cuba, and the Isla de la Juventud.

===Climate===

The Cayman Islands have a tropical marine climate, with a wet season of warm, rainy summers (May to October) and a dry season of relatively cool winters (November to April).[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Koppen Climate numbers and descriptions are generally used|date=July 2011[/tpl]
A major natural hazard is the tropical cyclones that form during the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November.
On 11 and 12 September 2004, Hurricane Ivan struck the Cayman Islands. The storm resulted in two deaths, and caused great damage to the infrastructure on the islands. The total economic impact of the storms was estimated to be $3.4 billion.Boxall, Simon. "Hurricane Ivan Remembered". Cayman Prepared. 9 September 2008. Web. 22 April 2012. .

The government's primary source of income is indirect taxation: there is no income tax, capital gains tax, or corporation tax. An import duty of 5% to 22% (automobiles 29.5% to 100%) is levied against goods imported into the islands. Few goods are exempt; notable exemptions include books, cameras, and infant formula.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
On 15 July 2012 the Cayman Islands premier McKeeva Bush announced the intended introduction of a "community enhancement fee" in the form of a payroll tax to be paid solely by expatriate workers. Caymanians themselves were to remain exempt from this tax. This would have been the first direct tax on income in the Cayman Islands' history.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.compasscayman.com/caycompass/2012/07/26/Government-announces-expat-tax/ |title=Government announces expat tax Pension contributions involved |publisher=Caymanian Compass |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] Bush also announced a five percent fee on "certain categories of employment" to be payable by businesses.

===Financial services industry===

The Cayman Islands are a major international financial centre. The biggest sectors are "banking, hedge fund formation and investment, structured finance and securitisation, captive insurance, and general corporate activities".United States Government Accountability Office (2008). GAO Report to the Chairman and Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, p. 7. Regulation and supervision of the financial services industry is the responsibility of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA).
The Cayman Islands are the fifth-largest banking centre in the world,Places in the sun. (2007, 24 February). The Economist, no. 382 (8517 suppl.), 3–5. with $1.5 trillion in banking liabilities. There are 279 banks ([tpl]As of|2008|06|lc=on[/tpl]), 19 of which are licensed to conduct banking activities with domestic (Cayman-based) and international clients, the remaining 260 are licensed to operate on an international basis with only limited domestic activity. Financial services generated CI$1.2 billion of GDP in 2007 (55% of the total economy), 36% of all employment and 40% of all government revenue. In 2010, the country ranked fifth internationally in terms of value of liabilities booked in the Cayman Islands and sixth in terms of assets booked. It has branches of 40 of the world's 50 largest banks. The Cayman Islands are the second largest captive domicile (Bermuda is largest) in the world with more than 700 captives, writing more than US$7.7 billion of premiums and with US$36.8 billion of assets under management.Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (11 July 2008), Regulatory Framework: Statistics[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl].

Starting in the mid-late 1990s, offshore financial centres, such as the Cayman Islands, came under increasing pressure from the OECD for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Cayman Islands and other financial centres on a "black list" and impose sanctions against them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/schemes/cayman.html |title=Haven or havoc? |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl] However, the Cayman Islands successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list in 2000 by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.
In 2004, under pressure from the UK, the Cayman Islands agreed in principle to implement the European Union Savings Directive (EUSD), but only after securing some important benefits for the financial services industry in the Cayman Islands. As the Cayman Islands are not subject to EU laws, the implementation of the EUSD is by way of bilateral agreements between each EU member state and the Cayman Islands. The government of the Cayman Islands agreed on a model agreement, which set out how the EUSD would be implemented with the Cayman Islands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ask.bm/uploaded/Publication/641_File_5.pdf |title=Guide to the EU Savings Directive |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl]
A report published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in March 2005, assessing supervision and regulation in the Cayman Islands' banking, insurance and securities industries, as well as its money laundering regime, recognised the jurisdiction's comprehensive regulatory and compliance frameworks. "An extensive program of legislative, rule and guideline development has introduced an increasingly effective system of regulation, both formalizing earlier practices and introducing enhanced procedures", noted IMF assessors. The report further stated that "the supervisory system benefits from a well-developed banking infrastructure with an internationally experienced and qualified workforce as well as experienced lawyers, accountants and auditors", adding that, "the overall compliance culture within Cayman is very strong, including the compliance culture related to AML (anti-money laundering) obligations".International CooperationMoney Laundering in the Cayman Islands: A Global Perspective, Cayman Financial Review, Third Quarter, 2010

===Labour===

The Cayman Islands have small population and therefore a limited work force. Work permits may therefore be granted to foreigners. On average, there have been more than 21,000 foreigners holding valid work permits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eso.ky/pages.php?page=immigrationdata |title=Work Permit Stats |publisher=Eso.ky |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl] thumb|Jamaican-born roadside woodcarver working outside Bodden Town

====Work permits for non-citizens====

In order to work in the Cayman Islands as a non-citizen, a work permit is required. This involves passing a police background check and a health check. A prospective immigrant worker will not be granted a permit unless certain medical conditions are present which include testing negative for syphilis or HIV. A permit may be granted to individuals on special work.
A foreigner must first have a job in order to move to the Cayman Islands. The employer applies and pays for the work permit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page?_pageid=1142,1592726&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=C.I.

The Cayman Islands presently imposes a controversial "rollover" in relation to expatriate workers who require a work permit. Non-Caymanians are only permitted to reside and work within the territory for a maximum of seven years unless they satisfy the criteria of key employees. Non-Caymanians who are 'rolled over' may return to work additional 7-year periods subject to a 1-year gap between their periods of work. The policy has been the subject of some controversy within the press. Law firms have been particularly upset by the recruitment difficulties that it has caused.Row brews over rollover[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl], 22 January 2007, Cayman net News Other less well remunerated employment sectors have been affected as well. Concerns about safety have been expressed by diving instructors and realtors have also expressed concerns. Others support the rollover as necessary to protect Caymanian identity in the face of large immigration of expatriate workers.Government takes up permit issue, Editorial, 5 March 2006, Camanian Compass
Concerns have been expressed that in the long term, the policy may damage the preeminence of the Cayman Islands as an offshore financial centre by making it difficult to recruit and retain experienced staff from onshore financial centres. Government employees are no longer exempt from this "rollover" policy according to this report in a local newspaper.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.caycompass.com/cgi-bin/CFPnews.cgi?ID=1024210 |title = Cayman Islands – Cay Compass News Online – Rollover for civil servants |accessdate = 2008-06-23[/tpl] The governor has used his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control for the disposition of civil service employees to determine which expatriate civil servants are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
This policy is incorporated in the Immigration Law (2003 revision), written by the United Democratic Party government, and subsequently enforced by the People's Progressive Movement Party government. Both governments agree to the term limits on foreign workers, and the majority of Caymanians also agree it is necessary to protect local culture and heritage from being eroded by a large number of foreigners gaining residency and citizenship.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.caymanobserver.com/viewarticle.cfm?id=36&Section=LocalNews |title = Cayman Observer |accessdate = 2008-06-23[/tpl]

The Constitution empowers the Governor to withhold Royal Assent in cases where the legislation appears to him or her to be repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution or affects the rights and privileges of the Legislative Assembly or the Royal Prerogative, or matters reserved to the Governor by article 55.Constitution article 78 The executive authority of the Cayman Islands is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Government, consisting of the Governor and the Cabinet.Constitution article 43 There is an office of the Deputy Governor, who must be a Caymanian and have served in a senior public office. The Deputy Governor is the Acting Governor when the office of Governor is vacant, or the Governor is not able to discharge his duties or is absent from the Cayman Islands.Constitution article 35 The current Governor of the Cayman Islands is Her Excellency Helen Kilpatrick, CBE, and the current Deputy Governor is Franz Manderson, MBE.
The Cabinet is composed of two official members and seven elected members, called ministers; one of whom is designated Premier.
The official members are the Deputy Governor and the Attorney General. They are appointed by the governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Legislative Assembly, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote.
The seven ministers are voted into office by the 18 elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands. One of the ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed premier by the governor.
After consulting the premier, the governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet member. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all ministers are obliged to support in the Assembly any measures approved by Cabinet.
Almost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board and the Health Insurance Commission.
Since 2000, there have been two official major political parties: United Democratic Party (UDP) and the People's Progressive Movement (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for an office still run as independents.

===Defence and law enforcement===

The defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. Law enforcement in the country is provided chiefly by the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service and the Cayman Islands Customs Department. These two agencies cooperate in aspects of law enforcement, including their joint marine unit. The Cayman Islands Cadet Corps was formed in March 2001 and carries out military-type training with teenage citizens of the country.Full details of the service here http://www.cicadetcorps.ky.

===Taxation===

No direct taxation is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$25.00 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caymanislands.ky/vacation_essentials/entry_requirements.aspx |title=Cayman Islands – Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, Travel and Tourism Site |publisher=Caymanislands.ky |date=23 January 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl]

===Foreign relations===

Foreign policy is controlled by the United Kingdom, as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and Jamaica, in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the United States has developed.
Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and money laundering. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.
Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either in the United Nations or in most other international organisations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being an associate member of Caricom and UNESCO, and a member of a sub-bureau of Interpol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/United-Kingdom |title=United Kingdom / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home - INTERPOL |publisher=Interpol.int |date=30 December 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl]
The defence and internal security of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.
