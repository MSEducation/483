Old San Juan ([tpl]lang-es|Viejo San Juan or San Juan Antiguo[/tpl]) is the oldest settlement within Puerto Rico and is the historic colonial section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1972 as "Zona Histórica de San Juan" (San Juan Historic Site), and declared a National Historic Landmark District in March 2013.

==Location==

Old San Juan is located on a small and narrow island which lies in the north coast, about [tpl]convert|35|mi|km[/tpl] from the east end of Puerto Rico, and is united to the mainland of Puerto Rico by the three bridges. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and to the south by San Juan Bay or "Bahia de San Juan" which lies between the city and the mainland. On a bluff about [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] high at the west end of the island and commanding the entrance to the harbor rise the battlements of Fort San Felipe del Morro, in which there is a lighthouse. 
The "Caño de San Antonio" lies also in South Coast and extends to the Southeast where the island of Old San Juan connects to the mainland through Santurce by three bridges, "Puente Dos Hermanos" (Ashford Avenue), "Puente G. Esteves" (Ponce de León Avenue) and "Puente San Antonio" (Fernández Juncos Avenue).
The city is characterized by its narrow, blue cobblestone streets and flat-roofed brick and stone buildings dating back to the 16th and 17th century when Puerto Rico was a Spanish possession. Near Fort San Felipe del Morro is the Casa Blanca, a palace on land which belonged to the family of Ponce de Leon.

==History==

In 1508, Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement, Caparra "Guaynabo—Encyclopædia Britannica" (with history of Puerto Rico), Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006, Britannica.com webpage: EB-Guaynabo-Puerto-Rico: names: Caparra, the first Spanish settlement of Puerto Rico (1508). (named after the Province of Cáceres, Spain, birthplace of the then-governor of Spain's Caribbean territories, Nicolás de Ovando). The ruins of Caparra are known as the Pueblo Viejo sector of Guaynabo, behind the almost land-locked harbor just to the west of the present San Juan metropolitan area. In 1509, the settlement was abandoned and moved to a site which was called at the time "Puerto Rico" (meaning "rich port" or "good port"), a name that evoked that of a similar geographical harbor in the island of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. In 1521, the name "San Juan" was added, and the newer settlement was given its formal name of "San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico", following the usual custom of christening the town with both its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the islands, honoring John the Baptist. Constructed in 1521, Casa Blanca served as the first fortification of the settlement and residence of Juan Ponce de León descendants, until the mid eighteenth century.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] San Juan: Historia Illustrada de su desarrollo urbano, 1508-1898 - Aníbal Sepúlveda Rivera.

Prior to the 19th century the area outside the city walls occupying the east side of Old San Juan Island, was almost uninhabited.  In 1838 the so-called area of Puerta de Tierra or “Land Gate” had a population of only 168 residents mainly of African descent.[ref]
</ref> According to another census made in 1846, the population had risen to 223 inhabitants and there were a total of 58 houses. On March 3, 1865, the municipal government of San Juan, approved a resolution promoting the city expansion across the land of Puerta de Tierra which included the plan for demolishing the city walls along the east side.<ref>
