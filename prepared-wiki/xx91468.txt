===Early career===

Maguire began his career on the UK Tour in 1998, at the time the second-level professional tour.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/players.php?ID=29&season=1997/1998 | title=Stephen Maguire - Season 1997/1998 | accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl] He almost qualified for the 2000 World Championships, leading eventual semi-finalist Joe Swail 9–6 in the final qualifying round before losing 9–10,Sporting Life: Joe Swail profile (Archive but first served notice of his true potential by knocking out Stephen Lee in the first round of the UK Championship in 2002.
Maguire was the surprise winner of the 2004 European Open. Ranked 41 in the world at the time, he beat well established top-16 player Jimmy White 9–3 in the final. It was in that same season that he qualified for the World Championship for the first time, losing 6–10 in the first round to Ronnie O'Sullivan, but O'Sullivan admitted to being impressed by Maguire's performance and tipped him to be a future World Champion.BBC Sport: O'Sullivan downs Maguire

===2004/2005===

The start of the 2004/2005 season saw Maguire establish himself as one of the game's brightest talents. He performed well at the season opening Grand Prix, reaching the quarter-finals, and things improved further at the British Open in Brighton. Maguire defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 6–1 in the semi-finals, leading O'Sullivan to claim that 'he had never seen anything like that on a snooker table before' and also rated Maguire as 'probably the best player in the world at the moment'.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4009747.stm |work=BBC Sport |title=O'Sullivan crashes out to Maguire |publisher= |date= 13 November 2004|accessdate=[/tpl] Although Maguire lost the final 6–9 to his compatriot John Higgins, he more than made up for it at the next event, the UK Championship, snooker's second biggest tournament.
The Scotsman played some superb snooker on the way to the final, beating the likes of Mark King, Mark Davis, Stephen Lee, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Steve Davis. Davis described Maguire as 'inspired',The Press: Davis hails new star while O'Sullivan was again rich in his praise for the youngster, claiming 'he could rule the game for the next ten years'.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20041228/sport/maguire-and-ding-get-masters-wild-cards.103487 |title=Maguire and Ding get Masters wild cards |work=Times of Malta |publisher= |date=28 December 2004 |accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl] In the final, Maguire blazed past David Gray with an emphatic 10–1 win.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4050259.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |title=Rampant Maguire wraps up UK title |date= 28 November 2004|accessdate=[/tpl]
The rest of the season was an anti-climax of sorts however. He lost against defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–10 in their World Championship first-round match, despite having led 9–7, but he still moved up to #3 in the world rankings.

===2006–2009===

In the 2005/2006 season, he only reached one quarter-final, showing evidence of a loss in form, especially when losing 4–13 to qualifier Marco Fu in the second round of the 2006 World Championships.
In 2007, he recorded his best run at the World Championship reaching the semi-final, where he lost 15–17 to eventual champion John Higgins having led 14–10.
Maguire again beat Shaun Murphy in the 2007 UK Championship semi-final 9–5 only to lose 2–10 against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final. In the 2008 China Open, he compiled a 147 in narrowly beating his friend Ryan Day 6–5 in the semi-finals, before edging out Shaun Murphy once again in the final by 10 frames to 9.
Despite losing at the quarter-final stage of the 2008 World Championship in another final frame decider (12–13) to Joe Perry, he became the world number 2 for the next season, his highest ever ranking having severed most of his ties the previous summer, Maguire formally left management company 110sport in the summer of 2008, but returned in October.110sport: "Maguire Signs Exciting New Three-year 110sport Deal"
The 2008/2009 season he failed to win a ranking event, but did enough to maintain his number two ranking at the end of the season by consistently reaching the later stages of tournaments. His best runs were semi-final appearances in the Shanghai Masters and UK Championship. In the Shanghai Masters he lost narrowly 5–6 against Ronnie O'Sullivan and in the UK Championship 4–9 against Shaun Murphy.

===2009/2010===

Maguire began the 2009/2010 season by winning the first event of the Pro Challenge Series beating Alan McManus 5–2 in the final.
Maguire was formally detained by Strathclyde Police on 27 August 2009, following allegations that he and countryman Jamie Burnett had colluded to produce a 9–3 victory for Maguire in their clash in the 2008 UK Championship.World Snooker News: Statement
Maguire had to withdraw from the first ranking event, the Shanghai Masters, due to shoulder injury. In the Grand Prix he won his first ranking match of the season, defeating Nigel Bond 5–3, before losing his next match 1–5 against Ding Junhui.
At the UK Championship he reached the semi-finals by defeating Michael Holt 9–6 in the first round, Stuart Bingham 9–3 in the second round and Peter Lines 9–3 in the quarter-final, before he lost again against Ding Junhui 5–9.
Maguire's first event of 2010 was the Masters. He beat Mark King 6–3 in the first round and Ryan Day 6–1 in the quarter-finals, but lost 3–6 in the semi-finals against Mark Selby.
Maguire then reached the semifinals of the Welsh Open. He defeated Dominic Dale 5–4 in the first round, Barry Hawkins 5–1 in the second round and Mark Williams 5–1 in the quarter-finals, but he lost 3–6 against defending champion Ali Carter.
He won his opening matches at the last two ranking tournament, the China Open and World Championship, but lost in the second round against Mark Allen 3–5 and Graeme Dott 6–13 respectively.

===2010/2011===

Maguire had a relatively quiet season, but he did reach the final of the Welsh Open where he led John Higgins 5–2 before being defeated 9–6. However, he followed this up by losing in the first round of the World Championship for the first time since 2005, as he was defeated by qualifier Barry Hawkins 10–9.

===2011/2012===

Maguire's season started poorly with first round exits at the opening two ranking events of the year, the Australian Goldfields Open and the Shanghai Masters.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/snooker/14218518.stm | title=Ken Doherty beats Stephen Maguire in Australian Open | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=8 December 2011 | date=20 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.masterssnooker.com/shanghai-masters-first-round-results-2011/2011/09/06/ | title=Shanghai Masters First Round Results | accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl] At the UK Championships he defeated Stephen Hendry and John Higgins to set up a quarter-final with world number seven Judd Trump, which Maguire lost 6–3.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/snooker/16097110.stm | title=Trump sinks Maguire to make semi-final | accessdate=8 December 2011 | work=BBC News | date=8 December 2011[/tpl] He made three century [tpl]Cuegloss|Break|breaks[/tpl] during the tournament, including a 144, which was the highest of the event.[tpl]cite web | url=http://asia.eurosport.com/snooker/uk-century-breaks_sto3055341/story.shtml | title=UK Championship century breaks | publisher=Eurosport | accessdate=8 December 2011[/tpl]

A quarter-final run in the Welsh Open and a first round defeat in the World Open followed, before Maguire competed in the China Open. There he made it to his second major final in as many months courtesy of wins over the likes of O'Sullivan and Stephen Lee. He played a  rejuvenated Peter Ebdon in the final and from 1–5 behind, won seven of the next ten frames to level the match at 8–8. The match went into a decider which Ebdon won to end the eight hour contest.[tpl]cite web | url=http://au.eurosport.com/snooker/ebdon-edges-maguire_sto3218584/story.shtml | title=Ebdon edges Maguire in epic final | publisher=Eurosport | date=1 April 2012 | accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl]
Maguire therefore went into the World Championship in very good form and his passage into the semi-finals was largely trouble free as he beat seventeen-year-old Luca Brecel 10–5 in the first round, Joe Perry 13–7 in the second and Stephen Hendry 13–2 in the quarter-finals, with a session to spare.[tpl]cite web | url=http://snooker.org/res/index.asp?event=102 | title=Betfred.com World Championship | publisher=Snooker.org | accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl] Maguire would unwittingly become Hendry's last ever opponent as the seven-time winner of the event retired immediately after the match.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/17917326 | title=Stephen Hendry retires after World Snooker Championship defeat | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 May 2012 | accessdate=3 May 2012[/tpl] Maguire lost his semi-final 12–17 to Ali Carter,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/17941717 | title=World Snooker Championship 2012: Ali Carter beats Maguire | publisher=BBC Sport | date=5 May 2012 | accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl] and finished the season ranked world number 4, meaning he had climbed four places during the year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/1d/b0/0,,13165~176157,00.pdf | title=Official World Ranking List for the 2012/2013 Season | accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]

==Rivalry==

Maguire has a rivalry with Shaun Murphy. In a 2004 Grand Prix match, Murphy was involved in having one of Maguire's frames forfeited. As the match was about to begin, Maguire realised he had forgotten to bring his chalk with him. He asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena.BBC Sport: Williams crashes out While he was away, Murphy spoke to the referee; the tournament director Mike Ganley was summoned and he docked Maguire a frame for not being ready to start at the scheduled time."Higginson revelling in spotlight". Sporting Life. 17 February 2007. Retrieved 10 September 2010. Archived on 16 July 2011 Maguire later won the match 5–2. Later that year, whilst playing in the final of the UK Championships, David Gray forgot his chalk. However, Maguire let him get it without a frame being docked. After beating Murphy in the 2007 Welsh Open, Maguire said, 'That put the icing on the cake, but we've always had a rivalry. I dislike him and I think he dislikes me. I try hard to beat everyone, but it would have hurt more if I'd lost to him'. After the previously mentioned 2006 World Championship match with Marco Fu, Maguire said, 'I don't want to be a fat world champion', a dig at Murphy.BBC Sport: "Quotes from The Crucible" Murphy currently leads the head-to-head 10-9.http://www.cuetracker.net/pages/h2h.php?ID1=29&ID2=4
