==Career==

===Philadelphia Phillies===

Punto was drafted in the 21st round of the 1998 MLB Draft and made his major league debut with the Philadelphia Phillies on September 9, 2001. He singled to right field off Bob Scanlan of the Montreal Expos as a pinch hitter in the 8th inning. He had 2 hits in 5 at-bats in just 4 games with the Phillies that season. In 2002 with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, he played in 115 games and hit .271, earning a selection as an International League All-Star. 
In 3 years with the Phillies he played in a total of 77 games and hit .223. His first, and only, home run with the Phillies was hit off Steve Trachsel of the New York Mets on July 10, 2003.

===Minnesota Twins===

After playing in a career-high 64 major-league games in [tpl]mlby|2003[/tpl], he was acquired by the Minnesota Twins in the [tpl]mlby|2004[/tpl] offseason (along with Carlos Silva) for Eric Milton. He started the season with the team, but he was injured twice and spent the majority of his time in 2004 on the disabled list. In [tpl]mlby|2005[/tpl], he competed for the starting job at second base, which he eventually won, and in [tpl]mlby|2006[/tpl] became the starting third baseman.
Punto was one of four Twins players nicknamed "The Piranhas" by White Sox manager, Ozzie Guillén. The other Piranhas were Jason Tyner, Jason Bartlett, and Luis Castillo. 
In 2005 Nick Punto batted .239, with a career high 4 home runs, and 26 runs batted in over the duration of 112 games.
Punto had his best full season in Minnesota during the 2006 season when he batted .290 with 45 runs batted in, and posted 17 stolen bases in 135 games.
In [tpl]mlby|2007[/tpl], Punto experienced his statistically worst full season with Minnesota, batting .210 with 25 runs batted in 150 games. He posted the lowest slugging percentage (.271) of any major league player with at least 200 at-bats in a single season. This was the lowest slugging percentage by a player with over 400 at-bats since José Lind recorded a .269 slugging percentage for the Pittsburgh Pirates in [tpl]mlby|1992[/tpl]. Punto also posted a −27.1 VORP in 2007, 8.5 runs worse than the second-worst position player in baseball, White Sox infielder Andy González. However, he has always played excellent defense and believed in his defensive abilities which the Twins are so keen on. On May 27 during an MPR broadcast Punto said, "I take too much pride in my defense to ever let (offensive struggles) affect me or affect my team. The one thing I can control is how I play defense."
After being injured most of the first half of the [tpl]mlby|2008[/tpl] season, Punto was activated from the DL on June 25, 2008 and finished the season batting .284 with 28 runs batted in.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/25/sports/BBN-Twins-Moves.php|title=Twins activate INF Punto from DL|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=March 29, 2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

After struggling as the Twins regular shortstop in 2009, Punto began losing time in the lineup to fellow Twin Brendan Harris.

He finished the season batting .228 with 38 RBI over 440 plate appearances.
Punto began the 2010 season as the Twins' starting third baseman, but ended up on the disabled list before the end of April with a strained groin muscle. Punto returned to the lineup in May, playing at third base, shortstop, and second base as injuries cropped up among other players. In July, he was essentially replaced as the starter at third base by Danny Valencia, but he continued to play regularly due to injuries to Orlando Hudson and J.J. Hardy.
