CATEGORIES: Battles and operations of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War

Operation Danny ([tpl]lang-he|מבצע דני[/tpl], Mivtza Dani) was an Israeli military offensive launched at the end of the first truce of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The objectives were to capture territory east of Tel Aviv and then to push inland and relieve the Jewish population and forces in Jerusalem. The main forces fighting against the IDF were the Arab Legion and Palestinian irregulars Chaim Herzog, 'The Arab-Israeli Wars' ISBN 0-85368-367-0 (1982). page 80: 'A blow against the Arab Legion was the essence of Operation 'Danny' planned as the main Israeli offensive to be mounted on the resumption of hostilities.'
It was launched at the end of the first truce, July 9–19, 1948. On 10 July, Glubb Pasha ordered the defending Arab Legion troops to "make arrangements...for a phony war"1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, by Benny Morris The operation was named after Danny Mass, the commander of the "Convoy of 35". The operation commander was Yigal Allon and his deputy was Yitzhak Rabin. The total force numbered around 6,000 men.Kimche, Jon and David (1960) A Clash of Destinies.

==Objectives==

The first phase of Operation Danny was to capture the cities of Lydda and Ramle, located on the road to Jerusalem, southeast of Tel Aviv. Ramle was one of the main obstacles blocking Jewish transportation.Golan, Arnon. "Lydda and Ramle: from Palestinian-Arab to Israeli towns, 1948-67," Middle Eastern Studies, October 1, 2003 From the start of the war, Lydda and Ramle militiamen had attacked Jewish traffic on nearby roads.Morris 2004, p. 424 Ramle became a focal point for blocking Jewish transportation, forcing traffic from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv to a southern bypass.Lydda and Ramle: from Palestinian-Arab to Israeli towns, 1948-67. by Golan, Arnon
The second phase was to capture the fort at Latrun and break through Ramallah. The operation was carried out under Palmach command using the Yiftach Brigade, the Harel Brigade, the 8th Armored Brigade and two battalions from the Kiryati and Alexandroni brigades.

===Lydda and Ramle===

On 9 July units from the Yiftach Brigade began approaching Ramle from the south. At the same time troops form the other brigades began attacking villages north of Lydda. Caught in a pincer movement and with only a token Arab Legion presence the two towns were captured the following day. This put Lydda airport and the strategic railway station at Ramle in Israeli hands. Two days after the capture of Lydda and Ramle only a few hundred of the 50,000 to 70,000 residents remained in the two towns.

===Latrun===

The second phase of the operation failed after several costly attacks on Arab Legion positions at Latrun and the threat of a UN-imposed cease-fire.Herzog, page 82.

===Casualties===

The Palmach record the names of ninety-one of its members killed during this Operation. Forty-four were killed at Khirbet Kurikur on 18 July 1948. Seven were killed in the capture of Lydda.http://www.palmach.org.il/show_item.asp?itemId=8519&levelId=42855&itemType=0
