Msgr. Peter Ebere Okpaleke of the clergy of Awka, Nigeria, was appointed with a Pontifical Act on the 7th of December 2012 by His Holiness as bishop of Ahiara.,Catholic news service bulletinUnwakwere Reflections on appointment of Father Okpaleke as bishop The diocese has an area of 425 square kilometres, population 620,000, Catholics 478,000, priests 127, and religious 113.
The bishop-elect was born in Amesi, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambara State, Nigeria in 1963. He studied philosophy and theology at Bigard Memorial Seminary, Ikot Ekpene and Enugu respectively and was ordained a priest in 1992. He first undertook higher studies at Catholic Institute of West Africa (CIWA) Port Harcourt and later at the Holy Cross Pontifical University in Rome where he bagged a doctorate degree in Canon Law. He has held a number of pastoral roles. Upon his return to Nigeria, he was appointed Judge at the Inter-Diocesan Tribunal of Onitsha and the Parish Priest of Sts John and Paul Parish, Umubele, Diocese of Awka. Bishop Okpaleke was consecrated as bishop of Ahiara Diocese on 21 May 2013, at Seat of Wisdom Seminary, Owerri.
Following his consecration, Bishop Okpaleke was rejected and denied possession of the Ahiara diocese by the clergy and laity of the diocese, on the ground that the process that led to his selection was flawed. They claim that his emergence was a surprise, that he was originally not among the finalists—3 priests who were from or have done pastoral work in the Ahiara diocese. Against this background the clergy and laity are demanding to be given a bishop from or who has done pastoral work in the Ahiara diocese. According to canon law, Bishop Okpalaeke had up till May 25, 2013 to take possession of the diocese, which could not be accomplished, hence rendering him a bishop without domain—a titular bishop.
Cardinal John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan, Archbishop of Abuja, has been tapped as apostolic administrator.
