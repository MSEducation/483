The 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XIX Commonwealth Games, were held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and dependencies competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time it was held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The official mascot of the Games was Shera and the official song of the Games, "Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto", was composed by celebrated Indian musician A.R. Rahman.
Preparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the slow pace of work, as well as issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations participated in the event, except Fiji, which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and Tokelau, which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals. The internationally acclaimed opening ceremony improved the image of the Games,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india |title='India has arrived': spectacular ceremony opens Commonwealth Games |publisher=The Guardian, UK |date= 3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101006004503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: India opens doors to the world at opening ceremony |work=The Telegraph |date=3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Hart| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101006045221/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending.[tpl]cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101015/sports/cgames2010_aus|title=Australia praises India's 'exceptional' Games|date=15 October 2010|agency=Agence France-Presse| accessdate=14 February 2011 [/tpl] The President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Ministry of Sports.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139|title=India should aim for Olympics: Australian Sports Minister|publisher=NDTV|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101008222034/http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139| archivedate= 8 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/Games-good-foundation-for-Olympic-bid-by-India-Rogge/articleshow/6680736.cms|title=Games good foundation for Olympic bid by India: Rogge|work=The Times of India | date=4 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that "Delhi delivered a fantastic Games".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/sports/cwg-2010/Delhi-delivered-a-fantastic-Games/newdelhi/SP-Article10-613055.aspx |title=â€˜Delhi delivered a fantastic Gamesâ€™ |work=Hindustan Times |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl] Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=Peter|last=Hanlon|title=It's time to reflect on how Delhi got it right| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101017152227/http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Bidding==

The two principal bids for the 2010 Commonwealth Games were from Delhi, India and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A ballot of members was held in November 2003 at the Commonwealth Games Federation General Assembly in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Delhi bid won by a margin of 46 votes to 22, confirming India's first successful bid for the Games.

==Organisation==

===Organising committee===

The organisation of CWG 2010 was beset by delays: in January 2010, the Indian Olympic Association vice-chairman Raja Randhir Singh expressed concern that Delhi was not up to speed in forming and organising its games committee and, following a 2009 Indian Government report showing two-thirds of venues were behind schedule, Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell stated that the slow progress of preparations represented a serious risk to the event.[tpl]cite news|title=India admits 2010 Games problems|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8256127.stm|publisher=BBC  | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010[/tpl] Singh also called for a revamp of the games' organising committees:[tpl]cite news|title=Olympic official calls for revamp of Delhi Games committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-42471320090915|agency=Reuters   | date=15 September 2009| accessdate=14 January 2011 [/tpl] Jarnail Singh,
a former Secretary of the Government of India, was appointed as the chief executive officer and Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi was appointed as head of the committee.

===Transport===

A four-lane flyway, 2.2 km stretch from Lodhi Road to trans-Yamuna, linking the Games Village to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed which reduced the travelling time between the village and the Stadium to six minutes.
In response to concerns over the large number of trains that pass by the Delhi metropolitan region daily, construction of road under-bridges and over-bridges along railway lines have been completed. To expand road infrastructure, flyovers, cloverleaf flyovers, and bridges were built to improve links for the Games and city in general. Road-widening projects were finished with an emphasis being placed on expanding national highways. To improve traffic flow on existing roads, plans were made to make both the inner and outer Ring roads signal free.
To support its commitment to mass transport, nine corridors have been identified and were constructed as High Capacity Bus Systems (for example, one from Ambedkar Nagar to Red Fort). Six of these corridors were expected to be operational in 2010. Additionally, The Delhi Metro was expanded to accommodate more people and boost the use of public transport during the 2010 games. The metro has extended to Gurgaon and the Noida area. For this large increase in the size of the network, Delhi Metro had deployed 14 tunnel boring machines.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/business/20080318/105062.htm|title=Delhi Metro deploys 'record' 14 tunnel boring machines|accessdate=14 May 2008[/tpl] Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was used to tag vehicles in venue parking lots to help organise mass parking and increase security.
Indira Gandhi International Airport was modernised, expanded, and upgraded. Costing nearly $1.95 billion, Terminal 3 has increased airport passenger capacity to more than 37 million passengers a year by 2010. A new runway has been constructed, allowing for more than 75 flights an hour. At more than 4400 metres long, it is one of Asia's longest. The airport has been connected to the city via a six-lane expressway (Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway) and the $580 million Delhi Airport Metro Express line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newdelhiairport.in/ |title=Indira Gandhi International Airport |publisher=Newdelhiairport.in |accessdate=14 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101030122648/http://www.newdelhiairport.in/| archivedate= 30 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Green Games===

The organisers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme to show the intention to host a "sustainable games" and to take the environment into consideration when constructing and renovating venues. Thyagaraj Stadium is intended to be a key example of environmentally considered construction.
In opposition to this intention, a number of environmental controversies arose and the adverse ecological impact of various aspects of the games have been protested by city residents.Trees.

===Other preparation===

In preparation for an influx of English-speaking tourists for the Games, the Delhi government implemented a program to teach English, and the necessary skills for serving tourists, to key workers—such as cab drivers, security workers, waiters, porters, and service staff. In the two years prior to the Games 2,000 drivers were taught English. In addition to Delhi, the Indian Government plans to expand the program to teach people in local tourist destinations in other parts of India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm|title=Lessons in English and etiquette ahead of Commonwealth Games|last=Roy|first=Rajeev Ranjan|date=30 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080411211929/http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
To facilitate hassle-free sightseeing in Delhi, Delhi Tourism undertook the launch of India's very first Hop on Hop Off bus known as HOHO DELHI, modelled on popular concept of transport facilities in Western countries. The bus, which is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies like digital video screens and GPS systems, also had trained guides who were responsible for giving information about the sites.
To prepare for the energy-usage spike during the Games and to end chronic power cuts in Delhi, the government undertook a large power-production initiative to increase power production to 7,000 MW (from the current 4,500 MW). To achieve this goal, the government streamlined the power distribution process, direct additional energy to Delhi, and constructed new power plants.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm|title=Delhi will have surplus powe...|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080504194524/http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm| archivedate= 4 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The negative pre-event publicity and heavy security presence played in part in low spectator attendance during the initial events. However the numbers picked up as the Games progressed.

===Formation of dedicated investigation committee===

The day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced the formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organising Committee. The probe committee will be led by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India VK Shunglu. This probe will be in addition to the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, and Central Vigilance Commission investigations already underway. The Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given "severe and exemplary" punishment after the Games. The probe committee is tasked with looking into "all aspects of organising and conducting" the Games, and "to draw lessons from it." It was given three months to submit its report, but the report was never publicly released.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-16/india/28259235_1_probe-panel-oc-bosses-alleged-misappropriation|title=CWG: Probe panel to report in 3 months |work=The Times of India |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece|title=Centre orders probe into CWG issues|work=The Hindu |location=India|date=16 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=J.|last=Balaji| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101017141103/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Indian Sports Ministry has directed the Organising Committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (led by Suresh Kalmadi), to not release any staffer from their positions till the probe committee's work is finished.

==Legacy==

One of the aims of hosting the Commonwealth Games was to build world-class athletics infrastructure within the country, expose audiences to top-level non-cricket competition and encourage the youth to "Come out and play" (the official theme of the games).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/come_out_and_play |title=Come Out and Play | XIX Commonwealth Games 2010 Delhi |publisher=Cwgdelhi2010.org |accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl] Building a sporting culture that looks beyond cricket is seen[tpl]by whom|date=August 2012[/tpl] as an important task for a country which won its first ever individual Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008, despite having the world's second-largest population.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC |title=Will India take next steps to secure sporting legacy?| accessdate=14 January 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110125061611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html| archivedate= 25 January 2011| deadurl= no[/tpl]
Sebastian Coe, former Olympic gold medalist and chairman of the 2012 Summer Olympics Organising Committee, was at the stadium during the 4x400m women's relay and described the audience's cheers for the racers as "potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who'd never even seen an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, but it has to be done."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/2010/10/did_delhi_live_up_to_expectati.html |title=Did Delhi live up to expectations? |last=Pearce |first=James|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 September 2012[/tpl]
