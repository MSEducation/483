CATEGORIES: Islamic criminal jurisprudence

In Islam, maisir or gambling is forbidden ([tpl]lang-ar|harƒÅm[/tpl]). [tpl]Quote|They ask you about wine and gambling. Say: 'In them both lies grave sin, though some benefit, to mankind. But their sin is more grave than their benefit.'|Qur'an, 2:219 (al-Baqara)[tpl]cite quran|2|219|s=ns[/tpl][/tpl]
It is stated in the Quran that intoxicants and games of chance, including maisir, were "abominations of Satan's handiwork," intended to turn people away from God and forget about prayer, thus Muslims were ordered to abstain from them.
[tpl]Quote|O believers, wine and gambling, idols and divining arrows are an abhorrence, the work of Satan. So keep away from it, that you may prevail. Satan only deserves to arouse discord and hatred among you with wine and gambling, and to deter you from the mention of God and from prayer. Will you desist?| Qur'an, Sura 5:90-91 (Al-Ma'ida)[tpl]cite quran|5|90|e=91|s=ns[/tpl][/tpl]
