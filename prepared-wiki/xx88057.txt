YouGov floated for £18 million in April 2005. In 2006, YouGov acquired a Dubai-based market research firm (Siraj) and in 2007 it further expanded by acquiring market research firms in the USA (Polimetrix), Germany (Psychonomics) and Scandinavia (Zapera). Between 2009 and 2011, YouGov expanded its US operations with three further acquisitions (Clear Horizons, Harrison Group and Definitive Insights). In 2014, YouGov acquired Asia Pacific based business, Decision Fuel. Each of these acquisitions has been re-branded as YouGov and form part of the YouGov Group, along with the organic businesses in the UK and France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://research.yougov.co.uk/about/investor-relations/ |title=Welcome to YouGov |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=2008-08-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620004050/http://www.yougov.co.uk/corporate/aboutyougovgroup.asp  |archivedate = 2008-06-20[/tpl]
Media clients of the YouGov Group include The Sun, The Times, The Guardian, The Economist, The Huffington Post, BILD, CBS News, Al Aan TV and Samaa TV.

==Methodology==

YouGov's methodology is to obtain responses from an invited group of internet users, and then to weight these responses in line with demographic information. It draws these demographically-representative samples from a panel of some 3 million people worldwide including over 400,000 people in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://research.yougov.co.uk/practices/yougov-panel/|title=YouGov - Panel|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] As YouGov's online methods use no field-force, its costs are lower than some face-to-face or telephone methods. (A field-force are those employees that ask the questions.)

==Accuracy==

YouGov has claimed that its opinion polls are most accurate when compared to its competitors and in particular that its online methodology is more accurate than traditional polling methods. For example, YouGov has contended that its opinion polls in recent UK elections have been consistently more accurate than traditional opinion pollsters who repeatedly overestimate the Labour vote.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] This pattern was evident during the United Kingdom general election 2005 campaign, when most traditional polls reported Labour's support in the range from 38 to 41%, compared with the 36% it achieved on polling day. In contrast, YouGov's nine polls during the final three weeks of the campaign all showed Labour on 36 or 37%, although GfK NOP (published in The Independent) gave the most accurate forecast in their final poll before the election.
Critics argue[tpl]Who|date=September 2008[/tpl] that, as not all of the public have access to the internet, online samples cannot accurately reflect the views of the population as a whole.Livingstone criticises YouGov|date=2008-04-07 YouGov counters that they have a representative panel and they are able to weight their data appropriately to reflect the national audience that they are aiming to poll.
It is a function of their internet panel methodology that YouGov is not able to pick up turnout factors to the same degree as other pollsters and they exclude it from their methods.  However, traditional polls use widely differing methods to take account of turnout, and these produce equally varied corrections to the raw data.  No consensus has emerged as to what, if any, correction has greatest validity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
Four weeks before the London mayoral election, 2008, a YouGov poll placed Boris Johnson 13% ahead of the incumbent Ken Livingstone. Livingstone's campaign team branded the poll "fundamentally flawed", arguing that it failed to take account of London's larger ethnic minority population compared to the rest of the country, and saying that it would complain to the Market Research Council of Great Britain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/apr/07/livingstone.boris1?gusrc=rss&feed=politics|title=Mayor makes complaint against YouGov over polling|author=Rosalind Ryan|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2008-04-09|location=London[/tpl] Ipsos MORI and ICM polls put the candidates neck-and-neck.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/apr/09/london08.livingstone|title=Livingstone leads Johnson in latest poll|author=Matthew Taylor|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2008-04-09|location=London[/tpl] A subsequent poll was derided by Livingstone as "a transparent attempt by the Evening Standard/YouGov to give Boris Johnson a more credible lead".[tpl]cite web|url=http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/05/opinion-poll-ne.html|title=London: Mayor & More|publisher=Dave Hill (The Guardian writer)|date=2008-05-01[/tpl] However, Livingstone never made the official complaint that had been announced to the media, and in the event, YouGov's final poll showing Johnson in the lead by 6% was the only accurate prediction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mrweb.com/drno/news8311.htm|title=Boris and YouGov Triumphant|publisher=MrWeb|date=2008-05-06[/tpl]
More recently, during the 2012 US Presidential Election, on the basis of one of the most extensive opinion polls ever conducted, YouGov predicted that Barack Obama would win the national vote by 2%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/us-election-yougov-poll_n_2077193.html |title=U.S. Election: YouGov Poll In UK Says Obama Will Win |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2012-11-05|accessdate=2013-09-29 |first=Ryan |last=Craggs[/tpl] This prediction proved to be one of the most accurate out of all pollsters covering the election.[tpl]cite news|last=Matthews |first=Dylan |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/07/which-pollsters-to-trust-in-one-chart/ |title=Which pollsters to trust, in one chart |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2012-11-07 |accessdate=2013-09-29[/tpl]
