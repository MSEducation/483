In 1980, Queen Hippolyta (blonde hair) appeared in the Super Friends episode "Return of Atlantis". In that episode, Wonder Woman addresses Hippolyta by name rather than "Mother" like in the live action television series which was no longer in production.

In Super Friends, he is mentioned in Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show in the episode "Darkseid's Golden Trap, Part 2", when Wonder Woman announces: "I have a date with Steve Trevor tonight...which dress should I wear?" He is also seen in the episode "Mr. Mxyzptlk and the Magic Lamp," although only a brief cameo, he has no dialogue. He later appears in an episode of The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, where he is revealed to be an astronaut. That episode was called "The Darkseid Deception."
