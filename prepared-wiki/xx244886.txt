Antonín Bečvář ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈantoɲiːn ˈbɛtʃvaːr̝̊[/tpl]; 10 June 1901 – 10 January 1965) was a Czech astronomer who was active in Slovakia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Obituary: Antonín Bečvář|journal=Physics Today|date=September 1965|volume=18|issue=9|pages=113|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v18/i9/p113_s3?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3047707[/tpl] He was born (and died) in Stará Boleslav. Among his chief achievements is the foundation of the Skalnaté Pleso Observatory and the discovery of the comet C/1947 F2 (Bečvář) (also known by the designations 1947 III and 1947c).  His lifelong illness led him to the High Tatras where he founded the observatory.[tpl]cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Publishing |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58133.html[/tpl]  
Bečvář is particularly important for his star charts: he led the compilation of the Atlas Coeli Skalnate Pleso (1951), published by Sky Publishing Corporation as the Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens, which was the state-of-the-art atlas of its kind until Wil Tirion's "Sky Atlas 2000.0" in 1981. He also compiled Atlas eclipticalis, 1950.0 (1958), Atlas borealis 1950.0 (1962), and Atlas australis 1950.0 (1964).
The asteroid 4567 Bečvář and the crater Bečvář on the Moon were named in his honour. American Avant-garde composer John Cage used Bečvář's star charts as the basis of several works: Atlas Eclipticalis (1961–62), Etudes Australes (1974–75), Etudes Boreales (1978) and Freeman Etudes (1977–80, 1989–90).
