==History==

Ventura County opened Oxnard Airport in 1934 by clearing a 3,500 ft dirt runway. In the 1930s aviator Howard Hughes erected a tent at the airport to shelter his famous H-1 monoplane racer, which he tested from the dirt strip. In 1938 Ventura County paved the dirt runway and built a large hangar. In 1939 James McLean opened the Oxnard Flying School with a Piper J-3 Cub and a Kinner 2-seat airplane. Housing was built nearby for instructors and students at the school.Historic Resources Report, 1600 W.

In late 1941, the airport was assigned to the U.S. Navy until the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu could be completed. The Navy moved to NAS Point Mugu in 1945 and the Oxnard Flying School returned to the airport. Ventura County regained control of the airport in 1948, receiving a final quitclaim deed. The state of California issued the airport an operating permit in 1949. 
Scheduled airline flights started in 1946 on Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3s; Southwest became Pacific Air Lines which added Martin 4-0-4s and Fairchild F-27s. In 1968 Pacific merged into Air West which became Hughes Airwest; it continued at Oxnard with F-27s until replaced by Golden West Airlines and other commuter airlines in 1973-74. Oxnard never had scheduled jet flights; it had Brasilia nonstops to SFO in the 1990s but most flights were to LAX, SBA or SMX.
