Tim Harrod (born May 25, 1968) is an American comedy writer. He has written for The Onion, the Late Show with David Letterman, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.
Born in Lynnfield, Massachusetts, the son of Ronald and Susan Harrod (later Anderson), Tim had a financially stable childhood offset by psychological hardship. Not until his adulthood was it determined that Tim's difficulties derived from a combination of clinical depression and problems functioning in mainstream society that are probably the result of Asperger's syndrome, a  milder form of autism.  Tim has one brother, Donald Harrod, who is two years older.
Tim is seen in many sketches on Late Night with Conan O'Brien.
