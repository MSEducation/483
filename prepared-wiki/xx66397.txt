On 14 May 1997, five airlines from three continents – Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways International, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and United Airlines. came together to launch Star Alliance.[tpl]Cite news|last=BRYANT|first=ADAM|title=United and 4 Others to Detail Air Alliance Today|work=The New York Times|date=14 May 1997|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FFC345D0C778DDDAC0894DF494D81|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=TAGLIABUE|first=JOHN|title=5 Airlines Extend Limits of Alliances|work=The New York Times|date=15 May 1997|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15FA3C5C0C768DDDAC0894DF494D81|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] The newly established alliance selected Young & Rubicam Advertising to increase awareness of the new alliance, with a budget of $25 million, (€18 million).[tpl]Cite news|last=Meredith|first=Robyn|title=Airline Alliance Picks Y.& R.|work=The New York Times|date=15 May 1997|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB061FFC3F5C0C768DDDAC0894DF494D81|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] The five airlines shared the traditional star logo from the beginning with the five points representing the five founding airlines. The alliance also adopted their first slogan "The Airline Network for Earth", with the goal being to have "an alliance that will take passengers to every major city on earth".
VARIG joined the Star Alliance network,[tpl]Cite news|title=5 Airlines In `Global Branding' Alliance|publisher=nwsource.com|work=Bloomberg News|date=14 May 1997|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970514&slug=2539161|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] on 22 October 1997 making it the alliance's first "new" member and its gateway airline into South America.

===2000: Major expansion===

The new millennium started off with the significant admission of The Austrian Airlines Group (Austrian Airlines, Tyrolean Airways and Lauda Air) in 26 March.[tpl]cite web|title=Austrian Airlines|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/austrian_airlines/#[/tpl]Austrian Airlines Group has joined Star AllianceSingapore Airlines joined on 1 April[tpl]cite web|title=Singapore Airlines|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/singapore-airlines/[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=SIA99/00 Annual Report|publisher=Singapore Airlines|url=http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_UK/docs/company_info/investor/annual/SIA_AR_9900.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl] giving the alliance an even stronger foothold in the Asian market. Then on 1 July BMI (British Midland) and Mexicana Airlines simultaneously joined Star Alliance, bringing the total membership tally up to 13.[tpl]Cite news|title=British Midland And Mexicana Airlines Welcomed to the Star Alliance Network|publisher=breakingtravelnews.com|date=26 June 2000|url=http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/btn40002507/|accessdate=16 October 2010[/tpl] The joining of BMI made London Heathrow the only European hub with two competing alliances. During the year, Emirates considered joining Star Alliance, but would later opt not to join. The same year, now defunct BWIA West Indies Airways who had entered an alliance with United Airlines considered becoming a member. BWIA however never joined the alliance. In 2000 the alliance also opened its first three business centers through the course of the year in Los Angeles, Frankfurt, and Bangkok as well as announcing the completion of its full-time Alliance Management Team (AMT) – the executive body of the partnership.[tpl]cite web|title=Star Alliance Chronological History|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/organisation/[/tpl]
In September 2001, Ansett Australia left the alliance due to bankruptcy which subsequently handed over a majority of the Australian market to Qantas, a rival Oneworld Alliance member. During this year Star Alliance also announced the appointment of their new CEO, Jaan Albrecht.
2003 saw the admission of three new airlines to the alliance. Asiana Airlines joined on 1 March,[tpl]cite web|title=Asian Airlines|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/asiana-airlines/[/tpl] Spanair joined on 1 May,[tpl]cite web|title=Spanair|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/spanair/[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] and finally, LOT Polish Airlines, the official flag carrier of Poland, joined in October.[tpl]cite web|title=LOT Polish Airlines|publisher=Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/lot-polish-airlines/[/tpl]
In March 2004, Mexicana Airlines left Star Alliance after deciding not to renew a codeshare deal with United Airlines and later joined Oneworld. US Airways then joined the alliance in May,[tpl]Cite news|title=US Airways Joins Star Alliance|work=The New York Times|date=2 June 2003|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00F14F63E540C718CDDAF0894DB404482|accessdate=20 October 2010[/tpl] becoming the alliance's second US-based airline.  Finally, in November, Adria Airways, Blue1, and Croatia Airlines joined the alliance as the first three regional members.
In 2005, Star Alliance invited Lineas Aereas Azteca to join the alliance in mid-2007, but the airline went bankrupt and never joined the alliance.  Then Star Alliance saw the admission of TAP Portugal on 14 March, thereby adding new African destinations to Star Alliance's network.[tpl]Cite news|title=TAP brings Star Alliance new Africa destinations|work=The New York Times|date=15 March 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/travel/14iht-travel15.html?_r=1|accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=TAP Portugal joins Star Alliance|publisher=AsiaTravelTips.com|date=15 March 2005|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/153-StarAlliance.shtml|accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl] After merging with US Airways under the US Airways name, America West Airlines joined, working through US Airways original membership, but would never be considered an individual member.
In April 2006 Swiss International Air Lines joined the alliance as its 17th member and its 6th airline from Europe. SWISS' predecessor, Swissair was due to join the alliance in 2001, but the airline went bankrupt in October of that year and went through an extensive restructuring process before joining 5 years later. April also saw the admission of South African Airways, who joined the alliance as the 18th member.

===Tenth anniversary===

In May 2007, Star Alliance and its members celebrated the alliance's 10th anniversary. During the previous decade, Star Alliance had grown from a membership of five airlines to include 17 carriers around the world.[tpl]Cite press release|title=Star Alliance Celebrates 10 Years|publisher=Star Alliance|date=14 May 2007|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/star-alliance-celebrates-10-years-prp/|accessdate=23 October 2010[/tpl] Each day the Star Alliance's members have a combined daily departure of 16,000 to 855 destinations in 155 countries, serving 406 million passengers annually.

On 27 October 2009, Continental Airlines became the 25th full member of the alliance after leaving SkyTeam on 24 October. At a joining ceremony in New York City, Jaan Albrecht, former CEO of Star Alliance, said, "Bringing Continental Airlines into Star Alliance has been a truly unique experience. This is the first time an airline has moved directly from one alliance to another and I would like to thank all those involved in ensuring a smooth switch". At the time, it was rumoured that the switch was part of Continental's initial move in its plan of a United-Continental merge.[tpl]Cite news|title=Continental plans United tie-up; will leave SkyTeam for Star Alliance|work=The Times |location=UK |date=20 June 2008|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/business/article4180450.ece|accessdate=17 November 2010|first=Mark|last=Frary[/tpl]

As of September 2010, Star Alliance flew to 1,172 airports in 181 countries, with approximately 21,200 daily departures.

===Expansion during 2011 and beyond===

The new decade saw the Star Alliance adding new members, but also losing some due to corporate restructuring and collapse.
In August, 2011, after continued delays, Air India was finally rejected for membership after failing to meet the requirements for membership.Air India’s dream to be a part of the 27-member Star Alliance is over, paving the way for the entry of Jet Airways in the exclusive club. Member-airlines of the world’s largest airline alliance were not able to come to a unanimous decision to allow Air India, whose application had been put on hold earlier. http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/ais-star-dream-ends/482772/  Later that year, on 13 December 2011, Ethiopian Airlines joined, adding five new countries and 24 destinations to the alliance's route map.
2012 was a year filled with several departures, new members, and restructurings.  In the beginning of January 2012 Continental Airlines completed its merger with United Airlines, thus formally ending its existence and membership in the alliance.  Shortly after this, on 27 January, longtime member Spanair left the alliance after suffering financial collapse and ceasing operations.  bmi then left on 20 April after its acquisition by International Airlines Group (IAG), a parent company of Oneworld Members Iberia and British Airways.  On 21 June 2012 Avianca, TACA Airlines and Copa Airlines all simultaneously joined the alliance, significantly increasing the alliance's presence in Latin America.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]  Then in November, Blue1 left the alliance, becoming an affiliate of parent Scandinavian Airlines.[tpl]cite web|last=Star Alliance|title=BMI formally leaves Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/bmi-removal-prp/[/tpl]  Finally, to end one of the most difficult years in the alliances history, Shenzhen Airlines joined on 29 November 2012, complementing Air China's Chinese network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/zh-joining-prp |title=Shenzhen Airlines Joins |publisher=Star Alliance |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-22[/tpl]
On 8 March 2013 TAM Airlines officially announced its departure, long expected after its merger with LAN Airlines to become LATAM Airlines Group. Later during the year, with the addition of EVA Air on 18 June and TACA's integration into Avianca, the alliance now had 28 members, making it the largest of the three main airline alliances.  On 13 December 2013, Air India was officially invited to join Star Alliance again, and the integration process was recommenced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/ceb1-prp/|title=STAR ALLIANCE AND AIR INDIA RECOMMENCE INTEGRATION PROCESS |publisher=Star Alliance |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2013-12-13[/tpl] On 31 March 2014, TAM Airlines left Star Alliance and joined Oneworld, and US Airways left as well as an affiliate of American Airlines.[tpl]cite web|title=US Airways and TAM leave Star Alliance|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/tam-us-leaving-prp/ |publisher=Star Alliance |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2014-04-13[/tpl] On the same day that US Airways and TAM Airlines left, Avianca Brazil announced that they would join Star Alliance in 2014 as an affiliate of the Avianca brand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/press/ceb2-prp//|title=STAR ALLIANCE MAINTAINS PRESENCE IN BRAZIL THROUGH AVIANCA BRAZIL |publisher=Star Alliance |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2013-12-13[/tpl] After TAM Airlines and US Airways left Star Alliance, the alliance had 26 airlines.

Codeshare flights between these airlines are, for the most part, seamless. This tight cooperation led to suspicions of anti-competitive behaviour, and the alliance was investigated by the European Union as a virtual merger of its members. Indeed, some speculated that if government regulations were relaxed, the members would merge into a single corporation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/speeches/text/sp1999678_en.html |title=Current issues arising with airline alliances: panel discussion. EUROPEAN AIR LAW ASSOCIATION. 11th Annual Conference. Recent developments in European air transport law and policy Lisbon, 5 November 1999 |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=5 November 1999 |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] although no evidence has yet materialized. Prior to Star Alliance, Northwest Airlines and KLM were operating together as the forerunners of the modern airline alliance system since 1993, although there had been even earlier pairings and groupings of airlines for decades on a less formal level. The creation of Star Alliance was a milestone in airline history because of its size. It sparked the formation of rivals, notably SkyTeam and Oneworld.
The alliance developed the "Regional" concept in 2004, which helped Star Alliance penetrate individual markets with the regional participation of smaller carriers. Regional Star Alliance members had to be sponsored by an existing full Star Alliance member. However, Star Alliance has stopped designating airlines as "Regional" members and now refers to all the 25 airlines as just "members".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.staralliance.com/en/about/airlines/ |title=Member Airlines – Star Alliance |publisher=Staralliance.com |date= |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]
Star Alliance members now fly over 21,200 daily flights to 1,172 airports in 181 countries with a fleet of 4,025 aircraft. Its members carried a total of 627.52 million passengers with a turnover of US$156.8 billion, €145 billion. The alliance's market share is 28% of the global market based on revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), which is greater than the combined market share of all airlines that are not in any of the three major alliances. All Star Alliance carriers combined employ over 405,000 pilots, flight attendants, and other staff. Star Alliance was voted best airline alliance in the Skytrax 2007 World Airline Awards.[tpl]cite web|year=2007|publisher=Skytrax|url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Allnc.htm|title=2007 World Airlines Awards– Best Alliance|accessdate=27 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070724182834/http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Allnc.htm  |archivedate = 24 July 2007[/tpl]

===Members' hubs===

===Co-location at Airports (move under one roof)===

===Premium status===

Star Alliance has two premium levels, Silver and Gold, based on a customer's tier status in a member carrier's frequent flyer program. Each of the member and regional airlines recognizes Star Silver/Gold status, with a few exceptions (mainly pertaining to airport lounge access). The statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is based solely on the frequent flyer programs of individual member airlines. Many member airlines also have an additional premium status beyond Gold which is not recognised across Star Alliance.

====Star Alliance Silver====

Star Alliance Silver status is awarded to customers who have reached a premium level of a member carrier's frequent flyer program.
Benefits of Star Alliance Silver membership:
Some airlines also offer the following to Silver members:

====Star Alliance Gold====

Star Alliance Gold status is awarded to customers who have reached a high level of a member airline's frequent flyer program.
Benefits of Star Alliance Gold membership:
Some airlines also offer the following to Gold members:

====Qualifying tiers by airline====

==Livery and logo==

Some Star Alliance members paint some of their planes with the Star Alliance livery, usually featuring a white fuselage with "Star Alliance" signature written across and a black tailfin with the Star Alliance logo while the color or design of the engine cowlings or winglets remains depending on the members livery. Singapore Airlines is the only exception, formerly opting to paint the tails of the aircraft with the airline's logo; and now applying the Star Alliance logo sans the black tailfin painting, leaving it white. Asiana Airlines was the first Star Alliance member to paint their aircraft in the current Star Alliance livery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-94602575.html |title=Star Alliance Launches New Aircraft Livery; New Member Asiana Airlines to Premiere Bold New Design. – PR Newswire | HighBeam Research: Online Press Releases |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]
Aircraft painted in the airlines' own livery have the Star Alliance logo painted behind the cockpit. Currently, 80 aircraft are painted in the Star Alliance livery.
