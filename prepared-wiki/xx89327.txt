In physics and astronomy, the Reissner–Nordström metric is a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M.
The metric was discovered by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström.
These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:
where Q represents the body's electric charge and J represents its spin angular momentum.

==The metric==

In spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ), the line element for the Reissner–Nordström metric is
where c is the speed of light, t is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity), r is the radial coordinate, rS is the Schwarzschild radius of the body given by
and rQ is a characteristic length scale given by
Here 1/4πε0 is Coulomb force constant.Landau 1975.
In the limit that the charge Q (or equivalently, the length-scale rQ) goes to zero, one recovers the Schwarzschild metric.  The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio rS/r goes to zero. In that limit that both rQ/r and rS/r go to zero, the metric becomes the Minkowski metric for special relativity.
In practice, the ratio rS/r is often extremely small.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is roughly 9 mm (3/8 inch), whereas a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit has a radius r that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164 km (26,200 miles).  Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars.

==Charged black holes==

Although charged black holes with rQ ≪ rS are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole, they have two horizons: the event horizon and an internal Cauchy horizon.[tpl]cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |authorlink=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar |title=The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19850370-9 |edition=Reprinted |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/Relativity/?view=usa&ci=9780198503705 |accessdate=13 May 2013 |page=205 |quote=And finally, the fact that the Reissner-Nordström solution has two horizons, an external event horizon and an internal 'Cauchy horizon,' provides a convenient bridge to the study of the Kerr solution in the subsequent chapters.[/tpl]  As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component grr diverges; that is, where
This equation has two solutions:
These concentric event horizons become degenerate for 2rQ = rS, which corresponds to an extremal black hole. Black holes with 2rQ > rS are believed not to exist in nature because they would contain a naked singularity; their appearance would contradict Roger Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis which is generally believed to be true.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Theories with supersymmetry usually guarantee that such "superextremal" black holes cannot exist.
The electromagnetic potential is
If magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge P is obtained by replacing Q2 by Q2 + P2 in the metric and including the term Pcos θ dφ in the electromagnetic potential.[tpl]clarify|date=January 2013[/tpl]
