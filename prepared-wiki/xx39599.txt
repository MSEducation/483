==Collaborations==

Kroeger, along with Saliva vocalist Josey Scott, Theory of a Deadman lead vocalist (serving as guitarist for this track) Tyler Connolly  and Our Lady Peace drummer Jeremy Taggart, performed the theme song titled "Hero" for the hit movie Spider-Man in 2002. Also in 2002, Kroeger wrote and sang on "Why Don't You & I" for Santana's Shaman.  However, when Arista decided to release the song as a single in Summer 2003, Kroeger's label, Roadrunner, refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a "high-profile single" would compromise the excitement over Nickelback's fall 2003 release The Long Road. Kroeger recommended The Calling's Alex Band, another Arista artist, as a replacement for re-recording the single."Nickelback's Record Company Explains Chad Kroeger ban on Santana Single" - July 2, 2003  @ RoadrunnerRecords.com"Nickelback's Kroeger Not Allowed on Santana Single" @ foundrymusic.com[tpl]Verify credibility|date=August 2010[/tpl]"Carlos Santana Says Label Politics Forced Chad Kroeger/Alex Band Change On New Single" @ Music.Yahoo!
