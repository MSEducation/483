Michael Stanley Dukakis ([tpl]IPAc-en|d|ʉ|ˈ|k|ɑː|k|ɨ|s[/tpl]; born November 3, 1933; Greek: Μιχαήλ Δουκάκης) served as the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991 respectively. He is the longest-serving Governor in Massachusetts history and only the second Greek American Governor in U.S. history, after Spiro Agnew. In 1988, he was the Democratic nominee for President, but lost to the  Republican candidate, then–Vice President, George H. W. Bush.

==Early life and education==

Dukakis's father Panos (1896–1979) was a Greek immigrant from Adramyttion (Edremit),Greek Americans: Struggle and Success (2nd edition), by Charles C. Moskos (page 176). Transaction Publishers, 1989 (ISBN 0-88738-778-0, ISBN 978-0-88738-778-4). in Turkey, which was then the Ottoman Empire, who settled in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1912, and graduated from Harvard Medical School twelve years later, subsequently working as an obstetrician. Dukakis' mother Euterpe (née Boukis; 1903–2003) was a Vlach-Aromanian immigrant from Larissa, in Thessaly, northern Greece;[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/17/us/campaign-trail-tapping-another-ethnic-group.html | author=Bernard Weinraub | title=Campaign Trail; Tapping Another Ethnic Group | work=The New York Times | date=October 17, 1988 | accessdate=August 24, 2008[/tpl] she and her family emigrated to Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1913.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/03/dukakis.htm|title=Euterpe Dukakis, mother of former Mass. governor, dies at 99 |agency=Associated Press |date=April 3, 2003 |publisher=The Boston Globe[/tpl]

==Massachusetts governor==

===First governorship (1975–1979)===

After serving four terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives between 1962 and 1970 (and winning the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1970http://www.hri.org/hri/dukakis.html), Dukakis was elected governor in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican Francis Sargent during a period of fiscal crisis. Dukakis won in part by promising to be a "reformer" and pledging a "lead pipe guarantee" of no new taxes to balance the state budget. He would later reverse his position after taking office. He also pledged to dismantle the powerful Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), a bureaucratic enclave that served as home to hundreds of political patronage employees. The MDC managed state parks, reservoirs, and waterways, as well as the highways and roads abutting those waterways. In addition to its own police force, the MDC had its own maritime patrol force, and an enormous budget from the state, for which it provided minimal accounting. Dukakis' efforts to dismantle the MDC failed in the legislature, where the MDC had many powerful supporters. As a result, the MDC would withhold its critical backing of Dukakis in the 1978 gubernatorial primary.
Governor Dukakis hosted President Ford and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during their visits to Boston in 1976 to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] He gained some notice as the only politician in the state government who went to work during the Blizzard of 1978, during which he went to local TV studios in a sweater to announce emergency bulletins.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Dukakis is also remembered for his 1977 exoneration of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian anarchists whose trial sparked protests around the world.
During his first term in office, Dukakis commuted the sentences of 21 first-degree murderers and 23 second-degree murderers. Due to controversy engendered by some of these individuals having re-offended, Dukakis curtailed the practice later, issuing no commutations in his last three years as governor.[tpl]Cite news | title=If you thought Duke's commutations were bad, be warned: Patrick's could be so much worse | url=http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=160964 | work=Boston Herald |publisher= |first=Howie |last=Carr | date=October 6, 2006 | accessdate=September 9, 2013[/tpl]
However, his first term performance proved to be insufficient to offset a backlash against the state's high sales and property tax rates, which turned out to be the predominant issue in the 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Dukakis, despite being the incumbent Democratic governor, was refused renomination by his own party. The state's Democratic Party chose to support Director of the Massachusetts Port Authority Edward J. King in the primary, partly because King rode the wave against high property taxes, but more significantly because state Democratic Party leaders lost confidence in Dukakis' ability to govern effectively. King also enjoyed the support of the power brokers at the MDC, who were unhappy with Dukakis' attempts to dismantle their powerful bureaucracy. King also had support from state police and public employee unions. Dukakis suffered a scathing defeat in the primary, a disappointment that his wife Kitty called "a public death".[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-01-17/news/mn-36772_1_michael-dukakis|title=An Enigma: For Dukakis, Key Is Voter Perception|date=January 17, 1988|first=Bob|last=Drogin|work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]

===Second governorship (1983–1991)===

Four years later, having made peace with the state Democratic Party, MDC, the state police and public employee unions, Dukakis defeated King in a 're-match' in the 1982 Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, John Winthrop Sears, in the November election. Future United States Senator, 2004 Democratic Presidential nominee, and US Secretary of State John Kerry was elected lieutenant governor on the same ballot with Dukakis, and served in the Dukakis administration from 1983 to 1985.
Dukakis served as governor during which time he presided over a high-tech boom and a period of prosperity in Massachusetts while simultaneously earning a reputation as a 'technocrat'.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] The National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective governor in 1986. Residents of the city of Boston and its surrounding areas remember him for the improvements he made to Boston's mass transit system, especially major renovations to the city's trains and buses. He was known as the only governor who rode the subway to work every day.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In 1988, Dukakis and Rosabeth Moss Kanter, his economic adviser in the 1988 presidential elections, wrote a book entitled Creating the Future: the Massachusetts Comeback and Its Promise for America, an examination of the Massachusetts Miracle.Butterfield, Fox (May 1, 1988)."What you see is what you get". The New York Times.

==1988 presidential campaign==

Using the phenomenon termed the "Massachusetts Miracle" to promote his campaign, Dukakis sought the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States in the 1988 United States presidential election, prevailing over a primary field that included Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Gary Hart, Joe Biden and Al Gore, among others. Touching on his immigrant roots, Dukakis used Neil Diamond's ode to immigrants, "America", as the theme song for his campaign. Famed composer John Williams wrote "Fanfare for Michael Dukakis" in 1988 at the request of Dukakis's father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson. The piece was premiered under the baton of Dickson (then the Associate Conductor of the Boston Pops) at that year's Democratic National Convention. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, with 2,877 out of 4,105 delegates. He chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to be his vice presidential running mate.
Dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was often referred to as "Zorba the Clerk". Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with George Bush, but in the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and spent quite a bit of the day in bed.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold. During the campaign, Dukakis's mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to The New York Times, "persistent suggestions" that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past."Dukakis Releases Medical Details To Stop Rumors on Mental Health", The New York Times, August 4, 1988.  In the 2008 film Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, journalist Robert Novak revealed that Republican strategist Lee Atwater had personally tried to get him to spread these mental-health rumors.Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story transcript, PBS, director: Stefan Forbes, 2008.
Dukakis' general election campaign was subject to several criticisms and gaffes on issues such as capital punishment, the pledge of allegiance in schools, and most famously, the tank incident. Like the allegations of psychiatric problems, these were vulnerabilities which Atwater identified and exploited. In 1991, shortly before his death from a brain tumor, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the "naked cruelty" of the 1988 campaign.[tpl]cite news |title=Gravely Ill, Atwater Offers Apology |agency=AP |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/us/gravely-ill-atwater-offers-apology.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 13, 1991 |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Dorothy Wickenden |title=Going Positive |magazine=The New Yorker |date=May 5, 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/05/05/080505taco_talk_wickenden |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl]

===Crime issues===

During the campaign, Vice President George H. W. Bush, the Republican nominee, criticized Dukakis for his traditionally liberal positions on many issues, calling him "a card-carrying member of the ACLU". Dukakis' support for a prison furlough program was a major election subject. During his first term as Governor, he had vetoed a bill that would have stopped furloughs for first-degree murderers.Oshinsky, David. "What Became of the Democrats", The New York Times (October 20, 1991): "In 1976 the state legislature passed a bill that would have ended the furloughs of first-degree murderers. Governor Dukakis, as the Edsalls point out, vetoed it. A strong advocate of prisoners' rights, he contended that the bill would 'cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation.'" During his second term, that program resulted in the release of convicted murderer William "Willie" Horton,''Crime, Risk and Insecurity" ed. Tim Hope and Richard Sparks, p. 266 who committed a rape and assault in Maryland after being furloughed. George H. W. Bush mentioned Horton by name in a speech in June 1988, and a conservative political action committee (PAC) affiliated with the Bush campaign, the National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled "Weekend Passes", which used a mug shot image of Horton.  The Bush campaign refused to repudiate the ad. That ad campaign was followed by a separate Bush campaign ad, "Revolving Door", criticizing Dukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton. The legislature canceled the program during Dukakis's last term.
The issue of capital punishment came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees. Because she knew the Willie Horton issue would be brought up, Dukakis's campaign manager, Susan Estrich, had prepared with Michael Dukakis an answer highlighting the candidate's empathy for victims of crime, noting the beating of his father in a robbery and the death of his brother in a hit-and-run car accident. However, when Bernard Shaw, the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis wife were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" Dukakis replied, "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life", and explained his stance. After the debate,Susan Estrich: "The Debates", Newsmax September 2004 (copy at the Internet Archive) many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the passion one would expect of a person discussing a loved one's rape and death. Many– including Dukakis himself– believe this, in part, cost him the election, as his poll numbers dropped from 49% to 42% nationally that night.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Other commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue and forced the candidate to make a difficult choice, while others believed that Dukakis dwelled too much on post-mortem reflections about this incident while the election was still in play in a way that was too self-effacing to the point of appearing self-pitying and defeatist, which only served to demoralize his campaign and reinforce the image of him as a weak leader.

===Tank photograph===

Dukakis was criticized during the campaign for a perceived softness on defense issues, particularly the controversial "Star Wars" program, which he promised to weaken. In response to this, Dukakis orchestrated what would become the key image of his campaign, although it turned out quite differently from what he intended. On September 13, 1988 Dukakis visited the General Dynamics Land Systems plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan to take part in a photo op in an M1 Abrams tank. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, had been photographed in a similar situation in 1986, riding in a Challenger tank while wearing a scarf.BBC - Radio4 - Today/The Fate of Tanks Compared with Dukakis' results, Thatcher's picture was very successful and helped her reelection prospects.100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist Footage of Dukakis was used in television ads by the Bush campaign, as evidence that Dukakis would not make a good commander-in-chief, and "Dukakis in the tank" remains shorthand for backfired public relations outings.http://www.apoliticus.com/tag/george-bush/ Although he had served in the United States Army, Dukakis was widely mocked by his opponents for what they characterized as martial posturing and a silly image.

===Outcome===

The Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost the election by a decisive margin in the Electoral College to George H.W. Bush and Dan Quayle, carrying only 10 states and the District of Columbia. Dukakis himself blames his defeat on the time he spent doing gubernatorial work in Massachusetts during the few weeks following the Democratic Convention. Many believed he should have been campaigning across the country. During this time, his 17-point lead in opinion polls completely disappeared, as his lack of visibility allowed Bush to define the issues of the campaign. Dukakis has since statedhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/dukakis-and-the-tank-99119_Page4.html that the main reason he lost was his decision "not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect it was a pretty dumb decision."
Despite Dukakis's loss, his performance was a marked improvement over the previous two Democratic efforts. Dukakis made some strong showings in states that had voted for Republicans Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. He also scored victories in states like Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Dukakis's home state of Massachusetts; Walter Mondale had lost all three, and since then, all three states have remained in the Democratic column for each subsequent presidential election. He swept Iowa, winning by 10 points, an impressive feat in a state that had voted Republican in the last five presidential elections. He won 43% of the vote in Kansas, a surprising showing in the home state of 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, and future Republican nominee Bob Dole. In another surprising showing, he received 47% of the vote in South Dakota; in Montana, Dukakis won 46% of the vote in a state that had voted over 60% Republican four years earlier. Dukakis's relative strength in farm states was no doubt due to the serious economic difficulties these states were facing in the 1980s, and it was the strongest showing in the Midwest for a Democrat since 1976.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Although Dukakis cut into the Republican hold in the Midwest, he failed to dent the emerging GOP stronghold in the South that had been forming since the end of World War II with a temporary reprieve with Jimmy Carter. He lost most of the South by a wide margin, with Bush's totals reaching around 60% in most states. He was able to hold Bush to 55% in Texas, though this was most likely due to Lloyd Bentsen's presence on the ticket. He also carried most of the southern-central parishes of Louisiana, despite losing the state. He held onto the border state of West Virginia, and he captured 48% of the vote in Missouri. He also carried 41% in Oklahoma, a bigger share than any Democrat since Jimmy Carter.
Dukakis won 41,809,476 votes in the popular vote. He also received 40% or more in the following states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont. Overall, the 1988 election showed a marked improvement in the popular vote for the Democrats. While he lost the popular vote, Dukakis's margin of loss (7.8%) was narrower than Jimmy Carter's in 1980 (9.7%) or Walter Mondale's in 1984 (18.2%).
In 2008, he reflected on his defeat during an interview with Katie Couric, in which he said he "owed the American people an apology" because "if I had beaten the old man, we never would have heard of the kid, and we wouldn't be in this mess."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4386669n | publisher=CBS News | title=Dukakis Defends Obama Campaign[/tpl]

==Post–presidential election==

Dukakis' final two years as governor were marked by increased criticism of his policies and significant tax increases to cover the economic effects of the U.S. economy's "soft landing" at the end of the 1980s and the recession of 1990. He did not run for a fourth term in 1990; Boston University President John Silber won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to Republican William Weld.
After the end of his term, he served on the board of directors for Amtrak, and became a professor of political science at Northeastern University, a visiting professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University, and visiting professor in the Department of Public Policy at the School of Public Affairs at UCLA. Along with a number of other notable Greek Americans, he is a founding member of The Next Generation Initiative: a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs. In November 2008, Northeastern named its new Center for Urban and Regional Policy after Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty.
Dukakis has developed a strong passion for grassroots campaigning and the appointment of precinct captains to coordinate local campaigning activities, two strategies he feels are essential for the Democratic Party to compete effectively in both local and national elections. In 2006, he and his wife worked to help Democratic candidate Deval Patrick in his successful effort to become governor of Massachusetts. He did the same in 2012 for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren. He has also been an advocate for effective public transportation and high-speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack of space at airports; and for extended learning time initiative in public schools."Make the school day a full day", The Orange County Register, April 11, 2008."http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/"
In August 2009, the 75-year-old Dukakis was mentioned as one of two leading candidates as a possible interim successor to Ted Kennedy in the U.S. Senate, after Kennedy's death.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Who should fill Kennedy's seat? | first=Scot | last=Lehigh | date=August 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8269945.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | title=Kennedy successor to be appointed | date=September 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] Instead, Gov.

Dukakis stated on January 31, 2014 that he was not in favor of an effort to rename South Station as the "Gov. Michael S. Dukakis Transportation Center".  He went on to state that he would not object to the naming the as-yet unbuilt North-South Rail Link after him.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/01/michael_dukakis_decries_terminal_honor | work=Boston Herald | title=Michael Dukakis decries terminal honor? | first=Laurel | last=Sweet | date=January 31, 2014[/tpl]
