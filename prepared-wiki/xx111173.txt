Jon Brant (born February 22, 1955 in Chicago)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jon-brant-mn0000214657 |title=Jon Brant |publisher=allmusic.com |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/tag/jon-brant/ |title=Jon Brant |publisher=thisdayinrock.com |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl] was the bass player for the band Cheap Trick from 1981 to 1987. In addition to his work with that band, Brant has also played with artists including Chris Spedding, Robert Gordon, Lou Reed, Diana Ross, Pete Special, Leslie Gore, Micki Free & others. He was also bassist for the band Red Siren (formerly Siren, following their legal band-name change).
After original bassist Tom Petersson left the group in 1980, he was replaced by Pete Comita. Comita left the group in the early recording stages of "One on One" and was replaced by Jon Brant. Though this was the first album to feature Brant, most of it was recorded without him. Guitarist Rick Nielsen played bass on all but three tracks ("Saturday at Midnight", "If You Want My Love" and "She's Tight").
Brant played on all of the tracks of the band's next three studio albums and co-wrote the hit "Tonight It's You" and "This Time Around" from 1985's Standing on the Edge. In 1987, Brant was forced out of Cheap Trick when Sony bought out CBS Epic. He remains good friends with drummer Bun E. Carlos to this day, and the two of them occasionally play together.
Brant rejoined Cheap Trick briefly on stage to play bass during "If You Want My Love" and "She's Tight"  during the band's 25th anniversary concert. In 2004, when Petersson was unable to tour briefly after the birth of his child, Brant re-joined the band for a month of shows as opening act for Aerosmith.  Brant started the tour with Cheap Trick a few days after returning  from a month long tour of bases in the Middle East.  He performed in Baghdad, Djibouti, Africa and the UAE. Brant returned once again in 2007 to Cheap Trick for one show in Augusta, Georgia. 
Brant performed with blues artist Lynne Jordan for several years in Chicago, then played for a few years with new age artist Nicholas Gunn. Brant also competes in the equestrian sport of eventing and runs a horse bedding manufacturing company.
Brant performs with Native American artist Micki Free. The two perform regularly at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida and other venues around the world.
