[[Pimsleur method]]

CATEGORIES: Language-teaching methodology

The Pimsleur method (sometimes billed as the Pimsleur Language Learning System) is an audio-based language acquisition method developed by Paul Pimsleur that stresses active participation over rote memorization. During lessons, the listener repeats words and phrases given by native speakers and constructs new phrases by inference. As new phrases are introduced, the listener is prompted to recall older phrases. The prompts for any given phrase are gradually spaced out in ever-increasing intervals.  Between 1963 and 1971, Pimsleur created Greek, French, Spanish, German, and Twi courses while teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles.
The Pimsleur method focuses on proficiency in speaking, as well as proficiency in reading. These two aspects are honed through thirty-minute lessons, which are repeated until a score of at least 80% comprehension is achieved before proceeding to the next lesson. During the lessons, students listen to native speakers of the target language as they speak phrases in both the foreign language, as well as the studentâ€™s main language. At graduated intervals, learners are prompted to repeat a phrase after listening to the speaker. As the student progresses through the program, the interval increases, as does the size of the vocabulary. The courses are made up of 30-minute daily sessions and shorter reading lessons.[tpl]cite web|title=Learn Spanish with The Pimsleur Method|url=http://www.pimsleur.com/learn-spanish|accessdate=22 August 2013[/tpl]  They are published and sold by Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster).
