Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg; 25 September 1968 – 12 August 2013) was a younger brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Prince Friso was a member of the Dutch Royal Family, but because of his marriage without an Act of Consent in 2004, he lost his membership of the Dutch Royal House and was no longer in the line of succession to the throne.
On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck where he was in critical but stable condition.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17077390|title=Dutch Prince Johan Friso 'buried by Austria avalanche'|work=BBC News| accessdate=17 February 2012|date=17 February 2012[/tpl] According to his doctor, Dr. Wolfgang Koller, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. His initial coma later progressed to a minimally conscious state and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2748703/zeer-ernstig-hersenletsel-friso.html |title=Zeer ernstig hersenletsel Friso|date=24 February 2012|publisher=NU|language=nl|accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hwCLbV_GfXhIVuvLNnS2uPKYa0kA?docId=CNG.163dc6a974e4d63bf289b4444420ae3d.341 |title=Dutch prince 'may never regain consciousness'|date=24 February 2012 |publisher=AFP|accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/24/world/europe/austria-dutch-prince-brain-damage/index.html?iref=allsearch|work=CNN|title=Dutch prince suffers brain damage after avalanche|date=25 February 2012[/tpl] On 12 August 2013, one and a half years after the accident, Prince Friso died of complications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23669317#TWEET853565|title=Dutch prince dies after year in coma|work=BBC|date=12 August 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

==Marriage and children==

On 30 June 2003, it was announced that Prince Friso was to marry Mabel Wisse Smit. The Dutch cabinet, however, did not seek permission from parliament for this marriage, a constitutional requirement if Prince Friso was to remain a member of the Dutch Royal House and in line of succession for the throne; at the time, he was second in line after his older brother, Willem-Alexander.
The Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende explained that this was due to discussions with Mabel Wisse Smit in October 2003 where she had admitted that her previous statements about an alleged relationship with Klaas Bruinsma (1953–1991), a known Dutch drug lord, had not been complete and accurate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/25/world/fg-briefs25.3|title=Prince Weds, Gives Up Any Claim to Throne|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl] She had previously stated that she had contact for a few months with Bruinsma, but in a casual context, not intimate or relating to business and that she had broken the contact on learning of Bruinsma's occupation.
This "breach of trust" was the reason the government did not seek parliamentary permission, respecting the wishes of the couple."Revelations About Dutch Prince's Fiancée Rattle Royal Family" They nevertheless married in Delft on 24 April 2004, and Mabel Wisse Smit became a member of the Dutch Royal Family but not a member of the Dutch Royal House.
Considering that his elder brother King Willem-Alexander has three children, Prince Friso's exclusion from the succession was unlikely to have an effect on the monarchy in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nos.nl/video/36559-gesprek-met-prins-friso-en-mabel-wisse-smit-2004.html |title=Gesprek met prins Friso en Mabel Wisse Smit (2004)|author=Redactie NOS|publisher=Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|date=22 June 2009[/tpl]

==Avalanche accident and death==

On 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, and he was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17077390|title=Dutch Prince Johan Friso 'buried by Austria avalanche'|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=17 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/dutch-prince-johan-friso-avalanche.html|title=Dutch prince rescued from avalanche, 'not out of danger'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl] According to a formal statement of the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD), a prognosis could only be given after some days. The prince's condition was described as "stable, but critical".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/|title=Het Koninklijk Huis|work=Netherlands Government Information Service|accessdate=17 February 2012[/tpl]In hospital MSNBC, 17 February 2012
The Dutch royal family issued a statement on 19 February saying "The Royal Family is very grateful and deeply touched by all expressions of support and sympathy after the ski accident of His Royal Highness Prince Friso. It was a great support for them during this difficult time."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2012/februari/zijne-koninklijke-hoogheid-prins-friso-19-februari-2012-1913/|title=Zijne Koninklijke Hoogheid Prins Friso|publisher=Het Koninklijk Huis|date=19 February 2012|accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl]
A prognosis on his health situation was expected within a few days, but this was pushed back to 24 February, a week after his accident. The RVD's comment remained the same: stable, but critical. On 24 February, an Innsbruck medical team announced that the prince had been buried for 25 minutes, followed by a 50-minute CPR to treat his cardiac arrest. Wolfgang Koller stated that an MRI was performed a day earlier revealing little change, however other neurological tests indicated significant damage due to oxygen shortage. It remained unclear whether the prince would ever regain full consciousness. Koller said that the Prince's family may now look for a rehabilitation institution. On the same day the Dutch royal family issued a statement requesting that the privacy of the Prince's family be respected to enable them to come to terms with his condition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/nieuws/nieuwsberichten/2012/februari/zijne-koninklijke-hoogheid-prins-friso-24-februari-2012-1429/|title=Zijne Koninklijke Hoogheid Prins Friso, 24 February 2012|language=Dutch|trans_title=His Royal Highness Prince Friso – 24 February 2012|publisher=Het Koninklijk Huis (The Dutch Royal House)|accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl]

On 19 November 2012, it was announced that the prince had started to show some signs of consciousness but it was still not certain whether he would ever wake up, and if he did, in what  state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/3350352/2012/11/19/Tekenen-van-zeer-gering-bewustzijn-bij-prins-Friso.dhtml|accessdate=19 November 2012|title=Tekenen van zeer gering bewustzijn bij prins Friso, 19 November 2012 |language=Dutch[/tpl]
On 9 July 2013, Prince Friso was moved back to Huis ten Bosch in the Netherlands. It was understood that his coma had then evolved into a minimally conscious state. As he was no longer in need of hospital-level medical care, he stayed with his family for the summer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nos.nl/koningshuis/artikel/527609-prins-friso-op-huis-ten-bosch.html|title=Prins Friso ligt nu in Huis ten Bosch|publisher=NOS|date=9 July 2013|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

A ceremony of commemoration was held on 2 November 2013 in the Oude Kerk in Delft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3549610/prins-friso-vrijdag-in-besloten-kring-begraven.html|title=Prins Friso vrijdag in besloten kring begraven|language=Dutch|trans_title=Prince Friso to be buried on Friday in a private ceremony|publisher=NU|accessdate=15 August 2013|date=13 August 2013[/tpl]

==Style, titles and names==

Under the Act on the Membership of the Royal House (2002), Prince Friso lost the title 'Prince of the Netherlands' by entering into a marriage without an Act of Consent.
By Royal Decree of 19 March 2004, nr. 126 the Prince was granted the surname 'Van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg' and the hereditary title 'Count of Orange-Nassau' to take effect upon his marriage.[tpl]cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stb-2004-126.html|title=Besluit van 19 maart 2004, houdende bepalingen inzake titels, predikaat en geslachtsnaam van Z.K.H. Prins Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David der Nederlanden, Prins van Oranje-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg, met ingang van zijn huwelijk|publisher=Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden|accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl]
By the same Royal Decree the Prince was allowed to continue his title 'Prince of Orange-Nassau' as a personal and non-hereditary title and the style of 'Royal Highness'. According to the notification of this Royal Decree, any children born to the couple were to receive the surname 'Van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg' and become a 'Count (Countess) of Orange-Nassau' and also have the noble predicate 'Jonkheer (Jonkvrouw) van Amsberg'. Herewith, his children had the same titles and names as those of Prince Constantijn, and thereby to show that they altogether belong to the royal family with descendance from Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus. In social use they are named with their comital title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koninklijkhuis.nl/globale-paginas/taalrubrieken/english/members-of-the-royal-house/royal-family/prince-friso/|title=Prince Friso|publisher=The Dutch Royal House|accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl] His wife acquired the feminine version of her husband's style and titles as a courtesy title, since it is customary for wives of members of the royal family to take the titles of their husbands.
Referred to from birth as Prince Johan-Friso, in 2004 the royal court announced that he had requested that his first name be simply "Friso" without the prefix "Johan".
