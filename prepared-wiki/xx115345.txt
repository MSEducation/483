==Relationships==

The small genus Wesolowskana (formerly known as Luxuria) should possibly be included in this genus.Salticidae.org: Luxuria There is some dispute whether Afraflacilla is a distinct genus or should be included in Pseudicius. Festucula and Marchena are other close relatives, these genera form a monophyletic group.Zabka & Grey 2002
