Once Upon a Time is an American fairy tale drama television series created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who also serve as executive producers alongside Steve Pearlman. It debuted on ABC on October 23, 2011. The first season introduces a bail bond agent, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and her birth-son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) who discover that a New England town, aptly named Storybrooke, Maine, is actually a remnant of a parallel world that was cursed by The Evil Queen/Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) and that all the characters from the fairy tales have no memories of who they were, including the parents of Emma: Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming/David Nolan (Josh Dallas), who sent her to the real world to save their world and break the curse.
Following the curse being eventually broken by Emma, Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) brings magic to Storybrooke and the characters reunite as their true selves. It is revealed that crossing the border surrounding Storybrooke will remove the inhabitants' fairytale memories again. Other main storylines in the second season include David Nolan striving to get Emma Swan and Mary Margaret Blanchard back from the Enchanted Forest, Regina contending with her powerful mother Cora (Barbara Hershey), the revelation of Rumplestiltskin's son Baelfire also being Henry's father - under his real-world alias Neal Cassidy (Michael Raymond-James), and the outsiders Greg Mendell (Ethan Embry) and Tamara (Sonequa Martin-Green) on their quest to destroy magic from Storybrooke. After failing to use the curse's trigger to destroy the town, the pair kidnap Henry and take him to Neverland. Emma, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, and Mr. Gold joins Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) on his ship to travel through a portal to rescue Henry. Upon arrival in Neverland, Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) retrieves Henry, keeping possession of him with help from the Lost Boys.
