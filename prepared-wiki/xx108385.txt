"I Saw Three Ships (Come Sailing In)" is a traditional and popular Christmas carol from England. A variant of its parent tune "Greensleeves", the earliest printed version of "I Saw Three Ships" is from the 17th century, possibly Derbyshire, and was also published by William Sandys in 1833.Cecil James Sharp (2008) The Morris Book: With a Description of Dances as Performed by the Morris Men The lyrics mention the ships sailing into Bethlehem, but the nearest body of water is the Dead Sea about 20 miles away. The reference to three ships is thought to originate in the three ships that bore the purported relics of the Biblical magi to Cologne Cathedral in the 12th century.Website describing the carol and giving secondary references Another possible reference is to Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, who bore a coat of arms 'Azure three galleys argent'*. Another thought was the three kings that came to baby Jesus.
