==Career==

Ewing first began to garner national attention during the mid-1980s both as a songwriter and recording artist for MCA and Capitol Records. His 1988 debut The Coast of Colorado produced the number 3 hit "Burnin' a Hole in My Heart" and four other top 20 country hits. The Will to Love included the top 5 hit "It's You Again". Although none of Ewing's subsequent chart entries made Top 40, he released eight more albums from 1990 to 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/skip-ewing-mn0000015072|title=Skip Ewing biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=Allmusic|accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl]
Ewing is a notable attendee of Columbine High School in Jefferson County, Colorado, and Redlands High School in Redlands, California.
In 2008, he served as the duet partner of the radio version of Reba McEntire's single, "Every Other Weekend." While also co-writing this single, the song reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. Although the song was credited for one week to Ewing and Kenny Chesney as "Every Other Weekend with Reba McEntire and Skip Ewing or Kenny Chesney" the song was thereafter credited to McEntire alone on the charts.

Additionally, Ewing has received a CMA Song of the Year nomination, a Grammy nomination, a Tony nomination and multiple BMI "Million Air" awards.
