Balch Fieldhouse is a 4,000, at one point seating 7,000, seat multi-purpose arena in Boulder, Colorado.  It opened in 1937.  It was home to the University of Colorado Buffaloes basketball teams until the Coors Events Center opened in 1979.
The Fieldhouse includes an annex that is home to the University of Colorado's Track and Field and Cross Country and Sports Information Offices. The fieldhouse is where the track and cross country teams meet for practice during the winter. Track meets are also regularly held by Colorado during the indoor track season. USATF also holds meets on the weekends for athletes participating in club track and field. 
The past 3 years, in November it has played host to the Boulder Qualifier for FIRST Lego League, where about 40 teams compete for a chance to advance to the state tournament.
