==Film career==

Deneuve was thirteen when she began her film career with a small role in André Hunebelle's Les Collégiennes (1957) with her younger sister Sylvie Dorléac, who acted in a few films casually as a child.[tpl]cite web|title=Catherine Deneuve interviewed by Arnaud Despelchin|publisher= Film Comment magazine (November/December 2008 edition)|url= http://www.filmcomment.com/article/catherine-deneuve-interviewed-by-arnaud-desplechin[/tpl] Deneuve was credited as Catherine Dorléac but subsequently used her mother's maiden name as her stage name in order to differentiate herself from her sisters.
After seeing Deneuve in L'Homme à femmes (1960), Jacques Demy cast her in his 1964 musical
Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, the film that brought her to stardom. Deneuve first portrayed the cold but erotic persona, for which she would be nicknamed the "ice maiden", in Roman Polanski's suspense classic Repulsion (1965), reinforcing it in Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour (1967), and reaching a peak in Tristana (1970).[tpl]cite news |title=Philip French's Screen Legends, The Observer Review, p.12 |date=1 February 2009 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/feb/01/catherine-deneuve-philip-french-screenlegends | location=London |work=The Guardian[/tpl] Her work for Buñuel would be her most famous.[tpl]Cite book | first = Maxine | last = Block | coauthors = Anna Herthe Rothe, Marjorie Dent Candee, Charles Moritz | publisher=H.W.

Further prominent films from this early time in her career included Jean-Paul Rappeneau's La Vie de château (1966), and Demy's musical Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (1967). Deneuve remained active in European films during the 1960s and 1970s, though she limited her appearances in American movies of the period to The April Fools (1969), a romantic comedy with Jack Lemmon, and Hustle (1975), a crime drama with Burt Reynolds. Her starring roles at the time were featured in such films as Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres (1972) with Marcello Mastroianni and Le Sauvage (1975) with Yves Montand.
In the 1980s, Deneuve's films included François Truffaut's Le Dernier métro (1980), for which she won the César Award for Best Actress, and Tony Scott's The Hunger (1983) as a bisexual vampire, co-starring with David Bowie and Susan Sarandon, a role which brought her a significant lesbian following.[tpl]Cite news | first = Matthew | last = Sweet | title = My lips are sealed...In her new film, 8 Women, the French icon Catherine Deneuve shares a kiss with her co-star Fanny Ardant.

In the early 1990s, Deneuve's more significant roles included 1992's Indochine opposite Vincent Perez, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and won a second César Award for Best Actress; and André Téchiné's two movies, Ma saison préférée (1993) and Les Voleurs (1996). In 1997, Deneuve was the protagonist in the music video for the song N'Oubliez Jamais sung by Joe Cocker. In 1998 she won acclaim and the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival for her performance in Place Vendôme. In the late 1990s, Deneuve continued to appear in a large number of films such as 1999's five films Est-Ouest, Le temps retrouvé, Pola X, Belle maman, and Le Vent de la nuit.
In 2000, Deneuve's part in Lars von Trier's musical drama Dancer in the Dark alongside Icelandic singer Björk was subject to considerable critical scrutiny. The film was selected for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. She made another foray into Hollywood the following year, starring in The Musketeer (2001) for Peter Hyams. In 2002, she shared the Silver Bear Award for Best Ensemble Cast at the Berlin International Film Festival for her performance in 8 Women. In 2005, Deneuve published her diary A l'ombre de moi-meme ("In My Own Shadow", published in English as Close Up and Personal: The Private Diaries of Catherine Deneuve); in it she writes about her experiences shooting the films Indochine and Dancer in the Dark. She also provided the voice role of Marjane Satrapi's mother in Satrapi's animated autobiographical film Persepolis (2007), based on the graphic novel of the same name.
Deneuve's more recent work includes Potiche (2010) and Les Bien-aimés (2011), in which she acts alongside her real-life daughter Chiara Mastroianni. During an interview at the Cannes Film Festival with Ali Naderzad, Deneuve was asked which was her own favorite film. "I still say it was The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. To do a film completely with music like an opera was an incredible experience. But to work with music all the time, it's such a lift, you know? It's an opera, it's very different."Naderzad, Ali (16 May 2007), "Catherine Deneuve in Cannes", Screen Comment. Deneuve continues to work steadily making at least two or three films per year.
