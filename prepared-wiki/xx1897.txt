The Cemetery H culture developed out of the northern part of the Indus Valley Civilization around 1700 BCE, in and around western Punjab region located in present-day India and Pakistan. It was named after a cemetery found in "area H" at Harappa.
The Cemetery H culture is part of the Punjab Phase, one of three cultural phases that developed in the Localization Era of the Indus Valley Tradition.[tpl]harvnb|Kenoyer|1991a[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Shaffer|1992[/tpl] It is considered to be part of the Late Harappan phase.
Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE. Together with the Gandhara grave culture and the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, it is considered by some scholars a nucleus of Vedic civilization. 
Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture, considered the formative stage of Vedic civilization. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers "both cremated (agnidagdhá-) and uncremated (ánagnidagdha-)" are invoked.Dudi, Amar Singh.

The Cemetery H culture also "shows clear biological affinities" with the earlier population of Harappa.[tpl]harvnb|Kennedy|2000|p=312[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=103, 310[/tpl]
The archaeologist Kenoyer noted that this culture "may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past."[tpl]harvnb|Kenoyer|1991b|p=56[/tpl]
