==Unknown noise PDF==

We now describe the system design of  for the case that the structure of the noise
PDF is unknown. The following model is considered for this scenario:
In addition, the message functions are limited to have the form
design of the decision intervals is also optimal in the following
sense. The above design requires
an optimal (and a more complex) design of the decision intervals
the number of sensors is nearly optimal. It is also argued in 
that if the targeted MSE

the unconstrained bandwidth settings.

==Additional information==

The design of the sensor array requires optimizing the power
allocation as well as minimizing the communication traffic of the
entire system. The design suggested in  incorporates probabilistic quantization in
sensors and a simple optimization program that is solved in the
fusion center only once. The fusion center then broadcasts a set
of parameters to the sensors that allows them to finalize their
constraints. Another work employs a similar approach to address
distributed detection in wireless sensor arrays.[ref]
