Alternative Press reviewer Evan Lucy rated the album 3/5, saying that "Fans of We the Kings' debut will undoubtedly find something to hold onto with Smile Kid, but for those who were less than enamored with the band's pop-punk blend will likely stay that way." He said although the band "have expanded their previously narrow sound", he was still dissuaded by the band's failure to branch out musically; "Until the band are willing to step outside further outside the musical box and Clark is willing to belt it out, We the Kings will remain good, not great--and still on the verge of pop-punk royalty."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/reviews/smilekid.htm|title=File Under: Pop-punk - We The Kings - Smile Kid|work=Alternative Press|last=Lucy|first=Evan|accessdate=2009-12-09[/tpl]
