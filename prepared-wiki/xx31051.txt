C-SPAN ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|s|p|æ|n[/tpl]), an acronym for Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network, is a private, nonprofit American cable television network, created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a public service that televises many proceedings of the federal government, as well as other public affairs programming. The C-SPAN network includes three television channels (C-SPAN, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3), one radio station and a group of websites that provide streaming media and archives of C-SPAN programs. C-SPAN's television channels are available to approximately 100 million cable and satellite households within the United States, while WCSP-FM, also called C-SPAN Radio, is broadcast on FM radio in Washington, D.C., and is available throughout the U.S. on XM Satellite Radio, via Internet streaming, and through apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices.
The network televises U.S. political events, particularly live and "gavel-to-gavel" coverage of the U.S. Congress as well as occasional proceedings of the Canadian and British Parliaments and major events worldwide. Its coverage of political and policy events is unedited, thereby providing viewers (or listeners) with unfiltered information about politics and government. Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy. C-SPAN is a nonprofit organization, funded by a 6-cent per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates, and does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of the content of its programming.

==History==

===Development===

Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's chairman and former chief executive officer, first conceived of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. bureau chief of cable industry trade magazine Cablevision.[tpl]cite book |title=Peer Participation and Software: What Mozilla Has to Teach Government |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010 |first=David R. |last=Booth |page=81 |isbn=978-0-262-51461-3[/tpl]  It was a time of rapid growth in the number of cable television channels available in the U.S., and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/04/20/41591/cspan-the-other-washington-monument |title=C-SPAN: The Other Washington Monument |date=April 20, 2010 |work=tvnewscheck.com |publisher=News Check Media |accessdate=November 30, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Legislative Television As Political Advertising: A Public Choice Approach |publisher=iUniverse |first=Franklin G. |last=Mixon |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-595-27086-6 |page=2[/tpl] Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network.

Lamb semi-retired in March 2012, coinciding with the channel's 33rd anniversary, and gave executive control of the network to his two lieutenants, Rob Kennedy and Susan Swain.

===Anniversaries===

C-SPAN had its 10th anniversary in 1989 and celebrated with a three-hour retrospective, featuring Lamb recalling the development of the network.[tpl]cite news |title=C-SPAN, America's Town Hall; Looking Back on the Decade That Brought Government Home |author=Tom Shales |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1183350.html |date=April 3, 1989 |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl] The 15th anniversary was commemorated in a more unusual manner; the network facilitated a series of re-enactments of the seven historic Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858, which were televised from August to October 1994, and have been rebroadcast from time to time ever since.[tpl]cite news |title=Historic debates will mark 15 years of C-SPAN |author=Ann Hodges |newspaper=The Houston Chronicle |page=4 |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SJB-93Y0-0030-W550&csi=8380&oc=00240&perma=true |date=March 19, 1994 |accessdate=May 22, 2013[/tpl] Five years later, the series American Presidents: Life Portraits served as a year-long observation of C-SPAN's 20th anniversary.[tpl]cite web|title=American Presidents: Life Portraits|url=http://www.americanpresidents.org/|publisher=C-SPAN[/tpl]

===Scope and limitations of coverage===

C-SPAN continues to expand its coverage of government proceedings, with a history of requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court.[tpl]cite news |title=C-SPAN seeks to air Supreme Court healthcare arguments |author=David G.

===Expansion and technology===

Since the late 1990s, C-SPAN has significantly expanded its online presence. In January 1997, C-SPAN began real-time streaming of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 on its website, the first time Congress had been live streamed online. To cover the Democratic and Republican conventions and the presidential debates of 2008, C-SPAN created two standalone websites: the Convention Hub and the Debate Hub.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2008/09/26/don%E2%80%99t-like-twitter%E2%80%99s-election-site-c-span-has-a-way-cooler-alternative-really/ |title=Don't like Twitter's Election Site?

C-SPAN began promoting audience interaction early in its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009, viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show Washington Journal. The network also has a Facebook page to which it added occasional live streaming in January 2011. The live stream is intended to show selected well-publicized events of Congress.[tpl]cite web |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/01/05/c-span-goes-social-streams-112th-congress-live-on-facebook/ |title=C-SPAN Goes Social: Streams 112th Congress Live on Facebook |author=Samantha Rollins |date=January 5, 2011 |work=Time.com |publisher=Time |accessdate=January 28, 2011[/tpl] In June 2010, C-SPAN joined with the website Foursquare to provide users of the application with access to geotagged C-SPAN content at various locations in Washington, D.C.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/06/22/Foursquare-CSPAN-Digital-Bus.aspx |title=Foursquare Checks Into Politics With C-SPAN |author=Sheila Shayon |date=June 22, 2010 |work=Brandchannel.com |publisher=Brandchannel |accessdate=November 22, 2010[/tpl]

==Programming==

===Senate and House of Representatives===

The C-SPAN network's core programming is live coverage of the U.S. House and Senate, with the C-SPAN channel emphasizing the United States House of Representatives. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action. C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted live coverage of the United States Senate. With coverage of the House and Senate, viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress. Important debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the Persian Gulf conflict during 1991, and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. When the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels broadcast other public affairs programming.[tpl]cite press release |title=C-SPAN2 to be Added to PRIMESTAR's Channel Lineup |url= |publisher=C-SPAN |date=December 4, 1996[/tpl]

===Public affairs===

The public affairs coverage on the C-SPAN networks other than the House and Senate floor debates is wide-ranging. C-SPAN is considered a useful source of information for journalists, lobbyists, educators and government officials as well as casual viewers interested in politics, due to its unedited coverage of political events. C-SPAN has been described by media observers as a "window into the world of Washington politics" and it characterizes its own mission as being "to provide public access to the political process".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/About/About-C-SPAN/ | title=About C-SPAN |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN | accessdate=January 25, 2011[/tpl] The networks cover U.S. political campaigns, including the Republican, Democratic, and Libertarian presidential nominating conventions in their entirety. Coverage of presidential campaign events are provided during the duration of the campaign, both by a weekly television program, Road to the White House, and at its dedicated politics website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/politics/ |title=C-SPAN Politics |author= |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl] C-SPAN also covers midterm elections.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/c-span-reaches-debate-milestone_b23226?c=rss  |title=C-SPAN Reaches Debate Milestone |author=Betsy Rothstein |date=October 20, 2010 |work=mediabistro.com |publisher=Mediabistro.com |accessdate=June 19, 2013[/tpl]

In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts press conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National Press Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/10/08/c-spans-supreme-court-broadcasts-do-you-have-the-right-to-burn/ |title=C-SPAN's Supreme Court Broadcasts: Do You Have the Right to Burn the Flag? |author=Andrew Cohen |date=October 8, 2010 |work=politicsdaily.com |publisher=AOL |accessdate=October 11, 2010[/tpl]
Occasionally, proceedings of the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, Parliament of the United Kingdom (usually Prime Minister's Questions and the State Opening of Parliament) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S.[tpl]cite press release |title=BBC Parliament Goes Live On Digital Satellite |url= |publisher=M2 Presswire |date=November 25, 1998[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/organization/40947 |title=Australian Parliament |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=July 16, 2013[/tpl] Similarly, the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports from around the world when major events occur—for instance, C-SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks.

With its public affairs programming, C-SPAN intends to offer different points of view, by allowing time for multiple opinions to be discussed on a given topic. For example, in 2004 C-SPAN intended to televise a speech by Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt adjacent to a speech by Holocaust denier David Irving, who had unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for libel in the United Kingdom four years earlier; C-SPAN was criticized for its use of the word "balance" to describe the plan to cover both Lipstadt and Irving.[tpl]cite web |title=C-SPAN's David Irving contretemps |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/individuals/david_irving/irving_update_20050413.htm |date=April 13, 2005 |work=adl.org |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=July 29, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=C-SPAN's Balance of the Absurd |author=Richard Cohen |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35346-2005Mar14.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl] When Lipstadt ended media access to her speech, C-SPAN canceled coverage of both.[tpl]cite web|title=Lipstadt/Irving Libel Trial |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Lipst |work=c-spanvideo.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=March 22, 2011[/tpl]
The network strives for neutrality and a lack of bias; in all programming when on-camera hosts are present their role is simply to facilitate and explain proceedings to the viewer. Due to this policy, no C-SPAN host has said his or her own name on television.

C-SPAN has occasionally produced spinoff programs from Booknotes focusing on specific topics.

Prior to the initiation of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as Metavid and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage.

As of 2012, C-SPAN received six cents of each subscriber's cable bill for an annual budget of $60 million.[tpl]cite news |title=C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb starts new chapter in his life |author=Emmanuel Touhey |url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/cover-stories/220849-c-span-founder-brian-lamb-starts-a-new-life-chapter |newspaper=The Hill |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl] As the network is an independent entity, neither the cable industry nor Congress controls the content of its programming.

There are not any official viewing statistics for C-SPAN because the network, which has no commercials or underwriting advertisements, does not use the Nielsen ratings. However, there have been a number of surveys providing estimates: 

==Public and media opinion==

A 2009 C-SPAN survey of viewers found that the network's most-valued attribute was its balanced programming. The survey's respondents were a mixed group, with 31 percent describing themselves as "liberal," while 28 percent described themselves as "conservative", and the survey found that C-SPAN viewers are an equal mixture of men and women of all age groups.[tpl]cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/30Years/media-release.aspx#30years |title=Marking 30 years.

==Must-carry==

In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which required cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected the availability of C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue the channel altogether.[tpl]cite news |title=C-SPAN Cut in 95 Cities Around the Country For Total Loss of About Four Million Viewers Brian Lamb Says Competition for Air Time May Lead Network to Liven Up Its Format |author=Alice A.
