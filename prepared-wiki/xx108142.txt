Give Blood is the debut album from the Brighton-based band, Brakes. The album was recorded onto 2" tape and mixed onto 1/4" tape in January 2005. Brakes and their 22-year old producer, Iain Gore, also removed all computer screens from the studio for the week and all the tracks were recorded live, with the duets being recorded around one mike. The only overdubs were lap steel on "Jackson" by bassist Marc Beatty, piano by drummer Alex White and guitar by Tom White on "I Can't Stand To Stand Beside You".
The album also features Matt Eaton of Actress Hands on "The Most Fun", Liela Moss of The Duke Spirit on "Jackson" and Rose, Becki and Julia of The Pipettes on "Sometimes Always".
The album was voted best of 2005 by the prestigious indie music shop Rough Trade.
