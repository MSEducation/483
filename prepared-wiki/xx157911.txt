NAI experienced a dramatic shift in its financial situation when NuSkin Enterprises, one of NAIâ€™s largest customers, did not renew its manufacturing contract and began the process of transferring to another manufacturer. Sales subsequently declined 15.5% from $67.9 million USD in 1998, with a net profit of $5.9 million, to $57.4 million in 1999, with a net loss of $2.9 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/13/13791.html |title=Natural Alternatives International, Inc. |accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=fundinguniverse.com[/tpl]
