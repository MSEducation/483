[[Agta (mythical creature)]]

CATEGORIES: Philippine legendary creatures

Agta is a tall creature, with skin as black as charcoal. These creatures reside in different trees. Among its favorite residences are Santo and Balete Trees. These are known to climb down from its tree and roam around the land warning fishermen to stay on land instead of fishing. Then, the Agta will push trees down so that the timbers will prevent the fishermen from going to the sea to fish. Agta is just like the kapre, who likes staying on their trees while smoking a roll of cigar. They are usually naked.http://awitchinmanila.wordpress.com/occult-manila/mythical-creatures-of-the-philippines
