[[Telisha]]

CATEGORIES: Cantillation marks

Telisha (Hebrew: [tpl]Hebrew|תְּלִישָא[/tpl]) is one of two cantillation marks found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. There are two versions of the Telisha: Telisha ketana ([tpl]Hebrew|תְּלִישָא קְטַנָּה[/tpl]) and Telisha gedola ([tpl]Hebrew|תְּלִישָא גְּדוֹלָה[/tpl]), the latter of which has a longer melody and higher peak. The Telisha trope can occur independently or can follow a Pazer or one of several other trope sounds. The Telisha ketana must be followed by a Kadma.A compendious grammar of the Hebrew language By G. F. R. Weidemann, page 49
The Hebrew word [tpl]Hebrew|1= תְּ֠לִישָא[/tpl] translates into English as detached. This is because they are never linked to the following note as a single phrase. [tpl]Hebrew|קְטַנָּה[/tpl] refers to little (the shorter note) and [tpl]Hebrew|גְדוֹלָה[/tpl] to great (the longer note).
The Telisha gedola can be found in the Torah 266 times.Concordance of the Hebrew accents in the Hebrew Bible: Concordance ..., Volume 1 By James D. Price, page 241 The Telisha ketana occurs 451 times.

While the names "Telisha Ketana" and "Telisha Gedola" are 6 syllables each, they are usually applied to words with far fewer syllables, often just one. In one-syllable words, only the notes leading to and from the peak are included. In multiple-syllable words, the additional syllables are recited at the level of the first note leading up to the peak.
