This is a list of Members of Parliament (MPs) elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, held on 7 June.
The list is arranged by constituency. New MPs elected since the general election and changes in party allegiance are noted at the bottom of the page. This Parliament was dissolved in 2005.

==Composition==

The effective government majority was slightly higher because Sinn Féin members do not take up their seats and the speaker does not vote. Speaker Michael Martin technically represented Labour in a notional majority.
