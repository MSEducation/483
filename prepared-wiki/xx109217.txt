Baleshwar Temple is ancient temple dedicated to Shiva, situated within city of Champawat in Uttarakhand. 
Built by the rulers of the Chand dynasty, Baleshwar Temple is a marvelous symbol of stone carving. There isn't any historical manuscript that dates the Baleshwar temple, however it is believed to have been built between the 10th and 12th century AD.

==Overview==

The main Baleshwar temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva (who is also known as Baleshwar). There are two other temples in the compound of Baleshwar, one dedicated to Ratneshwar and other to Champawati Durga.  Close to the Baleshwar Temple is a "Naula" (freshwater resource) which has now dried up. On the day of Mahashivratri, a very crowded fair is held in the Baleshwar Temple compound.
The exteriors of Ratneshwar and Champawati Durga temples are carved with the different posters of the local deities.
