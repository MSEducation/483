The Pre-Pyrenees are the foothills of the Pyrenees.

==Description==

As a mountainous system the Pre-Pyrenees are part of the Pyrenees. They run parallel to the main mountain range in a west to east direction. At the eastern end lies the area known as the Sub-Pyrenees.
On the French side the Pyrenees's slopes descend rather abruptly, thus on the northern side, the Pre-Pyrenees are confined to the Corbi√®res Range, towards the eastern end of the mountain system. The Massif de Plantaurel further west deserves mention as well, although not as clearly a foothill.
On the Iberian side, however, the picture is very different: a large and complex system of foothill ranges stretches from Navarre, across northern Aragon, reaching the Mediterranean coast on the Catalan end of the Pyrenees.

==Main ranges==

Although the highest peaks in the Pre-Pyrenees are not as high as those in the Pyrenees proper, some summits reach [tpl]convert|2600|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The main ranges include:
Northern Slope:
Southern Slope:
