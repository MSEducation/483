Rumworth is an electoral ward of Bolton, in Greater Manchester, England. Historically it was part of the hundred of Salford in Lancashire and centre of the Parish of  Deane which once covered roughly half of the present Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. The church of St Mary on which the parish was centred was in the township of Rumworth.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Rumworth/ParishMap.shtml|title=Rumworth Township Map|publisher=genuki.org |accessdate=2010-01-16[/tpl]

==History==

Rumworth was recorded as Rumhworth in 1242, Rumworth in 1278, Rumwrth in 1292 and Romeworthe in 1346. 
Rumworth was joined with Lostock as the third part of a knight's fee in 1212, held of the lords of Manchester. Later the Andertons of Lostock claimed a manor in Rumworth where there were fourteen oxgangs of land. The manor was bought by the Hultons of Over Hulton and it descended in this family. Sir Charles Tempest, the heir of the Andertons, had a large estate in the township. Contributors to the land tax in 1789 were Henry Blundell, who paid the largest share, Blackburne, and William Hulton. 
The population in the area increased in the 19th century as a result of the coal mines and erection of a cotton-mill and of weaving sheds.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Rumworth/ | title =Rumworth| publisher = Genuki| accessdate = 2010-01-09[/tpl]
