CATEGORIES: Organisations based in the United Kingdom

The British Numismatic Trade Association is an association formed by a majority of the leading United Kingdom coin dealers. Originally formed to represent the trade in discussions with UK Customs & Excise regarding value-added tax on coins, it has developed, becoming a part of the fight against forgery, theft and other criminal activities.  This helped to establish a benchmark for the highest ethical standards in the domestic coin trade. Members receive early warning notices of counterfeit coins and stolen property.
The BNTA is a member of FENAP, the Federation of European Numismatic Associations.
