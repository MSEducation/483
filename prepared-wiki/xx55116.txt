In an effort to keep the past from repeating itself, Jamil Neate brings together a crew of Vultures to search for Newtypes and protect them from being exploited. As they try to carry out this task, an old government rises from the ashes to try and unify the Earth as other forces slowly fan the flames of war once more between the newly formed New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. Now the crew of the Freeden face a multitude of enemies as they try to prevent another catastrophic war.

But when they open the cockpit they discover the pilot of the mobile suit is still inside of it and in a state of suspended animation. Awakening him they make their escape from the ship and defeat the mercenaries that turned on Rosa II.

Mirage Weiß, the captain of the Vulture ship Mirage, decides to take Kai to a Newtype Lab after Kai starts to suffer a mental break down. When they arrive to find the Newtype Lab destroyed, Kai leaves the ship and uncovers the powerful Gundam Belphagor, and battles Rick as he pilots the black Gundam X. Rick is rescued by Rosa II when she arrives in her G-Falcon, and together they flee as Kai destroys the Mirage with a single shot from the Gundam Belphagor's weapons. Joining up with a quirky female mechanic named Mana, a survivor of the destruction of Fort Severn by Carris Nautilus in the anime, they repaint and repair the Gundam X. Together they start a pursuit of Kai, who has now joined a mysterious organization that have rebuilt D.O.M.E., the true purpose of why and what the group intends are unknown.
