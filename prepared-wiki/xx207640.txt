[[Kindling model]]

CATEGORIES: Neurological disorders, Neurology, Epilepsy

Kindling is a commonly used model for the development of seizures and epilepsy in which the duration and behavioral involvement of induced seizures increases after seizures are induced repeatedly. The kindling model was first proposed in the late 1960s by Goddard and colleagues.  Although kindling is a widely used model, its applicability to human epilepsy is controversial.

The word kindling is a metaphor: the increase in response to small stimuli is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire.[ref][tpl]cite book |chapter=The kindling model of epilepsy |author=Abel MS, McCandless DW |editor=Adams RN, Baker GB, Baker JM, Bateson AN, Boisvert DPJ, Boulton AA, et al. |title=Neuromethods: Animal Models of Neurological Disease |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=1992 |pages=153–155 |isbn=0-89603-211-6 [/tpl]

A seizure may increase the likelihood that more seizures will occur; an old saying in epilepsy research is "seizures beget seizures".  Repeated stimulation "lowers the threshold" for more seizures to occur.[ref][tpl]cite journal|title=The pathophysiology of post traumatic epilepsy|author=PK Sahoo, KI Mathai, GV Ramdas, MN Swamy |journal=Indian Journal of Neurotrauma|volume=4| issue=1 |pages=11–14|year=2007 |url=http://www.ijntonline.com/June07/abstracts/03.PDF|format=PDF[/tpl]

The brains of experimental animals are repeatedly stimulated, usually with electricity, to induce the seizures.  Chemicals may also be used to induce seizures.  The seizure that occurs after the first such electrical stimulation lasts a short time and is accompanied by a small amount of behavioral effects compared with seizures that result from repeated stimulations. With further seizures, the accompanying behavior intensifies, for example progressing from freezing in early stimulations to convulsions in later ones. The lengthening of duration and intensification of behavioral accompaniment eventually reaches a plateau after repeated stimulation.  Even if animals are left unstimulated for as long as 12 weeks, the effect remains; the response to stimulation remains higher than it had been before.
It has been reported that repeated seizure stimulation can result in spontaneous seizures, but studies have had conflicting findings on this question.  In humans, some seizure disorders come to an end by themselves even after large numbers of seizures.  However, in both human epilepsy and in some animal models, evidence suggests that a process like that found in kindling does occur.

==Historical perspective==

Already in the 1950s and 1960s, numerous authors recognized the seizure-inducing potenital of focal stimulation.[ref]
