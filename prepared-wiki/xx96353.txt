Coalbed methane (CBM or coal-bed methane),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bg-group.com/Careers/graduates/howtoapply/Pages/JargonBuster.aspx|title=Jargon Buster|publisher=BG Group|accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl] coalbed gas, coal seam gas (CSG), or coal-mine methane (CMM) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds.Coal Gas, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 25.11.2011 In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.
The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal. It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of hydrogen sulphide. The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining, where it presents a serious safety risk. Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption. The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas condensate. It often contains up to a few percent carbon dioxide. Some coal seams, such as those in certain areas of the Illawarra Coal Measures in NSW, Australia, contain little methane, with the predominant coal seam gas being carbon dioxide.[tpl]cite web|title=Briefing Note - Lord Mayor - Response to SRACSG - Coal Seam Methane|url=http://www.nogasmininginsydney.com/Briefing%20Note%20-%20Lord%20Mayor-%20Response%20to%20SRACSG%20-%20Coal%20Seam%20Methane.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl]

==History==

Coalbed methane grew out of venting methane from coal seams. Some coal beds have long been known to be "gassy," and as a safety measure, boreholes were drilled into the seams from the surface, and the methane allowed to vent before mining.
Coalbed methane as a natural-gas resource received a major push from the US federal government in the late 1970s. Federal price controls were discouraging natural gas drilling by keeping natural gas prices below market levels; at the same time, the government wanted to encourage more gas production. The US Department of Energy funded research into a number of unconventional gas sources, including coalbed methane. Coalbed methane was exempted from federal price controls, and was also given a federal tax credit.
In Australia, commercial extraction of coal seam gas began in 1996 in the Bowen Basin of Queensland.Geoscience Australia, Coal seam gas, accessed 10 Oct. 2013.

==Reservoir properties==

Gas contained in coal bed methane is mainly methane and trace quantities of ethane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and few other gases. Intrinsic properties of coal as found in nature determine the amount of gas that can be recovered.

===Porosity===

The porosity of coal bed reservoirs is usually very small, ranging from 0.1 to 10%.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Adsorption capacity===

Adsorption capacity of coal is defined as the volume of gas adsorbed per unit mass of coal usually expressed in SCF (standard cubic feet, the volume at standard pressure and temperature conditions) gas/ton of coal. The capacity to adsorb depends on the rank and quality of coal. The range is usually between 100 to 800 SCF/ton for most coal seams found in the US. Most of the gas in coal beds is in the adsorbed form. When the reservoir is put into production, water in the fracture spaces is pumped off first. This leads to a reduction of pressure enhancing desorption of gas from the matrix.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Fracture permeability===

As discussed before, the fracture permeability acts as the major channel for the gas to flow. The higher the permeability, the higher the gas production. For most coal seams found in the US, the permeability lies in the range of 0.1–50 milliDarcies. The permeability of fractured reservoirs changes with the stress applied to them. Coal displays a stress-sensitive permeability and this process plays an important role during stimulation and production operations.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Thickness of formation and initial reservoir pressure===

The thickness of the formation may not be directly proportional to the volume of gas produced in some areas.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
For example, it has been observed in the Cherokee Basin in Southeast Kansas that a well with a single zone of [tpl]convert|1|to|2|ft|m|1[/tpl] of pay can produce excellent gas rates, whereas an alternative formation with twice the thickness can produce next to nothing. Some coal (and shale) formations may have high gas concentrations regardless of the formation's thickness, probably due to other factors of the area's geology.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The pressure difference between the well block and the sand face should be as high as possible as is the case with any producing reservoir in general.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Other properties===

Other affecting parameters include coal density, initial gas-phase concentration, critical gas saturation, irreducible water saturation, relative permeability to water and gas at conditions of Sw = 1.0 and Sg = 1-Swirreducible respectively.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Extraction==

To extract the gas, a steel-encased hole is drilled into the coal seam [tpl]convert|100|to|1500|m|ft[/tpl] below ground. As the pressure within the coal seam declines due to natural production or the pumping of water from the coalbed, both gas and produced water come to the surface through tubing. Then the gas is sent to a compressor station and into natural gas pipelines. The produced water is either reinjected into isolated formations, released into streams, used for irrigation, or sent to evaporation ponds. The water typically contains dissolved solids such as sodium bicarbonate and chloride but varies depending on the formation geology.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Coalbed methane wells often produce at lower gas rates than conventional reservoirs, typically peaking at near [tpl]convert|300000|cuft|m3[/tpl] per day (about 0.100 m³/s), and can have large initial costs. The production profiles of CBM wells are typically characterized by a "negative decline" in which the gas production rate initially increases as the water is pumped off and gas begins to desorb and flow. A dry CBM well is similar to a standard gas well.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The methane desorption process follows a curve (of gas content vs. reservoir pressure) called a Langmuir isotherm. The isotherm can be analytically described by a maximum gas content (at infinite pressure), and the pressure at which half that gas exists within the coal. These parameters (called the Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, respectively) are properties of the coal, and vary widely. A coal in Alabama and a coal in Colorado may have radically different Langmuir parameters, despite otherwise similar coal properties.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
As production occurs from a coal reservoir, the changes in pressure are believed to cause changes in the porosity and permeability of the coal. This is commonly known as matrix shrinkage/swelling. As the gas is desorbed, the pressure exerted by the gas inside the pores decreases, causing them to shrink in size and restricting gas flow through the coal. As the pores shrink, the overall matrix shrinks as well, which may eventually increase the space the gas can travel through (the cleats), increasing gas flow.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The potential of a particular coalbed as a CBM source depends on the following criteria. Cleat density/intensity: cleats are joints confined within coal sheets. They impart permeability to the coal seam. A high cleat density is required for profitable exploitation of CBM. Also important is the maceral composition: maceral is a microscopic, homogeneous, petrographic entity of a corresponding sedimentary rock. A high vitrinite composition is ideal for CBM extraction, while inertinite hampers the same.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The rank of coal has also been linked to CBM content: a vitrinite reflectance of 0.8–1.5% has been found to imply higher productivity of the coalbed.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The gas composition must be considered, because natural gas appliances are designed for gas with a heating value of about 1000 BTU (British thermal units) per cubic foot, or nearly pure methane. If the gas contains more than a few percent non-flammable gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, either these will have to be removed or it will have to be blended with higher-BTU gas to achieve pipeline quality. If the methane composition of the coalbed gas is less than 92%, it may not be commercially marketable.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Environmental impacts==

===Methane===

As with all carbon based fossil fuels, burning coalbed methane releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. CBM production also involves leaks of fugitive methane into the atmosphere. Methane is rated as having 72 times more effect on global warming than CO2. over 25 years,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Table 2.14, Chap. 2, p. 212 Analysis of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources indicates that generating electricity from CBM, as with conventional natural gas, has less than half the greenhouse gas effect of coal.Timothy J. Skone, Life-cycle analysis, 12 May 2011.
In the United States, methane escaping from coal during mining amounts to 10 percent of total methane emissions. Recovery of coal mine methane in advance of mining is seen as a major opportunity to reduce methane emissions.US Environmental Protection Agency, Identifying Opportunities for Methane Recovery at U.S. Coal Mines, EPA 430-K-04-003, Sept. 2008 (Revised Jan. 2009).

===Infrastructure===

CBM wells are connected by a network of roads, pipelines, and compressor stations. Over time, wells may be spaced more closely in order to extract the remaining methane. Decommissioning wells can cause some problems, as shown when a $75,000 fine was levied when "a blockage leaked cancer-causing chemical benzene" into bores near Kingaroy, Queensland.[ref]

===Produced water===

The produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction varies greatly in quality from area to area, but may contain undesirable concentrations of dissolved substances such as salts, naturally present chemicals, heavy metals and radionuclides.[ref]

====Pilliga forest====

Tests carried out on soil and water samples from "holding ponds and spill sites" in the Pilliga forest in New South Wales have shown "elevated levels of chloride and barium" and some "were so saline that they could have killed any plants and animals that came into sustained contact with them " and "would kill any animals that depended on it for drinking". There have been reports of kangaroos, frogs, "wallabies, goannas, turtles" dying either from drowning because of inadequate fencing, or from being poisoned by drinking the produced water.[ref]

In 2012 Eastern Star Gas was fined for "discharging polluted water containing high levels of salt into Bohena Creek" in the Pilliga Scrub.[ref]
</ref> There were "16 spills or leaks of contaminated water" including "serious spills of saline water into woodland and a creek."<ref name=MiningAust>
