The Redding Area Bus Authority is the operator of public transportation in Shasta County, California. Ten local routes serve the city of Redding and its suburban regions, with over 650,000 riders taking advantage of public transportation each year. Buses operate 6 days per week and stops are located at approximately quarter mile intervals. An eleventh route, the Burney Express, serves as a limited-stop weekday commuter line, operating twice per day in each direction. The agency was formed in 1981, and as the population of Redding exploded in the 1990s, service was greatly expanded. The service is administered by the City of Redding and operated by Veolia Transport.
