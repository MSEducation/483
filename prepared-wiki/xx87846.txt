The Illinois River is a tributary, about [tpl]convert|56|mi|km[/tpl] long, of the Rogue River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It drains part of the Klamath Mountains in northern California and southwestern Oregon. The river's main stem begins at the confluence of its east and west forks near Cave Junction in southern Josephine County. Its drainage basin includes Sucker Creek, which rises in the Red Buttes Wilderness, near Whiskey Peak on the California state line. The main stem flows generally northwest in a winding course past Kerby and through the Siskiyou National Forest and Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It joins the Rogue River from the south at Agness on the Curry–Josephine county line, [tpl]convert|27|mi|km[/tpl] from the Pacific Ocean.
The river's lower [tpl]convert|50.4|mi|km[/tpl], from where it enters the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest downstream from Kerby to its confluence with the Rogue River, were designated Wild and Scenic in 1984. Of this, [tpl]convert|28.7|mi|km[/tpl] is protected as wild, [tpl]convert|17.9|mi|km[/tpl] as scenic, and [tpl]convert|3.8|mi|km[/tpl] as recreational.[tpl]cite web|title=Illinois River, Oregon|publisher=National Wild and Scenic Rivers System|url=http://www.rivers.gov/rivers/illinois.php|accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl]

Sucker Creek is named after the state of Illinois, one of whose nicknames is the Sucker State.  Miners from Illinois named the creek.[tpl]cite news|title=Since You Asked: Sucker Creek got its name from Illinois|url=http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110817/NEWS/108170333/-1/NEWSLETTER100|newspaper=Mail Tribune|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group|location=Medford, Oregon|date=17 August 2011|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl]  In 2011, the United States Forest Service worked on a project to improve the creek.[tpl]cite web|title=Sucker Creek Restoration Project|url=http://kdrv.com/news/local/220586|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120327110249/http://kdrv.com/news/local/220586|archivedate=27 March 2012|publisher=KDRV News (Medford, Oregon)|author=Krashesky, Kaylin[/tpl] The project is a fishery rehabilitation project.[tpl]cite news|last=Fattig|first=Paul|title=S.

==Rafting and kayaking==

The Illinois River is "a wilderness river that tests both the skill and strength of boaters".[tpl]cite book|last=Giordano|first=Pete|year=2004|title=Soggy Sneakers: A Paddler's Guide to Oregon's Rivers|edition=fourth|location=Seattle|publisher=Mountaineers Books|pages=122–24|isbn=978-0-89886-815-9[/tpl] For the [tpl]convert|31|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] run along the Wild and Scenic part of the river between upper Oak Flat near Kerby and lower Oak Flat, boaters are far from trails and roads. In fact, it is "the most inaccessible river canyon in the lower 48 states..."[tpl]cite web|url=http://kalmiopsiswild.org/explore-kalmiopsis-wildlands/the-rivers/national-wild-and-scenic-illinoi-river/|title=Oregon's National Wild and Scenic Illinois River|publisher=KalmiopsisWild and Friends of the Kalmiopsis|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl] with sections that are inaccessible, even by trail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cacreeks.com/illinois.htm|title=Illinois River in Oregon|publisher=CAcreeks|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]refn|group="Note"|Interestingly, due to the ruggedness of the canyon, the Illinois River Trail (the path of which run 27 miles somewhat near the Illinois River) never actually reaches the riverbank.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oregonhiking.com/oregon-adventures/100-hikes-on-the-oregon-coast/south-coast-hikes/illinois-river-hike|title=Illinois River|last=Sullivan|first=William L.|publisher=Navillus Press|location=Eugene, Oregon|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl][/tpl] Depending on the water flow, this stretch of the river has eight class IV to IV+ rapids. Green Wall, a class V, "is considerably more difficult and longer than the others" and below it lie [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] of difficult rapids. The river is generally run by raft or kayak during the rainy season, October through April. At flows below [tpl]convert|800|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl], boating is difficult because of exposed rocks, and flows above [tpl]convert|3000|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl] "turn the river into boiling holes and rapids." A heavy rain can turn an ordinary trip into a high-water nightmare.
Permits from the U.S. Forest Service are required (year round) for river trips on the Wild Section of the river (between Briggs Creek and Nancy Creek) and groups are limited to no more than twelve.  However, the permits for non-commercial groups are free and are self issued 24/7, but the permit must also be deposited an Oak Flat to verify the safe completion of the trip.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/1517|title=Illinois - 2 - Miami Bar to Oak Flat (31 miles)|publisher=American Whitewater|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl] Since there is no dam on the Illinois River, river flows are highly dependent upon weather conditions. Changing weather can often result in water levels being too high or two low for safe and successful navigation. Furthermore, since water levels can rise rapidly, potential bad weather can also be the necessary cause for cancelled or postponed trips.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.c-w-r.com/rivers/illinois-river.html|title=Rafting the Illinois River in Oregon|publisher=California Whitewater Rafting|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]refn|group="Note"|In March 1998, a flash flood on the Illinois River resulted in the death of two rafters and required the helicopter rescue of ten others.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonkayaking.net/passages/illinois.html|title=Illinois Flood|last=Griffin|first=John|last2=Brinkman|first2=Jonathan|newspaper=The Oregonian|publisher=Advance Publications|location=Portland, Oregon|date=22 March 1998|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl] Reposted by oregonkayaking.net.[/tpl] Nevertheless, even under acceptable conditions, the Illinois River can still cause casualties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonkayaking.net/passages/erich_fleischman.html|title=Erich Fleischman|last=Quinn|first=Beth|publisher=oregonkayaking.net|date=10 May 2005|accessdate=3 May 2013[/tpl]
