==Professional and political career==

Bayard was elected to the U.S. Senate in a special election on November 7, 1922, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Senator Josiah O. Wolcott. On the same day he was also elected for the full term to follow, in both instances defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Senator T. Coleman du Pont, who had been appointed. During this term, he served in the Democratic minority in the last session of the 67th Congress, and in the 68th, 69th, and 70th Congress.
Bayard lost his bid for a second full term in 1928 to Republican John G. Townsend, Jr., the former Governor. He then lost another bid for a second full term in 1930 to incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Daniel O. Hastings. In all, Bayard served one term and part of another, from November 7, 1922 to March 3, 1929, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Subsequently, he resumed his law practice in Wilmington.

==Death and legacy==

Bayard died at Wilmington and is buried there in the Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery. His son, Alexis I. duPont Bayard, served as Lieutenant Governor of Delaware from 1949 to 1953.
