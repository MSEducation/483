==Career==

In 1924, Hirschfeld traveled to Paris and London, where he studied painting, drawing and sculpture.  When he returned to the United States, a friend, fabled Broadway press agent, Richard Maney, showed one of Hirschfeld's drawings to an editor at the New York Herald Tribune, which got Hirschfeld commissions for that newspaper and then, later, The New York Times.
Hirschfeld's style is unique, and he is considered to be one of the most important figures in contemporary drawing and caricature, having influenced countless artists, illustrators, and cartoonists. His caricatures are almost always drawings of pure line in black ink, into which  Hirschfeld dipped not a pen but a genuine crow’s quill.[tpl]cite web|last=Hirschfeld|first=Al|title=Al Hirschfeld.com|url=http://www.alhirschfeld.com/artwork/originals.html|work=Any Drawing on the Website|publisher=Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd.|accessdate=April 25, 2013[/tpl] 
Readers of The New York Times and other newspapers prior to the time they printed in color will be most familiar with the Hirschfeld drawings that are black ink on white illustration board. However, there is a whole body of Hirschfeld’s work in color.[tpl]cite web|last=Hirschfeld|first=Al|title=Al Hirschfeld's Early Color Portfolio|url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.373143642722636.75572.113374435366226&type=1|work=Hirschfeld's Early Color Portfolio|publisher=Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd.|accessdate=April 25, 2013[/tpl] Hirschfeld’s full-color paintings were commissioned by many magazines, often as the cover. Examples are TV Guide, Life Magazine, American Mercury, Look Magazine, The New York Times Magazine, The New Masses, and Seventeen Magazine.[tpl]cite web|last=Brian|first=Greg|title=The Fall of the TV Guide Empire|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-fall-tv-guide-empire-1300615.html?cat=38|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=April 25, 2013[/tpl] He also illustrated many books in color, most notably among them Harlem As Seen By Hirschfeld, with text by William Saroyan.[tpl]cite book|last=Hirschfeld|first=Al|title=Harlem As Seen By Hirschfeld|year=1941|publisher=Hyperion Press|location=New York[/tpl]      
Hirschfeld’s 1999 portrait of Liza Minnelli is an example of Hirschfeld’s work in color. It is also a fine example of how Hirschfeld achieved what he often sought: to capture a perfect likeness using a minimum number of lines. Hirschfeld achieved the uncanny likeness to Minnelli’s stance with only one line; Hirschfeld’s pen never left the page.[tpl]cite web|last=Hirschfeld|first=Al|title=Liza Minnelli, Minnelli on Minnelli|url=http://www.alhirschfeld.com/cgi-bin/cat_alpha?CAT=A1#L|work=Liza Minnelli, Minnelli on Minnelli|publisher=Margo Feiden Galleries Ltd.|accessdate=May 23, 2013[/tpl]
Hirschfeld himself found nothing interesting about caricatures that exaggerate and distort its subjects' faces. In fact Hirschfeld eschewed the designation of caricaturist altogether, calling himself a “character-ist” instead. Nonetheless he did face some complaints from his editors over the years; in a late-1990s interview with The Comics Journal Hirschfeld recounted how one editor told him his drawings of Broadway's "beautiful people" looked like "a bunch of animals".
