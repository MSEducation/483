Gauss–Markov stochastic processes (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov) are stochastic processes that satisfy the requirements for both Gaussian processes and Markov processes.[tpl]cite book|last=C.

Every Gauss–Markov process X(t) possesses the three following properties:
Property (3) means that every Gauss–Markov process can be synthesized from the standard Wiener process (SWP).

==Properties of the Stationary Gauss-Markov Processes==

Exponential autocorrelation:
A power spectral density (PSD) function that has the same shape as the Cauchy distribution:
(Note that the Cauchy distribution and this spectrum differ by  scale factors.)
The above yields the following spectral factorization:
which is important in Wiener filtering and other areas.
There are also some trivial exceptions to all of the above.
