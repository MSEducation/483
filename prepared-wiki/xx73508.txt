[[Garbage (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Garbage (band) albums, 1995 debut albums, Albums produced by Butch Vig

Garbage is the debut album by American alternative rock group Garbage. It was released in the late summer and autumn of 1995 worldwide, following critical acclaim and promising chart positions for their debut single "Vow", which entered the Billboard Hot 100.
Garbage eventually spent over a year on both the US and UK charts, reaching the top 20 on charts worldwide and receiving multi-platinum certification in numerous territories. The album's success was helped by the band promoting it on a year-long tour, including playing on the European festival circuit and supporting the Smashing Pumpkins throughout 1996, as well as by a run of increasingly successful singles culminating with "Stupid Girl" which in 1997 was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.
Garbage was considered innovative for its fusion of pop melodies with alternative rock, trip-hop and electronica genres and its use of loops and sampling including, amongst other things, The Clash's "Train in Vain", the sound of torn sheets of metal, an air conditioning unit and a broken tape deck.

==Background==

In 1983, Butch Vig and Steve Marker founded Smart Studios in Madison and Vig's production work brought him to the attention of Sub Pop. Vig's old band Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig and Marker's career as producers gained strength."Welcome to Spooner Town", by Andy Davis, Record Collector, issue #209, January 1997 In 1994, as Vig become "kind of burned out on doing really long records," he got together with Duke Erikson and Marker, and they started doing remixes for acts such as U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and House of Pain, featuring different instrumentation, and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. The experience inspired the three men to form a band, where they "wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html|title=BUTCH VIG: Nevermind The Garbage|work=Sound on Sound|date=March 1997|author=Buskin, Richard|accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl] An early comment that their work sounded "like garbage" inspired the band's name.
Vocalist Shirley Manson had been performing with the Edinburgh rock band Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie since 1984.[tpl]cite AV media notes | others=Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie | year=2005 | title=Hammer And Tongs[/tpl] In 1993, several band members, including Manson, changed their name to Angelfish. Their only release, the self-titled Angelfish, did not do any better than the preceding albums by Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie, selling only 10,000 copies.153 F.Supp.2d 462 RADIOACTIVE, J.V., Plaintiff, v.

Initial sessions with Vig on vocals, and the member's past work with all-male groups led to the band's desire for a woman on lead.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml | title=Volume Issue 11/01/94 | publisher=Cafemomo.com | accessdate=2008-02-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |archivedate=1999-10-14[/tpl] Marker was watching 120 Minutes when he saw the music video for Angelfish's "Suffocate Me". He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager Shannon O'Shea tracked Manson down. When Manson was contacted, she didn't know who Vig was and was urged to check the credits on Nevermind, the popular Nirvana album which Vig produced. On April 8, Manson met Erikson, Marker and Vig for the first time in London. Later that evening Vig was informed of Kurt Cobain's suicide. Garbage was put on hold, until Angelfish were touring North America in support of Live."Thanks For Your, Uhh Support, Absolute Garbage DVD. Retrieved 2008-02-24 Erikson, Marker and Vig attended the Metro Chicago date; and Manson was invited to Madison to audition for the band. The audition did not go well, but Manson socialized with the men while there and they found they had a similar taste in music. Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour. Manson called O'Shea and asked to audition again feeling that "it would work out"."Garbage: Behind The Music, VH1, aired March 31, 2002"(Retrieved - 2008-02-05)

==Recording==

In her return to Smart Studios, Manson began to work on skeletal versions of the songs "Queer", "Vow" and "Stupid Girl".""Modern Life Is Rubbish", Melody Maker magazine, March 18, 1995 issue (Retrieved 2008-02-05) While looking for a record deal to put the album out, Garbage sent out demo tapes with no bio, to avoid a bidding war over Vig's production history."Record Collector #209". Retrieved 2008-02-24 Garbage signed with Mushroom U.K. worldwide and to Jerry Moss's label Almo Sounds for North America. Manson's contribution was licensed to both Mushroom and Almo by her label Radioactive.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cafemomo.com/news/9905news.shtml | title=Garbage May 1999 news | publisher=Cafemomo.com |accessdate=2008-02-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010115131800/www.cafemomo.com/news/9905news.shtml |archivedate=2001-01-15[/tpl]
Garbage continued to work on the album throughout the start of 1995, being delayed by Vig's work producing Soul Asylum's Let Your Dim Light Shine album and the songs being "piecemealed together in the studio".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA97&dq=garbage%20%22Only%20Happy%20When%20It%20Rains%22&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Garbage's Serendipitous Success|journal=Billboard|author=Borzillo, Carrie|date=19996-03-23|accessdate=2011-05-25[/tpl] Vig described the composing process as a "disfunctional democracy" where someone would bring a loop or a sample, which was followed by jam sessions where the bandmembers would "find one bar that's kind of cool, load that into our samplers, jam on top of that, and Shirley will ad-lib", with the process continuing until the song was finished, often with "all of the original ideas gone, and the song had somehow mutated into something completely different." Among the songs that were completely reworked, "As Heaven is Wide" went from "a big rock track" to a techno song with Tom Jones-inspired beats, only keeping Erikson's fuzz bass and Manson's vocals from the original recording. Given Vig "got bored spending so many years recording really fast, straightforward punk records", the band "didn't want to approach the Garbage record from the angle of a band playing live", making their songs out of samples that would be processed and reworked in a wall of sound process "to create something that sounded fresh."
A major part of the work was Manson rewriting the song lyrics, which Vig said the band attempted to "write from a woman's perspective and I think, initially, some of them were a little pretentious. But as soon as Shirley came on board she simplified the lyrics so that they were a lot more subtle and worked better as songs." Manson detailed that regarding the previous song sketches, "some of the ideas for lyrics I found unsuitable, and others I liked and worked on with them. I always went to bat for what I believed in."

==Composition==

Garbage has an experimental alternative rock sound that "tried to incorporate different styles and genres, throw it all into a big melting pot and see what would happen", according to Vig.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml | title=The First UK Interview | date=1994-11-01 | work=Volume | accessdate=2008-02-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |archivedate=1999-10-14[/tpl] Vig explained that as in his opinion "the most exciting bands are those who incorporate all those elements of punk, funk, techno, hip hop, etc." Garbage would attempt to do the same and "take those influences and make them work in the context of a pop song.”[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@dock.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090413122252/http://www.garbage.net/garbage/articles/@dock.htm |archivedate=2009-04-13 |title=Butch Vig: In The Dock|journal=RAW magazine|accessdate=2008-02-05[/tpl]
The band went overboard with experimentation, with Erikson adding that throughout they liked to include “sounds that we found accidentally, like Steve’s sample of a tape deck backing up, or the bit in ‘Stupid Girl’ that was initially a mistake, but when we slowed it down, actually fit the timbre and pace of the song and became the hook.”[tpl]cite journal|title=Garbage Rise From the House That Grunge Built|url=http://absolutegarbage.net/articles/garbage-rise-from-the-house-that-grunge-built/|journal=Addicted to Noise|date=September 1995|author=Kaufman, Gil[/tpl]
The lyrics on the record were described by the bandmembers as "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." Vig said they tried to deal with "dark themes that I think a lot of people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and "the art of self-destruction." Manson stated that while the content was "a lot more poppy" than most of her previous work, the songs ended up describing the dark side of her nature, as "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Li0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7|title=Garbage: Experimental Jet Set Trash|author=Lanham, Tom|date=October 1995|journal=CMJ New Music Monthly|accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] The singer also declared that the music "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like "Vow" is very real despite "none of us having ever really acted on those feelings".[tpl]cite journal|title=Garbage Interview|url=http://www.thebaggage.com/issue13/garbage.html|journal=Retroactive Baggage|date=October 1996|first=Tim|last=Sismey|accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl]

===Chart performance===

Garbage took a while to reach high charts in North America, which Vig considered was "because I don't think it's cool to say you're in a pop band in the States. To be truly PC, you have to be in the grunge zone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292846,00.html|title=Top of the Heap|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Chris|last=Willman |date=1996-06-07|accessdate=2013-01-19[/tpl] The album debuted at #29 on the developing artists Top Heatseekers album chart.[tpl]cite journal|page=21|title=Heatseekers Album Chart|date=1995-09-02|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xw0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA21&dq=heatseekers%20Garbage&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Four weeks later, the album debuted at #193 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard 200|date=1995-09-30|journal=Billboard|page=105|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ag4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA95&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] as "Queer" impacted at Modern Rock.[tpl]cite journal|title=Modern Rock Tracks|date=1995-09-23|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9A0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA103&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=PA99#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=99[/tpl] In November, Garbage launched their first North American tour,[tpl]cite web|title=Garbage 1996 Setlists|url=http://www.garbagebase.com/g-1996.html|publisher=Garbagebase.com|accessdate=2011-07-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/604ZP6tD8|archivedate=2011-07-09[/tpl] which drove "Queer" to #12 on the Modern Rock chart[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZA0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA13&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q=Garbage%20Queer&f=false|title=Hot Modern Rock Tracks|page=85|date=1995-11-18|journal=Billboard[/tpl] and Garbage to climb to #127 on the album chart[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard 200...continued|date=1995-11-04|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wg4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=RA1-PA103&dq=Garbage%20Queer&pg=RA1-PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] and spend four weeks at #5 on the Heatseekers chart.[tpl]cite journal|title=Heatseekers Album Chart|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pw0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA110&dq=Garbage%20almo%2080004&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=21|date=1995-11-25[/tpl] The album dropped off the Billboard 200 at the start of December.[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NA0EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA22&dq=Garbage%20almo&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=102|date=1995-12-02[/tpl] At the start of January 1996, "Only Happy When It Rains" was serviced to alternative radio;[tpl]cite journal|title=Modern Rock Tracks|date=1996-01-27|page=111|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7g4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA111&dq=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] as Garbage re-charted on the Billboard 200 at #183.[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard 200|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zg4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA15&dq=Garbage%20almo%2080004&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=79|date=1996-01-13[/tpl] At the start of March, Garbage peaked at #2 on the Heatseeker chart.[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard's Heatseekers Albums|date=1996-03-09|page=17|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TA8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA85&dq=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] A week later, the album broke into the top half of Billboard 200 for the first time,[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard 200 (Heatseeker Impact)|page=112|date=1996-03-16|journal=Billboard|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YA8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA105&dq=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] as "Only Happy When It Rains" peaked at #16 at alternative radio.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YA8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA108&dq=%22Only%20Happy%20When%20It%20Rains%22&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hot Modern Rock Tracks|pages=|journal=Billboard|date=1996-03-16[/tpl] The album had sold 238,000 units by this point.[tpl]cite journal|last=Borzillo|first=Carrie|title=Garbage's Serendipitous Success;

===World tour===

Vig stated that the band had no initial plans to tour as "not going on the road would really free us up to record tons of stuff". As the bandmembers realized "that if we were going to have a successful record we'd have to go out on tour and promote it", and enjoyed playing live to record the "Vow" video, they decided to perform to audiences as well. To perform the complex and layered tracks live, the band hired Los Angeles bass player Daniel Shulman for the tour, and figured out ways to trigger samples on stage, such as having Marker play a keyboard along with his guitar.
