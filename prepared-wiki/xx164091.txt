The toothless catfish lives in clear, flowing waters. It has been reported to be solitary, but it also often forms aggregations around log snags or in deeper rock pools. It also occurs in sandy bottoms around the cover of woody debris and in flooded lagoons. This fish feeds on aquatic insects, mollusks, prawns, and bottom detritus by thrusting its snout into the sandy bottom. Nothing is specific is known about the breeding biology, but it probably spawns early in the wet season.Has Teeth in the back of its mouth.
