[[Hausdorff maximal principle]]

CATEGORIES: Axiom of choice, Order theory, Mathematical principles

In mathematics, the Hausdorff maximal principle is an alternate and earlier formulation of Zorn's lemma proved by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.
The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the axiom of choice over Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory. The principle is also called the Hausdorff maximality theorem or the Kuratowski lemma (Kelley 1955:33).

==Statement==

The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any partially ordered set, every totally ordered subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally-ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.
An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.
For the converse direction, let A be a partially ordered set and T a totally ordered subset of A. Then
The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.
