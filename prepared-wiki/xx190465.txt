Mandell described Pittman's discovery of his condition as follows: "It started with a simple twitch. Billy Pittman woke up one spring morning two years ago to find his eye was twitching, and it wouldn't stop. Eye drops, a splash of water to the face -- no help. He went back to bed that afternoon, woke up, and now noticed his nostril wasn't moving. By the next morning, he couldn't feel the left side of his face."[tpl]cite news|author=Stewart Mandell|title=Sweet resiliency: Pittman overcomes setbacks to become key for 'Horns|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=January 2, 2006|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/stewart_mandel/01/01/texas.pittman/[/tpl] 
Texas coach Mack Brown recalled that, after missing the 2003 and 2004 seasons, Pittman nearly quit the team: "That poor young man had everything that could possibly happen happen.  He was ready to quit."   After coming back from the condition, Pittman told a local reporter for the Associated Press, "I've come through a lot.  What don't kill you will make you stronger."[tpl]cite news|author=Jim Vertuno|title=Pittman emerging as key 'Horns receiver|publisher=The Victoria Advocate (Associated Press story)|date=October 28, 2005|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rYw_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=xFUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4682,5944820&dq=billy-pittman+oklahoma&hl=en[/tpl]  
Pittman was able to overcome the disorder and became the leading receiver on the 2005 Texas Longhorns football team that finished the regular season with a record and defeated the USC Trojans for the BCS National Championship.  During the 2005 campaign, Pittman became the favorite receiver for Texas quarterback Vince Young.  In the second game of the season, Pittman helped the Longhorns defeat Ohio State in Columbus, Ohio.
