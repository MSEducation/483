CATEGORIES: Senecioneae, Asteraceae genera

 Pittocaulon is a genus of the tribe Senecioneae and the family Asteraceae.  Most if not all of its members used to be Senecio.
The five species of this genus have been described as "strange shrubs and small trees with broomstick-like branches".  All five species are native to the dry parts of central and southern Mexico. In addition to the strange appearance of these plants, Pittocaulon is of interest due to the remarkable range of habitats in which the species occur, from dry highland scrub well above 3000 meters, to tropical dry forest in hot country as low as 300 meters and on rocks, often in very steep situations.  Pittocaulon species are conspicuous (crazy) when they flower at the end of the dry season  are popularly called "palo loco" or "crazy tree", because they flower at the very end of the dry season when most other plants are suffering the effects of drought.
