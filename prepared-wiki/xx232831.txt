Natural gas was a desirable fuel for glass manufacturing, and many firms were drawn to northwest Ohio during the 1880s to exploit this newly discovered resource.  To take advantage of Ohio's gas boom, the new company's glass works was built in Fostoria, Ohio.  The firm also received incentives of $5,000 to $10,000 cash.  The factory’s furnace had a capacity of 12 pots, and originally employed 125 workers.
At least 20 glass employees relocated from Bellaire, Ohio, for the startup.  These were experienced glass men such as Henry Crimmel and his brother Jacob, Hayes O’Neal, and Deacon Scroggins.[ref]
