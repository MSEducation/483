Uschi Glas (born Helga Ursula Glas; 2 March 1944) is a German film and television actress.
Born in Landau an der Isar, Bavaria, Glas started appearing in films in 1965. Her breakthrough role was that of Barbara in the unconventional 1968 movie Zur Sache, Schätzchen (Go for It, Baby), which captured the spirit of the times in that it presented youthful protest against the German establishment and hinted at the loosening of morals in the wake of the sexual revolution. From then on, the tabloid press would refer to Glas frequently as "Schätzchen".
In the late 60s and early 70s, Glas appeared in many slapstick movies, notably in three films of the seven-part series (1967–72) Die Lümmel von der ersten Bank (The Brats on the Front Bench Row).
In the 1980s and 1990s Glas concentrated on her television work, appearing in a succession of TV series tailored to her person, playing, among other characters, a veterinarian in Tierärztin Christine (1993), an energetic businesswoman in Anna Maria – Eine Frau geht ihren Weg (Anna Maria – A Woman Does it Her Way, 1995–1996), and the ideal teacher in Sylvia – Eine Klasse für sich (Sylvia – A Class of her Own, 1998–2000). She also appeared in many feature-length made-for-TV movies. In total, Glas appeared in more than 75 film and TV productions.
Glas was married to the actor [tpl]ill|de|Bernd Tewaag[/tpl] from 1981 until their divorce in 2003; they had three children. In 2005 Glas married the consultant Dieter Herrmann.
In 2004, Glas published a memoir, Mit einem Lächeln (With a Smile).
