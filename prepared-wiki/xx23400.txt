Speex is a patent-free audio compression format designed for speech and also a free software speech codec that may be used on VoIP applications and podcasts.Xiph.Org Speex: A Free Codec For Free Speech, Retrieved 2009-09-01 It is based on the CELP speech coding algorithm.Xiph.Org Introduction to CELP Coding, Retrieved 2009-09-01 Speex claims to be free of any patent restrictions and is licensed under the revised (3-clause) BSD license.  It may be used with the Ogg container format or directly transmitted over UDP/RTP.
The Speex designers see their project as complementary to the Vorbis general-purpose audio compression project.
Speex is a lossy format, meaning quality is permanently degraded to reduce file size.
The Speex project was created on February 13, 2002.Xiph.org Speex releases - pre-1.0 - NEWS and ChangeLog in speex-0.0.1.tar.gz, Retrieved 2009-09-01 The first development versions of Speex were released under LGPL license, but as of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph's version of the (revised) BSD license.Xiph.Org Speex FAQ – Under what license is Speex released?, Retrieved 2009-09-01 Speex 1.0 was announced on March 24, 2003, after a year of development.Xiph.Org (2003-03-24) Speex reaches 1.0; Xiph.Org now a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization, Retrieved 2009-09-01 The last stable version of Speex encoder and decoder is 1.1.12.
Xiph.Org now considers Speex obsolete; its successor is the more modern Opus codec, which surpasses its performance in all areas.

==Description==

Speex is targeted at voice over IP (VoIP) and file-based compression. The design goals have been to make a codec that would be optimized for high quality speech and low bit rate. To achieve this the codec uses multiple bit rates, and supports ultra-wideband (32 kHz sampling rate), wideband (16 kHz sampling rate) and narrowband (telephone quality, 8 kHz sampling rate). Since Speex was designed for VoIP instead of cell phone use, the codec must be robust to lost packets, but not to corrupted ones. All this led to the choice of code excited linear prediction (CELP) as the encoding technique to use for Speex. One of the main reasons is that CELP has long proven that it could do the job and scale well to both low bit rates (as evidenced by DoD CELP @ 4.8 kbit/s) and high bit rates (as with G.728 @ 16 kbit/s).
The main characteristics can be summarized as follows:

==Applications==

There are a large base of applications supporting the Speex codec.  Examples include:
Most of these are based on the DirectShow filter or OpenACM codec (e.g. Microsoft NetMeeting) on Microsoft Windows, or Xiph.org's reference implementation, libvorbis, on Linux (e.g. Ekiga). There are also plugins for many audio players. See the plugin and software page on the speex.org site for more details.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.speex.org/software/ |title=A free codec for free speech |publisher=Speex |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29[/tpl]
The media type for Speex is audio/ogg while contained by Ogg, and audio/speex (previously audio/x-speex) when transported through RTP or without container.
The United States Army's Land Warrior system, designed by General Dynamics, also uses Speex for VoIP on an EPLRS radio designed by Raytheon.
