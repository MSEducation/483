==Names==

The Smoky Hill gets its name from the Smoky Hills region of north-central Kansas through which it flows. American Indians living along the Smoky Hill considered it and the Kansas River to be the same river, and their names for it included Chetolah and Okesee-sebo.  Early maps of European explorers called the river (also in combination with the Kansas River) the River of the Padoucas as its source is located in what was then Padouca (Comanche) territory.[tpl]cite journal | last = Root | first = George A. | title = Ferries in Kansas, Part VI -- Smoky Hill River | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–22 | date = February 1935 | url = http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1935/35_1_root.htm[/tpl]
The USGS lists a number of other variant names for the Smoky Hill River, including Chitolah River, Fork of the Hill Buckaneuse, La Fourche de la Cote Boucaniere, La Touche de la Cote Bucanieus, Manoiyohe, Pe P'a, Sand River, Shallow River, Smoky Creek, Branche de la Montagne a la Fumee, Ka-i-urs-kuta, Oke-see-sebo River, and Rahota katit hibaru, among others.

==Geography==

The Smoky Hill River originates in the High Plains of eastern Colorado and flows east. Both the main course of the river and the North Fork Smoky Hill River rise in northern Cheyenne County, Colorado.[tpl]GNIS|485218|North Fork Smoky Hill River[/tpl] The two streams converge roughly [tpl]convert|5|mi|km[/tpl] west of Russell Springs in Logan County, Kansas. From there, the river continues generally eastward through the Smoky Hills region. The Saline River, one of the Smoky Hill's two main tributaries, joins the river in eastern Saline County.[tpl]GNIS|485315|Saline River[/tpl] The other major tributary, the Solomon River, joins the Smoky Hill in western Dickinson County.[tpl]GNIS|482755|Solomon River[/tpl] The Smoky Hill joins the Republican River at Junction City, Kansas to form the Kansas River.
The Smoky Hill River directly drains an area of [tpl]convert|8810|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl]. The combined Smoky Hill-Saline Basin drains [tpl]convert|12229|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title = Smoky Hill-Saline Basin | publisher = Kansas Water Office | url = http://www.kwo.org/BACs/SHS/SHS.htm[/tpl] The entire Smoky Hill drainage basin covers approximately [tpl]convert|20000|sqmi|km2[/tpl], including most of north-central and northwestern Kansas.[tpl]Cite book | contribution = Smoky Hill River | title = Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc. | editor-last = Blackmar | editor-first = Frank W. | volume = 2 | pages = 708–709 | place = Chicago | publisher = Standard | year = 1912 | contribution-url = http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/s/smoky_hill_river.html[/tpl] Via the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the Smoky Hill is part of the Mississippi River watershed.
The Smoky Hill feeds two reservoirs: Cedar Bluff Reservoir in Trego County and Kanopolis Lake in Ellsworth County.
The largest city along the Smoky Hill River is Salina. Besides Junction City, other Kansas towns along the river are Ellsworth, Marquette. Lindsborg, Kansas, and Abilene.

==History==

The earliest known reference to the river was on a 1732 map by French cartographer d'Anville who labeled it the River of the Padoucas. A 1758 map referred to it as the Padoucas River. An early reference to the river as the Smoky Hill was by American explorer Zebulon Pike during his 1806 expedition to visit the Pawnee. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 established Kansas Territory, which included the entire length of the Smoky Hill River.[tpl]cite journal | last = Gower | first = Calvin W. | title = Kansas Territory and Its Boundary Question: "Big Kansas" or "Little Kansas" | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = Spring 1967 | url = http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1967/67_1_gower.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-25 [/tpl] 
With the onset of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858, an ancient Native American trail along the Smoky Hill River provided the shortest, fastest route west across Kansas, becoming known as the Smoky Hill Trail.[tpl]cite journal | last = Gower | first = Calvin W. | title = The Pike's Peak Gold Rush and the Smoky Hill Route, 1859-1860 | journal = Kansas Historical Quarterly | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–171 | date = Summer 1959 | url = http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1959/59_2_gower.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-25 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Smoky Hill Trail : History | publisher = Cherry Creek Valley Historical Society | url = http://www.smokyhilltrail.info/history.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-25[/tpl] Beginning in 1865, the trail served as the route for the short-lived Butterfield Overland Despatch. To protect travelers, the U.S. Army established several forts along the trail, including Fort Downer, Fort Harker, Fort Hays, Fort Monument, and Fort Wallace.[tpl]cite web | last = Chinn | first = Stephen | coauthors = Richard A. Ensminger | title = Kansas Forts | date = 1993-10-11 | url = http://www.vlib.us/old_west/forts.html | accessdate = 2009-07-25[/tpl] Before American colonization, the land along the Smoky Hill River was favored hunting ground for the Plains Indians. In 1867, the Comanche and the Kiowa, and in 1868, the Sioux and the Arapaho signed treaties withdrawing their opposition to the construction of a railroad along the Smoky Hill River. The Kansas Pacific Railway was completed in 1870, rendering the Smoky Hill Trail obsolete.[tpl]cite web | title = Cherry Creek State Park Marker Text | publisher = Colorado Historical Society | year = 2002 | url = http://www.coloradohistory.org/RIPsigns/show_markertext.asp?id=883 | accessdate = 2009-07-25[/tpl]
In 1948, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finished construction of a dam on the Smoky Hill for flood control in southeastern Ellsworth County, Kansas, creating Kanopolis Lake.[tpl]cite web | title = History of Kanopolis Dam | publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers | url = http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/ka/History.cfm[/tpl] In 1951, the United States Bureau of Reclamation completed another dam on the river, this one for irrigation as well as flood control, in southeastern Trego County, creating Cedar Bluff Reservoir.[tpl]cite web | title = Cedar Bluff Unit Project | publisher = Bureau of Reclamation | url = http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Cedar+Bluff+Unit+Project[/tpl]
