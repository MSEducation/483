StarOffice, known briefly as Oracle Open Office before being discontinued in 2011, was a proprietary office suite. It originated in 1985 as StarWriter by StarDivision, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999. Sun was itself acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.
StarOffice supports the OpenOffice.org XML file format, as well as the OpenDocument standard, and can generate PDF and Flash formats. It includes templates, a macro recorder, and a software development kit (SDK).
The source code of the suite was released in July 2000, creating a free, open source office suite called OpenOffice.org, which subsequent versions of StarOffice were based on, with additional proprietary components.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/faq-overview.html | title = OpenOffice.org — FAQ — Overview | accessdate = 2010-02-04 | author = OpenOffice.org [/tpl]
In March 2009, a study showed that StarOffice only had a 3% market share in the corporate market.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2012-05-07|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/forrester/microsoft-office-still-owns-the-desktop-future-of-staroffice-unclear/214|publisher=ZDnet|title=Microsoft Office still owns the desktop, future of StarOffice unclear|first=Sheri|last=McLeish|date=2009-05-26[/tpl]

==History==

StarWriter 1.0 was written by Marco Borries in 1985 for the Zilog Z80. Borries formed StarDivision in Lüneburg the following year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_Of_OpenOffice.org&oldid=186681|title=A Brief History Of OpenOffice.org|date=13 October 2010|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Apache Software Foundation[/tpl] It was later ported to the Amstrad CPC (marketed by Schneider in Germany) under CP/M, and later the Commodore 64 under Microsoft BASIC,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] which was later ported to the 8086-based Amstrad PC-1512, running under MS-DOS 3.2. Later, the integration of the other individual programs followed as the development progressed to an Office Suite for DOS, IBM's OS/2 Warp, and for the Microsoft Windows operating-system. From this time onwards StarDivision marketed its suite under the name "StarOffice."
Until version 4.2, StarDivision based StarOffice on the cross-platform C++ class library StarView. In 1998 StarDivision began offering StarOffice for free.
Sun Microsystems acquired the company, copyright and trademark of StarOffice in 1999 for [tpl]USD|73.5 million[/tpl].Sun shelled out $73.5 million for Star Division, C|Net Sun wanted to compete with Microsoft Office, and also wanted to save money on licenses for Microsoft Office and Windows:

==Naming==

StarSuite, the version of StarOffice with Asian language localization, included Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese interfaces. It also included additional fonts for the East Asian market, resulting in slightly larger installation footprint. Otherwise the features were identical to StarOffice.
The two brands existed because a StarOffice brand was owned by another company in certain Asian countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/software/staroffice/faqs.jsp |title=FAQs for StarOffice Software |publisher=Sun.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2009-08-12[/tpl] Currently NEC produces StarOffice collaborative software in Japan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nec.co.jp/StarOffice/ |title=NEC StarOffice page |publisher=Nec.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2009-08-12[/tpl] After Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems (in January 2010) it renamed both StarOffice and StarSuite as "Oracle Open Office".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/open-office/index.html|title=Oracle's OpenOffice Page|accessdate=2010-04-29[/tpl]

===Oracle Open Office===

Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice as Oracle Open Office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newformat.se/documents/oracle/oracle-open-office-features-overview-060550.pdf|title=Oracle Open Office: Features Overview: An Oracle White Paper|date=January 2010|publisher=Oracle Corporation|accessdate=20 September 2013[/tpl]
On 15 December 2010, Oracle released Oracle Open Office 3.3, based on OpenOffice.org 3.3 beta, and a web-based version called Oracle Cloud Office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/195766|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101217212955/http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/195766|archivedate=17 December 2010|title=Oracle Announces Oracle Cloud Office and Oracle Open Office 3.3: Industry’s First Complete, Open Standards-Based Office Productivity Suites for Desktop, Web and Mobile Users|publisher=Oracle Corporation[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/1012/80148.html|language=German|accessdate=2012-05-07|title=Kostenpflichtiges Oracle Open Office 3.3 veröffentlicht|publisher=Golem.de|date=2010-12-15|first1=Jens|last1=Ihlenfeld|first2= Ingo|last2=Pakalski[/tpl] The suite was released in two versions, sold at [tpl]euro|39[/tpl] and [tpl]euro|49.95[/tpl].

==Pricing and licensing==

Traditionally, StarOffice licenses sold for around [tpl]USD|70[/tpl], but in 2004, Sun planned to offer subscription-based licenses to Japanese customers for about [tpl]yen|1,980[/tpl] ([tpl]USD|17[/tpl]) per year (Becker, 2004). P. Ulander, a desktop products manager for Sun, acknowledged that Sun planned to expand subscription-based licenses to other countries as well. [tpl]As of | 2009 | January[/tpl] Sun's website offered StarOffice for [tpl]USD|34.95[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |title=Get StarOffice Software |publisher=Sun Microsystems, Inc. |url=http://www.sun.com/software/staroffice/get.jsp |accessdate=2009-01-16[/tpl]
Sun used a per-person license for StarOffice, compared to the per-device licenses used for most other proprietary software. An individual purchaser gains the right to install the software on up to five computers. For example, a small-business owner can have the software on laptop, office and home computers, or a user with a computer running Microsoft Windows, and another running Linux, can install StarOffice on both computers.
In 2010 StarOffice 9 Software was no longer offered free of charge to education customers, but StarOffice 8 could still be used without charge. The free OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the same functionality as StarOffice 9, could also be used. Sun also offered free web-based training and an online tutorial for students and teachers, free support services for teachers (including educational templates for StarOffice) and significantly discounted technical support for schools.
