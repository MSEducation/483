CATEGORIES: Symptoms and signs, Medical terminology

A calculus (plural calculi) is a stone (a concretion of material, usually mineral salts) that forms in an organ or duct of the body. Formation of calculi is known as lithiasis. Stones can cause a number of medical conditions.
Some common principles (below) apply to stones at any location, but for specifics see the particular stone type in question.
Calculi are not to be confused with gastroliths.

Calculi usually are asymptomatic, and large calculi may have required many years to grow to their large size.
