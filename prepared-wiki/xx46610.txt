[[Zeeman effect]]

CATEGORIES: Spectroscopy, Quantum magnetism, Foundational quantum physics

The Zeeman effect ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|z|eɪ|m|ən[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-nl|ˈzeːmɑn|IPA[/tpl]), named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, is the effect of  splitting a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules.
Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.
The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy.

When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called inverse Zeeman effect.

==Nomenclature==

Historically, one distinguishes between the "normal" and an anomalous Zeeman effect that appears on transitions where the net spin of the electrons is not 0, the number of Zeeman sub-levels being even instead of odd if there is an uneven number of electrons involved. It was called "anomalous" because the electron spin had not yet been discovered, and so there was no good explanation for it at the time that Zeeman observed the effect.
At higher magnetic fields the effect ceases to be linear. At even higher field strength, when the strength of the external field is comparable to the strength of the atom's internal field, electron coupling is disturbed and the spectral lines rearrange. This is called the Paschen-Back effect.
In the modern scientific literature, these terms are rarely used, with a tendency to use just the "Zeeman effect".

The Lyman alpha transition in hydrogen in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction involves the transitions
Note in particular that the size of the energy splitting is different for the different orbitals, because the gJ values are different. On the left, fine structure splitting is depicted. This splitting occurs even in the absence of a magnetic field, as it is due to spin-orbit coupling. Depicted on the right is the additional Zeeman splitting, which occurs in the presence of magnetic fields.

==Strong field (Paschen-Back effect)==

In general, one must now add spin-orbit coupling and relativistic corrections (which are of the same order, known as 'fine structure') as a perturbation to these 'unperturbed' levels. First order perturbation theory with these fine-structure corrections yields the following formula for the Hydrogen atom in the Paschen-Back limit:[tpl]cite book | author=Griffiths, David J.| title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics |edition=2nd | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-111892-7 | oclc=40251748 |page=247[/tpl]

==Intermediate field for j = 1/2==

In the magnetic dipole approximation, the Hamiltonian which includes both the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions is 
These ladder operators have the property
We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as 
Now we can determine the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian: 
Solving for the eigenvalues of this matrix, (as can be done by hand, or more easily, with a computer algebra system) we arrive at the energy shifts: 

==Applications==

===Astrophysics===

George Ellery Hale was the first to notice the Zeeman effect in the solar spectra, indicating the existence of strong magnetic fields in sunspots. Such fields can be quite high, on the order of 0.1 Tesla or higher.  Today, the Zeeman effect is used to produce magnetograms showing the variation of magnetic field on the sun.

===Laser Cooling===

The Zeeman effect is utilized in many Laser cooling applications such as a Magneto-optical trap and the Zeeman slower.
