Ronald "J.J." Henry III (born April 2, 1975) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour.
Henry was born in Fairfield, Connecticut. While attending Texas Christian University, he was the individual runner up at the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships and turned pro later that year. He joined the Nationwide Tour in 1999, and after winning the 2000 BUY.COM Knoxville Open moved up to the PGA Tour in 2001. His first PGA Tour win came in 2006 at the Buick Championship; he became the first Connecticut golfer to win the event. He played on the 2006 Ryder Cup team, halving all three matches he was involved in.
Henry came close at the 2012 Byron Nelson Championship where he had one-shot lead with two holes to play. A double bogey on the 71st hole resulted in him eventually finishing two strokes behind winner Jason Dufner. Later in the year, Henry won for the second time on the PGA Tour at the Renoâ€“Tahoe Open. The event used the modified Stableford scoring system and Henry prevailed by one point over Brazilian Alexandre Rocha. He earned entry into the PGA Championship the following week.
Henry lives with his wife Lee and his two children in Fort Worth, Texas.
