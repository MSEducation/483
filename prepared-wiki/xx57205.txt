The IBM 6400 family of line matrix printers are modern highspeed business computer printers introduced by IBM in 1995. These printers are designed for use on a variety IBM systems including mainframes, servers, and PCs.
The IBM 6400 series printers are line matrix printers manufactured by Printronix Corp
and rebranded for IBM. All internal parts have the Printronix Logo and/or artwork.
Although they once did, IBM no longer manufactures printers. One of their old printer divisions
became Lexmark The other became the IBM Printing Systems Division, which was recently spun off to Ricoh. IBM now uses several different manufacturers to fill their printer
requirements under the IBM brand.

IBM 6400 Line Printer SeriesOverview
The 6400 Series of High Speed Matrix Line Printers offer the latest in line matrix technology combined with interface selections to meet today’s expansive and changing printing requirements. With the 6400, users can select the right line matrix printer for their application. Moreover, with its print speeds of 500 lpm to 2000 lpm, interfaces, configurations and options make the 6400 series a true investment in your printing needs for today and tomorrow.

The IBM 6400 Line Matrix Printer family consists of pedestal mount and floor
cabinet models that print at different speeds, Actual print speed is determined by the interaction of many
variables. Models that print 475, 500, 800, 900, and 1000 lpm are available in floor
cabinet and pedestal housings. Models that print 1200, 1400, and 1500 lpm
are available only in floor cabinets.
The microprocessor of the Data Controller unit on the CMX controller board
runs at 25 MHz or 40 MHz, depending on printer model. This means there
are two kinds of CMX controller board for IBM 6400 printers, used as shown
in Table 1. The 40 MHz controller board, however, is backwards compatible
in all models that use the 25 MHz board.
There have been several series of the 6400 Matrix Line Printer.  The 6400 is only available as a refurbished printer.  The 6500 Series is the most current release of this workhorse Matrix Line Printer.  Click here to be taken to the 6500 page.
