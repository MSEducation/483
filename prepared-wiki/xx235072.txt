The Brolga Project (Building Regional Opportunities, Leveraging from Graduates in Australia)Angus Kidman, (31 July 2009), Is Sampling The Right Way To Attract Rural Workers? Lifehacker  is a work experience program for final year university students needing with businesses, non-governmental organisations and government departments in rural and regional Australia. It was launched on the 6 October 2008.
Students and businesses complete online Expressions of Interest (EOI) at The Brolga Project with these  matched in a central database. Once there's a match, an 'introduction' is performed via a Skype conference, where details of the placement are arranged, then the student completes the placement and hopefully returns to the host agency at the end of their studies, the beginning of their career.
The project is a response to rural drift, young people moving from country areas to live in the city.
