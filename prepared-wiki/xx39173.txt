[[Antiemetic]]

CATEGORIES: Antiemetics

An antiemetic is a drug that is effective against vomiting and nausea. Antiemetics are typically used to treat motion sickness and the side effects of opioid analgesics, general anaesthetics, and chemotherapy directed against cancer.
Antiemetics are also used for morning sickness, but there is little information about the effect on the fetus, and doctors prefer not to use them unless it is strictly necessary.[tpl]citation |title= Practical Selection of Antiemetics |author= Zachary A.
