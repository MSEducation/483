[[Microdermal implants]]

CATEGORIES: Body modification

Microdermal implants are a form of body modification which gives the aesthetic appearance of a transdermal implant, without the complications of the much more complicated surgery associated with transdermal implants.BMEzine Encyclopedia [tpl]verify credibility|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Microdermal implants can be placed practically anywhere on the surface of the skin on the body, but are different from conventional piercings in that they are composed of two components: an anchor, which is implanted underneath the skin, with a step protruding from (or flush with) the surface of the surrounding skin, and the interchangeable jewellery, which is screwed into the threaded hole in the step of the anchor.

Microdermal implants are a more desirable alternative to surface piercings, as they provide less scarring when removed. They are semi permanent and can be removed with the assistance of a professional. There is an estimated 2% rejection rate. Implants should be left alone and covered for the first 3â€“6 months as they are susceptible to outside damage (tugging, pulling and catching, which move the implant closer to the surface of the skin).  Also, the body naturally rejects foreign objects, so it is crucial for the piercings to go as deep as possible. In order to combat these effects constant modification to the jewelry is being made; the latest use large holes in the anchors to encourage tissue to grow through to hold the jewelry in place.
