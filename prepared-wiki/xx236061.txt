This species is a perennial herb producing several unbranched stems up to 30 centimeters tall from a woody base. The leaves are coated in glandular trichomes that hold drops of sticky exudate, which is likely protective against solar radiation. Its flower heads contain yellow flowers. This plant occurs in high mountain páramo habitat, taking hold in small accumulations of organic matter in rocky cracks and crevices.
