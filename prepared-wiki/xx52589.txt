The Scottish Highland Football League (commonly known as the Highland League) is a football league, operating in the North of Scotland. It features teams not only from the Scottish Highlands, as the name may suggest, but also the north-east lowlands of Moray and Aberdeenshire. The league is a full member of the Scottish Football Association and is currently sponsored by the Aberdeen-based Press & Journal newspaper.
Historically, the league was one of the three senior leagues outwith the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League, along with the East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues. However, as part of the reorganisation of Scottish football during the 2012–13 season, it became a feeder division along with the newly formed Lowland Football League to the bottom tier of the merged Scottish Professional Football League.
It is intended that promotion and relegation will be instituted with the Scottish League Two via an annual play-off with the champions of the Lowland Football League, though this will not happen until at least the 2014–15 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22862971 |title=Scottish FA approves Lowland League for next season |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2013[/tpl] Consequently, it will stand at a new Level 5 on the Scottish football pyramid, on a par with the Lowland League.

==History==

===Formation===

The Highland Football League was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club by employees of the Highland Railway Company who had their Company HQ and Locomotive Workshops based in the Highland capital. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. The inaugural champions were Inverness Thistle. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics) and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

===Recent history===

Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to the Scottish Football League (SFL). Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland.
The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs.
In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied. On 25 February 2009, Formartine United, Strathspey Thistle and Turriff United and  were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club.
Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.
