The Kyzyl Kum ([tpl]lang-uz|Qizilqum[/tpl], [tpl]lang-kk|Қызылқұм[/tpl]), also called Qyzylqum, is the 16th largest desert in the world. Its name means Red Sand in Turkic languages. It is located in Central Asia in the doab between the rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, and is divided between Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and (partly) Turkmenistan.  It covers about [tpl]convert|298000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Geography==

The territory consists mainly of an extensive plain at an altitude up to [tpl]convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, with a number of depressions and highlands (Sultanuizdag, Bukantau). Most of the area is covered with sand-dunes (barchans); in the North-West large areas are covered with takirs (clay coatings); there are also some oases. There are agricultural settlements along the rivers and in the oases. Temperatures can be very high during the summer months, from mid-May to mid-September. Kerki, one extreme inland city located on the banks of the Amu Darya River, recorded [tpl]convert|51.7|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] in July 1983.

==Fauna==

Desert fauna include the Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii) and a large lizard known as the Transcaspian or Desert Monitor (Varanus griseus), which can reach lengths of [tpl]convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Saiga Antelope (Saiga tatarica) also occasionally migrates through the northern part of the desert.
There is a Kyzyl Kum nature reserve in Bukhara Province, founded in 1971. The area of the reserve amounts to [tpl]convert|101000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and it is located on flood-land (tugai) drained by the Amu-Darya close to the settlement Dargan Ata. Fauna include: the Bukhara Deer (a local species of Cervus elaphus), Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), Common Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetus) etc.
Another reserve (or eco-centre), "Djeyran", is located [tpl]convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the south of Bukhara. The total area of this reserve is [tpl]convert|51450|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is a breeding centre for rare animals such as: the Goitered or Persian Gazelle Gazelle (Djeyran, Gazella subgutturosa), Przewalski's Horse (Equus przewalskii), the Koulan (Onager, Equus hemionus) and Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata). The reserve was founded in 1977 on the enclosed area in [tpl]convert|5131|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Paleontology==

The Kyzyl Kum has exposed rock formations that have yielded a number of fossils.  Of particular interest is the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, from the early Late Cretaceous, which has produced several species of early birds: Enantiornis martini and E. walkeri, Kizylkumavis cretacea, Kuszholia mengi, Lenesornis kaskarovi, Sazavis prisca, Zhyraornis kaskarovi, and Z. logunovi are recognized as valid species. Tyrannosaurid, therizinosaurid, ostrich-mimic, oviraptorosaurian, troodontid, armored, duckbilled, and horned dinosaurs are also known from this rock unit.[tpl]cite book |last=Weishampel |first=David B. |coauthors=Paul M.

==Economy==

The local population uses the large spaces of the Kyzyl Kum as a pasture for livestock (mostly sheep, Bactrian Camels and dromedaries).
The Kyzyl Kum is well known for its deposits of gold, uranium, copper, aluminium and silver, natural gas and oil. The development of most the famous gold-field at Muruntau began in the early 1970s. The centres for the mining and smelting industry at the region are Navoi, Zarafshan city, Uchkuduk. The major industrial enterprises are: НГМК (Navoi Mining and Smelting Complex) and the Uzbek U.S.A. Joint Venture "Zarafshan-Newmont". The centres of the gas-production industry are Gazli and Mubarek.
