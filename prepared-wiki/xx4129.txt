Hawaii is a major tourist destination and Honolulu, situated on the island of Oahu, is the main gateway to Hawaii and a major gateway into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as famously being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.
Honolulu is both the westernmost and the southernmost major American city. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as "City of Honolulu" (not to be confused with the "City and County") as a census county division (CCD).[tpl]cite web| url = https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=15:1500390810 |title = 2010 Census - Honolulu CCD Population | publisher = United States Census Bureau, Population Division | date = April 1, 2010 | accessdate =May 21, 2013 [/tpl] Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean.

In the Hawaiian language, Honolulu means "sheltered bay" or "place of shelter"[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]; alternatively, it means "calm port".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Honolulu&searchmode=none |title=etymonline.com entry for Honolulu|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl] The old name is said to be Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nuuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.honolulu.gov/cchnl.htm |title=This Is Your City and County of Honolulu Government |publisher=honolulu.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor near the city on December 7, 1941.

==History==

Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hellohonolulu.com/history.cfm |title=Honolulu History – |publisher=Hellohonolulu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] However, after Kamehameha I conquered O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu in the Battle of Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu at Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu Pali, he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i to Waikīkī in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now downtown Honolulu.  The capital was moved back to Kailua-Kona in 1812.
In 1794, Captain William Brown of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/United-States/Hawaii-Honolulu-History-c2089416.html |title=Honolulu History, Hawaii |publisher=Travelgrove.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia.
In 1845, Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu. He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108523.html |title=About Infoplease, Part of Family Education Network |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1941-12-07 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] erecting buildings such as St. Andrew's Cathedral, [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace, and Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.honolulu.gov/cchnl.htm#city |title=About the City, Official Web Site for The City and County of Honolulu |publisher=.honolulu.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]
Despite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's subsequent annexation by the United States in 1898, followed by a large fire in 1900, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.honolulu-city.com/honolulu-history.htm |title=Honolulu History |publisher=Honolulu-city.com |date=1941-12-07 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]
An economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. Modern air travel brings, as of 2007, 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at Honolulu International Airport.[tpl]cite web| url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/visitor-stats/visitor-research/2007-annual-research.pdf | title = 2007 Annual Visitor Research Report | publisher = Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism, State of Hawaii | date =July 1, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2009 [/tpl] Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, with thousands of hotel rooms. The UK consulting firm Mercer, in a 2009 assessment "conducted to help governments and major companies place employees on international assignments", ranked Honolulu 29th worldwide in quality of living; the survey factored in political stability, personal freedom, sanitation, crime, housing, the natural environment, recreation, banking facilities, availability of consumer goods, education, and public services including transportation.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1173105 | title = Quality of Living global city rankings 2009 – Mercer survey | publisher = Mercer| date=April 28, 2009| accessdate=May 8, 2009 [/tpl]

==Geography==

===Climate===

Honolulu experiences a tropical semi-arid climate (Köppen classification Bsh), with a mostly dry summer season, due to a rain shadow effect.[tpl]cite doi|10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130[/tpl]
Temperatures vary little throughout the months, with average high temperatures of [tpl]convert|80|–|90|°F|°C[/tpl] and average lows of [tpl]convert|65|–|75|°F|°C[/tpl] throughout the year. Temperatures reach or exceed [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] on an average 38 days annually,This is comparable to Washington, D.C. despite being slightly warmer during the summer, see http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=hnl. with lows in the upper 50s °F (14–15 °C) occurring once or twice a year. The highest recorded temperature was [tpl]convert|95|°F[/tpl] during a heat wave in September 1998. The highest recorded temperature in the state was also recorded later that day in Ni'ihau. The lowest recorded temperature was [tpl]convert|52|°F[/tpl] on February 16, 1902, and January 20, 1969.
Annual average rainfall is [tpl]convert|17.05|in|abbr=on[/tpl], which mainly occurs during the winter months of October through early April, with very little rainfall during the summer. Honolulu has an average of 278 sunny days and 90 wet days per year. Although Honolulu is known to have a wet and dry season, it is unnoticeable. This is mainly because light showers fall in the summer while heavier rain falls during the winter. Yet, both seasons experience the same amount of rainy days.
Although the city is situated in the upper tropics, hurricanes are quite rare. The last recorded hurricane that hit the area was Category 4 Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Tornadoes are also uncommon and usually strike once every 15 years. Waterspouts off the coast are also uncommon, hitting about once every five years.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=28119&refer=&units=us |title=Weatherbase.com |publisher=Weatherbase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]

====Rail====

Currently, there is no urban rail transit system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were operated in Honolulu by the now-defunct Honolulu Rapid Transit Company prior to World War II. Predecessors to the Honolulu Rapid Transit Company were the Honolulu Rapid Transit and Land Company (began 1903) and Hawaiian Tramways (began 1888).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&year=1888 |title=Hawaii's History in 1888 – Hawaii History – 1888 |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]
The City and County of Honolulu is currently constructing a [tpl]convert|20|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] rail transit line that will connect Honolulu with cities and suburban areas near Pearl Harbor and in the Leeward and West Oahu regions. The Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project is aimed at alleviating traffic congestion for West Oahu commuters while being integral in the westward expansion of the metropolitan area. The project, however, has been criticized by opponents of rail for its cost, delays, and potential environmental impacts, but the line is expected to have large ridership.
