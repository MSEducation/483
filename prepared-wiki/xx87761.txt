Dartford railway station serves the town of Dartford in Kent, England. All train services from the station are operated by Southeastern, which also manages the station. Dartford is a major interchange station in the North Kent region of the Southeastern network. Ticket barriers control access to the platforms.
The station is the nodal point for three lines from London:
Lines terminate west of Dartford at London Charing Cross and London Cannon Street via London Bridge, and London Victoria.
The first station was opened here by the South Eastern Railway it extended its North Kent Line from Gravesend on 30 July 1849, taking the line from there to London. The original station building had an Italianate design; this was replaced by a glass and metal ticket office complex in 1972. A footbridge leads across the line to the two island platforms, which are capable of a very large number of train movements during a working day. There are four carriage sidings at the country end of the station. Replacement of the 1972 station building was approved in 2011,http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/news/latest-news/dartford-station-upgrade-plans-revealed/ with enabling works started late that year, and major works commencing in mid-2012. The new building was opened in August 2013 with all works scheduled for completion by November of that year.http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/news/article/dartford-station-uk-investment-delivers-a-better-railway-for-passengers/
