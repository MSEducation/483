Patrica Parsons (June 9, 1931 â€“ October 26, 2006), better known as Patsy Parsons, sometimes credited as Patsy Lee Parsons, was an American character actress who appeared in about a dozen films beginning in 1937 at the age of six. Ms. Parsons was born in Parkersburg, W.Va,. but moved to Hollywood at age 5. She is best remembered for her 1954 TV role as the evil space tyrant "Cleolanthe" in Rocky Jones, Space Ranger.
Like many child stars, she experienced great difficulty in graduating to adult roles, with a typical appearance being an uncredited bit part in a Martin and Lewis film. One of her bigger child parts was in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) starring James Cagney.
Parsons retired shortly after leaving Rocky Jones, Space Ranger, making one last TV appearance on Science Fiction Theater in 1956.
However, life did not end for Ms. Parsons as she began a new career as the wife of banker and community activist Solon Soteras. As Pat Soteras, she worked at Pepperdine University and raised three children, Alexander, Nickoletta and Anthony. She also wrote a weekly column for the Malibu Times. However, in her later years, Pat is most remembered for her extraordinary work with the Agoura/Oak Park/ Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce where, as the Chamber's executive director, she increased membership eightfold.
In memory of Pat's work with the Chamber, the Patricia Soteras scholarship fund was established.
