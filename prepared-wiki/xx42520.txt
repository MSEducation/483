The album reached #3 on the U.S. Billboard album chart and #1 in Canada on the RPM national Top Albums chart. The musicians were Hal Blaine on drums, Joe Osborn on bass guitar, Mike Melvoin on keyboard, Dennis Budimir and Louie Shelton on guitars. As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), it was produced by Wes Farrell at Western Recorders, studio 2 in Los Angeles.
Up to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter.  Cassidy penned the song "Lay It on the Line" with Wes Farrell. The song features a strong guitar track.
The album cover was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birthdates of the family (including their dog, Simone), which were the actual birthdates of the cast members. The album also included a bookcover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after its release.
