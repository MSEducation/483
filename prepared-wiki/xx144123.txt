Journey Escape is a videogame developed and manufactured by Data Age in San Jose, California for the Atari 2600 console, and released in 1982. It stars the rock band Journey, one of the world's most popular acts at the time, and is based on their album Escape.

==Plot==

From the game's manual:

==Gameplay==

The player must lead the band members to their "Scarab Escape Vehicle" (as featured on the cover) and protect the concert cash from "love-crazed" groupies, sneaky photographers, stage barriers and "shifty-eyed" promoters. Assisting the player are roadies, which provided short periods of immunity to obstacles, and The Manager, inexplicably depicted as the Kool-Aid Man, which allowed the player to move to the Scarab completely unhindered. The screen scrolls vertically non-stop, although the speed can be controlled; the player moves side to side to dodge the aforementioned obstacles.

==Music==

Despite the title, the song "Escape" is not featured in the game; the intro tune is an excerpt from "Don't Stop Believin'", which is also on the same album. The in-game music, however, appears to be an original tune, rather than based on a Journey song.
