RIMPAC, the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, is the world's largest international maritime warfare exercise. RIMPAC is held biennially during June and July of even-numbered years from Honolulu, Hawaii. It is hosted and administered by the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet, headquartered at Pearl Harbor, in conjunction with the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, and Hawaii National Guard forces under the control of the Governor of Hawaii. The US invites allied military forces from the Pacific Rim nations to participate. With RIMPAC the United States Pacific Command seeks to enhance interoperability between Pacific Rim armed forces, ostensibly as a means of promoting stability in the region to the benefit of all participating nations. The Pacific faces several potential targets which the United States Department of Defense believes may require naval force-on-force engagements, especially China and North Korea.

==Participants==

The first RIMPAC, held in 1971, involved forces from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Australia, Canada, and the US have participated in every RIMPAC since then. Other regular participants are Chile, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and the UK. The Royal New Zealand Navy was frequently involved until the 1985 ANZUS nuclear ships dispute.
Several observer nations are usually invited, including China, Ecuador, India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Russia, who became an active participant for the first time in 2012."Russian Warships Arrive at U.S. Pearl Harbor for Joint Drills." RIA Novosti. 1 July 2012. While not contributing any ships, observer nations are involved in RIMPAC at the strategic level and use the opportunity to prepare for possible full participation in the future.
The United States contingent has included an aircraft carrier strike group, submarines, up to a hundred aircraft and 20,000 Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and their respective officers. The size of the exercises varies from year to year.

==RIMPAC 2004==

RIMPAC 2004 included 40 ships, seven submarines, 100 aircraft, and nearly 18,000 military personnel from seven navies, including Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and the United Kingdom. It focused on multinational training while building trust and cooperation among the participating naval partners. Rear Admiral Patrick M. Walsh, Commander Carrier Group Seven, served as Multinational Task Force Commander aboard the [tpl]USS|John C. Stennis[/tpl].

RIMPAC 2010 brought together units and personnel from Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Peru, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. During the exercise, participating countries conducted gunnery, missile, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as maritime interdiction and vessel boarding, explosive ordnance disposal, diving and salvage operations, mine clearance operations, and an amphibious landing. RIMPAC 2010 will also emphasize littoral operations with ships like the U.S. littoral combat ship [tpl]USS|Freedom|LCS-1|2[/tpl], the French frigate Prairial, and the Singaporean Formidable class frigate RSS Supreme.
On 28 June 2010, the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan arrived in Pearl Harbor to participate in RIMPAC 2010. Ronald Reagan was the only aircraft carrier to participate in this exercise. During the in-port phase of RIMPAC, officers and crew of the 14 participating navies interact in receptions, meetings, and athletic events.[tpl]cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Aaron Stevens, USN | title= USS Ronald Reagan Arrives in Hawaii for RIMPAC 2010 | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=54347 | work= NNS100630-09 | publisher= USS Ronald Reagan Public Affairs | date= 30 June 2010 | accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] The Reagan completed its Tailored Ships Training Availability (TSTA) exercises prior to RIMPAC 2010.
During 6–7 July 2010, 32 naval vessels and five submarines from seven nations departed Pearl Harbor to participate in Phase II of RIMPAC 2010. This phase included live fire gunnery and missile exercises; maritime interdiction and vessel boardings; and anti-surface warfare, undersea warfare, naval maneuvers and air defense exercises. Participants also collaborated in explosive ordnance disposal; diving and salvage operations; mine clearance operations; and amphibious operations.[tpl]cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Robert Stirrup, USN | title= Ships Depart Pearl Harbor for RIMPAC 2010 Exercises | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=54554 | work= NNS100708-18 | publisher= Commander, Navy Region Hawaii Public Affairs | date= 9 July 2010 | accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] Phase III involved scenario-driven exercises designed to further strengthen maritime skills and capabilities.
During RIMPAC 2010, over 40 naval personnel from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Chile, Peru, and Colombia managed combat exercises while serving aboard the Ronald Reagan (pictured). This involved managing anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare for Carrier Strike Group Seven and the entire RIMPAC force, including the use of radar, charts, and high-tech devices to monitor, chart, and communicate with other ships and submarines. Tactical action officers from the different countries coordinated the overall operational picture and provided direction and administration to the enlisted personnel involved in the Sea Combat Control (SCC) activities.[tpl]cite web | author= Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Stephen Votaw, USN | title= USS Ronald Reagan Hosts International Navies for Sea Combat Control Exercises During RIMPAC 2010 | url= http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=54880 | work= NNS100724-06 | publisher= USS Ronald Reagan Public Affairs | date= 24 July 2010| accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] Also, Reagan conducted a live Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launch, firing at a simulated target, the first since 2007.

==RIMPAC 2014==

RIMPAC 2014 will be the 24th exercise in the series and will take place in the summer of 2014.
For the first time, the Royal Norwegian Navy will actively participate in the exercise. Norway will send one Fridtjof Nansen-class frigate and possibly Norwegian marine special forces.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10148449 China has also been invited to send ships from their People's Liberation Army Navy; if China chooses to attend, it will mark not only the first time China will participate in a RIMPAC exercise, but also the first time China will participate in a large-scale United States-led naval drill. http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/22/us-usa-china-drill-idUSBRE92L18A20130322

==Experiments==

RIMPAC experiments have included a range of sectors important to international militaries. In RIMPAC 2000, for example, the first of the Strong Angel international humanitarian response demonstrations was held on the Big Island of Hawai'i near Pu'u Pa'a. That series continued with events in the summer of 2004 and again in 2006.  
Participants have also conducted exercises in ship-sinking and torpedo usage. They also have tested new naval vessels and technology. For example in 2004, the United States Navy tested the Australian built HSV-2 Swift, a 321-foot experimental wave-piercing catamaran that draws only 11 feet of water, has a top speed of almost 50 knots, and can transport 605 tons of cargo.
