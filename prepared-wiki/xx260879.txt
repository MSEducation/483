The Raymond Fogelman Social Sciences and Humanities Library is the flagship library of The New School university.  It is located at 55 West 13th Street, in New York City's Greenwich Village.

==Location==

Currently, the library is located at 55 West 13th Street, better known as Arnhold Hall.  The library moved to that location when 65 Fifth Avenue was demolished. Until that time Arnhold Hall had been the main academic building for The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. The move caused controversy among student activists, who demanded additional study space.
Shelves are distributed throughout the building's nine floors, with computer labs available on the third and ninth floors.  Cafe 55, one of The New School's main dining halls, is located on the fourth floor, and is a popular study area for undergraduates.

==Collection==

The New School owns other several libraries throughout New York City, and is a member of the Research Library Association of South Manhattan. Fogelman, holds its largest collection with 150,350 tangible items and 1,580,310 digital ones.http://www.newschool.edu/admin/oir/documents/2009-fact-sheet.pdf Other university libraries include:
==Access and Usage==

All students and faculty of The New School are granted access to Fogelman. In addition, students at Cooper Union and New York University can also access the collection as part of an intercollegiate consortium.
Throughout the academic year, Fogelman hosts events and workshops.  A schedule of events can be found on the library's website.
Several key paintings in The New School Art Collection are kept at Fogelman.  Among these is a floor-to-ceiling, wrap-around, black-and-white wall mural by Kara Walker.  Completed in fall of 2009, the piece comments on America's history of racism and slavery.  In the center of the stairwell is a large sculpture meant to compliment Walker's piece.
