[[Gjálp and Greip]]

CATEGORIES: Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Gjálp and Greip are two giantesses.

==Thor's visit to Geirröðr==

According to Skáldskaparmál they were daughters of the giant Geirröðr. As Thor was wading across Vimur the river "waxed so greatly that it broke high upon his shoulders". He finds out why.
Once Thor reaches Geirröðr's dwelling he is offered a seat.
The same myth is related in Þórsdrápa, though the giantesses are not named there.
Gesta Danorum relates a similar story.

==Other references==

In Hyndluljóð Gjálp and Greip are mentioned as two of the mothers of Heimdall.
In Haustlöng, Þjazi is called "the son of the suitor of Greip". Greip may be used there as a generic giantess name and the kenning may mean simply "giant".
In a lausavísa composed by Vetrliði Sumarliðason and quoted in Skáldskaparmál, Gjálp is mentioned as being killed by Thor.
