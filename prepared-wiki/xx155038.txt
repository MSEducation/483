The activities of CHUNK 666 include building tall bikes, riding said bikes at events like Critical Mass, making zines and organizing the Chunkathalon, which is an annual festival. The bicycles are home-made using salvaged bicycle parts and a variety of methods, including welding; they are described as "bikes that have [tpl]convert|9|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl]-long forks and are built to come apart after 3Â½ miles, or are [tpl]convert|9|ft|m[/tpl] tall, or lean back so far that it doesn't look sane - let alone safe - to ride".[tpl]cite book | last = Carlsson | first = Chris | title =  Critical Mass: Bicycling's Defiant Celebration | publisher = AK Press | year = 2002 | pages = 208 | isbn = 1-902593-59-6 [/tpl]
