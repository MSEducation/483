The Marion Malkin Memorial Bowl, or Malkin Bowl, is an outdoor theatre in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Built in 1934, it was originally a two-thirds-size replica of the Hollywood Bowl. Allard de Ridder, then conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, was largely responsible for convincing W.H. Malkin, a former mayor of Vancouver, to build the theatre as a summer concert venue for the VSO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0002979|title=Allard de Ridder|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|author=Bryan N.S. Gooch[/tpl] Malkin endowed the theatre in memory of his wife.
Malkin Bowl is home to Theatre Under The Stars, or TUTS.
