==History==

===First generation-C1 (1953–1962)===

The first generation Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 model year. Originally designed as a show car for the 1953 Motorama display at the New York Auto Show, it generated enough interest to induce GM to make a production version to sell to the public. To keep costs down, GM executive Robert F. McLean mandated off-the-shelf mechanical components, and used the chassis and suspension from the 1952 Chevy sedan. The drivetrain and passenger compartment were moved rearward to achieve a 53/47 front-to-rear weight distribution.  It had a 102-inch wheelbase. The engine was the same inline six that powered all other Chevrolet models, but with a higher-compression ratio, three Carter side-draft carburetors, and a more aggressive cam. Output was 150 horsepower. Because there was currently no manual transmission available to Chevrolet rated to handle 150 HP, a two-speed Powerglide automatic was used. 0-60 mph time was 11.5 seconds. To keep tooling costs in line, the body was made out of fiberglass instead of steel. First production was on June 30, 1953.[tpl]cite book|last=Emanuel|first=Dave|title=Corvette Tech Q & A|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1557883769[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Porter|first=Lindsay|title=Chevrolet Corvette Restoration Guide|year=1997|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=0760303258|page=256|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BqpUBaVCOtEC&dq=Chevrolet+Corvette+(C1)+1955[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/corvette/history.html | title=Chevrolet Corvette History | publisher=Edmunds | accessdate=2013-03-29[/tpl]
This generation was often referred to as the "solid-axle" models (the independent rear suspension was not introduced until the second generation).[tpl]cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Classic Corvette 30 Years|year=2003|publisher=Crestline Imprints|isbn=0760318069|page=384|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jBtsVHSnt5gC&dq=Solid+axle+Corvette[/tpl] 300 hand-built polo white Corvette convertibles were produced for the 1953 model year.[tpl]cite book|last=Prince|first=Richard|title=Corvette Buyers Guide, 1953-1967|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=0760310092|page=192|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6fqyf5ceXucC&dq=Corvette+rushed+into+production|date=2002-08-08[/tpl]
The 1954 model year arrived quickly. It could now be ordered in Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red and Black, or Polo White. 3,640 were built, and sold slowly.
The 1955 model offered a [tpl]convert|265|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] V8 engine as an option. With a large inventory of unsold 1954 models, GM limited production to 700 for 1955.  With the V8, 0-60 mph time improved to 8.5 seconds.
A new body was introduced for the 1956 model featuring a new "face" and side coves; the taillamp fins were also gone.[tpl]cite book|last=W.

The 1958 Corvette received a body and interior freshening which included a longer front end with quad headlamps, bumper exiting exhaust tips, a new steering wheel, and a dashboard with all gauges mounted directly in front of the driver.[tpl]cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard catalog of Corvette, 1953-2005|year=2004|publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0873499077|edition=Second [/tpl] Exclusive to the 1958 model were hood louvers and twin trunk spears.

In 1961, the rear of the car was completely redesigned with the addition of a "duck tail" with four round lights. The light treatment would continue for all following model year Corvettes until 2014.[tpl]cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History, Photos, Technical Data and Pricing|year=2011|publisher=F+W Media |isbn=1440230552|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lbWMwV86qPsC&dq=1961+corvette&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] In 1962, the Chevrolet [tpl]convert|283|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] Small-Block was enlarged to [tpl]convert|327|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Second generation-C2 (1963–1967)===

The second generation (C2) Corvette, which introduced Sting Ray to the model, continued with fiberglass body panels, and overall, was smaller than the first generation. The C2 was later referred to as mid-years.[tpl]cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=The Corvette Factories: Building America's Sports Car|year=2009|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-3551-2|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ogJxa6-rMLEC&dq=c2+corvette+Larry+Shinoda&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] The car was designed by Larry Shinoda with major inspiration from a previous concept design called the "Q Corvette," which was created by Peter Brock and Chuck Pohlmann under the styling direction of Bill Mitchell.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=March 2003 |issn=0032-4558|page=61|url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=c88DAAAAMBAJ&dq=c2+corvette+Larry+Shinoda |title= 50 Corvette [/tpl] Earlier, Mitchell had sponsored a car known as the "Mitchell Sting Ray" in 1959 because Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing. This vehicle had the largest impact on the styling of this generation, although it had no top and did not give away what the final version of the C2 would look like.[tpl]cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=Corvette Restoration Guide, 1963-1967|year=1999|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-0179-1|page=18|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=eUFVYkBduPEC&dq=Mitchell+Sting+Ray&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] The third inspiration was a Mako Shark Mitchell had caught while deep-sea fishing.[tpl]cite book|title=DieCastX Magazine|year=2007|publisher=Air Age|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=OvoDAAAAMBAJ&dq=Mako+Shark+Mitchell+had+caught+while+deep-sea+fishing.&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]
Production started for the 1963 model year and ended in 1967. Introducing a new name, "Sting Ray", the 1963 model was the first year for a Corvette coupé and it featured a distinctive tapering rear deck (a feature that later reappeared on the 1971 "Boattail" Buick Riviera) with, for 1963 only, a split rear window. The Sting Ray featured hidden headlamps, non-functional hood vents, and an independent rear suspension.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Hot Rod |title=Street Machines and Bracket Racing |issue=5 |year=1981 |page=77[/tpl] Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov never liked the split rear window because it blocked rear vision, but Mitchell thought it to be a key part of the entire design. Maximum power for 1963 was [tpl]convert|360|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and was raised to [tpl]convert|375|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] in 1964. Options included electronic ignition, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic first offered on some 1963 Pontiac models.[tpl]cite book| title=Super Street Cars|publisher=Super Street Cars|page=35[/tpl] On 1964 models the decorative hood vents were eliminated and Duntov, the Corvette's chief engineer, got his way with the split rear window changed to a full width window.
Four-wheel disc brakes were introduced in 1965, as was a "big block" engine option: the [tpl]convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] V8. Side exhaust pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the [tpl]convert|425|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] [tpl]convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] big block in 1965 spelled the beginning of the end for the Rochester fuel injection system.[tpl]cite book|first=Staff of Old Cars Weekly|title=Nothin' but Muscle|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1-4402-1549-0|page=34|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=o6hBEhAvkUoC&dq=1965+%22big+block%22+Sting+Ray+corvette&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] The [tpl]convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] option cost [tpl]USD|292.70[/tpl] while the fuel injected [tpl]convert|327|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] engine cost [tpl]USD|538.00[/tpl]. Few people could justify spending [tpl]USD|245.00[/tpl] more for [tpl]convert|50|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds.  Another rare '63 and '64 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums and more, only a couple hundred coupes and ONE convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963.  With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of '65n production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425 hp in the middle of the production year and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger 427 cubic inch big block [tpl]convert|427|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] Big Block version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a telescopic steering wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=September 1988 |issn=0032-4558|url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=zOQDAAAAMBAJ&dq=Sting+Ray's+independent+rear+suspension+was&source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Driving the New Corvette [/tpl]
1967 was the final year for the C2 generation. The 1967 model featured restyled fender vents, less ornamentation, and back-up lamps which were now rectangular and centrally located. The first use of all four taillights in red also occurred in the 1967 model; this all-four red taillight treatment continued on the first C3 in 1968 only and later returned on the first C4 in 1984, continuing on all Corvettes since. 1967 had the first L88 engine option which was rated at [tpl]convert|430|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], but unofficial estimates place the actual output at [tpl]convert|560|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] or more.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1CqX-40TnVUC&pg=PA203 |last=Leffingwell|first=Randy |title=Corvette Fifty Years |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |page=203|isbn=0-7603-1180-3[/tpl] Only twenty such engines were installed at the factory. From 1967 (to 1969), the Holley triple two-barrel carburetor, or Tri-Power, was available on the 427 L89 (a $368 option, on top of the cost for the high-performance 427).[tpl]cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J.

Duntov came up with a lightweight version of the C2 in 1962. Concerned about Ford and what they were doing with the Shelby Cobra, GM planned to manufacture 100 Grand Sport Corvettes, but only five were actually built.[tpl]cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=2003|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=c88DAAAAMBAJ&dq=Chevrolet+Corvette+(C2)+Grand+Sport&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] They were driven by historic drivers such as Roger Penske, A.

===Third generation-C3 (1968–1982)===

The third generation Corvette, patterned after the Mako Shark II concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model year and was in production until 1982. C3 coupes featured the first use of T-top removable roof panels. It introduced monikers that were later revived, such as LT-1, ZR-1, and Collector Edition. In 1978, the Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with a two-tone Silver Anniversary Edition and an Indy Pace Car replica edition of the C3. This was also the first time that a Corvette was used as a Pace Car for the Indianapolis 500.[tpl]cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=1977|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558[/tpl]
Engines and chassis components were mostly carried over from the C2, but the body and interior were new. The [tpl]convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] engine replaced the old [tpl]convert|327|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] as the base engine in 1969, but power remained at [tpl]convert|300|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. 1969 was the only year for a C3 to optionally offer either a factory installed side exhaust or normal rear exit with chrome tips. The all-aluminum ZL1 engine was also new for 1969; the special big-block engine was listed at 430-hp (320 kW), but was reported to produce [tpl]convert|560|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and propelled a ZL1 through the 1/4 mile in 10.89 seconds.Corvette 50th Anniversary-specifications and performance-by the Editors of Consumer Guide
There was an extended production run for the 1969 model year due a lengthy labor strike, which meant sales were down on the 1970 models, to 17,316.Flory, p.734. 1970 small-block power peaked with the optional high compression, high-revving LT-1 that produced [tpl]convert|370|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The 427 big-block was enlarged to [tpl]convert|454|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] with a [tpl]convert|390|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] rating. The ZR-1 special package was an option available on the 1970 through 1972 model years, and included the LT-1 engine combined with special racing equipment. Only 53 ZR-1's were built.[tpl]cite web|author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-corvette.htm |title=1971 Corvette |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-06-07|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]
In 1971, to accommodate regular low-lead fuel with lower anti-knock properties, the engine compression ratios were lowered which resulted in reduced power ratings. The power rating for the [tpl]convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] L48 base engine decreased from 300 to 270 horsepower and the optional special high performance LT1 engine decreased from 370 to 330 horsepower. The big-block LS6 454 was reduced from 450 to [tpl]convert|425|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], though it was not used in Corvettes for 1970; it was used in the Chevelle SS. For the 1972 model year, GM moved to the SAE Net measurement which resulted in further reduced, but more realistic, power ratings than the previous SAE Gross standard.[tpl]cite book|last=Antonick|first=Mike|title=Corvette Black, Books 1953-2007|year=2006|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-2894-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9P-RNjfCeRYC&dq=1971+Corvette[/tpl] Although the 1972 model's [tpl]convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] horsepower was actually the same as that for the 1971 model year, the lower net horsepower numbers were used instead of gross horsepower. The L48 base engine was now rated at [tpl]convert|200|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and the optional LT1 engine was now rated at [tpl]convert|270|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl]. 1974 models had the last true dual exhaust system that was dropped on the 1975 models with the introduction of catalytic converters requiring the use of no-lead fuel. Engine power decreased with the base ZQ3 engine producing [tpl]convert|165|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the optional L82's output [tpl]convert|205|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], while the 454 big-block engine was discontinued. Gradual power increases after 1975 peaked with the 1980 model's optional L82 producing [tpl]convert|230|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Styling changed subtly throughout the generation until 1978 for the car's 25th anniversary. The Sting Ray nameplate was not used on the 1968 model, but Chevrolet still referred to the Corvette as a Sting Ray; however, the 1969 (through 1976) models used the "Stingray" name as one word, without the space.[tpl]cite book|last=Mann|first=James |first2=Tom |last2=Falconer |title=Corvette 1968-1982|year=2010|publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3747-9|url= http://books.google.com/?id=oTh4irEsXCgC&dq=1968+Corvette [/tpl] In 1970, the body design was updated including fender flares, and interiors were refined, which included redesigned seats,and indication lights near the gear shift that were an early  use of fiber optics . Due to government regulation, the 1973 Corvette's chrome front bumper was changed to a [tpl]convert|5|mph|0|adj=on[/tpl]system with a urethane bumper cover.[tpl]cite book|last=McNicholl|first=George A.|title=How to rebuild Corvette rolling chassis 1963-1982|year=2007|publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3014-2|page=14[/tpl] 1973 Corvettes are unique in that sense, as they are the only year where the front bumper was polyurethane and the rear retained the chrome two-piece bumper set. 1973 was also the last year chrome bumpers were used. The optional wire-spoked wheel covers (left) were offered for the last time in 1973. From 1974 onwards both the front and rear bumpers were polyurethane.
In 1974, a [tpl]convert|5|mph|0|adj=on[/tpl] rear bumper system with a two-piece, tapering urethane bumper cover replaced the Kamm-tail and chrome bumper blades, and matched the new front design from the previous year. 1975 was the last year for the convertible, (which did not return for 11 years) and Dave McLellan succeeded Zora Arkus-Duntov as the Corvette's Chief Engineer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corvettemuseum.com/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716165801/http://www.corvettemuseum.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|publisher=Web.archive.org |date=July 16, 2011|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl] For the 1976 models the fiberglass floor was replaced with steel panels to provide protection from the catalytic converter's high operating temperature.

Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with the Indy 500 Pace Car limited edition and a Silver Anniversary model featuring silver over gray lower body paint. All 1979 models featured the previous year's pace car seats and offered the front and rear spoilers as optional equipment. 53,807 were produced for the model year, making 1979 the peak production year for all versions of the Corvette.

After several years of weight increases, 1980 Corvettes were lighter as engineers trimmed both body and chassis weight. In mid-1981, production shifted from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and several two-tone paint options were offered. The 1981 models were the last available with a manual transmission until well into the 1984 production run. In 1982, a fuel-injected engine returned, and a final C3 tribute Collectors Edition featured an exclusive, opening rear window hatch.

===Fourth generation-C4 (1984–1996)===

The fourth generation Corvette was the first complete redesign of the Corvette since 1963. Production was to begin for the 1983 model year but quality issues and part delays resulted in only 43 prototypes for the 1983 model year being produced that were never sold. All of the 1983 prototypes were destroyed or serialized to 1984 except one with a white exterior, medium blue interior, L83 350 ci, 205 bhp V8, and 4-speed automatic transmission. After extensive testing and modifications were completed, it was initially retired as a display sitting in an external wall over the Bowling Green Assembly Plant's employee entrance.

Regular fourth generation production began on January 3, 1983; the 1984 model year and delivery to customers began in March 1983. The 1984 model carried over the [tpl]convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] L83 slightly more powerful (5 bhp) "Crossfire" V8 engine from the final 1982 third generation model. New chassis features were aluminum brake calipers and an all-aluminum suspension for weight savings and rigidity. The new one piece targa top had no center reinforcement. A new electronic dashboard with digital liquid crystal displays for the speedometer and tachometer was standard. Beginning in 1985, the [tpl]convert|230|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] L98 engine with tuned port fuel injection became the standard engine.
September 1984 through 1988 Corvettes offered a Doug Nash designed "4+3" transmission – a 4-speed manual coupled to an automatic overdrive on the top three gears. It was designed to help the Corvette meet U.S. fuel economy standards. Since 1981 (when it was last offered), a manual transmission returned to the Corvette starting with production in late-1984. The transmission proved to be problematic and was replaced by a modern ZF 6-speed manual gearbox in 1989.[tpl]cite book|last=Cangialosi|first=Paul|title=How to rebuild and modify high-performance manual transmissions|year=2010|publisher=CarTech |isbn=1934709298[/tpl]
In 1986, the second Corvette Indy Pace Car was released. It was the first convertible Corvette since 1975. A Center High Mounted Signal Light (CHMSL) – a third center brake light – was added in 1986 to comply with safety regulations. While the color of the pace car used in the race was yellow, all 1986 convertibles also had an Indy 500 emblem mounted on the console, making any color a "pace car edition". In 1987, the B2K twin-turbo option became available from the factory. The Callaway Corvette was a Regular Production Option (RPO B2K). The B2K option coexisted from 1990 to 1991 with the ZR-1 option, which then replaced it. Early B2Ks produced [tpl]convert|345|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|450|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl];[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/specs/callaway/87tt.html|title=1987 Twin Turbo Callaway Corvette|publisher=Corvette Action Center|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl] later versions boasted [tpl]convert|450|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|613|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/specs/callaway/90tt.html|title=1990 Twin Turbo Callaway Corvette|publisher=Corvette Action Center|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]
1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. Each of these featured a special badge with an identification number mounted next to the gear selector, and were finished with a white exterior, wheels, and interior. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer to that of the base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained at the top of the rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.
For the 1992 model year, the [tpl]convert|300|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] LT1 engine was introduced, an increase of [tpl]convert|50|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off the front of the camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer. Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.
A special 40th Anniversary Edition was released in 1993, which featured a commemorative Ruby Red color, 40th anniversary badges, and embroidered seat backs. The 1993 Corvette also marked the introduction of the Passive Keyless Entry System, making it the first GM car to feature it. Production of the ZR-1 ended in 1995, after 6,939 cars had been built.[tpl]cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=101 projects for your Corvette : 1984-1996|year=2003|publisher=Motorbooks International |isbn=0760314616[/tpl] 1996 was the final year of C4 production, and featured special models and options, including the Grand Sport and Collector Edition, OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics), run flat tires, and the LT4 engine. The [tpl]convert|330|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] LT4 V8 was available only with a manual transmission, while all [tpl]convert|300|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] LT1 Corvettes used automatic transmissions.
Chevrolet released the Grand Sport (GS) version in 1996 to mark the end of production of the C4 Corvette. The Grand Sport moniker was a nod to the original Grand Sport model produced in 1963. A total of 1,000 GS Corvettes were produced, 810 as coupes and 190 as convertibles. The 1996 GS came with the high-performance LT4 V8 engine, producing [tpl]convert|330|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|340|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Grand Sport came only in Admiral Blue with a white stripe down the middle, and black wheels and two red stripes on the front left wheel arch.[tpl]cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette milestones|year=1996|publisher=Motorbooks International |isbn=076030095X[/tpl]

===Fifth generation-C5 (1997–2004)===

Production of the C5 Corvette began in 1997 and ended with the 2004 model year. Chevrolet used cars like the Nissan 300ZX and Mazda RX-7 as benchmarks for quality and styling due to criticisms the C4 Corvette received when compared to Japanese rivals.[tpl]cite book |title= All Corvettes Are Red|last= Schefter|first= James |year= 1998 |publisher=Pocket Publishing |isbn= 978-0-671-68501-0 | url= http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671685015 [/tpl] The C5 had a top speed of [tpl]convert|181|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and was judged by the automotive press as improved in nearly every area over the previous Corvette design, thanks to the car's much increased structural rigidity and much more curvaceous design.[tpl]cite web|last=Pace|first=Harold|title=The Immortal Corvette: 1997-2003|url=http://www.automedia.com/The_Immortal_Corvette_19972003/res20031201c5/1/|publisher=autoMedia.com|accessdate=30 September 2012[/tpl]
Also introduced with the C5 was GM's new LS1 small block. This third-generation small block V8 was completely redesigned. Now all-aluminum, it featured a distributor-less ignition and a new cylinder firing order. It was initially rated at [tpl]convert|345|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|350|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl], but was increased to [tpl]convert|350|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] in the 2001 edition. The new engine, combined with the new body and its low 0.29 drag coefficient, was able to achieve up to 28 mpg on the highway.[tpl]cite book|last=Thurn|first=Walt|title=High-performance C5 Corvette builder's guide|year=2007|publisher=CarTech |isbn=1932494332[/tpl]
For its first year, the C5 was available only as a coupe, although the new platform was designed from the ground up to be a convertible, which returned in 1998, followed by the fixed-roof coupe (FRC) in 1999. One concept for the FRC was for it to be a stripped-down model with a possible V6 engine (nicknamed in-house as the "Billy Bob").[tpl]cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=Corvette C5 performance projects|year=2006|publisher=MBI Pub. |isbn=0760320810|page=8[/tpl] By 2000, FRC plans laid the groundwork for the return in 2001 of the Z06, an RPO option not seen since Zora's 1963 race-ready Corvette.Schefter, pp. 96, 105, 108.
The Z06 model replaced the FRC model as the highest performance C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a [tpl]convert|385|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] derivative of the standard LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid fixed roof design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex.[tpl]cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Essential musclecars|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0760319669[/tpl] Those characteristics, along with the use of materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to [tpl]convert|405|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl]for 2002–2004. Although the Z06's rated power output equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.[tpl]cite book|last=Endres|first=Christopher P.|title=Chevy LS1/LS6 performance : high performance modifications for street and racing : covers Chevy LS1 and LS6 engines, 1997 and up|year=1996|publisher=HP Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=1557884072|edition=1st ed.[/tpl]

===Sixth generation-C6 (2005–2013)===

The C6 Corvette retained the front engine and rear transmission design of the C5, but was otherwise all-new, including new bodywork with exposed headlamps (for the first time since 1962), a larger passenger compartment, a new 6.0 liter engine and a reworked suspension geometry. It had a longer wheelbase than the C5, but its overall vehicle length and width were less than the C5, allegedly to widen appeal to the European market.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] The 6.0L (364 cu in) LS2 V8 produced [tpl]convert|400|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6000 rpm and [tpl]convert|400|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] at 4400 rpm, giving the vehicle a 0–60 time of under 4.2 seconds.[tpl]cite book|last=Berg|first=Phil|title=Corvette C6|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0760318654[/tpl] Its top speed was [tpl]convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The C6 generation did not match the previous generation's relatively good fuel economy, despite its relatively low 0.28 drag coefficient and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions. This feature helps the C6 avoid the Gas Guzzler Tax by achieving better fuel economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.web-cars.com/corvette/1989.php|title=The Corvette Story|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]
The new Z06 arrived as a 2006 model in the third quarter of 2005. It has a 7.0 L version of the small block engine codenamed LS7. At 427.6 cubic inches, the Z06 was the largest small block ever offered from General Motors. Because of the Corvette's former use of 427 cubic-inch big blocks in the late-1960s and early 1970s, the LS7's size was rounded down to 427 cubic inches. Official output was [tpl]convert|505|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and has a 0-[tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] time of 3.7 seconds with no increase in top speed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/corvette/2006/first-drive-2006-chevrolet-corvette-z06.html|title=First Drive: 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06|publisher=Insideline.com|date=August 31, 2005|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]
For 2008, the Corvette received a mild freshening: a new LS3 engine with displacement increased to [tpl]convert|6.2|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl], resulting in [tpl]convert|430|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|424|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|436|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|428|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] if ordered with the optional performance exhaust). The 6-speed manual transmission also has improved shift linkage and a 0–60 time of 4.0 seconds, while the automatic is set up for quicker shifts giving the C6 automatic a 0–60 time of 4.0 seconds, faster than any other production automatic Corvette. The interior was slightly updated and a new 4LT leather-wrap interior package was added. The wheels were also updated to a new five-spoke design.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FirstDrives/articleId=120575|title=First Drive: 2008 Chevrolet Corvette|publisher=Edmunds.com|date=Apr 27, 2007|accessdate=Nov 22, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
ZR1 was formally announced in a December 2007 press statement by General Motors, where it was revealed that their target of [tpl]convert|100|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] per [tpl]convert|1|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] had been reached by a new "LS9" engine with an Eaton-supercharged 6.2-liter engine producing [tpl]convert|638|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|604|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl].

The historical name Grand Sport returned to the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was basically an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many of the features of the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry sump oiling (manual transmission only), 6-piston 14" front brakes and 4-piston rear, improved suspension, and front carbon fiber fenders. Manual power train equipped G/S models receive a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a dry-sump oil system. A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allows for sub 4 second 0-60. EPA estimated 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on skid pad.
Beginning with the 2011 model year, buyers of the Corvette Z06 and ZR1 were offered the opportunity to assist in the build of their engine. Titled the "Corvette Engine Build Experience," buyers paid extra to be flown to the Wixom, Michigan Performance Build Center.[tpl]cite book|last=Earnest|first=Brian|title=Corvette the great American sports car|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, WI|isbn=144021753X[/tpl] Participants helped the assembly line workers build the V8 engine, then took delivery of the car at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, KY, near the Corvette final assembly point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/07/13/2011-chevy-corvette-engines-can-be-built-by-owner/|title=2011 Chevy Corvette Engines Can be Built by Owner|publisher=Automoblog.net|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]

===Seventh Generation-C7 (2014–)===

The next-generation (C7) Corvette had been in development since 2007. Originally set to be introduced for the 2011 model year, its introduction was delayed for 3 years.

To GM's product planners and marketers, the fact that the Corvette had become known as an old man's toy became a prime factor in developing the next generation. Studies showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers in 2012, through October, were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of Audi R8 and 30 percent of Porsche 911 customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledges that too many people saw it as the car of "the successful plumber." John Fitzpatrick, Corvette's marketing manager said "It's the old saying, 'Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man's car, but everybody wants to be seen driving a young man's car.' " To counter that perception GM planned to make the new generation C7 more aspirational to younger people. Towards that end, a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game Gran Turismo 5 in November 2012.[tpl]cite news|last=Higgins |first=Tim |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-11/corvette-not-just-for-successful-plumbers-with-new-design.html |title=Corvette Not Just for Successful Plumbers With New Design |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]  As part of the marketing effort associated with the introduction of the new generation, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 utilized a Corvette for the 12th time as its pace car.

The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette uses an LT1 6.2 L V8 (376 cu in) making [tpl]convert|455|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|460|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] with the optional performance exhaust. The LT1 engine (the "LT1" designation was first used by GM in 1970 and then later in 1992.) is in the Gen 5 family of small block engines, which will be used in GM vehicles as the new small V8 option. It features three technologies new to the GM V8, though widely available on other engines in the marketplace: direct injection, variable valve timing, and an active fuel management system. Fuel injectors are located under the intake manifold. The Corvette remains rear-wheel drive with the transaxle located in the rear. Transmission choices include a 7-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters. The new interior includes wide-bottom seats as standard, with sportier versions with high side bolsters optional. The Corvette's flag logo has been revised for the new car and a small casting of a stingray has been added to the car's ornamentation.
Features of the new generation's structure include a carbon fiber hood and removable roof panel. The fenders, doors and rear quarter panels remain composite. At the rear of the car, the trademark, round taillights have changed to a more squarish form.  The underbody panels are made of "carbon-nano" composite and it makes use of a new aluminum frame which locates the four wheels an inch farther apart, front to rear and side to side.  Luggage space decreased by 33% from the previous generation's.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/new/sns-mct-bc-auto-chevroletstingray-review-20131101,0,5604602.story|title=2014 Chevrolet StingRay Review|accessdate=2013-11-10 | work=Chicago Tribune|first=Mark|last=Phelan[/tpl] The overall weight of the car was not announced by General Motors for many months after its first showing in January 2013.

Astronaut Alan Shepard, a long time Corvette owner, was invited by then GM Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov to drive pre-production Corvette models. General Motors executives later gave Shepard a 1972 model with a Bill Mitchell interior. Jim Rathmann, a Melbourne, Florida Chevrolet dealer and winner of the 1960 Indy 500, befriended astronauts Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper. Rathman convinced GM President Ed Cole to set up a program which supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves.[tpl]cite web|last=Bean|first=Alan|url=http://www.alanbean.com/astronaut_training.cfm|title=Training[/tpl] In his memoir Last Man On The Moon, Gene Cernan describes how this worked. The astronauts received brand-new Corvettes which they were given the option to purchase at a 'used' price after they'd been driven 3000 miles. Alan Bean recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads and beaches themselves as local police turned a blind eye.

==Concept cars==

Corvette concept cars have inspired the designs of several generations of Corvettes.[tpl]cite book|author=auto editors of Consumer Guide |title=Corvette: 50th anniversary|year=2003|publisher=Publications International |isbn=0785379878[/tpl] The first Corvette, Harley Earl's 1953 EX-122 Corvette prototype was itself, a concept show car, first shown to the public at the 1953 GM Motorama at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City on January 17, 1953. It was brought to production in six months with only minor changes.
Harley Earl's successor, Bill Mitchell was the man behind most of the Corvette concepts of the 1960s and 1970s. The second-generation (C2) of 1963 was his, and its design first appeared on the Sting Ray racer of 1959. It made its public debut at Maryland's Marlborough Raceway on April 18, 1959, powered by a [tpl]convert|283|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] V8 with experimental 11:1 compression aluminum cylinder heads and took fourth place. It raced through 1960 wearing only "Sting Ray" badges before retiring to tour the auto-show circuit in 1961.[tpl]cite book|first=Randy |last=Leffingwell |title=Corvette: fifty years|publisher=MBI |year=2002 |isbn=9780760311806 [/tpl]
In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was designed by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the look of that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In 1965 Mitchell removed the original concept body and redesigned it as the Mako Shark II. Chevrolet actually created two of them, only one of which was fully functional. The original Mako Shark was then retroactively called the Mako Shark I. The Mako Shark II debuted in 1965 as a show car and this concept influenced Mitchell's redesigned Corvette of 1968.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The Aerovette has a mid-engine configuration using a transverse mounting of its V-8 engine. Zora Arkus-Duntov's engineers originally built two XP-882s during 1969. John DeLorean, Chevy general manager, ordered one for display at the 1970 New York Auto Show. In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882. A near-identical body in aluminum alloy was constructed and became the XP-895 "Reynolds Aluminum Car." Duntov and Mitchell responded with two Chevrolet Vega (stillborn) Wankel 2-rotor engines joined together as a 4-rotor [tpl]convert|420|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] engine which was used to power the XP-895. It was first shown in late 1973. The 4-rotor show car was outfitted with a [tpl]convert|400|cuin|L|abbr=on[/tpl] small-block V8 in 1977 and rechristened Aerovette. GM chairman Thomas Murphy approved the Aerovette for 1980 production, but Mitchell's retirement that year, combined with then Corvette chief engineer Dave McLellan's lack of enthusiasm for the mid-engine design and slow-selling data on mid-engined cars killed the last hope for a mid-engine Vette.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
A Corvette Stingray Anniversary concept car was unveiled at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, fifty years after the Sting Ray racer-concept of 1959.[tpl]cite book|title=Friends magazine-published by Chevrolet for Corvette owners|publisher=Chevrolet[/tpl] The vehicle was based on a combination of the 1963 Sting Ray and the 1968 Stingray. The new Stingray concept appears in the 2009 movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, as the vehicle mode of the character Sideswipe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5151143/corvette-stingray-concept-sideswipe-in-disguise |title=Corvette Stingray Concept: Sideswipe In Disguise |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=Feb 11, 2009|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl] A convertible/speedster version was used for the same character in the 2011 sequel, Transformers: Dark of the Moon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5802217/transformers-dark-of-the-moon-sideswipe-bumblebee-first-look |title=Transformers "Dark of the Moon" Sideswipe, Bumblebee: First Look |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=Nov 14, 2012[/tpl]

Production statistics from 1953 when the first generation of Corvette's were released until present.

==Owner demographics==

According to research by Specialty Equipment Market Association and Experian Automotive, as of 2009, there were approximately 750,000 Corvettes of all model years registered in the United States. Corvette owners were fairly equally distributed throughout the country, with the highest density in Michigan (3.47 per 1000 residents) and the lowest density in Utah, Mississippi, and Hawaii (1.66, 1.63, and 1.53 registrations per 1000 residents). 47% of them hold college degrees (significantly above the nationwide average of 27%), and 82% are between ages of 40 and 69 (median age being 53).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sema.org/?q=node/1697 |title=Vette Owners Quick to Customize |publisher=SEMA |date=Jan 15, 2009|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012[/tpl]

===C6.R===

C6.R GT1 (Z06)
In 2005, the factory Corvette Team began racing the C6.R to coincide with the new sixth generation (C6) Corvette being released to the public. Private teams, primarily in Europe, continued to race the C5-R for a couple of years before switching to C6.R. Corvette C6.R went on to win its class at every race it entered in the 2005 ALMS season.[tpl]cite web|title=2011 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 Carbon vs. 2010 Corvette Grand Sport vs. 2002 Corvette Z06 Comparison Test and Video|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/corvette/2011/2002-chevrolet-corvette-z06-vs-2010-corvette-grand-sport-vs-2011-corvette-z06-carbon-comparison-test-and-video.html|accessdate=10 October 2012[/tpl]  By the end of 2009, Corvette had clinched four consecutive ALMS GT1 team and manufacturers titles (2005–2008) and three Le Mans 24 Hour class victories in the LMGT1 category (2005, 2006, 2009). 2007 and 2008 races were won by the factory Aston Martin squad's DBR9. The last official race for factory GT1 Corvettes was the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans.[tpl]cite web|title=Pratt & Miller Engineering Introduces Corvette C6RS Supercar for the Street|url=http://www.prattmillerc6rs.com/pressrelease.htm|work=Corvette C6RS|accessdate=10 October 2012[/tpl]
C6.R GT2 (ZR1)
While some privateers continued to use GT1 version of the C6.R in Europe, the official factory team Corvette Racing switched from slowly dying GT1 category to much more competitive and popular GT2 class in mid-2009. The new GT2 C6.R used a modified version of the ZR1 model body, but does not have the ZR1 supercharged engine. GT2 rules are based more on production vehicles, therefore the GT2 C6.R naturally aspirated engine was considerably more restricted and less powerful than its predecessor. The car debuted at Mid-Ohio's ALMS round. They achieved one ALMS race victory in the remaining 2009 ALMS season, and one victory at the final round of 2010 ALMS season, Petit Le Mans. Corvette Racing's two GT2 C6.Rs also led most of the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, but both cars were forced to retire. Racing in the new GTE Pro class, the C6.R raced in the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the No. 73 car taking the class victory. The No. 74 car led the class for most of the race but crashed in the morning hours. The C6.R raced by Larbre Competition also took the GTE Am class victory.[tpl]cite web|last=Schilke|first=Nancy|title=Shanghai victory sees Larbre Competition crowned GTE Am world champions|url=http://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/shanghai-victory-sees-larbre-competition-crowned-gte-am-world-champions/|work=Race reports|accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl] In 2012, Corvette Racing returned to glory in the ALMS winning 4 of 10 races and claiming the Driver’s, Team, and Manufacturer’s Championships. Corvette Racing repeated the feat in 2013 by winning 5 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team and Manufacturer's Championships again.

===C7.R===

In 2014, Corvette Racing introduced the new C7.R to coincide with the launch of the seventh-generation C7 Corvette. The car made its on track debut at the 2013 Rolex Motorsports Reunion and later participated in the 2014 Roar Before the Rolex 24 to prepare for the 2014 United SportsCar Championship. The car's new livery will be debuted at the 2014 North American International Auto Show.
