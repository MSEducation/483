==Fictional character biography==

Karyn, a psi judge, first worked with Dredd in the initial Raptaur invasion[tpl]Issue|date=November 2009[/tpl] and would work alongside him several times afterwards[tpl]Issue|date=November 2009[/tpl]. She primarily handled supernatural threats. Karyn expressed a desire to replace Judge Anderson as the department legend, taking several missions just to achieve this, such as joining Dredd's covert team infiltrating Sov gulags.Judge Dredd: "Gulag" (by Gordon Rennie and Charlie Adlard, in 2000 AD #1382-1386, 2004)
She would also work alongside other notable names in the Judge Dredd Universe, teaming up with Devlin Waugh during his "Fetish" story (lead into through "Visions").
Her career met an ignoble end in 2127[tpl]Issue|date=November 2009[/tpl]. Four years before, she and Dredd had teamed up to handle an East-European vampiric entity (termed virkolak) known as the Shadow King, who had been killing Sov asylum-seekers. Unknown to her, its spirit had escaped into the Undercity; when she and Dredd led a rescue mission into the Undercity, they discovered the Shadow King had spent the last four years building up an army of vampiric Troggies. After the creature possessed Dredd, she tried to emulate Anderson by drawing its spirit into her mind to be imprisoned - the attempt went wrong and she was completely possessed. She is currently locked in a Psi-Division cell, and it is considered unlikely her mind can ever be retrieved[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl].
