The Buchla 200e is a modular synthesizer designed by electronic music pioneer Don Buchla and built by Buchla and Associates (now called Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments).  

==History==

The 200e is based on the earlier Model 200 system. Many of the modules in the 200e series share similar functionality and layout with Model 200 modules, and therefore have similar names. However, all of the e series modules have the ability to store and recall parameters set by the user. Another new feature the 200e adds is MIDI implementation via the 225e MIDI Decoder module. This allows 200e modules to respond to MIDI note, velocity, and controller data via internal busses.
