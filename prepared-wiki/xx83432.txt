Tieta (Portuguese: Tieta do Agreste, lit. "Tieta from Agreste") is a melodrama novel written by Brazilian author Jorge Amado, published on August 17, 1977. Set in the 1970s, it narrates the return of Tieta to the remote village of Santana do Agreste, 26 years after being beaten and expelled by her father in front of all the town's people.
In 1996, a film version was made with Sonia Braga in the role of Tieta.

==Background==

Written in Buraquinho Beach, Lauro de Freitas, on the surroundings of Salvador, Brazil, and concluded in London in mid-1977, Tieta lives up to its full title: "Tieta from Agreste, Goats Sheperd or The Return of The Prodigal Daughter, Melodramatic Feuilleton in Five Sensational Episodes and Poignant Epilogue: Emotion and Suspense!" The book is one of the author's longest narratives and follows the story's protagonist on a range of three decades.
In the work of Jorge Amado, the novel falls between those books that, in novelistic tone, chronic time and custom, without losing sight of social and political criticism. Published during the period of military regime, the plot anticipates issues that would become central in the life of the country, such as concern for the environment and criticism to power relations guided by favoritism and corruption. With its impetuosity and questioning spirit, Tieta joined the gallery of the author's great female characters, alongside with Gabriela, Dona Flor and Tereza Batista.
