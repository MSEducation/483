Thunder and Lightnings is a realistic children's novel by Jan Mark, published in 1976 by Kestrel Books of Harmondsworth, London, with illustrations by Jim Russell. Set in Norfolk, it features a developing friendship between two boys who share an interest in aeroplanes, living near RAF Coltishall during the months in 1974 when the Royal Air Force is phasing out its Lightning fighters and introducing the Jaguar.
Mark won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. She also won a prize for children's novels by new writers, sponsored by The Guardian newspaper.
Atheneum Books published the first U.S. edition in 1979, retaining the Russell illustrations.

==Origins==

Jan and Neil Mark moved to Norfolk in 1969 and lived "directly under a flight-path, with Lightning fighters from RAF Coltishall taking off 200 feet above the roof". According to her obituary in The Guardian, she wrote her debut novel Thunder and Lightnings for "the Kestrel/Guardian prize for a children's novel by a previously unpublished writer", and won it.[ref]
This was not the venerable Guardian Children's Fiction Prize (1966 to present), which annually recognises a book by someone who has not yet won the award; Jan Mark never won that. Evidently it was co-sponsored by a publisher; 2006 obituaries in The Guardian and The Independent named it "Kestrel/Guardian" and "Penguin/Guardian" respectively.
