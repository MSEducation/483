Antique (Pronunciation: [tpl]IPAc-en|ɑː|n|ˈ|t|iː|k|ə[/tpl]) is a province of the Philippines located in the region of Western Visayas. The province's capital, San Jose, is located in the western portion of Panay Island and borders Aklan, Capiz and Iloilo to the east, whilst facing the Sulu Sea to the west.
Antique was one of the three sakup (districts) of Panay before Spanish colonizers arrived on the islands. The province was known at that time as Hantík, the local name for the large red ants found on the island.[tpl]cite web|title=Provincial Government of Antique|url=http://www.geocities.com/antiquegov/|work=Provincial Government of Antique|publisher=League of Provinces of the Philippines|accessdate=3 May 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5knB8jFH8|archivedate=25 October 2009|location=WebCite[/tpl] The Spanish chroniclers, however, were influenced by the French when they recorded the region's name as Hantique, which was later reduced into its formal name "Antique".

==History==

Historians believe that the earliest people who settled on the island of Panay were tribal Negritos or Atis. Oral history, relayed as the "Legend of Maragtas", states that in 1212, ten "datus" from Malay escaped persecution from Sri-Vishaya, a Hindu-Malay empire in Borneo and Sumatra. The ten datus, led by Datu Puti, sailed northward with their families and communities, landing on Panay after departing Borneo.http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html
Upon arrival, the Malay datus met the Ati chieftain King Marikudo and his wife Maniwantiwan. They offered the chieftain a golden salakot (wide-brimmed headgear)[tpl]cite web|title=salakot|url=http://everything2.com/title/salakot|work=Everything2|publisher=Everything2 Media, LLC.|accessdate=3 May 2012|author=Langdon|date=17 August 2001[/tpl] and golden necklace, among other gifts, as a display of respect. King Marikudo responded to the datus' generosity by moving to the mountains with his Ati tribe, allowing the Malayans to settle in the lowlands. The legacy of this landing is commemorated annually in Antique during the Binirayan festival.[tpl]cite news|title=THE MANY FACETS OF ANTIQUE|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/ht/ht003434.htm|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Philippine Headline News Online|date=28 May 2003|author=Jocelyn Montemayor[/tpl]
The island of Panay was then divided into three sakups: Hantik, Aklan and Irong-Irong. Aklan became the present-day Aklan and Capiz, Irong-Irong became Iloilo, and Hantik (also called Hamtik or Hamtic) became Antique. Hantik was named for the large red[tpl]contradiction-inline|reason= source describes them as "black ants"|date=August 2013[/tpl] ants found on the island called "hantik-hantik".http://eventphilippines.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/calendar-of-festivals-and-events.pdf
The sakup of Hantik was given to Datu Sumakwel, one of the ten datus, and who, according to tradition, was the oldest and wisest of them. The three sakups were later governed as a political unit called the Confederation of Madyaas, also under Datu Sumakwel. Datu Sumakwel founded the town of Malandog, considered to be the first Malay settlement in the country. Malandog is now a barangay in the present-day municipality of Hamtic, which was named after the historic sakup.
During the Spanish colonial period, the coastal province was vulnerable to attacks by Moro raiders. Under the direction of the Spanish friars, a series of watchtowers, like the 'Old Watchtower' in Libertad and Estaca Hill in Bugasong, were built to guard Antique.
In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army landed in Antique and occupied the province during the Second World War.
During the Japanese Insurgencies and Occupation (1942-1944), the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from 1942 to 1946 and the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-activated between 1944 and 1946. Additionally, during the implementation of the anti-imperial Japanese military operations on Panay Island between 1942 and 1945 in the Antique province, Filipino military forces aided the local guerrilla resistance against the Imperial Japanese Army.
Between 1944 and 1945, Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 6th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army defeated the Japanese troops and liberated the province. The liberation was achieved with the active support of recognized local guerrillas.

==Geography==

The province of Antique is one of the six provinces comprising Western Visayas or Region VI and one of the four provinces in the island of Panay.
The Province of Antique is an elongated stretch of land occupying the entire western side of the island.  It is bounded by the rugged central mountains of Panay, bordering on the provinces of Aklan in the northeast, Capiz on the east, Iloilo in the southeast and the Sulu Sea on the west.  Its western-most and northernmost point is Semirara Island at [tpl]coord|12|07|10|N|121|21|10|E|display=inline|region:PH_type:landmark[/tpl], while its easternmost point is approximately [tpl]coord|11|01|N|122|19.5|E|display=inline|region:PH_type:landmark[/tpl]. Anini-y is the province's most southerly point at [tpl]coord|10|24|24|N|121|57|38|E|display=inline|region:PH_type:landmark[/tpl]. Resembling a seahorse in shape, it is [tpl]convert|155|km[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|35|km[/tpl] at its widest point.
Antique has rugged and varied land. Nogas Island, Hurao-Hurao Island and Mararison Island have long stretches of white sand beaches that are ideal for shell-hunting. Batbatan Island on the other hand, appeals to scuba divers because of the well-preserved coral reefs. Mount Madia-as (or Madjaas), on the border with Aklan, is the highest peak on Panay. This [tpl]convert|2113|m[/tpl] high mountain[tpl]cite web|title=Mt. Madjaas (2,113+)|url=http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2009/03/mt-madjaas-2090.html|publisher=Pinoy Mountaineer|accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl] is a dormant volcano with lakes and 14 waterfalls. It is said to be the legendary home of Bulalakaw, the supreme god of the ancients, and beckons as a challenge for hikers and trekkers.
The municipality of San Jose de Buenavista serves as the provincial capital, the center of commerce and trade, and the seat of the provincial government and national government agencies.

===Subdivisions===

Antique is subdivided into 18 municipalities.

==Demographics==

Antiqueños are seafaring people that share many characteristics with their Panay neighbors. However, the steep slopes and the rugged, long mountain ranges of Antique have isolated it from the rest of Panay. Hence, they have developed their own distinct language called Kinaray-a. This dialect is of Austronesian origin characterized by the predominance of r's and schwa sounds spoken with a lilting gentle intonation.
The Antiqueños are noted for their industry. They are renowned weavers throughout the Visayas. The Bugasong patadyong, a tube cotton fabric of plaid design, is highly valued because of its fineness of weaving. Piña cloth is also produced in looms throughout the province. Wine manufactured from the sap of the coconut is a cottage industry.

===Religion===

The people of Antique are predominantly Christians, predominantly Roman Catholic. Even today, the Catholic Church remains influential in both the society and politics of the province. Other religious denominations present in the province include Protestants and Nontrinitarian, Iglesia Filipina Independiente more commonly known as Aglipayan Church, Baptist Churches, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Church of Latter Day Saints, among others.
In the mountains, remnants of ancient folk beliefs persist. Babaylans or native priestesses continue to divine the future, heal the sick or conjure spells.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===

For the year 1998, production of palay, the primary crop of the province, registered a total of 177,521 metric tons (mt.) or 4,438,025 cavans from 58,847 hectares with an average yield of 3.02 metric tons per hectare. An increase of 8,280 mt. or 16.37 percent over last years (1997) production was observed because the area harvested has increased by 9,822 hectares or 5.86 percent. However, the average yield per hectare decreased by 0.3 mt. per hectare or 0.09 percent. The average yield per hectare for irrigated lands is 3.39 mt., 2.63 mt. for rain-fed farms, and 1.57 for upland areas. The province regularly harvests enough to feed its population. This year,[tpl]when|date=January 2013[/tpl] there is a surplus of 83,756 mt. or 2,093,900 cavans of palay.
Copra, the second major agricultural commodity, registered a total production of 15,712 mt. in 1998 reflecting a decrease of 965 mt. (5.78%) as against last years (1997) yield of 16,677 mt. The main bulk of copra came from the municipality of Caluya where this area accounts for 44 percent of the total copra output of the province. The area planted with coconuts constitutes about 34 percent of the total area of the province. Caluya, together with Pandan, account for more than half (53%) of the total provincial figure in terms of area planted, number of bearing trees, nuts production and copra yield.
For current year, data on production of other field crops are the following: corn, 650 metric tons; legumes (moonbeams, peanuts and other beans), 1,689 metric tons; muscovado sugar, 2,280 metric tons; root crops (camote, cassava, ube, etc.), 3,434 metric tons; vegetables (leafy, fruit and root), 870 metric tons; banana, 11,102 metric tons; and mango, 1,330 metric tons.

The aquaculture sector yields the highest production during the inclusion of seaweeds in this sector.
Fishing is the major source of livelihood for households in the 15 coastal municipalities. The rich fishing grounds of the Cuyo East Pass, Sulu Sea, and the municipal waters along the approximately 296.8 km coastline, make fishing a promising venture. The fishing season is year round and peaks during December to June. A total of 17,437 households are directly dependent on fishing, and 39,055 households are indirectly dependent on it.

==Binirayan festival==

Started in San Jose in 1974 by the late Gov. Evelio Javier, this is a week-long festival that includes colorful street parades, beach shows, plaza concerts, a beauty contest and trade fair. "Binirayan" biray, or "sailboat" in Kinaray-a (Antique's local language), refers to the difficult journey of the 10 datus to reach Malandog beach, where they befriended the Atis (Aetas) and eventually started a civilization in pre-Hispanic times. As above-stated, Antique tradition holds that it was founded by Bornean Malays in the 12th century. According to legend, 10 Bornean datus (chieftains) claimed Panay island and their leader, Datu Sumakwel, founded the settlement in Malandog, Hamtik, Antique.Inquirer.net,  Antique celebrates pride of place and history
