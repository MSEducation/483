==Biography==

As a young boy growing up in San Francisco, Joel Engle never knew his father. Tragedy struck when, at the age of 11, Joel found his mother lying on the kitchen floor after suffering a stroke. She died soon after, leaving Joel in the care of his elderly grandparents. Just three years later there was even more upheaval when Joel's grandfather died and his grandmother went to live in a retirement home.  
At the age of 14, Joel was placed in the Baptist Children's Home in Moore, Oklahoma.
Engle was adopted by Dale and Nadine Engle of Garber, Oklahoma at age 16. 
Joel went on to study music and theology on scholarship at Oklahoma Baptist University. While there, he met and eventually married his wife Valerie. 
After college, he toured with Dawson McAllister student conferences for three years, playing in front of crowds upward of 500,000 per year. 
In 1997, Joel and wife Valerie, started Spin360, a modern worship resource that provided worship leaders with songs, chord charts, sheet music, and other tools.  This ministry served over 12,000 churches worldwide. 
Joel's piano and vocal talents were also simultaneously being put to good use with many camp dates, conferences, and outreach opportunities with the Billy Graham Association, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Student Life. 
Joel has been the opening act for GMA Dove Award winners Casting Crowns, TobyMac, Rebecca St. James, Third Day, MercyMe, and others.
