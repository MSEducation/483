It is a highly episodic series of adventures as Syn, in his guise as the Scarecrow outwits the king's agents and keeps his band of Dymchurch smugglers out of prison. The novel inspired the William Buchanan novel Christopher Syn, upon which the Disney film The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh is based, hence the similarities between the plots.[tpl]fact|date=September 2012[/tpl]
