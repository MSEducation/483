[[Screamo]]

CATEGORIES: Hardcore punk, Emo, Post-hardcore, Fusion music genres

Screamo is a post-hardcore-influenced subgenre of emo that evolved in the early 1990s. This initially involved a more aggressive offshoot of emo music and used short songs that grafted "intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics."Jason Heller, "Feast of Reason".

==Characteristics==

Screamo essentially describes a particularly dissonant style of emo influenced by hardcore punk. Screamo uses typical rock instrumentation, but is notable for its brief compositions, chaotic execution, and screaming vocals. The genre is "generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene."Explore style: Screamo at Allmusic Music Guide Primary characteristics of the genre are described by Allmusic:

In addition to melodic transitions from heavy to soft styles, the genre is also characterized "by frequent shifts in tempo and dynamics and by tension-and-release catharses." Screamed vocals are used "not consistently, but as a kind of crescendo element, a sonic weapon to be trotted out when the music and lyrics reach a particular emotional pitch." Some consider the genre to be a bridge between hardcore punk and emo.[tpl]cite web|last=Henderson |first=Alex |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r793934 |title=Let It Enfold You - Senses Fail |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl]

===Conceptual elements===

Screamo lyrics often feature topics such as emotional pain, romantic interest, feminism, politics, and human rights. The New York Times noted that "part of the music's appeal is its un-self-conscious acceptance of differences, respect for otherness." Some screamo bands openly demonstrate acceptance of religious, nonreligious, and straight edge lifestyles
Many screamo bands in the 1990s saw themselves as implicitly political, and as a reaction against the turn to the right embodied by California politicians, such as Roger Hedgecock. Some groups were also unusually theoretical in inspiration: Angel Hair cited surrealist writers Antonin Artaud and Georges Bataille, and Orchid lyrically name-checked French new wave icon Anna Karina, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, French philosopher Michel Foucault, and critical theory originators the Frankfurt School.Orchid, Dance Tonight, Revolution Tomorrow.
