The Colonizer and the Colonized ([tpl]lang-fr|Portrait du colonisé, précédé par Portrait du colonisateur[/tpl]) is a well-known nonfiction book of Albert Memmi, published in French in 1957 and in English at first in 1965.
This work explores and describes the psychological effects of colonialism on colonized and colonizers alike. Dissecting the minds of both the oppressor and the oppressed, Memmi reveals truths about the colonial situation and struggle that are as relevant today as they were five decades ago.
When it was published in 1957, many national liberation movements were active. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote the preface. The work is often read in conjunction with Frantz Fanon's Les damnés de la Terre (The Wretched of the Earth) and Peau noire, masques blancs (Black Skin, White Masks) and Aimé Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism.
Several decades later, Memmi published a follow-up book called Decolonization and the Decolonized.
