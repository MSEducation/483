==History==

It was founded in 1881 as a mouthpiece of the local Republican Party in an era when many American newspapers served political parties.  Gary Farrugia has served as Publisher since 2001.
The paper endorsed Democratic Party candidate Senator Barack Obama for President of the United States in the 2008 election cycle.
Ever since the death of its founder, Theodore Bodenwein, The Day has been held in public trust, and is still independent.
The Day Trust devotes its attention to operating the newspaper and supporting a charitable foundation, the Bodenwein Public Benevolent Foundation. This arrangement ensures that the newspaper will remain independent and locally-owned and that profits from the newspaper will be distributed to non-profit organizations within The Day's primary circulation area.
In October 2010, The New England Newspaper & Press Association recognized The Day as its Newspaper of the Year for its weekday edition and Newspaper of the Year for its Sunday edition in the 25,000 to 40,000 circulation category.
The Day also received NENPA's Publick Occurrences award in recognition "of outstanding journalism in 2010 for flood coverage" that included its print, photographic and Web component in theday.com. The recognition came for coverage of the flooding in late March and early April that devastated many communities in southeastern Connecticut and southern Rhode Island.
In December 2009, theday.com was recognized as New England's Website of the Year. That same year, reporter Lee Howard won the Theodore Driscoll Investigative Reporting Award for a series of stories about H1-B visa abuses. http://www.theday.com/article/20090523/NWS/305239937/0/SEARCH
