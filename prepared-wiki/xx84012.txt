The  Black-crested Bulbul, (Pycnonotus flaviventris), is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is found from the Indian Subcontinent to southeast Asia.
The Black-crested Bulbul is generally about 19Â cm in length. As the name suggests, the head of this bulbul is black while the rest of its body is different shades of yellow. Both the male and female are similar in plumage. One can make out a younger bird by its slightly duller coloring.
This is a bird of forest and dense scrub. It builds its nest in a bush; two to four eggs is a typical clutch. The Black-crested Bulbul feeds on fruit and insects.
