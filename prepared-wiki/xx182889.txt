Shedd's Country Crock is a food brand owned by Unilever. It originally sold spreads, such as margarine, but later extended to side dishes, particularly mashed potatoes and pasta, made by Hormel under licence.
The brand was originally owned by Beatrice Foods before they sold the Shedd's business to Unilever in 1984 following Beatrice's merger with Esmark.
