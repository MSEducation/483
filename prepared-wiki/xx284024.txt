The school opened on 20 January 1969 with Mr.P.C.C.Nair as headmaster, he had over a thousand children to teach with very few teachers trained to teach at secondary level. In fact twenty of the teachers had no teaching experience and only enthusiasm, but they were required when just one year consisted of seventeen classes.[tpl]cite web|title=Mr. P.C.C Nair - First Principal of Meadowlands Secondary|url=http://msot.co.za/past-messages.html|publisher=Meadowlands Secondary|accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl]
