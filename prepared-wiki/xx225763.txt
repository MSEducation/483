Nilantha Tillakaratne (born March 16, 1977) was a Sri Lankan cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He was born in Colombo.
Tillakaratne began his career with Kalutara Town Club, making twelve appearances for the team during the 1996-97 Saravanamuttu Trophy campaign, Kalutara's only season in first-class cricket. Featuring in the upper-middle order, Tillakaratne played twelve of the team's thirteen matches in the competition, none of which ended in victory.
Tillakaratne's first-class best score, an innings of 78 against Panadura, was one of the four half-centuries that Tillakaratne made during his career.
After two seasons out of the first-class game, Tillakaratne returned to play for Antonians in the 1999-2000 season, for whom he played four matches in the Premier Championship campaign, though once again he struggled to bat from the opening order.
