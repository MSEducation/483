After the end of World War II, he re-established his law practice in Vienna.  Prominent clients included, among others, Otto von Habsburg, the eldest son of Karl of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria and last King of Hungary.  Draxler had an instrumental role in the "Causa Habsburg" which led to the return of Otto von Habsburg to Austria as private citizen in 1966 after 48 years in exile.  Corporate clients included Universal Pictures.
