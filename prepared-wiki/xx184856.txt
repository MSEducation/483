Sansker: first seen in Spawn:Blood Feud comic books, Sansker is the alien form of a vampire who has stalked innocent victims throughout history.  In this era, Sansker posed as a specialist in paranormal crimes thus being able to commit the crimes himself, tamper with the evidence,and switch the blame to an unsuspecting citizen.  In this case, his target was Spawn.  Sansker takes on the form of a giant snake monster when threatened and his flexible tail can wrap around anyone who stands in his way.
