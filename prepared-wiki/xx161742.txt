[[Cedar rocket]]

CATEGORIES: Military equipment of Lebanon

The Cedar rockets ([tpl]lang-ar|صواريخ أرز[/tpl]) are a series of missiles developed by Haigazian College and the Lebanese army during the 1960s. There were three types: Arz 1, Arz 2, and Arz 3.

==Single-stage Rockets==

In November 1960, Professor Manoug Manougian and a group of students formed Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS). They started research into single and multistage solid fuel rockets with a budget of 750 LBP donated by MP Emile Bustani. Due to lack of proper equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories.
In April 1961, after several failures, a single stage rocket was launched to an altitude of about one kilometer. Improvements on the solid fuel system increased the altitude to two kilometers.

==Multi-stage Rockets==

As a result of these experiments, the Lebanese President Fuad Chehab granted financial assistance  of ten and fifteen thousand LBP to HCRS for 1961 and 1962 respectively.
During the academic year 1961-1962, HCRS worked on two-stage rockets, and improved the design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 (Arz 1) was launched to a height of 11500 m, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for security. That summer, two more rockets were launched to a height of 20 km. 
Due to the successes of the HCRS, new members joined, and the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS) was formed in 1962.
