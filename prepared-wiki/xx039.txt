==CPU configuration==

Initial prototypes were equipped with two AT&T Hobbit processors and three AT&T 9308S DSPs.
Production models used two PowerPC 603 processors running at 66 or 133 MHz to power the BeBox. Prototypes having dual 200 MHz CPUs or four CPUs exist, but these were never publicly available.http://www.bebox.nu/news.php?lookat=65 Interview with Joseph Palmer
