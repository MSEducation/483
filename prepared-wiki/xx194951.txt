Location estimation in wireless sensor networks is the problem of estimating the location of an object from a set of noisy measurements, when the measurements are acquired in a distributed
manner by a set of sensors.

==Motivation==

Many civilian and military applications require monitoring that can identify objects in a specific area, such as monitoring the front entrance of a private house by a single camera. Monitored areas that are large relative to objects of interest often require multiple sensors (e.g., infra-red detectors) at multiple locations. A centralized observer or computer application monitors the sensors. The communication to Power and bandwidth requirements call for efficient design of the sensor, transmission, and processing.
The CodeBlue systemhttp://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/codeblue/ of Harvard university is an example where a
vast number of sensors distributed among hospital facilities
allow staff to locate a patient in distress. In addition, the sensor
array enables online recording of medical information while
allowing the patient to move around. Military applications (e.g.
locating an intruder into a secured area) are also good candidates
for setting a wireless sensor network.

==Setting==

designed to minimize estimation error.
For example: minimizing the mean squared error (MSE),
alternative designs when the sensors are bandwidth constrained to
