Forcalquier Cathedral (Concathédrale Notre-Dame-du-Bourguet de Forcalquier) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in the town of Forcalquier, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.
Erected in the 12th century, the cathedral of Forcalquier was a second seat of the Bishop of Sisteron, and for that reason is referred to as a co-cathedral. The nave, the choir, the transept and the cloister date from the early 13th century, representing one of the first examples of Gothic style in southern France. The bell tower is from the 16th century. The church houses a panel of the Triumph of Christ by Pierre Mignard.
