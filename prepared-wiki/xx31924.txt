CATEGORIES: Ancient Cypriots, Metamorphoses in Greek mythology, Women in Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Anaxarete was a Cypriot maiden who refused the advances of a shepherd named Iphis. His advances were described by Ovid in the following paragraph:
Anaxarete spurned him and mocked his feelings until he cried in despair and hanged himself on her doorstep. Anaxarete was still unmoved. When she mocked his funeral, calling it pitiful, Aphrodite turned her into a stone statue.
