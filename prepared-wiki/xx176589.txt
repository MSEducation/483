==Developer Support==

Microsoft has ActiveX Document support in its developer tools to help programmers in creating ActiveX Document applications.
In Visual C++, programmers can include Microsoft Foundation Classes's support for ActiveX Documents in the MFC project wizard. A programmer can choose to add ActiveX document server and/or container support to the new program by checking a checkbox during the project creation process.Compound Document Support, MFC Application Wizard, Visual Studio 2012 documentation, by Microsoft, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fa2f8zdk.aspx
