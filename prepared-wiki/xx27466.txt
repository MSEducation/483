OpenOffice.org (OOo), commonly known as OpenOffice, was an open-source office suite. It was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice, which Sun Microsystems acquired in 1999 for internal use. Sun open-sourced the software in July 2000 as a competitor to Microsoft Office, releasing version 1.0 on 1 May 2002. The project was closed by Oracle Corporation, the then-owner of Sun, in April 2011. Active successor projects include Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice and NeoOffice.
OpenOffice.org's default file format was the OpenDocument Format (ODF), an ISO/IEC standard, which originated with OpenOffice.org. It could also read a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office.
OpenOffice.org contained a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation application (Impress), a drawing application (Draw), a formula editor (Math), and a database management application (Base).[tpl]cite web |title=Why OpenOffice.org|url=http://why.openoffice.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120104082941/http://www.openoffice.org/why/|archivedate=4 January 2012|publisher=Sun Microsystems, Apache Software Foundation[/tpl]
OpenOffice.org was primarily developed for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Solaris, and later for OS X, with ports to other operating systems. It was distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPL); early versions were also available under the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL).

==History==

OpenOffice.org originated as StarOffice, a proprietary office suite developed by German company StarDivision from 1985 on. In August 1999, StarDivision was acquired by Sun Microsystems[tpl]Cite news |last=Rooney |first=Paula |title=Apache OpenOffice 3.4 makes official debut; LibreOffice makes its case |publisher=ZDnet |date=8 May 2012 |url= http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/apache-openoffice-34-makes-official-debut-libreoffice-makes-its-case/10915 |accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] for US$59.5 million,[tpl]cite web|title=Star-Division-Gründer Marco Börries verlässt Sun Microsystems|url=http://business.chip.de/news/Star-Division-Gruender-Marco-Boerries-verlaesst-Sun-Microsystems_41399961.html|work=Chip Online DE|date=18 January 2001|accessdate=21 June 2013|language=German|trans_title=StarDivision founder Marco Börries leaves Sun Microsystems[/tpl] as it was supposedly cheaper than licensing Microsoft Office for 42,000 staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/OpenOffice-at-the-crossroads-1023702.html?page=2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131208042359/http://www.h-online.com/open/features/OpenOffice-at-the-crossroads-1023702.html?page=2|archivedate=8 December 2013|work=The H Open|publisher=Heinz Heise|title=OpenOffice at the crossroads: Every bug is a feature|page=2|first=Richard|last=Hillesley|date=21 June 2010|accessdate=20 June 2013|quote=Simon Phipps, now an ex-Sun employee, later claimed that 'The number one reason why Sun bought StarDivision in 1999 was because, at the time, Sun had something approaching forty-two thousand employees. Pretty much every one of them had to have both a Unix workstation and a Windows laptop. And it was cheaper to go buy a company that could make a Solaris and Linux desktop productivity suite than it was to buy forty-two thousand licenses from Microsoft.'[/tpl]
On 19 July 2000 at OSCON, Sun Microsystems announced that it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software and of providing a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/press/sun_release.html |title=SUN MICROSYSTEMS OPEN SOURCES STAROFFICE TECHNOLOGY |publisher=Sun Microsystems |date=19 July 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/OpenOffice-splits-and-pirouettes-1270296.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131208000704/http://www.h-online.com/open/features/OpenOffice-splits-and-pirouettes-1270296.html|archivedate=8 December 2013|accessdate=9 May 2012|date=6 July 2011|title=OpenOffice – splits and pirouettes|first=Richard|last=Hillesley|publisher=Heinz Heise|work=The H Online[/tpl] The new project was known as OpenOffice.org,[tpl]cite web |url=http://sun.systemnews.com/articles/29/1/news/2477 |title=Sun Will Release StarOffice Source Code |publisher=System News|work=Sun.systemnews.com|volume=Volume 29 |issue=1 |accessdate=14 January 2012[/tpl] and the code was released as open source on 13 October 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www4.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2640108,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20001211201100/http://www4.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2640108,00.html|title=Sun puts StarOffice into open source|archivedate=11 December 2000|date=13 October 2000|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|work=ZDNet News|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=15 October 2013[/tpl] The first public preview release was Milestone Build 638c, released in October 2001 (which quickly achieved 1 million downloads[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_Of_OpenOffice.org&oldid=186681|title=A Brief History Of OpenOffice.org|date=13 October 2010|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Oracle Corporation[/tpl]); the final release of OpenOffice.org 1.0 was on 1 May 2002.

===Naming===

The project and software were informally referred to as OpenOffice since the Sun release, but since this term is a trademark held by Open Office Automatisering in Benelux since 1999,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/orange-launches-open-office-3039289058/|title=Orange launches 'Open Office'|first=David|last=Meyer|work=ZDNet Networking|publisher=ZDNet|date=4 September 2007|accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://openoffice.nl/merkenregistratie|title=over het merk "Open Office"|language=Dutch|trans_title=about the brand "Open Office"|publisher=Openoffice.nl|accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl] OpenOffice.org was its formal name.
Due to a similar trademark issue (a Rio de Janeiro company that owned that trademark in Brazil), the Brazilian Portuguese version of the suite was distributed under the name BrOffice.org from 2004, with BrOffice.Org being the name of the associated local nonprofit from 2006.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.broffice.org/sobre|title = Sobre o BrOffice.org |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101120111119/http://broffice.org/sobre|archivedate=20 November 2010|date=7 July 2006|language=Portuguese|accessdate=16 October 2013[/tpl] (BrOffice.org moved to LibreOffice in December 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=LibreOffice Development Extends To Brazil|url=http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2010/12/06/libreoffice-development-extends-to-brazil/ |publisher=The Document Foundation|date=6 December 2010|first=Florian|last=Effenberger|accessdate=24 January 2011[/tpl])

The suite contained no personal information manager, email client or calendar application analogous to Microsoft Outlook, despite one having been present in StarOffice 5.2. Such functionality was frequently requested.

===Fonts===

OpenOffice.org included OpenSymbol, DejaVu,[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=External/Modules&oldid=91799#Fonts |title=External/Modules |work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Sun Microsystems|date=4 September 2008|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] the Liberation fonts (from 2.4) and the Gentium fonts (from 3.2).[tpl]cite web |url=http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=89682 |title=OpenOffice.org — Issue 89682 — Include the Gentium open fonts |publisher=OpenOffice.org |accessdate=3 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=77705 |title=OpenOffice.org — Issue 77705 – Liberation font and OOo |publisher=OpenOffice.org|accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=104723 |title=OpenOffice.org — Issue 104723 – Update Liberation fonts to v1.05.1.20090721 |publisher=OpenOffice.org|accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl] Versions up to 2.3 included the Bitstream Vera fonts. OpenOffice.org also used the default fonts of the running operating system.
Fontwork is a feature that allows users to create stylized text with special effects differing from ordinary text with the added features of gradient colour fills, shaping, letter height, and character spacing. It is similar to WordArt used by Microsoft Word.  When OpenOffice.org saved documents in Microsoft Office file format, all Fontwork was converted into WordArt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Impress_Guide/Using_Fontwork&oldid=78557|date=23 May 2008|title=Using Fontwork|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Getting_Started/Using_Fontwork|title=Using Fontwork|date=9 November 2007|accessdate=22 September 2013|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Sun Microsystems[/tpl]

===Extensions===

From version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org supported third-party extensions.[tpl]cite mailing list |last=Bergmann |first=Stephan |title=.oxt, .uno.pkg, .zip |mailinglist=dev@extensions.openoffice.org |date=7 July 2006 |url=http://markmail.org/thread/mqs2zu2razceqnr3|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl] As of April 2011, the OpenOffice Extension Repository listed more than 650 extensions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110424015927/http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project|title=OpenOffice.org Extensions|publisher=Oracle Corporation|archivedate=24 April 2011[/tpl] Another list was maintained by the Free Software Foundation.[tpl]cite web|title=Open Office und FSF streiten um Extensions|language=German|trans_title= OpenOffice and FSF argue about extensions|publisher=Linux Magazin|url=http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Open-Office-und-FSF-streiten-um-Extensions |accessdate=16 May 2012|date=10 May 2010|first=Ulrich |last=Bantle[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List|title=Group:OpenOfficeExtensions/List|publisher=LibrePlanet|accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl]

===OpenOffice Basic===

OpenOffice.org included OpenOffice Basic, a programming language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). OpenOffice Basic was available in Writer, Calc and Base.[tpl]cite web |last=Bain |first=Mark Alexander |work=NewsForge |title=An introduction to OpenOffice.org Basic |url= http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/09/20/1840248.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060323022629/http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/09/20/1840248.shtml|archivedate=23 March 2006|accessdate=3 March 2007[/tpl] OpenOffice.org also had some Microsoft VBA macro support.

===Connectivity===

OpenOffice.org could interact with databases (local or remote) using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) or SDBC (StarOffice Database Connectivity).

==File formats==

From Version 2.0 onward, OpenOffice.org used ISO/IEC 26300:2006 OpenDocument as its native format. Versions 2.0–2.3.0 default to the ODF 1.0 file format; versions 2.3.1–2.4.3 default to ODF 1.1; versions 3.0 onward default to ODF 1.2.
OpenOffice.org 1 used OpenOffice.org XML as its native format. This was contributed to OASIS and OpenDocument was developed from it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/xml/general.html |title=OpenOffice.org XML File Format |accessdate=22 September 2013|publisher=Sun Microsystems[/tpl]
OpenOffice.org also claimed support for the following formats:[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Getting_Started/File_formats&oldid=175577 |title=File formats OOo can open|date=17 July 2010|accessdate=20 June 2013|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Oracle Corporation[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Getting_Started/File_formats&oldid=74444 |title=Getting Started Guide for OpenOffice.org 2.x — File formats |date=23 April 2008|accessdate=20 June 2013|work=OpenOffice.org Wiki|publisher=Sun Microsystems[/tpl]

==Development==

OpenOffice.org converted all external formats to and from an internal XML representation.
The OpenOffice.org API was based on a component technology known as Universal Network Objects (UNO). It consisted of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA-like interface description language.

===Native desktop integration===

OpenOffice.org 1.0 was criticized for not having the look and feel of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.org used native widget toolkit, icons, and font-rendering libraries on GNOME, KDE and Windows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://projects.gnome.org/ooo/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090415144829/http://projects.gnome.org/ooo/|archivedate=15 April 2009|title=Gnome/OpenOffice.org(G/OO.o) |publisher=Gnome.org |date= |accessdate=22 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://kde.openoffice.org/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100713115136/http://kde.openoffice.org/|archivedate=13 July 2010|title=OpenOffice.org KDE Integration Project |publisher=OpenOffice.org |date= |accessdate=16 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.kde.org/node/3983 |title= Elite Kubuntu Developers Successful OpenOffice KDE 4 Integration |publisher=blogs.kde.org |accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]
The issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X. Early versions of OpenOffice.org required the installation of X11.app or XDarwin (though the NeoOffice port supplied a native interface). Versions since 3.0 ran natively using Apple's Aqua GUI.[tpl]cite web | title = OpenOffice.org Mac OS X Delivery Schedule |url= http://www.openoffice.org/porting/mac/timeline.html |publisher=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]

===Use of Java===

Although originally written in C++, OpenOffice.org became increasingly reliant on the Java Runtime Environment, even including a bundled JVM.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120105133104/http://www.openoffice.org/download/common/java.html|archivedate=5 January 2012|url=https://www.openoffice.org/download/common/java.html |title=Java & OpenOffice.org |publisher=Apache Software Foundation|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl] OpenOffice.org was criticized by the Free Software Foundation for its increasing dependency on Java, which was not free software.[tpl]cite news |last=Byfield |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Byfield |title=Free Software Foundation and OpenOffice.org team up to escape Java trap|publisher=Linux Foundation|work=linux.com|date=16 May 2005 |url=http://www.linux.com/feature/44959 |accessdate=9 September 2007[/tpl]
The issue came to the fore in May 2005, when Richard Stallman appeared to call for a fork of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website. OpenOffice.org adopted a development guideline that future versions of OpenOffice.org would run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.org 2.0 from using free-software Java implementations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/jdk@tools.openoffice.org/msg00005.html|title=Reoccuring  discussions arounds OOos Java usage (sic)|first=Kay|last=Ramme|work=tools-jdk mailing list|publisher=OpenOffice.org|date=11 May 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]
On 13 November 2006, Sun committed to releasing Java under the GNU General Public License[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp |title=Sun Opens Java |accessdate =25 November 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061116045838/http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp |publisher=Sun Microsystems|archivedate = 16 November 2006[/tpl] and had released a free software Java, OpenJDK, by May 2007.

===Security===

In 2006, the lab director of the French Ministry of Defense, Lt. Col. Eric Filiol, demonstrated security weaknesses, in particular within macros.[tpl]cite web |url= http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060718-7288.html |title=OpenOffice.org less secure than Microsoft Office? |work=Ars Technica|first=Eric|last=Bangeman|date=18 July 2006| accessdate =1 August 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://openoffice.2283327.n4.nabble.com/quot-Le-ministere-de-la-Defense-met-OpenOffice-a-l-index-quot-td2918635.html |title='Le ministère de la Défense met OpenOffice à l'index' |first=Louis|last=Suárez-Potts|date=21 July 2006|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl] In 2006, Kaspersky Lab demonstrated a proof of concept virus, "Stardust", for OpenOffice.org.[tpl]cite web | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-7349_3-6078475.html |first=Joris|last=Evans|title=Stardust virus lands on OpenOffice|publisher =CNet |date=31 May 2006|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl] This showed OpenOffice.org viruses are possible, but there is no known virus "in the wild".

====OpenOffice.org 2====

Work on version 2.0 began in early 2003 with the following goals (the "Q Product Concept"): better interoperability with Microsoft Office; improved speed and lower memory usage; greater scripting capabilities; better integration, particularly with GNOME; a more usable database; digital signatures; and improved usability.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.openoffice.org/tools/releases/q-concept.html|title= StarOffice / OpenOffice.org "Q" Product Concept|first=Lutz|last=Hoeger|publisher=Sun Microsystems|date=August 2003|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl] It would also be the first version to default to OpenDocument.

On 2 September 2005, Sun announced that it was retiring the SISSL to reduce license proliferation,[tpl]cite web |url= https://blogs.oracle.com/webmink/entry/addressing_proliferation_deeds_not_just |first=Simon|last=Phipps|work=Simon Phipps, SunMink|publisher=Sun Microsystems|title= Addressing Proliferation: Deeds not just Words |accessdate=26 December 2012[/tpl] though some press analysts felt it was so that IBM could not reuse OpenOffice.org code without contributing back. Versions after 2.0 beta 2 would use only the LGPL.
On 20 October 2005, OpenOffice.org 2.0 was released. 2.0.1 was released eight weeks later, fixing minor bugs and introducing new features. As of the 2.0.3 release, OpenOffice.org changed its release cycle from 18 months to releasing updates every three months.

====OpenOffice.org 3====

On 13 October 2008, version 3.0 was released, featuring the ability to import (though not export) Office Open XML documents, support for ODF 1.2, improved VBA macros, and a native interface port for OS X. It also introduced the new Start Center.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0 |title=OpenOffice.org 3.0 Features|publisher=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]
Version 3.2 included support for PostScript-based OpenType fonts. It warned users when ODF 1.2 Extended features had been used. An improvement to the document integrity check determined if an ODF document conformed to the ODF specification and offered a repair if necessary.

Before the final version of OpenOffice.org 3.4 could be released, Oracle cancelled its sponsorship of development and fired the remaining StarDivision development team.

==Market share==

Problems arise in estimating the market share of OpenOffice.org because it could be freely distributed via download sites (including mirror sites), peer-to-peer networks, CDs, Linux distributions and so forth. The project tried to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis,[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.openoffice.org/w/index.php?title=Market_Share_Analysis&oldid=170058 |title=OpenOffice.org Market Share Analysis |publisher=Oracle Corporation |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] listing known distribution totals, known deployments and conversions and analyst statements and surveys.

It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20031018013700/ooo.ximian.com/ooo-build.html |title=About ooo-build |publisher=Ximian |date=18 October 2003 |accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] Most Linux distributions used,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tuxdeluxe.org/node/184|title=Meek not geek - Interview with Michael Meeks of OpenOffice.org|work=Tux Deluxe|first=Daniel|last=James|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=1 October 2013[/tpl] and worked together on,[tpl]cite conference |url=http://www.linuxsymposium.org/archives/OLS/Reprints-2004/Reprint-Meeks-OLS2004.pdf |title=The World of OpenOffice |first=Michael |last=Meeks |author= |authorlink= |date=21–24 July 2004 |month= |year= |conference=Linux Symposium 2004 |conferenceurl=http://www.linuxsymposium.org/archives/OLS/Reprints-2004/ |editor=John W.

Sun's contributions to OpenOffice.org had been declining for a number of years[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/ooo-commit-stats-2008.html |first=Michael|last=Meeks|work=Stuff Michael Meeks is doing |title=Measuring the true success of OpenOffice.org|publisher=People.gnome.org |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] and some developers were unwilling to assign copyright in their work to Sun, particularly given the deal between Sun and IBM to licence the code outside the LGPL. On 2 October 2007, Novell announced that ooo-build would be available as a software package called Go-oo, not merely a patch set.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2007-10-02.html |title=2007-10-02: Tuesday|work=Stuff Michael Meeks is doing|publisher=People.gnome.org |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2009[/tpl] (The go-oo.org domain name had been in use by ooo-build as early as 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/121441/|title=ooo-build 1.3.8 Announced|first=Michael|last=Meeks|work=LWN.net|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=1 October 2013[/tpl]) Sun reacted negatively, with Simon Phipps of Sun terming it "a hostile and competitive fork".[tpl]cite web|url=http://techrights.org/2008/10/12/microsoft-novell-hijack-openoffice/#comment-27387 |title=Microsoft/Novell Fork OpenOffice.org and Insult Sun, Warn Your Distributor Now |first=Roy|last=Schestowitz|work=TechRights |date=10 December 2008 |accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] However, the office suite branded "OpenOffice.org" in most Linux distributions, having previously been ooo-build, soon in fact became Go-oo.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.go-oo.org/download/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100803034339/http://www.go-oo.org/download/ |archivedate=3 August 2010 |title=Download Go-OO!: Other derivatives|publisher=Go-oo.org |accessdate=16 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openoffice.org/+bug/151829/comments/5 |title=Bug #151829 in openoffice.org (Ubuntu): "Include go-oo in Ubuntu" |work=Launchpad.net|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|accessdate=28 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/154364 |title=Go-OO: The best office suite you never knew you used|first=Federico|last=Kereki |publisher=Linux.com |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl] Go-oo also encouraged outside contributions, with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Calling-a-cat-a-dog-746843.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131208000702/http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Calling-a-cat-a-dog-746843.html|archivedate=8 December 2013|title = Healthcheck: OpenOffice: Calling a cat a dog|page = 4|first = Richard|last = Hillesley|work = The H Open|date = 29 January 2009|accessdate = 26 June 2013[/tpl] When LibreOffice forked, Go-oo was deprecated in favour of that project.

IBM's changes were donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice and its code was merged into Apache OpenOffice 4.0.[tpl]cite web|first=Rob|last=Weir |url=https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/merging_lotus_symphony_allegro_moderato|title=Merging Lotus Symphony: Allegro moderato |publisher=Apache Software Foundation|date= 21 January 2013|accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]

====StarOffice====

Sun used OpenOffice.org as a base for its commercial proprietary StarOffice application software, which was OpenOffice.org with some added proprietary components. Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice as Oracle Open Office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newformat.se/documents/oracle/oracle-open-office-features-overview-060550.pdf|title=Oracle Open Office: Features Overview: An Oracle White Paper|date=January 2010|publisher=Oracle Corporation|accessdate=20 September 2013[/tpl] Oracle discontinued development in April 2011.
