==Early life==

Hurt was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of Phyllis (née Massey), an amateur actress and engineer, and Arnould Herbert Hurt, a mathematician who became an Anglican clergyman and served as vicar of Shirebrook.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/realmedia/2002/01/john_hurt.ram|title=BBC Radio Derby|accessdate=28 October 2010[/tpl] Hurt's father was also a vicar at St John's Church in Sunderland. In 1937, he moved his family to Derbyshire, where he became Perpetual Curate of Holy Trinity Church. When Hurt was five, his father became the vicar of St. Stephen's Church in Woodville, Derbyshire, and remained there until 1952.
In 1945, Hurt's father founded 1st Woodville (St. Stephen's) Scout Group, which is still going today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Hurt had a strict upbringing; the family lived opposite a cinema, but he was not allowed to see films there. He was also not permitted to mix with local children because his parents saw them as "too common".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/apr/27/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank|title=The Guardian Interview: John Hurt|work=Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=28 October 2010|date=1 July 2000[/tpl]
At the age of eight, Hurt was sent to the Anglican St Michael's Preparatory School in Otford, Kent, where he eventually developed his passion for acting. He decided he wanted to become an actor, and his first role was that of a girl in a school production of The Bluebird (L'Oiseau Bleu) by Maurice Maeterlinck. While he was a pupil at the school, he was abused by Donald Cormack (now deceased), then Senior Master of the school and later Head Teacher (until his retirement in 1981).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stmichaels.kent.sch.uk/school-visitors/12/history-of-the-school|title=History of St Michael's School, accessed 21 March 2010.

Hurt said that the experience affected him hugely.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-hurt-i-was-abused-too-511182.html|author=Sholto Byrnes |title=John Hurt: I was abused, too|work=Independent on Sunday |date=16 October 2005 |location=UK|accessdate=28 October 2010[/tpl]
Hurt's father moved to Old Clee Church in Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire. Hurt (then aged 12) became a boarder at Christ's Hospital School (then a grammar school) in Lincoln, because he had failed the entrance exam for admission to his brother's school. Hurt often accompanied his mother to Cleethorpes Repertory Theatre, but his parents disliked his acting ambitions and encouraged him to become an art teacher instead. His headmaster, Mr. Franklin, laughed when Hurt told him he wanted to be an actor, telling him that he "wouldn't stand a chance in the profession". Aged 17, Hurt enrolled in Grimsby Art School (now the East Coast School of Art & Design), where he studied art. In 1959, Hurt won a scholarship allowing him to study for an Art Teacher's Diploma (ATD) at Saint Martin's School of Art in London.Rob Sharp (19 April 2008). Central Saint Martins: The art and soul of Britain. The Independent. Retrieved July 2013. Despite the scholarship, paying for his studies was financially difficult, so he persuaded some of his friends to pose nude and sold the portraits. In 1960, he won a scholarship to RADA, where he trained for two years. He was then cast in small roles on television.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

In June 2009, Hurt played the on-screen Big Brother for Paper Zoo Theatre Company's production of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and will be touring during early 2010. Hurt said, "I think Paper Zoo thought it would be quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he's managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course I looked up Paper Zoo, and they seem to me to be the sort of company that’s essential in the country as we know it, and doing a lot of really good stuff."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/1984/interview.asp |title=John Hurt on 1984 |publisher=National Media Museum |accessdate=28 October 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

In 2007 Hurt took part in the BBC genealogical television series Who Do You Think You Are?, which investigated part of his family history. Prior to participating in the programme, Hurt had harboured a love of Ireland and was enamoured of a 'deeply beguiling' family legend that suggested his great-grandmother had been the illegitimate daughter of Irish nobleman the Marquess of Sligo. The genealogical evidence uncovered seemed to contradict the family legend, rendering the 'suggestion' doubtful. Coincidentally the search revealed that his great-grandmother had previously lived in Grimsby at a location within a mile of the art college at which Hurt had once enrolled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbcwhodoyouthinkyouare.com/stories.php?art=39448 |title=Who Do You Think You Are?
