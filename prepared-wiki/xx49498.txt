CATEGORIES: Plant morphology

A panicle is a much-branched inflorescence.[tpl]cite book |author=Hickey, M.; King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl] Some authors distinguish it from a compound spike, by requiring that the flowers (and fruit) are pedicellate. The branches of a panicle are often racemes. A panicle may have determinate or indeterminate growth.
This type of inflorescence is largely characteristic of grasses such as oat and crabgrass,Technically, the inflorescence unit in a grass is the spikelet, but the arrangement of spikelets may be described as a panicle. as well as other plants such as pistachio and mamoncillo. Botanists use the term paniculate in two ways: "having a true panicle inflorescence" as well as "having an inflorescence with the form but not necessarily the structure of a panicle".
A corymb is similar to a panicle with the same branching structure, but with the lower flowers having longer stems, thus giving a flattish top superficially resembling an umbel. Many species in the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs.
