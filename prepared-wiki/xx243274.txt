The Ligas Superiores are one of two leagues that form part of the Departamental Stage in the Copa Perú of the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF) football league system. The other league at level are the Ligas Departamentales.
A transcendental step is given in the Copa Perú with the official establishment of the Ligas Superiores, that already last year were disputed experimentally in some departments.
