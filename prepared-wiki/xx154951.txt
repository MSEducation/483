==About==

The Sherman is a Neo-Classical Revival style apartment building, and according to the City of Omaha, was one of the first three apartment buildings constructed in Omaha. Named for Sherman Avenue, the former name of Omaha's North Sixteenth Street, today the three-story building is the oldest apartment building in the city. It has been in continuous use as an apartment since its construction.(nd) The Sherman. City of Omaha Landmark Heritage Preservation Commission. Retrieved 5/29/07.
George H. Payne, developer of the Sherman, was one of the eleven board of directors of Omahaâ€™s 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition. The Sherman's classically-inspired design was undoubtedly influenced by the Expo, which was held in nearby Kountze Park.(2007) More Nebraska National Register Historic Places tour.
