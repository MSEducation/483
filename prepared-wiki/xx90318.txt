CATEGORIES: Māori Party, Māori political parties in New Zealand

The Māori Party, a political party in New Zealand, was formed on 7 July 2004. The Party is guided by eight constitutional "kaupapa", or Party objectives. Tariana Turia formed the Māori Party after resigning from the Labour Party where she had been a Cabinet Minister in the Fifth Labour-led Government. She and Pita Sharples, a high-profile academic, became co-Leaders. After the 2008 election, the Party supported the National-led government, and Turia and Sharples became ministers outside of cabinet.

==Formation==

The foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand's foreshore and seabed, became the catalyst for setting up the Māori Party.
The Māori Party believes:
A court judgement stated that some Māori appeared to have the right to seek formal ownership of a specific portion of seabed in the Marlborough Sounds. This prospect alarmed many sectors of New Zealand society, however, and the Labour Party foreshadowed legislation in favour of state ownership instead. This angered many Māori, including many of  Labour's Māori MPs. Two MPs representing Māori electorates,  Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta, announced an intent to vote against the legislation.
Turia, a junior minister, once informed that voting against the government would appear "incompatible" with holding ministerial rank, announced on April 30, 2004 her intention to resign from the Labour Party. Her resignation took effect on May 17, and she left parliament until she won a by-election in her Te Tai Hauauru seat two months later.
After leaving the Labour Party, Turia, subsequently joined by Sharples, began organizing a new political party. They and their supporters agreed that the new organization would simply use the name of "the Māori Party". They chose a logo of black and red — traditional Māori colours — incorporating a koru design, also traditional.
The leaders of the Māori Party have indicated that they wish to unite "all Māori" into a single political movement.

==2005 election==

In 2005 election, the party won four out of seven Māori seats and 2.12% of the party vote. This entitled the Māori Party to 3 list seats, so the fourth electorate seat became an overhang seat. Tariana Turia held Te Tai Hauauru; Pita Sharples won the Tamaki Makaurau electorate; Hone Harawira, son of Titewhai Harawira, won Te Tai Tokerau; and Te Ururoa Flavell won Waiariki.
In the post-election period the Māori Party convened a series of hui to decide whether to support Labour or National, though some party leaders have indicated they prefer to deal with Labour.  That day, however, Turia and Prime Minister Helen Clark met privately and ruled out a formal coalition.  Coupled with the support of the Greens and Progressives, Māori Party support would have given Clark just enough support to govern without the support of other parties. However, in the end, no deal was done and the Māori Party stayed in Opposition, citing that they were not prepared to compromise their positions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10350828|title=Maori Party stays in opposition|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=18 October 2005[/tpl]
Gerry Brownlee, Deputy Leader of the National Party claimed after the election that both Labour and National could rely on "57 seats" out of the 62 required in the 2005 election to govern. This implied that National had received support from United Future 3, Act 2 and the Māori Party 4 in addition to National's own 49 seats.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10350478|title=Coalition talks in chaos as Nats accuse Clark of failure|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=16 October 2005|first=Patrick|last=Crewdson[/tpl]  Brash himself later supported this statement and claimed he had witnesses to it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10351002|title=Brash: I had the 57 votes|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=19 October 2005|first=Audrey|last=Young[/tpl] This came after the National Party tried to woo the Māori Party in attempts to both see if a coalition arrangement was feasible and to counter any attempts which may have been made by Helen Clark.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/event/story.cfm?c_id=1500891&ObjectID=10349075|title=National courts the Maori Party|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=7 October 2005|author=Tony Gee, Audrey Young and Ruth Berry[/tpl] Tariana Turia denied this claim.

==Rātana pā==

On 24 January 2006 the Māori Party's four MPs were jointly welcomed to the Rātana pā with the Leader of the Opposition and leader of the National Party, Don Brash, together with his delegation of eight MPs. They were originally intended to be welcomed on half an hour apart but agreed to be welcomed and sit together. Turia disputed claims that this was pre-arranged, saying: "We're here for a birthday. We're not here for politics."Stuff [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2008[/tpl]
However critics said this would have reminded onlookers of how the Māori Party and National were said to be in coalition or confidence and supply talks. This may also have served to reinforce the Labour Party's election campaign statement that a 'vote for the Māori Party is a vote for National'. One Ratana kaumatua (elder) said this was deliberate and deserved after the talks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=280&ObjectID=10365240|title=Parties forced to share stage at Ratana marae|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=25 January 2006|first1=Jon|last1=Stokes[/tpl]

==2008 election==

In the 2008 general election the Māori Party retained all four of the seats it won in 2005, and also won an additional seat, after Rahui Katene won Te Tai Tonga from Labour.
The Māori Party's share of the party vote remained low, at 2.39%.Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Overall status. The Labour Party won the party vote by a large majority in every Māori electorate, meaning that the typical Māori voter had split their vote, voting for a Māori Party candidate with their electorate vote and the Labour Party with their party vote.See Māori electorate results at Chief Electoral Office: Official Count results: Electorate details.
The National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with the support of the Māori Party as well as ACT New Zealand and United Future. Sharples was given the Minister of Māori Affairs portfolio and also became an Associate Minister of Corrections and Associate Minister of Education. Turia became Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10543509 |title=Key's Government |date=17 November 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl]

==Leadership issues==

In December 2012, Tariana Turia announced she would resign as party co-leader before the 2014 election.  Te Ururoa Flavell announced  his interest in a leadership role. However, the Māori Party constitution requires male and female co-leaders, meaning Sharples would have to resign before Flavell could take on the role.Ratana unveiling for Turia's successor? DominionPost 13 January 2013 Shortly after this in July 2013, Sharples announced his resignation from the party, further saying that he will be quitting politics all together come the next general election in 2014. He went on to say that "Our supporters deserve a unified party" which indicated that the leadership tension influenced his decision to resign as party co-leader.http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/pita-sharples-stands-down-flavell-likely-successor-5483970
