"Wouldn't I Be Someone" is a song by The Bee Gees. It was released on July 1973.  Although the single failed to chart in United States, it was a No. 1 hit in Hong Kong and in Costa Rica, and reached No. 17 in Italy.  Originally released on Best of Bee Gees, Volume 2 with an extended version timed at 5:31, it was noted for its lush symphony orchestra arrangement and bluesy guitar solo by Alan Kendall.  The single was shortened to a running time of 3:30 with the B-side of "Elisa". Both songs had been from an album called A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants. However, producer Robert Stigwood and Polydor refused to release that, citing it to not be commercial enough for sales.  It was followed by the more R&B flavored, "Mr. Natural", produced by legendary Arif Mardin.
The album, A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants, was released as a bootleg in Malaysia on Polydor, but this single and two B-side was RSO/Polydor label.
