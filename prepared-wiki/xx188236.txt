The Hausstock is a mountain in the Glarus Alps, on the border between the cantons of Glarus and Graubünden. It overlooks the valleys of Linthal (Glarus) and Surselva (Graubünden). The Hausstock was the site of the 1799 withdrawal of the Russian army under General Alexander Suvorov. A well-known destination already in the nineteenth century with British and American climbers, the mountain remains popular with mountain climbers and skiers.

Like the rest of the nummulite formation of the high Glarus Alps, the Hausstock contains fine-grained black sandstone.[ref]
