K Blows Top: A Cold War Comic Interlude, Starring Nikita Khrushchev, America's Most Unlikely Tourist (2009, ISBN 978-1-58648-497-2) is a book by Peter Carlson published by PublicAffairs describing the 1959 visit of Nikita Khrushchev to the United States.
Khrushchev's visit took him to New York, New York, Los Angeles, California, San Francisco, California, Iowa, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., and included visits to 20th Century Fox, the Mark Hopkins Hotel, an Iowa farm, a Pittsburgh steel mill, and Camp David.

The title comes from a New York Times headline about Kruschev's reaction when he was refused admission to Disneyland.C-SPAN, Carlson interview, August 31, 2009
