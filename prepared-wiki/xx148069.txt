[[Wet laboratory]]

CATEGORIES: Laboratory techniques

Wet laboratories are laboratories where chemicals, drugs, or other material or biological matter are handled in liquid solutions or volatile phases, requiring direct ventilation, and specialized piped utilities (typically water and various gasses). Wet laboratory space types do not include biohazards in Levels BL-2, BL-3, and BL-4 as defined by the 1999 NIH/CDC guideline "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories."  The wet laboratory space types are typically located within a building specifically designed to house them.
In biology, chemistry, genetics or biochemistry, the terms wet lab or wet laboratory distinguish classical benchtop experiments handling biological material from in silico (computer analysis) or other theoretical work.
