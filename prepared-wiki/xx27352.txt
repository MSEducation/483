[[Parenthesis (rhetoric)]]

CATEGORIES: Rhetoric, Grammar, Punctuation

In rhetoric, a parenthesis (plural: parentheses; from the Greek word παρένθεσις, which comes in turn from words meaning "alongside of" and "to place") or parenthetical phrase is an explanatory or qualifying word, clause, or sentence inserted into a passage. The parenthesis could be left out and still form grammatically correct text.[tpl]cite book|author=John Walker|title=A Rhetorical Grammar: In which the Common Improprieties in Reading and Speaking are Detected ...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8TsJAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA99|year=1823|publisher=T.
