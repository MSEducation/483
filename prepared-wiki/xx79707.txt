Nyamuragira (Derived from the Kinyarwanda verb Kuragira inka, meaning to herd cows; Inka means cow or cows) is an active volcano in the Virunga Mountains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about 25 km north of Lake Kivu. 
It has been described as Africa's most active volcano[tpl]Citation |last1  = Smets | first1 = B. | last2  = Wauthier | first2 = C. | last3  = d’Oreye | first3 = N. | display-authors = 3 | title = A new map of the lava flow field of Nyamulagira (D.R.

Recent eruptions occurred on 2 January 2010 and 8 November 2011. 

==Geography and geology==

Nyamuragira volcano is an active volcano in the Virunga Mountains of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about 25 km north of Lake Kivu.  It is in the Province of Nord-Kivu. (It is 13 km north-north-west of Nyiragongo, the volcano which caused extensive damage to the city of Goma in its 2002 eruption.) 
Nyamuragira has a volume of 500 cubic km, and covers an area of 1,500 km2. It has a low shield profile, and contrasts with adjacent steep-sided Nyiragongo volcano.

==Sulphur Dioxide==

Nyamuragira volcano is responsible for a large portion of the sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere by volcanoes.

==2010 eruption==

At dawn on 2 January 2010, Nyamuragira began spewing out lava flows. There are no settlements close to the volcano, but wildlife officials feared that the eruption may threaten the chimpanzees in the area. Another danger was that the lava could have flowed into the southern sector of Virunga National Park, where there are settlements and villages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8437742.stm|title=DR Congo Volcano Eruption Threatens Rare Chimpanzees|publisher=BBC News|date=2 January 2010|accessdate=2 January 2010[/tpl]
Extensive lava flows from the 2010 eruption can be seen on satellite photographsGoogle Earth shows the crater and lava flows very clearly at coordinates -1.408333, 29.200000 reaching 25 km south-west to Lake Kivu, about 22 km north-west and 35 km north-north-east. 

==2011 eruption==

The volcano erupted again on November 7, 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Congo Volcano Erupts: Video|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/nov/08/congo-volcano-erupts-video|accessdate=8 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 November 2011[/tpl]
That eruption produced a 400-meter high column of lava, and it is said to have been its largest eruption in 100 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geographic.org/photos/volcanoes/volcano_photos_317.html |title=Nyamuragira Volcano, Democratic Republic of the Congo |work=Volcano Photos |publisher=Geographic.org |accessdate=2011-12-26[/tpl]

==2013 activity==

Goma volcanologists warn for an imminent eruption, as more steam and fumes are released from the volcano.
