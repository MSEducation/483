[[Operation Crosstie]]

CATEGORIES: Nevada Test Site nuclear explosive tests, 1967 in the United States

Operation Crosstie was a series of 48 nuclear tests conducted by the United States in 1967-1968 at the Nevada Test Site. These tests followed the Operation Latchkey series and preceded the Operation Bowline series.

==Gasbuggy==

The blast designated Gasbuggy involved an underground detonation, intended to stimulate production of natural gas by cracking the rock in the underground formation of its deposit. The test proceeded as expected, but not only did the production not increase as much as expected, but the customers also refused to buy gas contaminated with traces of radioisotopes.

==Buggy==

Buggy was a Plowshare test designed to excavate a channel.  It was a simultaneous detonation of 5 devices, placed [tpl]convert|150|ft|m[/tpl] apart and [tpl]convert|150|ft|m[/tpl] below the surface that resulted in a
channel [tpl]convert|300|ft|m[/tpl] wide,
900 feet long, and [tpl]convert|80|ft|m[/tpl] deep

==Faultless==

The Faultless test was a calibration test conducted in a mine cavity 3,200 feet beneath the Hot Creek Valley near Tonopah, Nevada, with a yield of around 1 megaton. This test was conducted to see if the land was fit for testing a 5 megaton thermonuclear warhead for the Spartan missile.latimes The test failed because of the large degree of faulting that resulted in the area around the test. It was decided that the land was unfit for multi-megaton nuclear tests, so a similar calibration test was conducted at Amchitka Island, Alaska, in the fall of 1969 during Operation Mandrel.

==Table of detonations==

The United States test series summary table is here: United States' nuclear testing series.
The detonations A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length".
