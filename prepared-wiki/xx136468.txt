James Lyle Telford (21 June 1889 â€“ 27 September 1960) was the 24th mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia from 1939 to 1940 and a founder of the British Columbia branch of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). He was born in Valens, Ontario.
Telford was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as CCF representative. He campaigned for Vancouver mayor in late 1938, defeating incumbent mayor George Clark Miller by approximately 2000 votes in a city race that involved a total of seven mayoral candidates, which split the right-wing vote. Telford did not maintain CCF party membership as mayor, maintaining that political parties should not be a part of municipal politics.[tpl]cite news | publisher=The Vancouver Sun | date=30 November 2002 | page=B4 | first=John | last=Mackie | title=The mayors of Vancouver[/tpl] He was also a medical doctor by profession.
