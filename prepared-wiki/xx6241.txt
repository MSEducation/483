Lithium (from [tpl]lang-el|λίθος lithos[/tpl], "stone") is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, lithium exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, only appears in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
The nuclei of lithium verge on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light in atomic weight.Numerical data from: [tpl]cite doi | 10.1086/375492 [/tpl] Graphed at :File:SolarSystemAbundances.jpg For related reasons, lithium has important links to nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium-6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.Nuclear Weapon Design.

Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, high strength-to-weight alloys used in aircraft, lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than half of lithium production.
Trace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms. The element serves no apparent vital biological function, since animals and plants survive in good health without it. Non-vital functions have not been ruled out. The lithium ion Li+ administered as any of several lithium salts has proved to be useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder, due to neurological effects of the ion in the human body.

===Atomic and physical===

Like the other alkali metals, lithium has a single valence electron that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, it is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity compared to other alkali metals is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in lithium's 1s orbital and are much lower in energy, and therefore they do not participate in chemical bonds).
Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. When cut, it possesses a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray due to oxidation. While it has one of the lowest melting points among all metals (180 °C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.[tpl]RubberBible86th[/tpl]
Lithium has a very low density of 0.534 g/cm3, comparable with that of pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature, the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862 g/cm3) being more than 60% denser. Furthermore, apart from helium and hydrogen, it is less dense than any liquid element, being only 2/3 as dense as liquid nitrogen (0.808 g/cm3).Densities for all the gaseous elements can be obtained at Airliquide.com[tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.airliquide.com/Encyclopedia.asp?LanguageID=11&CountryID=19&Formula=&GasID=5&UNNumber=&EquivGasID=32&VolLiquideBox=&MasseLiquideBox=&VolGasBox=&MasseGasBox=&RD20=29&RD9=8&RD6=64&RD4=2&RD3=22&RD8=27&RD2=20&RD18=41&RD7=18&RD13=71&RD16=35&RD12=31&RD19=34&RD24=62&RD25=77&RD26=78&RD28=81&RD29=82 |title=Nitrogen, N2, Physical properties, safety, MSDS, enthalpy, material compatibility, gas liquid equilibrium, density, viscosity, inflammability, transport properties |publisher=Encyclopedia.airliquide.com |accessdate=2010-09-29[/tpl] Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being sodium and potassium.

At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is the most prevalent.[tpl]Cite journal|first = A.

Lithium has a specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-Kelvin, the highest of all solids.THERMO Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications.

===Chemistry and compounds===

Lithium reacts with water easily, but with noticeably less energy than other alkali metals do. The reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually stored under cover of a hydrocarbon, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals can be stored in more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).
When placed over a flame, lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color, but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1039/QJ8611300270|title=XXIV.—On chemical analysis by spectrum-observations|year=1861|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London|volume=13|issue=3|page=270 [/tpl] Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent, as the hydrogen produced will not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers, specifically the Class D type (see Types of extinguishing agents). Lithium is the only metal which reacts with nitrogen under normal conditions.[tpl]cite book|page=47|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&pg=PA47|title=The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide|author=Krebs, Robert E.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33438-2[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author1=Institute, American Geological|author2=Union, American Geophysical|author3=Society, Geochemical|title=Geochemistry international|volume =31|issue=1–4|page=115|date=1 January 1994|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=77McAQAAIAAJ[/tpl]
Lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium, an element of similar atomic and ionic radius. Chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with N2, the formation of an oxide ([tpl]chem|Li|2|O[/tpl]) and peroxide ([tpl]chem|Li|2|O|2[/tpl]) when burnt in O2, salts with similar solubilities, and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides.[tpl]Cite book|first = Conrad W. |last = Kamienski, McDonald, Daniel P.; Stark, Marshall W.; Papcun, John R.|chapter =Lithium and lithium compounds|title =Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc.| year = 2004|doi =10.1002/0471238961.1209200811011309.a01.pub2[/tpl][tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=97–99[/tpl] The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride (LiH).
Other known binary compounds include the halides (LiF, LiCl, LiBr, LiI), and the sulfide ([tpl]chem|Li|2|S[/tpl]), the superoxide ([tpl]chem|LiO|2[/tpl]), carbide ([tpl]chem|Li|2|C|2[/tpl]). Many other inorganic compounds are known, where lithium combines with anions to form various salts: borates, amides, carbonate, nitrate, or borohydride ([tpl]chem|LiBH|4[/tpl]). Multiple organolithium reagents are known where there is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations.[tpl]Cite book|pages=3–40|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z76sVepirh4C&pg=PA16|author=Sapse, Anne-Marie and von R.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance).[tpl]cite web|url=http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/Li_iso.htm |title=Isotopes of Lithium|accessdate=2008-04-21|publisher=Berkeley National Laboratory, The Isotopes Project[/tpl] Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon compared to the next lighter and heavier elements, helium and beryllium, which means that alone among stable light elements, lithium can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3.:File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg shows binding energies of stable nuclides graphically; the source of the data-set is given in the figure background. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.
Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=104&n=158|title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|author=Sonzogni, Alejandro|location=National Nuclear Data Center|accessdate=2008-06-06[/tpl]
7Li is one of the primordial elements (or, more properly, primordial nuclides) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration.

Nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics uses are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent as to slightly but measurably change the 6Li to 7Li ratios even in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200274101987|title=Isotope-abundance variations of selected elements (IUPAC Technical Report)|year=2002|last1=Coplen|first1=T.B.|last2=Bohlke|first2=J.K.|last3=De Bievre|first3=P.|last4=Ding|first4=T.|last5=Holden|first5=N.E.|last6=Hopple|first6=J.A.|last7=Krouse|first7=H.R.|last8=Lamberty|first8=A.|last9=Peiser|first9=H.S.|last10=N.N.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=74|issue=10|page=1987|display-authors=9[/tpl]

==Occurrence==

===Astronomical===

According to modern cosmological theory, lithium—as both of its stable isotopes lithium-6 and lithium-7—was among the 3 elements synthesized in the Big Bang.[tpl]cite journal | bibcode= 1985ARA&A..23..319B] | title= Big bang nucleosynthesis – Theories and observations | author1= Boesgaard | first1= A.

Palo Alto | doi= 10.1146/annurev.aa.23.090185.001535[/tpl] Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a "cosmological lithium discrepancy" in the Universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have far more. The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the "mixing" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.universetoday.com/476/why-old-stars-seem-to-lack-lithium/ |title=Why Old Stars Seem to Lack Lithium|date= 2006-08-16|author= Cain, Fraser [/tpl] Furthermore, lithium is produced in younger stars. Though it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than predicted in later-generation stars, for causes not yet completely understood.
Though it was one of the three first elements (together with helium and hydrogen) to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron are markedly less abundant than other nearby elements. This is a result of the low temperature necessary to destroy lithium, and a lack of common processes to produce it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060901133923/http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2006 |title=Element Abundances |accessdate=2009-11-17[/tpl]
Lithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars. Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the "lithium test" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/24593/brown-dwarf/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110225032434/http://www.universetoday.com/24593/brown-dwarf/|archivedate=2011-02-25|title=Brown Dwarf |accessdate=2009-11-17 |last=Cain |first=Fraser |publisher=Universe Today[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www-int.stsci.edu/~inr/ldwarf3.html |title=L Dwarf Classification|accessdate=2013-03-06 | first =Neill | last = Reid | date = 2002-03-10[/tpl] Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X-4) orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.

===Biological===

Lithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids have been found to contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb.

He named the metal inside the material "lithium".
Arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts.[tpl]Cite book|year = 2004|title = Encyclopedia of the Elements: Technical Data – History –Processing – Applications|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 978-3-527-30666-4|pages = 287–300|author = Enghag, Per[/tpl] It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium.[tpl]Cite book|last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford|year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Science and the Arts|volume=5| title=The Quarterly journal of science and the arts|year=1818|page=338|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-10-05|url=http://books.google.com/?id=D_4WAAAAYAAJ|author=Various authors[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url =http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/t/i/timeline/source.html|title = Timeline science and engineering|publisher = DiracDelta Science & Engineering Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2008-09-18[/tpl] Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zkIAAAAAYAAJ|first1=William Thomas|last1=Brande|first2=William James|last2=MacNeven|title=A manual of chemistry|year=1821|page=191|accessdate=2010-10-08|publisher=Long[/tpl] In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.

The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines or similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small market for lithium soaps and the lubricating greases based upon them was supported by several small mining operations mostly in the United States.
The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some "natural sources" of lithium ion which had been "contaminated" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.[tpl]cite web| url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450494.pdf| title = Commodity Report 1994: Lithium|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-11-03|year = 1994|first = Joyce A.|last = Ober[/tpl] 
Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process.[tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/ciuz.200300264|title = Lithium und seine Verbindungen – Industrielle, medizinische und wissenschaftliche Bedeutung |year = 2003|last1 = Deberitz|first1 = Jürgen|first2 = Gernot|journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit|volume = 37|page = 258|last2 = Boche| issue = 4[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/ciuz.19850190505|title = Lithium – wie es nicht im Lehrbuch steht|year = 1985|last1 = Bauer|first1 = Richard |journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit|volume = 19|page = 167| issue = 5[/tpl] These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices. But in the mid-1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive method than underground or even open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials as only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the turn of the 21st century.
The use in lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007.[tpl]cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/myb1-2007-lithi.pdf|title = Minerals Yearbook 2007 : Lithium| publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2010-11-03|year = 1994|first = Joyce A.|last = Ober[/tpl] With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s, new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand.[tpl]Cite book| first = Jessica Elzea |last = Kogel|title = Industrial minerals & rocks: commodities, markets, and uses|isbn = 978-0-87335-233-8|page = 599|url = http://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA600&lpg=PAPA599|chapter = Lithium|year = 2006|publisher = Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration|location = Littleton, Colo.[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8erDL_DnsgAC&pg=PA339 |title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 28 – Lactic Acid to Magnesium Supply-Demand Relationships|publisher=M.

==Production==

Since the end of World War II lithium production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals such as those above. Lithium salts are extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450o C.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=73[/tpl] In 1998 it was about [tpl]nowrap|95 US$ / kg[/tpl] (or 43 US$/pound).[tpl]cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |title=Lithium|accessdate = 2007-08-19|last=Ober |first=Joyce A |format=PDF |pages = 77–78| publisher=United States Geological Survey[/tpl]
Worldwide identified reserves of lithium in 2008 were estimated by the US Geological Survey as 13 million tonnes. Deposits of lithium are found in South America throughout the Andes mountain chain. Chile is the leading lithium producer, followed by Argentina. Both countries recover the lithium from brine pools. In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada.[tpl]Cite book| author = Hammond, C.

There are differing opinions about the potential growth of lithium production. A 2008 study concluded that "realistically achievable lithium carbonate production will be sufficient for only a small fraction of future PHEV and EV global market requirements", that "demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade", and that "mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound, it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that LiIon propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the 'Green Car'".
However, according to a 2011 study conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/albertus-20110617.html|title=Study finds resource constraints should not be a limiting factor for large-scale EV battery production|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2011-06-17|accessdate=2011-06-17[/tpl] Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/08/lithium-20110803.html|title=University of Michigan and Ford researchers see plentiful lithium resources for electric vehicles|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2011-08-03|accessdate=2011-08-11[/tpl]
