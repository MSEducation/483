[[Working President]]

CATEGORIES: Indian National Congress

The head of the executive committee - the Congress Working Committee of the Congress Party in India is known as the Working President of Congress. For some of Congress's history over the past century, especially under Indira Gandhi, this office has been combined with that of President of the All India Congress Committee, or Congress President, but the duties are different, with the Working President often being a person of great influence within the organisational structure of the party rather than of great political popularity.
