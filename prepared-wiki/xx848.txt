The Military Forces of Colombia ([tpl]lang-es|Fuerzas Militares de Colombia|links=no[/tpl]) are the armed forces of the Republic of Colombia. 

More specifically, the Colombian Constitution ([tpl]lang-es|Constitución Política de Colombia[/tpl]) includes two overlapping definitions of what could be defined as 'armed forces' in English:
This is a subtle yet important distinction, both in terms of emphasizing the civil nature of the National Police, and some differences that may apply to it as a service, as well as in clearing confusion when dealing with documents and references about the Colombian armed forces, in particular due to the large size of the police and the military-style operation and training of some of its most noticeable units, as a result of the Colombian Conflict.

==Funding==

In 1999, Colombia assigned 3.6% of its GDP to defense, according to the National Planning Department.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] By 2007 this figure had risen to 6.1% of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] The armed forces number about 250,000 uniformed personnel: 145,000 military and 105,000 police. These figures do not include assistance personnel such as cooks, medics, mechanics, and so on. This makes the Colombian military one of the largest and most well-equipped in Latin America. Many Colombian military personnel have received military training assistance directly in Colombia and also in the United States. The United States has provided equipment and financing to the Colombian military and police through the military assistance program, foreign military sales, and the international narcotics control program, all currently united under the auspices of Plan Colombia.
