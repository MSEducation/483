==Background==

The current Peebles High School building was completed in August 1997, along with three other public high schools in Adams County, North Adams, Manchester, and West Union High School.  All four schools used the same layout and appear almost identical from the air.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3O0CAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=Manchester,+North+Adams,+Peebles,+West+Union+identical+buildings&source=bl&ots=1TiHMd20Dr&sig=E6g0E2tcxHjfu5gxLaetlCEVn2o&hl=en&ei=PxMpS-zMNsv_nAfPtdmcDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=In God's Country|accessdate=2009-12-16|publisher=Cincinnati Magazine|author=Linda Vaccariello[/tpl]

==Controversy==

The four regular public high schools in Adams County were built at the same time and all four featured a large granite tablet outside the school carved with the Ten Commandments.  They were removed after a lengthy four-year legal battle over the placement of the tablets on public property.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/06/10/loc_commandments10.html|title=Commandments removed amid protests |accessdate=2009-12-16|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|author=Marie McCain and Dan Horn[/tpl] In Peebles, the tablet now is located directly across the street facing the high school on the property of the Peebles Baptist Church.

==Athletics==

All Peebles teams are nicknamed "The Indians," because of the town's close proximity to Serpent Mound.
The school has Jr. high and high school sports in soccer, cross country, golf, volleyball, baseball and basketball.  
In the 2007-08 season, the 7th grade boys basketball team, coached by Josh Arey, went undefeated. The following year, 2008â€“09, the then 8th grade boys team, coached by John McAdow, went undefeated again for the first time in PHS history. The teams are considered to be one of the greatest sports teams to ever come through the small village of Peebles, Ohio.
The history of Peebles basketball from 1954 through 2000 was detailed in the 2008 feature-length documentary, "We are the Indians."
The current coach of the Varsity Boys Indians is Josh Arey. The head girls coach is Vohn Hoop.
