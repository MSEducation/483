Wadd ([tpl]lang-ar|ود[/tpl]) "Love and Friendship", known variously as Ilumquh, ʻAmm and Sīn, was the Minaean pagan moon god. Snakes were believed to be a sacred symbol to Wadd. He is mentioned in the Qur'an (71:23) as a deity of the time of the Prophet Noah.
 And they say: By no means leave your gods, nor leave Wadd, nor Suwa'; nor Yaghuth, and Ya'uq and Nasr. (Qur'an 71:23) 
The Temple dedicated to Wadd was demolished on the orders of Muhammad, and those who resisted the demolition were killed, in the Expedition of Khalid ibn al-Walid (2nd Dumatul Jandal).[tpl]cite book|last=William Pickthall|first=Marmaduke|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kpJCAAAAYAAJ&q=qatan|title=Islamic culture, Volume 9|year=1967|publisher=Islamic Culture Board|isbn=978-1-142-49174-1|page=191[/tpl] Original is from the University of Virginia[tpl]cite book|last=ibn al Kalbi|first=Hisham|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G4HXAAAAMAAJ|title=The book of idols: being a translation from the Arabic of the Kitāb al-asnām|year=1952|publisher=Princeton University Press|asin=B002G9N1NQ|page=48[/tpl]
