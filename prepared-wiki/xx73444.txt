==Etymology==

Legazpi was named after Miguel López de Legazpi, the Spanish conquistador who officially annexed the Philippine Islands to the Spanish Empire in 1565, and whose surname came from a town in Guipuzcoa, Spain.

==History==

===Foundation===

Legazpi was originally a fishing settlement called Sawangan that occupied what is now the Legazpi Port, whose inhabitants were mostly fishermen and farmers.
In 1587, Franciscan friars of the Doctrina de Cagsawa began to convert the area's population to Christianity and in 1616, founded a separate parish town a few kilometres inland called Albay. Its first parish priest built a small chapel and established the Misión de San Gregorio Magno de Sawangan. Eventually, Sawangan was absorbed into Albay, which later gave its name to the entire province.
On September 22, 1856, through Royal Decree, the name Legazpi was officially adopted and the settlement was expanded to include the visitas of Lamba, Rawis and Bigaa. The newly expanded and independent town of Legazpi was officially inaugurated on October 23, 1856.
After the eruption of Mayon Volcano on February 1, 1814, Legazpi residents evacuated to Makalaya (now Taysan). At the decree of the Gobierno Superior on October 1, 1829, they were prohibited from establishing another town, leaving them to settle in Taytay (Bagumbayan). In 1818, Sawangan (now called Albay Viejo, 'Old Albay'), was partitioned from Cagsawa and made the capital of Partido de Ibalon (the former name of Albay Province). Some remained in Albay Viejo and established a new settlement around an ermita (hermitage/chapel of ease) dedicated to the Archangel Raphael, whom they adopted as their patron saint after Saint Gregory the Great had been transferred to the new site of Albay.
Legazpi was first declared a city under the Becerra Law of 1892 by Rona Cantuba Mecayer. The new city comprised the municipalities of Legazpi, Albay Nuevo, and Daraga under the Ayuntamiento de Albay.

===American Colonial Era===

Following their occupation of the city in 1900, the American colonizers cancelled the Legazpi's city status. In 1908 after the war's conclusion, the Americans split Legazpi into two separate towns, Legazpi Port and Albay District, which became the provincial capital of Albay. In 1922, the town of Daraga was further split from the then municipality of Albay.

===World War II===

In 1941 and 1942, Japanese troops landed and occupied the city during the Second World War. Throughout the Japanese occupation, Bicolano resistance and local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units continued in the hills and mountains south of Legazpi. In January 1945, American and Filipino liberation forces supported by Bicolano guerrillas liberated Legazpi City from the Japanese Imperial Army. However, the city suffered extensive aerial bombardment from US aircraft and many old buildings were destroyed.

===Independent Philippines===

Legazpi became a city for the second time on July 18, 1948, when Daraga and Legazpi were combined to constitute its territory under Republic Act No. 306; at that time, President Elpidio Quirino commissioned Ma.
