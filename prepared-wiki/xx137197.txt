Membership in these organizations means automatic affiliation with ACT.
Individual members who are qualified are also accepted.

Integration and education are ACT’s main organizing and  consolidation activities.  Regular visits are made to update members of the organizational activities and campaigns.  Discussions, dialogues, for a, and symposia are held especially on the burning issues of the day that directly or indirectly affect the education sector.  ACT also aims to unite the membership on the principles and objectives of the organization, align itself with the basic masses and raise its levels of unity to an anti-foreign domination stand on the educational system and Philippine society.  ACT also provides institutional services like free legal aid, media exposure on legitimate concerns, training, and other forms of assistance as may be deemed necessary.  It regularly comes out with its quarterly publication, the ACT Forum, for its present and future members.
