==Background==

The album is among Joel's most ambitious albums, and Joel has openly acknowledged that it's one of his personal favorites, calling it "the recording I'm most proud of and the material I'm most proud of." Billy Joel Interview on Nylon Curtainhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU When he recorded the album, he said in an interview that he wanted to "create a sonic masterpiece." So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.

Regarding the album's themes, Joel has stated "It was during the Reagan years, and the diminishing horizons in America at the time that all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit kind of life your old man had." Billy Joel Interview on Nylon Curtainhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU This pessimism about the American dream, in Joel's view, permeates most of the songs on the album.
The song "Allentown", which brought attention to the plight of America's declining steel industry, spent an unprecedented six weeks at No. 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1983.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
Pop-culture journalist Chuck Klosterman praised songs from the album, specifically "Laura" and "Where's the Orchestra?," in his book Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs.
