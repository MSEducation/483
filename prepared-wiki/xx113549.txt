Crackle of Death is a 1976 film, the third produced in the Night Stalker film series. It combined the Kolchak: The Night Stalker episodes "Firefall" and "The Energy Eater" with additional narration by Darren McGavin as Kolchak. It also contains new dialogue by McGavin, Oakland and Grinnage, as well as new "scenes", such as a newspaper on a desk and the image of the Doppelganger being inserted into old footage (for example, when Kolchak looks at the sky, he sees the Doppelganger giant face).
Crackle of Death was followed by a fourth movie entitled Demon and The Mummy that combined two more episodes in a similar manner; namely, "Demon In Lace" and "Legacy of Terror".
All four episodes comprising these films were subsequently withdrawn from the original television syndication package. They were not made available in their entirety again until a Columbia House VHS video release in the 1990s. The TV-edited films have never been released on home video.
