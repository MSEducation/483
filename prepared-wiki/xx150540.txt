B-Sides Collect is a compilation album by Skinny Puppy, released in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=29|author=Wolanski, Coreen|title=Skinny Puppy:  Every Dog Has Its Day|publisher=Exclaim!|year=2002|accessdate=2010-07-20[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Skinny Puppy:  The Illustrated Discography (Second Edition) |last=Kern |first=Jay |year=2010 |publisher=Mythos Press  |page=62[/tpl] The album serves as a collection of several B-sides from earlier singles that went out of print around the time of its release. With the exception of "Serpents", this collection compliments Twelve Inch Anthology which contains many B-Sides. Not all B-sides are represented, due to time and label restrictions. Other B-sides that had previously been available but do not appear on this release include: "Censor (Dogshit) 12inch mix", "Tin Omen (reload)", "Spasmolytic (remix)", "Walking On Ice (Live)", "Inquisition (Extended Mix)", and "Choralone (Live)".
