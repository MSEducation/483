Shaftesbury Abbey was an abbey that housed nuns in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Founded in 888, the abbey was the wealthiest Benedictine nunnery in England, a major pilgrimage site, and the town's central focus. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the English Reformation by the order of Thomas Cromwell, minister to King Henry VIII. At the time it was the second wealthiest nunnery in England, behind only Sion Abbey.[tpl]cite book|title='Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey of Barking', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 2|year=1907|pages=115-122|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39832|editor=William Page & J.

==Early history==

Alfred the Great and his daughter Æthelgifu founded the Abbey in 888 (eight years after founding the town of Shaftesbury as a burgh), which boosted the town's growth.  The relics of St Edward the Martyr were translated from Wareham and received at the abbey with great ceremony. The translation of the relics was overseen by St Dunstan and Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia.[ref]
