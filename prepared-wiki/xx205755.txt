Preflight,Pre-flight (printing) in the graphic arts industry, is the process of checking a digital document before it goes to plate, print or otherwise output (exported - such as to PDF). It is a way to check quality before printing, digitally or otherwise, but can also be used to check any common artwork file. Preflight may be done on the source desktop publishing document, or before creating a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. The term preflight was first used during a presentation in 1990 by Chuck Weger, a well known industry consultant. There were some early postscript RIPs that interpreted data and provided a preflight report of sorts.
