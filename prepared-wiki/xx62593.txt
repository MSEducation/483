Others say that she was once a beautiful but impious Norman  noblewoman who loved hunting so much that she said, "If there is no hunting in heaven, I would rather not go!" She is said to have regretted making this wish, and now cries out 
in misery rather than joy as she hunts forever in the night sky.
