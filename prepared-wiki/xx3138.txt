[[Exabyte]]

CATEGORIES: Units of information

The exabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix exa indicates multiplication by the sixth power of 1000 or 1018 in the International System of Units (SI).  Therefore one exabyte is one quintillion bytes (short scale).
A related unit, the exbibyte, using a binary prefix, is [tpl]gaps|10246|bytes[/tpl], about 15% larger.

==Usage examples==

Several filesystems use disk formats that support theoretical volume sizes of several exabytes, including Btrfs, XFS, ZFS, exFAT, NTFS, HFS Plus, and ReFS.

===All words ever spoken===

A popular expression claims that "all words ever spoken by human beings" could be stored in approximately 5 exabytes of data[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/12/opinion/12WED4.html | publisher=New York Times | title=Trying to Measure the Amount of Information That Humans Create | author=Verlyn Klinkenborg | date=November 12, 2003 | accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl] (login)[tpl]Cite web| url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid5_gci944596,00.html | title=How many bytes for... | publisher=techtarget.com | accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html3month/2005/051206.McKay.petabyte.html | title='Robbie the Robot' making data easier to mine | date=December 6, 2005 | publisher=purdue.edu | accessdate=2007-02-17[/tpl] (although this project is now outdated and therefore not entirely accurate), often citing a project at the UC Berkeley School of Information in support.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/ | title=How Much Information? 2003 | publisher=berkeley.edu | accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl] The 2003 University of California Berkeley report credits the estimate to the website of Caltech researcher Roy Williams, where the statement can be found as early as May 1999.[tpl]Cite web| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508062723/http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/~roy/dataquan/ | title=Data Powers of Ten | author=Roy Williams | archivedate=1999-05-08 | accessdate=2006-07-19 | url=http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/~roy/dataquan/[/tpl] This statement has been criticized.[tpl]Cite web| author=Mark Liberman | authorlink = Mark Liberman | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000110.html | title=More on the 5 exabyte mistake | date=November 12, 2003 | publisher=upenn.edu | accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://brian.carnell.com/archives/years/2003/12/000022.html | title=How Much Storage Is Required to Store Every Word Ever Spoken by Human Beings? | date=December 31, 2003 | author=Brian Carnell | publisher=brian.carnell.com | accessdate=2006-07-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060206081135/http://brian.carnell.com/archives/years/2003/12/000022.html  |archivedate = 2006-02-06[/tpl] Mark Liberman calculated the storage requirements for all human speech at 42 zettabytes (42,000 exabytes, and 8,400 times the original estimate), if digitized as 16 kHz 16-bit audio, although he did freely confess that "maybe the authors the exabyte estimate were thinking about text".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000087.html | title=Zettascale Linguistics | author=Mark Liberman | authorlink=Mark Liberman | date=November 3, 2003 | publisher=upenn.edu | accessdate=2007-02-17[/tpl]
Earlier studies from the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that by the end of 1999, the sum of human-produced information (including all audio, video recordings, and text/books) was about 12 exabytes of data.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.cio.com/archive/092203/enriquez.html | title=The Data That Defines Us |date=Fall–Winter 2003 | author=Juan Enriquez | publisher=CIO Magazine | accessdate=2006-07-19[/tpl] The 2003 Berkeley report stated that in 2002 alone, "telephone calls worldwide on both landlines and mobile phones contained 17.3 exabytes of new information if stored in digital form" and that "it would take 9.25 exabytes of storage to hold all U.S. telephone calls each year".

===100,000 Libraries of Congress===

The content of Library of Congress is commonly estimated to hold 10 terabytes of data in all printed material.  Recent estimates of the size including audio, video, and digital materials is from 3 petabytes to 20 petabytes.
Therefore, one exabyte could hold a hundred thousand times the printed material, or 500 to 3,000 times all content of the Library of Congress.
