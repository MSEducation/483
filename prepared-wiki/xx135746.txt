He is also a civil engineer (sound/acoustics). 
He is married to the Canadian orienteerer Sandy Hott (née Smith). In the spring of 2007 they decided to change their surnames from Hott Johansen merely to Hott, to make it simple and easy to spell. They had thought of this name change for a while,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] and finally decided to do it before their first son was born in June 2007.
