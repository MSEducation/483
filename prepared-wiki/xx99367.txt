Arthur Ernest Wilder-Smith, FRSC (22 December 1915 – 14 September 1995), more commonly known as A. E. Wilder-Smith, was a British organic chemist and young Earth creationist. 

==Biography==

Wilder-Smith earned three doctorates; his first PhD in 1941 in Physical Organic Chemistry from Reading University, England, his second in Pharmacology from the University of Geneva, and his third from Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Zurich. Wilder-Smith became a professor of pharmacology at the University of Illinois Medical Center in 1963.[tpl]cite journal | last = Blaine | first = Graham B. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Drug Users: The Psychopharmacology of Turning On, by A.

In 1966 he published the book Herkunft und Zukunft des Menschen[tpl]cite web|title=Bibliographic Information|url=http://openlibrary.org/search?wisbn=0871233568|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl]  which promoted Burdick's and other's claims that dinosaur and human footprints existed together at Paluxy River.

With the exception of plate 6 from Burdick all plates claiming to be man tracks were in situ.  In the mid-1980s the footprints were  shown to be not of human origin, and some specimens were shown to be doctored or carved, in particular the loose blocks attributed to Burdick.[tpl]cite web|last=Kuban|first=Glen J.|title=The "Burdick Print"|url=http://paleo.cc/paluxy/wilker6.htm|work=Kuban's Paluxy Website|publisher=Kuban|accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl]The Texas Dinosaur/"Man Track" Controversy, Talk.Origins 
According to the National Center for Science Education, Wilder-Smith's 1981 work The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution contains a variety of falsehoods and errors.[tpl]cite news | url=http://ncse.com/book/export/html/1447 | title=Analysis of the Melvindale Science Curriculum Sub-Committee Book Recommendations   |publisher=National Center for Science Education | date=October 30, 1998 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-04-06[/tpl] Kenneth Christiansen, Professor of Biology at Grinnell College, reviewed the book stating "the most fundamental flaw of the book is an apparent confusion or ignorance (it is hard to tell) concerning our present understanding of the evolutionary process."Kenneth Christiansen, "The Natural Sciences Know Nothing of Evolution Review" in Reviews of Creationist Books ed Liz Rank Hughes, National Center for Science Education, 1992. page 134 ISBN 0-939873-52-4 He further noted that Wilder-Smith's work disregarded basic literature in the field discussed. In 1986, Wilder-Smith and creationist physicist Edgar Andrews (President of the Biblical Creation Society) debated biologists Richard Dawkins and John Maynard Smith at the Oxford Union.http://richarddawkins.net/audio/721-1986-oxford-union-debate from Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science 
Wilder-Smith has also been claimed to be the "father" of the intelligent design movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faithandscienceresource.org.uk/reviews/noseriousscientist.html|title=No Serious Scientist . . .|publisher=Faith and Science Resource|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] In 2005, intelligent design advocate William A. Dembski wrote that Wilder-Smith's "intuitive ideas about information has been the impetus for much of my research."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.02.Reply_to_Henry_Morris.htm|title=Intelligent Design's Contributions to the Debate Over Evolution: A Reply to Henry Morris|author=William A. Dembski|date=1 February 2005|publisher=Design Inference Website|accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] However this was rebutted by Nick Matzke, writing in 2007 for the science blog Panda's Thumb. He asserts that "intelligent design" as such originated in the 1989 textbook Of Pandas and People, and that claims of links with earlier works were "a desperate attempt to obfuscate the basic historical point ID's origins". While it is true that Wilder-Smith also discussed young Earth creationist concepts, he had never used the phrase "intelligent design" itself. The closest phrasing is found in his 1968 publication Man’s origin, man’s destiny: a critical survey of the principles of evolution and Christianity, which with its argument that the mammary glands in whales could not have arisen by chance mutations. Wilder-Smith wrote that (emphasis added) "To deny planning when studying such a system is to strain credulity more than to ask one to believe in an intelligent nipple designer, who incidentally must have understood hydraulics rather well."[tpl]cite web |url=http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/08/the-true-origin.html |title=The true origin of "intelligent design" |author= Nick Matzke |authorlink=Nick Matzke |date= August 14, 2007 |publisher=The Panda's Thumb |accessdate=2012-07-03[/tpl]
