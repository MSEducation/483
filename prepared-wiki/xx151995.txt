Cinema 500 km ([tpl]lang-ar|السينما 500 كم[/tpl]) is a Saudi Arabian documentary film which premiered in 2006. Directed by Abdullah Al-Eyaf, the film depicts the experiences of Tariq Al-Husaini, a 21-year-old Saudi who is a movie fan despite the fact that there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia (motion pictures are available on home video only). Al-Husaini is shown applying for a passport and traveling 500 kilometers to Bahrain to see a movie in a cinema for the first time in his life.
Abdullah Al-Eyaf secured permission from the Saudi Ministry of Culture and Information to shoot this documentary. The film premiered at the Emirates Film Competition in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 2006 http://www.efilmc.com/english/sn_pr_e.aspx?i1=3085&i2=8053&i3=5425, but due to the lack of cinemas in Saudi Arabia there are no plans yet to show the film in its home country.
