[[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]]

CATEGORIES: United Nations Mission in Kosovo, Government of Kosovo

The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo or UNMIK is the officially mandated mission of the United Nations in Kosovo. Currently, UNMIK describes its mandate as being to "help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants of Kosovo and advance regional stability in the western Balkans."About UNMIK section of the official UNMIK website
UNMIK was established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1244[tpl]UN document |docid=S-RES-1244(1999) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=1999 |resolution_number=1244 |accessdate=2008-09-06[/tpl] which was passed on 10 June 1999. In that Resolution, the UN decided to "deploy in Kosovo, under United Nations auspices, an international civil and security presence".
UNMIK still exists today, but its day-to-day functions are relatively minor since Kosovo declared independence and adopted a new constitution,[tpl]cite web|title=Promoting security, stability and respect for human rights in Kosovo|url=http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmik/|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 September 2012[/tpl] and following the creation of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), which itself operates within the framework of Security Council Resolution 1244."EU launches Kosovo police mission", BBC, 9 December 2008. – Retrieved on 19 May 2009.

Kosovo is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the Yugoslav) government and Kosovo's largely ethnic-Albanian population. A clear majority of the Kosovo's population support Kosovo's independence. Internationally, [tpl]Numrec|Kos[/tpl] of the United Nation's 193 member states (including a  majority of European countries) have recognised Kosovo's independence.
The head of UNMIK is the Special Representative of the Secretary-General ('SRSG') and is appointed by the Secretary-General under the advice of UN member states. Farid Zarif, an Afghan diplomat, has been the SRSG since 11 October 2011.

==Structure==

UNMIK has been divided into four sections which it calls "pillars."  These are:
Responsibility for enforcement of Pillars I and II has now been transferred to the institutions of provisional self-government in Kosovo. The UN, however, still monitors this enforcement.
Following a major internal restructuring of its activities, this Pillar structure underwent a change. Pillar I was dissolved causing Police Commissioner and the Director of the Department of Justice to report to SRSG instead of DSRSG as previously. Pillar II was reduced to a Department of Civil Administration and its Director also reporting directly to the SRSG. UNMIK oversees a substantial UN International Police force numbered at approximately 1,985 including Formed Police Units.
A NATO-led force called KFOR provides an international security presence in support of UNMIK's work, but is not subordinate to the UN.
The European Union led economic development includes the privatisation of former government enterprises.[tpl]cite web|author=Kosovo Trust Agency |url=http://kta-kosovo.org/html/index.php?module=htmlpages&func=display&pid=19 |title=Archive :: Kosovo Trust Agency :: KTA |publisher=Kta-kosovo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl]http://kta-kosovo.org/ktapress/2007/eng/wave-29-results-eng.doc This policy has been opposed by Belgrade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newkosovareport.com/20071127235/Business-and-Economy/KTA-only-Kosovo-Institutions-can-privatize-Brezovica.html |title=KTA: only Kosovo Institutions can privatize Brezovica |publisher=New Kosova Report |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] This was formerly carried out by the KTA (Kosovo Trust Agency) an EU organisation with Jasper Dick as Managing Director.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] Since 2008 this role of the KTA has been taken over by The Privatisation Agency of Kosovo.[tpl]cite web|author=Kosovo Trust Agency |url=http://kta-kosovo.org/html/ |title=Kosovo Trust Agency :: KTA |publisher=Kta-kosovo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl]

As described above, UNMIK no longer performs all of these functions.

==Criticism==

The UNMIK has been criticized for failing to achieve many of its stated objectives and is widely resented by both Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]. After seven years of work ([tpl]As of|2006|lc=on[/tpl]):

In June 2005, a BBC article suggested that the European Roma Rights Centre were to sue UNMIK over the treatment of Roma refugees.
In July 2006, a book, 'Peace at Any Price: How the World Failed Kosovo', written by two former senior staffers at UNMIK, exposed a catalogue of errors and incompetence in the institution over its seven-year history.

==Kosovo final status process==

===2005===

A UN-led political process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status. Belgrade proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain a part of Serbia — Belgrade officials repeatedly said that an imposition of Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law and the UN Charter. Representatives of Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian majority asserted that Kosovo must become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milošević years made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia impossible.
UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland, leads the status process with Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan, his deputy. Ahtisaari's office — the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) — is located in Vienna and includes liaison staff from NATO, the European Union and the United States.

===2006===

The initial status negotiations focused on technical issues important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo's minorities (and especially the Kosovo Serbs). Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, an important measure in the protection of Kosovo Serb communities.  Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo's minorities.
On 24 July 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself.  Serbian President Boris Tadić, Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Agim Çeku attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo's future status.  Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but added that the discussion was "frank and candid" and the atmosphere was better than he could have expected."Serbian, Kosovo Albanian talks fail to reach breakthrough on future status " Agence France-Presse (AFP), Vienna, 24 July 2006.
Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on 20 September 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by U.S. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.  At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its desire to work towards a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006 and also endorsed Ahtisaari's plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement.[tpl]cite web | title = Kosovo Contact Group Ministerial Statement | url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/72892.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213221912/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2006/72892.htm |archivedate = February 13, 2008[/tpl]
As the end of 2006 neared, and despite progress on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.[tpl]cite news | title =  UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008  | date=2006-10-09 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

===2007===

On 2 February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered to representatives in Belgrade and Pristina a draft status settlement proposal. The proposal covered a wide range of issues related to Kosovo's future, in particular measures to protect Kosovo's non-Albanian communities such as decentralization of government, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional protections for non-Albanian communities, which would remain in place for at least three years. Whilst not mentioning the word "independence," the draft included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo. In particular, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, to create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols.[tpl]cite web | title = Error Page - Yahoo!

After this meeting, leaders from both sides signalled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Kosovo Albanians for Kosovo's independence; Belgrade for continued sovereignty over Kosovo). Concluding that there was little hope of the two sides reconciling their positions independently, Ahtisaari said he would submit to the UN Security Council his own proposed status arrangements, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March.[tpl]cite web | title = Error Page - Yahoo!

In a survey carried out by UNDP and published in March 2007, 96% of Kosovo Albanians and 77% of non-Serb minorities in Kosovo wanted Kosovo to become independent within present borders. Some 78% of the Serb minority wanted Kosovo to remain an autonomous province within Serbia.

In early May 2007, European members of the UN Security Council, Germany and the United States circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution that would replace UN Security Council Resolution 1244, endorse Ahtisaari's proposals and end the UN administration of Kosovo after a transition period of 120 days. The US Permanent Representative to the UN said that the European/US draft had enough support in the Security Council to be adopted unless Russia chose to object.[tpl]cite web | title = UN News Service-News Now | url=http://www.un.org/radio/news/RS/nnF/nnFItemDesc.asp?id=10132 | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = RIA Novosti - Russia - Russia threatens to veto UN Kosovo resolution - dept.

"UN Resolution on Kosovo Circulated", AP, 11 May 2007. Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.[tpl]cite web | title = FT.com / Comment & analysis / Letters - A long reconciliation process is required | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl]
The Contact Group said that, regardless of the outcome of the present negotiations, a new International Civilian Office (ICO) will be established in Kosovo to take up the civil administration provided for under UNSCR 1244, supervise the implementation of any status settlement and safeguard minority rights. NATO leaders said that the presence of KFOR will be maintained in Kosovo after any status settlement. The EU will establish a European Security and Defense Policy Rule of Law mission to focus on the policing and justice sectors.

Whilst the draft resolution on Kosovo's status had yet to be endorsed by the Security Council, senior US officials had been suggesting that an agreement might be reached by 2008. The US assistant secretary of state for European affairs told delegates at a NATO conference in Croatia that he hoped that Kosovo's future could be resolved in the months leading up to the alliance's next summit meeting in Romania in April of that year.[tpl]cite news | title = Russia dismisses Kosovo statehood without Serb agreement | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2122139,00.html | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Tran | date=2007-07-09[/tpl] Were the draft resolution to fail, observers had been speculating that fresh talks between the parties might follow.
On Monday, 16 July 2007, after many weeks of discussions at the Security Council, Russia rejected a fifth draft of a Security Council resolution based on the Ahtisaari proposals. British and European Union officials suggested on 17 July 2007 that a final draft would be presented 'within days' in an effort to secure Russian support. European Union foreign policy chief proposed new talks between Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians if this final draft failed, lasting for a period of four months and under the guidance of the Contact Group of leading nations.[tpl]cite web | title = FT.com / World - EU and US introduce Kosovo resolution | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8e12741a-347d-11dc-8c78-0000779fd2ac.html | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl]
Concerns remain that a failure to secure a resolution favourable to Kosovo Albanian opinion might lead to violence in Kosovo, including in the period up to a possible election in November 2007. Kosovo newspaper Zeri suggested, Reuters reported, that Contact Group nations might be considering an international conference on Kosovo in September in Paris.
The United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Kosovo Albanian leaders reacted by proposing unilateral independence for 28 November 2007, though the UN would be required to overrule any such action.[tpl]cite web | title = Kosovo's Ceku proposes date for independence declaration (SETimes.com) | url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/07/20/feature-01 | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl]
Recognition of any unilateral declaration of independence would likely be of central importance; though US officials have indicated that they might support such a move, European nations have argued against unilateral moves by either side. French foreign minister and former UN Kosovo chief, Bernard Kouchner, warned that a unilateral declaration would split the European Union over recognition of the independence, whilst US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack commented that, 'There is nothing to be gained by short-circuiting the diplomatic process that is under way.' Violence is feared in Kosovo should Kosovo Albanian demands for independence not be met.[tpl]cite web | title = FT.com / Home UK / UK - Kosovo move 'would split EU' | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ec139576-397d-11dc-ab48-0000779fd2ac.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl]
Despite the deadlock, the European Union has already drawn-up plans to admit the province. A 72-member European Union delegation with 200 local support staff would have a mandate to oversee implementation of the UN plan. An EU chief representative would continue to perform the same duties as the SRSG, with veto power over government decisions and the authority to fire officials found obstructing the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution.[tpl]cite web | title = EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/?extreferer_click=&aid=2368 | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | year = 2008 [/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=August 2009[/tpl][tpl]Verify source|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==History==

After the war ended, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1244 that placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorized KFOR, a NATO-led peacekeeping force.

In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo that established the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year). UNMIK oversaw the establishment of a professional, multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The unrest in 2004 was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots. This event was the motive for protests since no one was ever arrested nor personally accused in the case.  Protesting, the Kosovo Albanians mobs burned hundreds of Serbian houses, Serbian Orthodox Church sites (including some medieval churches and monasteries) and UN facilities. Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending. International prosecutors and judges handled the most sensitive cases.U.S State Department Report, published in 2007.

==After the declaration of independence==

Plans for UNMIK to hand authority over to the EULEX mission after Kosovo's constitution was approved faltered as a result of Russian opposition to Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon decided to reconfigure the mission for a temporary period. Reportedly the UN will give way to the EU mission in Albanian areas, but retain control over police in Serb-inhabited areas and set up local and district courts serving minority Serbs. The move is in response to opposition to the EU presence in North Kosovo and other Serb-dominated areas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/12/europe/EU-GEN-Kosovo-UN.php|title=Kosovo: UN to reconfigure mission to recognize 'new realities'|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl]
In December 2008, the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) assumed most of UNMIK's roles, assisting and supporting the Kosovo authorities in the rule of law area, specifically in the police, judiciary and customs areas.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund granted membership to Kosovo in July 2009. Membership with the World Bank, under the aegis of Ranjit Nayak, the World Bank Representative in Kosovo (since February 2007), has resulted in Kosovo being treated by the World Bank as its 186th member country, and no longer under the United Nations Security Council Resolution No.1244.
