It is designed to run exclusively on Mac computers, having been pre-installed on all Macs since 2002. It was the successor to Mac OS 9, released in 1999, the final release of the "classic" Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. The first version released was Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, and a desktop version, Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah" followed on March 24, 2001. Previous releases of OS X were named after big cats; for example, OS X v10.8 was referred to as "Mountain Lion". However, with the announcement of OS X Mavericks in June 2013, this was dropped in favor of Californian landmarks.[tpl]cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/os-x-mavericks/ | title=Apple Has A New, California-Based Naming Scheme For OS X, Starting With OS X Mavericks | publisher=TechCrunch | date=June 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 10, 2013 | author=Ha, Anthony[/tpl]
OS X, whose X is the Roman numeral for 10 and is a prominent part of its brand identity, is built on technologies developed at NeXT between the second half of the 1980s and Apple's purchase of the company in late 1996. The 'X' is also used to emphasize the relatedness between OS X and UNIX. Versions 10.5 "Leopard" running on Intel processors, 10.6 "Snow Leopard", 10.7 "Lion", 10.8 "Mountain Lion", and 10.9 "Mavericks" have obtained UNIX 03 certification. iOS, which runs on the iPhone, iPod Touch,[tpl]cite web| first=Karen| last= Haslam| date=January 2007| title=Macworld Expo: Optimised OS X sits on 'versatile' flash| url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=16927|publisher=IDG |work=Macworld| accessdate=January 13, 2007[/tpl] iPad, and the 2nd and 3rd generation Apple TV,[tpl]cite web| first=Chris| last=Foresman| url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/09/apple-tv-definitely-running-ios-could-be-jailbreak-target.ars| title=Apple TV definitely running iOS, could be jailbreak target| publisher=Condé Nast Digital |work=Ars Technica|accessdate=November 16, 2010|date=September 2010[/tpl] shares the Darwin core and many frameworks with OS X.

Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" was the first version of OS X to drop support for 32-bit Intel processors and run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs.
The server edition, OS X Server, was architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart, and included tools to facilitate management of workgroups of OS X machines, and to provide network services. Starting with v10.7 "Lion", OS X Server is no longer offered as a separate operating system product; instead, the server management tools are available for purchase separately, and are preinstalled on the server models of Mac Pro and Mac Mini along with OS X.

==History==

OS X is based upon the Mach kernel. Certain parts from FreeBSD's and NetBSD's implementation of Unix were incorporated in NeXTSTEP, the core of Mac OS X. NeXTSTEP was the graphical, object-oriented, and UNIX-based operating system developed by Steve Jobs' company NeXT after he left Apple in 1985.[tpl]cite web | last=Singh | first=Amit | title=Architecture of Mac OS X |url=http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx/arch.html | accessdate=April 7, 2006 | work=What is Mac OS X?[/tpl]
While Jobs was away from Apple, Apple tried to create a "next-generation" OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, with little success.[ref]

Eventually, NeXT's OS, then called OPENSTEP, was selected to be the basis for Apple's next OS, and Apple purchased NeXT outright.[ref]

Steve Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO, and later became CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first known as Rhapsody and was later renamed to Mac OS X.[ref]

Mac OS X originally ran on PowerPC-based Macs. In 2006, the first Intel Macs had a specialized version of 10.4 "Tiger". In 2007, 10.5 "Leopard" was the first to run on both PowerPC and Intel Macs with the use of Universal Binaries. 10.6 "Snow Leopard" was the first version of OS X to drop support for PowerPC Macs.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Mac OS X Server 1.x was incompatible with software designed for the original Mac OS and had no support for Apple's own IEEE 1394 (FireWire) interface. Mac OS X 10.x included more backward compatibility through Classic and more functionality by introducing the Carbon API as well as FireWire support. As the operating system evolved, it moved away from the legacy Mac OS to an emphasis on new "digital lifestyle" applications such as the iLife suite, enhanced business applications (iWork), and integrated home entertainment (the Front Row media center).[ref]

OS X is the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers. Previous Macintosh operating systems were named using Arabic numerals, e.g. Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter X in OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced "ten" [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|n[/tpl] in this context.[tpl]cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2006/03/osx-fiveyears.ars | title=Five years of Mac OS X | accessdate=April 15, 2009 | publisher=Condé Nast Digital | work=Ars Technica | date=March 24, 2006 | first=John | last=Siracusa | quote=Even Steve Jobs still says "ecks" instead of "ten" sometimes.[/tpl] However, a common mispronunciation is "X" [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00z8dnj/Click_26_02_2011/ | title=BBC Click programme | accessdate=March 20, 2011 |publisher=BBC | date=February 26, 2011 time: 00:12:45 | first=Spencer | last=Kelly | quote=Now we have dealt with this a number of times over the years. Of course X [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s[/tpl] does mean 10, but anyone who used to poke around on Unix systems will know that in those days anything Unix had an X (ˈɛks) in it, and OS Ten is written OS X (ˈɛks) in honour of the fact that it is based on Unix, unlike its predecessors. So, hey, you can say it any way you want; me, I'm showing my age and sticking with X (ˈɛks).[/tpl]
OS X's core is a POSIX compliant operating system (OS) built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is OS X.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/12/mac-os-x-lion-to-tone-down-the-aqua/ | title=Mac OS X Lion to tone down the Aqua | publisher=AOL | work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | author=Grothaus, Michael[/tpl]
OS X introduced a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, Mac OS 9. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[tpl]cite web | first=Eric Steven | last=Raymond | title=The Elements of Operating-System Style | url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch03s01.html#id2892085 | accessdate=November 5, 2008[/tpl]
Many aspects of OS X's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,
and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.
The most visible change was the Aqua theme. The use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes—similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs—brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what OS 9 and OS X Server 1.0's "Platinum" appearance had offered. According to John Siracusa, an editor of Ars Technica, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look "hit like a ton of bricks."[tpl]cite web | last=Siracusa | first=John | url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/3 | title=Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard: the Ars Technica review | publisher=Condé Nast Digital | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=October 28, 2007[/tpl]
Bruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X v10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[tpl]cite web |date=February 2000 | first=Bruce | last=Tognazzini | url=http://www.asktog.com/columns/034OSX-FirstLook.html | title=OS X: A First Look | accessdate=November 5, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=February 16, 2004 | first=Matthew Paul | last=Thomas | url=http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/02/16/os-x | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081014095216/http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2004/02/16/os-x | archivedate=October 14, 2008 |title=My first 48 hours enduring Mac OS X | accessdate=November 5, 2008[/tpl]
Third-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[tpl]cite web | title=Apple lowers boom on Aqua 'skins' | date=February 2, 2001 | url=http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/newsbursts/0,7407,2681914,00.html?chkpt=p1bn | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011031104835/http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/newsbursts/0,7407,2681914,00.html?chkpt=p1bn | archivedate=October 31, 2001 | accessdate=May 22, 2006 | work=ZDNet | publisher=CBS Interactive[/tpl]
The architecture of OS X incorporates a layered design.[tpl]cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/About/About.html |title=About the Technologies for Developing Mac OS X Software |publisher=Apple |accessdate=April 4, 2012[/tpl]
The layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[tpl]cite web  | first=Tom | last=Zepko | url=http://homepage.mac.com/tom_zepko/cocoa/why-cocoa.html | title=Why Cocoa? | accessdate=April 15, 2009 | date=November 6, 2003[/tpl]
OS X includes its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Java. For the Apple–Intel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[tpl]cite web | url=http://developer.apple.com/macosx/adoptinguniversalbinaries.html | title=Adopting Universal Binaries on Mac OS X | accessdate=December 15, 2008 | date=February 22, 2007 | publisher=Apple[/tpl] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework, retained from classic Mac OS, or using the newer Automator application.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The Darwin sub-system in Mac OS X is in charge of managing the filesystem, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions "the most common frustration" in Mac OS X, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[tpl]cite web | first=Rob | last=Griffiths | title=Prevent Mac Disasters | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/42286/2005/01/preventmacdisasters.html | work=Macworld |publisher=IDG |date=February 2005 | accessdate=February 8, 2009[/tpl] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[tpl]cite web | first=Dan | last=Frakes | title=Repairing permissions: what you need to know | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/52220/2006/08/repairpermissions.html | work=Macworld | publisher=IDG |date=August 2006 | accessdate=February 8, 2009[/tpl] He argues that OS X typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge.[tpl]cite web | first=Dan | last=Frakes | title=Five Mac maintenance myths | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133684/2008/06/maintenance_intro.html | work=Macworld |publisher=IDG |date=June 2008 | accessdate=February 8, 2009[/tpl]

===Distribution and languages===

As of September 2011, OS X is the second-most-active general-purpose client operating system in use on the World Wide Web, (after Microsoft Windows), with an 8.45% usage share according to statistics compiled by W3Counter.[tpl]cite web | url=http://w3counter.com/globalstats.php | title=Global Web Stats | date=September 2011 | accessdate=October 28, 2011 | publisher=W3Counter | work=Operating System Market Share[/tpl] It is the most successful Unix-like desktop operating system on the web, estimated at over 5 times the usage of Linux (which has 1.5%).
There are twenty-two "System Languages" available for the user at the moment of installation (the "system language" is the entire operating system environment). As of Mac OS X Lion, the languages are Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese (European), Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[tpl]cite web | title=System – New system languages. | url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#system | publisher=Apple | accessdate=June 6, 2011[/tpl]

==Compatibility==

===Software===

The APIs that OS X inherited from OpenStep are not backward compatible with earlier versions of Mac OS. These APIs were created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems and are now referred to by Apple as Cocoa. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the "NS" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for Nextstep or NeXT/Sun. The official OpenStep API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and Application Kit and the first to use the "NS" prefix.[tpl]cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/cocoafundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH3-SW12 | title=Cocoa Fundamentals Guide: A Bit of History | accessdate=December 15, 2008 | publisher=Apple Developer Connection | work=ADC Reference Library[/tpl]
Apple's Rhapsody project would have required all new development to use these APIs, causing much outcry among existing Mac developers. All Mac software that did not receive a complete rewrite to the new framework would run in the equivalent of the Classic environment. To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to (Mac) OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created. Applications written with Carbon can be executed natively on both systems. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as "Mac OS X": Mac OS X Server (now referred to as Mac OS X Server 1.x).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
OS X also used to support the Java Platform as a "preferred software package"—in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that "features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface."[tpl]cite web |url=http://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LanguageIntegration/LanguageIntegration.html | title=Introduction to Cocoa-Java Integration Guide | accessdate=April 8, 2006 | publisher=Apple Developer Connection | work=ADC Reference Library[/tpl]
Since OS X is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the *BSDs, Linux, or other Unix-like systems can be recompiled to run on it. Projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. From version 10.3 to version 10.7, OS X included X11.app, Apple's version of the X Window System graphical interface for Unix applications, as an optional component during installation.[tpl]cite web | title=X11 for Mac OS X 1.0 | date=October 28, 2003 | url=http://support.apple.com/downloads/X11_for_Mac_OS_X_1_0 | publisher=Apple | accessdate=December 15, 2008[/tpl]
Up to and including Mac OS X v10.4 (Tiger), Apple's implementation was based on the X11 Licensed XFree86 4.3 and X11R6.6. All bundled versions of X11 feature a window manager which is similar to the OS X look-and-feel and has fairly good integration with Mac OS X, also using the native Quartz rendering system. Earlier versions of OS X (in which X11 has not been bundled) can also run X11 applications using XDarwin. With the introduction of version 10.5 Apple switched to the X.org variant of X11.[tpl]cite web | url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2007/Oct/msg00065.html | title=Re: X11 in Leopard: xterm on start-up | author=Ben Byer | date=October 27, 2007 | work=Apple's x11-users mailing list | accessdate=January 18, 2008[/tpl] Version Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" uses X.org Server version 1.10.x[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OTQ5OA |title=X.Org Server 1.10.2 Brings A Bunch Of Bug-Fixes |author=Michael Larabel |date=May 28, 2011 |publisher=phoronix |accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl] Starting with OS X Mountain Lion, X11 is not bundled in OS X; instead, it has to be installed from, for example, the open source XQuartz project.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/17/apple-removes-x11-in-os-x-mountain-lion-shifts-support-to-open-source-xquartz/ | title=Apple Removes X11 in OS X Mountain Lion, Shifts Support to Open Source XQuartz | publisher=MacRumors | date=February 17, 2012 | accessdate=February 23, 2012 |last=Slivka |first=Eric[/tpl]

===Hardware===

For the early releases of Mac OS X, the standard hardware platform supported was the full line of Macintosh computers (laptop, desktop, or server) based on PowerPC G3, G4, and G5 processors. Later versions discontinued support for some older hardware; for example, Panther does not support "beige" G3s,[tpl]cite web | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=April 28, 2005 | title=Mac OS X: System Requirements | url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106163 | publisher=Apple[/tpl]
and Tiger does not support systems that pre-date Apple's introduction of integrated FireWire ports (the ports themselves are not a functional requirement). Mac OS X v10.5 "Leopard", introduced October 2007, has dropped support for all PowerPC G3 processors and for PowerPC G4 processors with clock rates below 867 MHz. Mac OS X v10.6 "Snow Leopard" supports Macs with Intel processors, not PowerPC. Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion" requires a Mac with an Intel Core 2 Duo or newer processor.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Tools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation disc have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of Mac OS X on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867 MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867 MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware (e.g. graphics acceleration, DVD writing), the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
PowerPC versions of Mac OS X prior to Leopard retain compatibility with older Mac OS applications by providing an emulation environment called Classic, which allows users to run Mac OS 9 as a process within Mac OS X, so that most older applications run as they would under the older operating system. Classic is not supported on Intel-based Macs or in Mac OS X v10.5 "Leopard", but users still requiring Classic applications on Intel Macs can use the SheepShaver emulator to run Mac OS 9 on top of Leopard.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Apple–Intel transition===

In April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[tpl]cite web | last=Rothenbourg | first=Matthew | coauthors=dePlume, Nick | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Apple/Apple-Keeps-x86-Torch-Lit-with-Marklar/ | title=Apple Keeps x86 Torch Lit with 'Marklar' | accessdate=June 8, 2013 | date=August 30, 2002 | publisher=eWeek.com[/tpl] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[tpl]cite web | last1=Clark | first1=Don |last2=Wingfield | first2=Nick | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB111680203134440188.html | title = Apple Explores Use Of Chips From Intel For Macintosh Line | date=May 23, 2005 | work=The Wall Street Journal | publisher=Dow Jones & Company | accessdate=February 8, 2009[/tpl] and CNET,[tpl]cite web | last=Kanellos | first=Michael | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1006_3-5716696.html | title=Apple to Intel: Some advantage, lots of risk | accessdate=April 28, 2006 | date=May 23, 2005 | work=CNET | publisher=CBS Interactive[/tpl] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.
On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs confirmed these rumors when he announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. The last time that Apple switched CPU families—from the Motorola 68K CPU to the IBM/Motorola PowerPC—Apple included a Motorola 68K emulator in the new OS that made almost all 68K software work automatically on the new hardware. Apple had supported the 68K emulator for 11 years, but stopped supporting it during the transition to Intel CPUs. Included in the new OS for the Intel-based Macs is Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines. Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provides support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers support building universal binaries that will run on either architecture.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html | accessdate=April 8, 2006 | title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 | publisher=Apple | date=June 6, 2005[/tpl]
PowerPC-only software is supported with Rosetta, though applications may have to be rewritten to run properly on the newer OS X for Intel. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and x86.[tpl]cite web | title=Adopting Universal Binaries | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=January 2006 | url=http://developer.apple.com/macosx/adoptinguniversalbinaries.html|publisher=Apple[/tpl] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs. Some PowerPC applications would not run on Intel OS X at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[tpl]cite web | last=Landau | first=Ted | title=OS X First Aid | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/50339/2006/04/firstaidintel.html | work=Macworld | publisher=IDG | date=May 2006 | accessdate=February 8, 2009[/tpl] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, x86, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Support for the PowerPC platform was dropped after Mac OS X 10.5. Such cross-platform capability already existed in Mac OS X's lineage; OpenStep was ported to many architectures, including x86, and Darwin included support for both PowerPC and x86. Apple stated that Mac OS X would not run on Intel-based personal computers aside from its own, but a hacked version of the OS compatible with conventional x86 hardware was developed by the OSx86 community.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
On June 8, 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Snow Leopard (version 10.6) would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[tpl]cite web | last=Stevens | first=Tim | title=Snow Leopard officially puts PowerPC Macs on endangered species list | url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/10/snow-leopard-officially-puts-powerpc-macs-on-endangered-species/ | work=Engadget |publisher=AOL | date=June 10, 2009 | accessdate=June 15, 2009[/tpl]
However, Rosetta is still available in Snow Leopard; it is not installed by default, but it is available on the installation DVD as an installable add-on and is installed automatically via the Internet when first attempting to run a PowerPC-based application.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
On all versions from (and including) Lion, Rosetta is no longer available.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Features==

One of the major differences between the previous versions of Mac OS and OS X was the addition of the Aqua GUI, a graphical user interface with water-like elements. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[tpl]cite web |url=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGPartIII/chapter_11_section_1.html | publisher=Apple | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=June 9, 2008 | work=Apple Human Interface Guidelines | title=The Aqua Interface |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081209044209/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGPartIII/chapter_11_section_1.html  | archivedate=December 9, 2008[/tpl] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[tpl]cite book | title=Learning Cocoa With Objective-C | page=6 | last=Davidson | first=James Duncan | publisher=O'Reilly | year=2002 | isbn=0-596-00301-3[/tpl] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (document modal dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Apple has continued to change aspects of the OS X appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. One example of a UI behavioral change is that previewed video and audio files no longer have progress bars in column view; instead, they have mouse-over start and stop buttons as of 10.5.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
The human interface guidelines published by Apple for Mac OS X are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[tpl]cite book | title=Programming Mac OS X: A Guide for Unix Developers | year=2003 | publisher=Manning | isbn=1-930110-85-5 | last=O'Malley | first=Kevin | page=7[/tpl] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/ | publisher=Apple | accessdate=March 2, 2011 | title=OS X.

In version 10.3, Apple added Exposé, a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[tpl]cite web | url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2503 | publisher=Apple|accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=October 31, 2008 | title=Mac 101: Exposé[/tpl] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[tpl]cite web | url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8727.html | publisher=Apple | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | title=About FileVault | work=Mac OS X 10.5 Help[/tpl]

The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[tpl]cite web | url=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SyncServices/Articles/WhySyncServices.html | publisher=Apple | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | date=October 31, 2007 | title=Why Use Sync Services? |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081012141434/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SyncServices/Articles/WhySyncServices.html  | archivedate=October 12, 2008[/tpl]
As of version 10.5, all system icons are scalable up to 512×512 pixels, to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. This version includes Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Exposé-like interface.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html | accessdate=December 16, 2008 | title=Spaces.

==Versions==

With the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until version 10.9, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named "Cheetah" internally at Apple, and version 10.1 was code named internally as "Puma". After the immense buzz surrounding version 10.2, codenamed "Jaguar", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. 10.3 was marketed as "Panther", 10.4 as "Tiger", 10.5 as "Leopard", 10.6 as "Snow Leopard", 10.7 as "Lion", 10.8 as "Mountain Lion", and 10.9 as "Mavericks". "Panther", "Tiger" and "Leopard" are registered as trademarks of Apple, but "Cheetah", "Puma" and "Jaguar" have never been registered. Apple has also registered "Lynx" and "Cougar" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.Trademark #78257226 for Panther, #78269988 for Tiger, #78270003 for Leopard, #78271630 for Cougar and #78271639 for Lynx, all registered in 2004 by Apple Computer, Inc.[tpl]cite web | title=United States Patent and Trademark Office | url=http://www.uspto.gov/index.html | accessdate=December 20, 2006[/tpl] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name "Tiger".

===Public Beta: "Kodiak"===

On September 13, 2000 Apple released a $29.95[tpl]cite web | author=John Siracusa | url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/4q00/macosx-pb1/macos-x-beta-1.html | title=Mac OS X Beta – Page 1 – (10/2000) | publisher=Condé Nast Digital | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=March 11, 2010[/tpl] "preview" version of Mac OS X (internally codenamed Kodiak) in order to gain feedback from users.
The "PB" as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Mac_OS_X_Public_Beta_Expires_Today/ | title=Mac OS X Public Beta Expires Today | News | publisher=The Mac Observer | accessdate=March 11, 2010[/tpl]

===Version 10.0: "Cheetah"===

On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X v10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).Although the version is now called Cheetah by users, rare evidences can be found to prove that it was called so internally. For instance, a Q&A was created in 2005 which mentions it.[tpl]cite web | title=Technical Q&A | url=http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2004/qa1378.html | publisher=Apple | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=October 4, 2005[/tpl]
The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Version 10.1: "Puma"===

Later that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X v10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[tpl]cite web | url=http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/29/1522209 | title=Apple Cease-And-Desists Stupidity Leak | year=2001 | publisher=Slashdot | accessdate=November 5, 2008[/tpl] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jan/07macosx.html | title=Apple Makes Mac OS X the Default Operating System on All Macs |date=January 2002 | date=January 7, 2002 | accessdate=December 3, 2006 | publisher=Apple[/tpl]

It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple
), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[tpl]cite press release | title=Apple Previews "Jaguar," the Next Major Release of Mac OS X | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/may/06jaguar.html | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=May 6, 2002 | publisher=Apple[/tpl] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.

===Version 10.3: "Panther"===

Mac OS X v10.3 "Panther" was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/oct/08panther.html | title=Apple Announces Mac OS X "Panther" | date=October 8, 2003 | accessdate=January 11, 2007 | publisher=Apple[/tpl] Support for some early G3 computers such as "beige" Power Macs and "WallStreet" PowerBooks was discontinued.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/06/01/10/apple_unveils_intel_imacs.html | title=Apple unveils Intel iMacs | publisher=AppleInsider | date=January 2006 | accessdate=December 15, 2008[/tpl] Only PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Version 10.5: "Leopard"===

===Version 10.6: "Snow Leopard"===

Mac OS X v10.6 "Snow Leopard" was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of [tpl]nowrap|Mac OS X[/tpl], Snow Leopard focused on "under the hood" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser.  Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[tpl]cite web | first=Steven | last=Lynch | url=http://www.hardocp.com/news/2008/06/11/snow_leopard_will_support_powerpcs | publisher=HardOCP | title=Mac OS X Snow Leopard Drops PowerPC Support | date=June 12, 2008 | accessdate=October 20, 2010[/tpl]

===Version 10.7: "Lion"===

Mac OS X v10.7 "Lion" was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications (Launchpad) and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incapable of running PowerPC applications.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Changes made to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) include the Launchpad (similar to the home screen of iOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies Exposé, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[tpl]cite web | title=Apple – OS X Lion - The world's most advanced desktop operating system. | url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/ | date=October 20, 2010 | accessdate=October 20, 2010 | publisher=Apple[/tpl] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed (similar to iOS).
