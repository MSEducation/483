CATEGORIES: Presidential elections in Germany, 2009 elections in Germany

An indirect presidential election was held in Germany on 23 May 2009. The President of Germany was elected by the Federal Assembly, which is made up of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of members nominated by the state Landtags.See Bundesversammlung for more details and references
The incumbent Horst Köhler (supported by CDU/CSU and FDP) stood for reelection and faced Gesine Schwan (supported by SPD and Alliance '90/The Greens).Bundespräsident Köhler will nochmals antreten (International, NZZ Online)
The Left (successor of the Party of Democratic Socialism) indicated they might be prepared to support Schwan if the SPD agreed to be open to cooperation with the Left on the federal level,http://www.n-tv.de/BundespraesidentenWahl_Linke_bieten_Tausch_an/020820082116/1003215.html but ultimately decided they would present their own candidate.http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1216918300242 The party nominated party activist and TV actor Peter Sodann on 14 October 2008; and it was left undecided whether the party would support Schwan if Sodann was eliminated after the first round of voting. 
Frank Rennicke was nominated as the joint candidate of the NPD and its sister party the DVU.
Following the Hesse state elections in January 2009, which strengthened CDU and FDP, and the Free Voters' promise to support Köhler, his reelection was seen as likely; however, CDU/CSU, FDP and Free Voters only had a slim majority in the Federal Assembly (50.16%), which made the election very competitive. In the end, Köhler was reelected in the first round of voting by 613 votes, which was exactly the minimum number of votes necessary. His nearest rival's, Social Democrat Gesine Schwan, received 503 votes making a second round unnecessary.[tpl]cite news   | title = German president wins re-election| publisher = BBC  | date = 23 May 2009  | url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm | accessdate = 23 May 2009[/tpl]  It has been seen by some as an important indicator for the federal elections in September.
