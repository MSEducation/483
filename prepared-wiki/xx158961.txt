Spring Garden is a neighborhood in central Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, bordering Center City on the north.  Spring Garden is a neighborhood that combines diverse residential neighborhoods and significant cultural attractions.  The residential areas on the north side of the neighborhood (North of Spring Garden Street) are composed mostly of brick and brownstone three-story townhouses built during the mid-to-late 19th century.  The houses include townhouses in the Italianate style, Second Empire, Queen Anne, and Venetian Gothic.  Many streets (including Green Street and Spring Garden Street) include "terraced" set ups, which include a small gardened plot, often raised, in front of the house.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.preservationalliance.com/advocacy/Historic%20District%20Manual%20pdfs/The_Spring_Garden_Historic_District.pdf |title=The Spring Garden Historic District: A Guide for Property Owners |editor-last=Spina |editor-first=Laura M. |publisher=Philadelphia Historical Commission[/tpl]  The residential areas to the south are dominated by taller, multi-family buildings built during the 20th century.

==Boundaries==

FinkelFinkel 1995:168. defines Spring Garden as "North of Benjamin Franklin Parkway to Fairmount Avenue, Broad Street to Schuylkill River." The Philadelphia Information Locator Service listPhiladelphia Information Locator Service: Philadelphia Neighborhoods and Place Names. (augmented from the Finkel 1995 list), repeats Finkel's definition of the neighborhood's boundaries. One qualification that should be added is that this definition would have Spring Garden as extending deep into Center City, nearly all the way to City Hall. The other boundary that most would agree Finkel omitted is Vine Street.
The Spring Garden Civic Association limits its purview to only the northern half of the above definition, as "between Spring Garden Street and Fairmount Avenue and between Broad Street and Pennsylvania Avenue/Fairmount Park."[tpl]cite web|title=Spring Garden Civic Association|url=http://springgardencdc.com/|accessdate=3 December 2013[/tpl] 
The neighborhood's main arterial road is Spring Garden Street, running east to west.

==History==

The neighborhood was originally part of the Northern Liberties, a township to the north of the city (which at that time was distinct from the other townships and municipalities within the County of Philadelphia).  It was originally part of a manor (named Spingettsbury Farm) established by William Penn.  During the late 1700s, the manor was split into two estates---"Bush Hill" (located to the east of 19th Street) and "The Hills" (located to the west of 19th Street).  In the early 1800s, the estates were subdivided, and from 1850 to 1876, housing was developed in alignment with the city grid that had originally been established by William Penn.
The neighborhood name is quite old, going back many decades before Philadelphia's Act of Consolidation, when the area was part of the Spring Garden District of Philadelphia County, not yet part of the city. Finkel gives 1808 as the year it first appears in the written sources that he and his contributors consulted. The Philadelphia Information Locator Service list (augmented from the Finkel 1995 list), while repeating Finkel's definition of the neighborhood's boundaries, gives 1813 as the earliest year of use.
The neighborhood was once home to significant heavy industry. Many blocks of the neighborhood were once covered by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Various Bement-related machine tool firms (William Bement & Son; Bement, Miles & Co; and then Niles-Bement-Pond) occupied the site where the Barnes Foundation museum now stands.
