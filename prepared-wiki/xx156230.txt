==History==

The Manor was built during the late 16th Century and the original name, Llys Llannerch, was changed to Llys Masi (Massey’s Court) at that time.
The Estate was owned by the Myddelton family of Chirk and their descendants from 1633 to 1909 and it was purchased by Charles William Sandles of Cheshire in 1909. He had plans to establish it as an Agricultural College, but in 1911, due to financial difficulties he had to sell it to a cotton broker (Mr R.W. Brown), from Birkenhead. Mr Brown continued to develop the farm as an Agricultural College and did so until 1919, when it was purchased by Denbighshire County Council.
The first principal was Mr Isaac Jones who was appointed in 1919 and took up office on St David's Day 1920. He was followed by Mr D.S. Edwards (1943-1967), Mr Maldwyn Fisher (1967-1983) The last principal of the college as an independent establishment was Mr Fred Cunningham (1983–2010) before it became part of the Deeside College Group on 1 August 2010.
