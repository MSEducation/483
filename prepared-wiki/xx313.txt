Chemistry, a branch of physical science, is the study of the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm |title=What is Chemistry? |publisher=Chemweb.ucc.ie |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl]Chemistry. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007. Chemistry is chiefly concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms - for example, the properties of the chemical bonds formed between atoms to create chemical compounds. As well as this, interactions including atoms and other phenomena - electrons and various forms of energy—are considered, such as photochemical reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, changes in phases of matter, and separation of mixtures. Finally, properties of matter such as alloys or polymers are considered.
Chemistry is sometimes called "the central science" because it bridges other natural sciences like physics, geology and biology with each other.Theodore L. Brown, H. Eugene Lemay, Bruce Edward Bursten, H. Lemay. Chemistry: The Central Science. Prentice Hall; 8 edition (1999). ISBN 0-13-010310-1. Pages 3–4.Chemistry is seen as occupying an intermediate position in a hierarchy of the sciences by "reductive level" between physics and biology. See Carsten Reinhardt. Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries. Wiley-VCH, 2001. ISBN 3-527-30271-9. Pages 1–2. Chemistry is a branch of physical science but distinct from physics.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01801556[/tpl]
The etymology of the word chemistry has been much disputed.See: Chemistry (etymology) for possible origins of this word. The origin of chemistry can be traced to certain practices, known as alchemy, which had been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world, particularly the Middle East.http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-04

==Etymology==

The word chemistry comes from the word alchemy, an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alchemylab.com/history_of_alchemy.htm |title=History of Alchemy |publisher=Alchemy Lab |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl] Alchemy, which was practiced around 330, is the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies (Zosimos).Strathern, P. (2000). Mendeleyev's Dream – the Quest for the Elements. New York: Berkley Books. An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix "-ry" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as "chemistry".
The word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الکیمیاء).  In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία."alchemy", entry in The Oxford English Dictionary, J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1989, ISBN 0-19-861213-3.p. 854, "Arabic alchemy", Georges C. Anawati, pp. 853–885 in Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science, eds. Roshdi Rashed and Régis Morelon, London: Routledge, 1996, vol. 3, ISBN 0-415-12412-3. This may have  Egyptian origins. Many believe that al-kīmīā is derived from the Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Chemi or Kimi, which is the ancient name of Egypt in Egyptian. Alternately, al-kīmīā may be derived from χημεία, meaning "cast together".Weekley, Ernest (1967). Etymological Dictionary of Modern English. New York: Dover Publications. ISBN 0-486-21873-2

===Definition===

In retrospect, the definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science. The term "chymistry", in the view of noted scientist Robert Boyle in 1661, meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies.[tpl]Cite book| last=Boyle | first = Robert |title=The Sceptical Chymist|location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. (reprint)|year=1661|isbn=0-486-42825-7[/tpl] In 1663, "chymistry" meant a scientific art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the different substances on their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to a higher perfection - this definition was used by chemist Christopher Glaser.[ref][tpl]Cite book| last=Glaser | first = Christopher |title=Traite de la chymie|location=Paris | year=1663[/tpl] as found in: [tpl]Cite book| last = Kim | first = Mi Gyung | title = Affinity, That Elusive Dream - A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-262-11273-6[/tpl]

The 1730 definition of the word "chemistry", as used by Georg Ernst Stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.[tpl]Cite book| last=Stahl | first = George, E. |title=Philosophical Principles of Universal Chemistry|location=London | year=1730[/tpl] In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered the word "chemistry" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.Dumas, J. B. (1837). 'Affinite' (lecture notes), vii, pg 4. "Statique chimique", Paris: Academie des Sciences This definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances - a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling.[tpl]Cite book| last = Pauling | first = Linus | title = General Chemistry | publisher = Dover Publications, Inc. | year = 1947 | isbn = 0-486-65622-5[/tpl] More recently, in 1998, the definition of "chemistry" was broadened to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes, as phrased by Professor Raymond Chang.[tpl]Cite book|author=Chang, Raymond |title=Chemistry, 6th Ed.|location=New York | publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1998|isbn=0-07-115221-0[/tpl]

==History==

Early civilizations, such as the EgyptiansFirst chemists, February 13, 1999, New Scientist and Babylonians amassed practical knowledge concerning the arts of metallurgy, pottery and dyes, but didn't develop a systematic theory.
A basic chemical hypothesis first emerged in Classical Greece with the theory of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything is formed as a combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The Nature of Things).[tpl]cite web|last=Lucretius|title=de Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things)|work=The Internet Classics Archive|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=50 BCE|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html|accessdate=2007-01-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Simpson|first=David|title=Lucretius (c. 99 - c. 55 BCE)|work=The Internet History of Philosophy|date=29 June 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/lucretiu.htm|accessdate= 2007-01-09[/tpl] Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.[tpl]cite book|last=Strodach|first=George K.|title=The Art of Happiness|year=2012|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=0-14-310721-6|pages=7–8|location=New York[/tpl]
In the Hellenistic world the art of alchemy first proliferated, mingling magic and occultism into the study of natural substances with the ultimate goal of transmuting elements into gold and discovering the elixir of eternal life.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.laboratory-journal.com/science/chemistry-physics/international-year-chemistry-history-chemistry | title=International Year of Chemistry - The History of Chemistry|publisher=G.I.T.

===Chemistry as science===

Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline. Boyle in particular is regarded as the founding father of chemistry due to his most important work, the classic chemistry text The Sceptical Chymist where the differentiation is made between the claims of alchemy and the empirical scientific discoveries of the new chemistry."Robert Boyle, Founder of Modern Chemistry" Harry Sootin (2011) He formulated Boyle's law, rejected the classical "four elements" and proposed a mechanistic alternative of atoms and chemical reactions that could be subject to rigorous experiment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/boyle_robert.shtml |title=History - Robert Boyle (1627–1691) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl]
The theory of phlogiston (a substance at the root of all combustion) was propounded by the German Georg Ernst Stahl in the early 18th century and was only overturned by the end of the century by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the chemical analogue of Newton in physics; who did more than any other to establish the new science on proper theoretical footing, by elucidating the principle of conservation of mass and developing a new system of chemical nomenclature used to this day.[tpl]Cite book|title = Affinity, that Elusive Dream: A Genealogy of the Chemical Revolution | author = Mi Gyung Kim | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2003 |page = 440|isbn = 0-262-11273-6[/tpl]
Prior to his work, though, many important discoveries had been made, specifically relating to the nature of 'air' which was discovered to be composed of many different gases. The Scottish chemist Joseph Black (the first experimental chemist) and the Dutchman J. B. van Helmont discovered carbon dioxide, or what Black called 'fixed air' in 1754; Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen and elucidated its properties and Joseph Priestley and, independently, Carl Wilhelm Scheele isolated pure oxygen.
English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.
The development of the electrochemical theory of chemical combinations occurred in the early 19th century as the result of the work of two scientists in particular, J. J. Berzelius and Humphry Davy, made possible by the prior invention of the voltaic pile by Alessandro Volta. Davy discovered nine new elements including the alkali metals by extracting them from their oxides with electric current.[tpl]cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new Phenomena of Chemical Changes produced by Electricity, particularly the Decomposition of the fixed Alkalies, and the Exhibition of the new Substances, which constitute their Bases|pages=1–45|issue=0|year=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kg9GAAAAMAAJ|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001|publisher=Royal Society of London.[/tpl]
British William Prout first proposed ordering all the elements by their atomic weight as all atoms had a weight that was an exact multiple of the atomic weight of hydrogen. J. A. R. Newlands devised an early table of elements, which was then developed into the modern periodic table of elements by the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian Dmitri Mendeleev in the 1860s.Timeline of Element Discovery - About.com The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.
Organic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, reducible to chemistry.[tpl]Cite book| title = The Development of Modern Chemistry | author = Ihde, Aaron John | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1984 | page = 164 | isbn = 0-486-64235-6[/tpl] Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) and the application of thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).
