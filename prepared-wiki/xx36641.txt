===Australian Federal Convention and Referendum===

In 1897, Edmund Barton topped the poll of the delegates elected from New South Wales to the Constitutional Convention, which developed a constitution for the proposed federation. Although Sir Samuel Griffith wrote most of the text of the Constitution, Barton was the political leader who carried it through the Convention.
In May 1897, Barton was appointed for the second time to the Legislative Council on Reid's recommendations to take charge of the federation bill in the Upper House. This gave Reid's Attorney-General, John Henry Want, a free hand to oppose the bill. In September 1897, the convention met in Sydney to consider 286 proposed amendments from the colonies. It finalised its draft constitution in March 1898 and Barton went back to New South Wales to lead the campaign for a yes vote in the June referendum. Although it gained majority support, it achieved only 71,595; 80,000 was the minimum number for it to pass.
In July 1898 Barton resigned from the Upper House to stand against Reid for election to the Legislative Assembly, but narrowly lost. In September, he won a by-election for Hastings and Macleay and was immediately elected leader of the opposition, which consisted of a mixture of pro-federation and anti-federation protectionists. In January 1899 Reid gained significant concessions from the other states and he joined Barton in campaigning for the second referendum in June 1899, with Barton campaigning all over the state. It passed 107,420 votes to 82,741.
In August 1899 when it became clear that the Labour Party could be maneuvered into bringing down the Reid Government, Barton resigned as leader of the opposition, as he was unacceptable to Labour, and William Lyne took his place. He refused an offer to become Attorney-General again. He resigned from Parliament in February 1900 so that he could travel to London with Alfred Deakin and Charles Kingston to explain the federation bill to the British Government. The British Government was adamant in its opposition to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council as incorporated in the draft constitution; eventually, Barton agreed that constitutional (inter se) matters would be finalised in the High Court, but other matters could be appealed to the Privy Council.

==First Prime Minister==

Few people doubted that Barton, as the leading federalist in the oldest state, deserved to be the first Prime Minister of the new federation. However, since no federal Parliament had yet been established, the usual convention of appointing the leader of the largest party in the lower house could not apply. The newly arrived Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, instead invited Sir William Lyne, the premier of New South Wales, to form a government.
Hopetoun's decision, known as the Hopetoun Blunder, can be defended on grounds that Lyne had seniority. Still, Lyne's long massive opposition to federation until he changed his mind at the last minute caused him to be unacceptable to prominent federalists such as Deakin, who refused to serve under him. After tense negotiations, Barton was appointed Prime Minister and he and his ministry were sworn in on 1 January 1901.
Barton's government consisted of himself as Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Alfred Deakin as Attorney-General, Sir William Lyne as Minister for Home Affairs, Sir George Turner as Treasurer, Charles Kingston as Minister for Trade and Customs, Sir James Dickson as Minister for Defence, and Sir John Forrest as Postmaster-General. Richard O'Connor was made Vice-President of the Executive Council and Elliott Lewis was appointed Minister without Portfolio. Only ten days into the life of the government, Sir James Dickson died suddenly; he was replaced on 17 January as Minister for Defence by John Forrest, and James Drake was brought into the ministry as Postmaster-General on 5 February.
The main task of Barton's ministry was to organise the conduct of the first federal elections, which were held in March 1901. Barton was elected unopposed to the seat of Hunter in the new Parliament (although he never lived in that electorate) and his Protectionist Party won enough seats to form a government with the support of the Labour Party. All his ministers were elected, except for Elliott Lewis, who did not stand for election and was replaced by Sir Philip Fysh.
An early piece of legislation of the Barton government was the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which put the White Australia policy into law. The Labour Party required legislation to limit immigration from Asia as part of its agreement to support the government, but Barton had promised the introduction of the White Australia Policy in his election campaign. Barton stated, "The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman". One notable reform was the introduction of women's suffrage for federal elections in 1902.[ref]

Barton was a moderate conservative, and advanced liberals in his party disliked his relaxed attitude to political life. A large, handsome, jovial man, he was fond of long dinners and good wine and was given the nickname "Toby Tosspot" by the Bulletin.[ref]

For much of 1902, Barton was in England for the coronation of King Edward VII. This trip was also used to negotiate the replacement of the naval agreements between the Australian colonies and the United Kingdom (under which Australia funded Royal Navy protection from foreign naval threats) by an agreement between the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom. Deakin disliked this arrangement and discontinued it, moving for a substantial expansion of Australia's own navy in 1908.[ref]

In September 1903, Sir Edmund Barton left Parliament to become one of the founding justices of the High Court of Australia. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by Deakin on 24 September.

==Judicial career==

Barton was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Richard O'Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. Barton was also one of six justices to have served in the Parliament of New South Wales, along with O'Connor, Albert Piddington, Adrian Knox, McTiernan, and H. V. Evatt.
On the bench Sir Edmund was considered a good and "scrupulously impartial" judge and adopted the same position of moderate conservatism he had taken in politics. Along with his colleagues Griffith and O'Connor, he attempted to preserve the autonomy of the States and developed a doctrine of "implied immunity of instrumentalities", which prevented the States from taxing Commonwealth officers, and also prevented the Commonwealth from arbitrating industrial disputes in the States' railways. They also narrowly interpreted the Federal Government's powers in commercial and industrial matters.
After 1906, Sir Edmund increasingly clashed with Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins, the two advanced liberals appointed to the court by Deakin. Like Sir Samuel Griffith, Barton was several times consulted by Governors-General of Australia on the exercise of the reserve powers.Donald Markwell, "Griffith, Barton and the early governor-generals: aspects of Australia's constitutional development", Public Law Review, 1999. In 1919, although ill, he was extremely disappointed to be passed over for the position of Chief Justice on the retirement of Griffith.Markwell, "Griffith, Barton and the early governor-generals", Public Law Review, 1999.

==Death and family==

Sir Edmund Barton died from heart failure at the Hydro Majestic Hotel, Medlow Bath, New South Wales. He was interred in South Head General Cemetery in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse (see Waverley Cemetery). He was survived by his wife and six children:

==Honours==

Barton refused knighthoods in 1887, 1891 and 1899, but agreed to be made a Knight Grand Cross of St Michael and St George in 1902. (He was the only prime minister to be knighted during his term of office until Robert Menzies in 1963; various others were knighted after leaving the office; Sir Earle Page was already a knight when he briefly became prime minister in 1939.) He received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1900.
In 1905, the Japanese government conferred the Grand Cordon, Order of the Rising Sun, and Sir Edmund was granted permission to retain and wear the insignia. The honour was presented in acknowledgement of his personal role in resolving a conflict concerning the Commonwealth's Pacific Island Labourers Act and the Queensland protocol to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty.
In 1951 and again in 1969, Sir Edmund was honoured on postage stamps bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.[tpl]cite web| title=Stamp|url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0006080.jpg |publisher=Australian Stamp and Coin Company |accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Stamp |publisher=Australian Stamp and Coin Company |url=http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0009190.jpg |accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]
The Barton Highway in Australia, connecting the Hume Freeway to the Australian capital, Canberra, was named after Sir Edmund. The Division of Barton in New South Wales is named after him, as is Barton, Australian Capital Territory, a suburb of Canberra close to Capital Hill which is the location of many government departments and national institutions, and the headquarters of Australia's main political parties. The Edmund Barton Building is a government office building in that suburb.

==Attributed Immigration Speech==

In the 21st Century an internet meme developed which wrongly attributed a speech on immigration to Barton. The quotation, which spread by email and social networks, includes a photograph of Barton and an extract from a speech which argues for equal treatment of immigrants conditional on their cultural assimilation, the loyalty to the Flag of Australia and the exclusive adoption of the English language in Australia. The quote is attributed  to "Sir Edmund Barton, Australia's first Prime Minister" and dated 1907, four years after Barton left governmental office.[tpl]cite web|title=Immigration Quote Wrongly Attributed to Sir Edmund Barton|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/edmund-barton-immigration-quote.shtml|publisher=Hoax-Slayer|accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl] The words originate in fact from a letter written on 3 January 1913 by Theodore Roosevelt to the American Defense Society which argues for the ideals of American nationalism. It was first quoted in the New York Times the day after Roosevelt's death.
