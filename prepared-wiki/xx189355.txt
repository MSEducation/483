The Hispano HA-100 Triana (named for the district of Seville where the Hispano Aviación plant was located) was a military trainer aircraft developed in Spain in the 1950s. The first aircraft designed by Willy Messerschmitt after World War II, it was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tricycle undercarriage. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem.
The programme was initiated when the Spanish government issued a requirement in 1951 for a replacement for the Hispano HS-42s and HA-43s then in service. Hispano proposed two versions with different engine power, the HA-100E and HA-100F, the former for basic training, the latter for advanced training, and the construction of two prototypes of each was undertaken. Development was fraught with problems, mostly in obtaining suitable parts, and most particularly with engines. The ENMASA Sirio was originally selected for the HA-100E, but when this proved unavailable, the ENMASA Beta was used instead, a heavier and  much more powerful engine than had been wanted for the basic trainer. As it transpired, the performance of this engine was far from satisfactory, and when the second prototype flew in February 1955 (the first HA-100F), it was powered by a Wright R-1300.
Flight testing was very positive, and the HA-100 performed well in comparative tests against the American T-28 Trojan, leading to a contract for 40 of the aircraft. However, obtaining engines remained a stumbling block, with Spain unable to afford to import the Wright engine in quantity. Eventually, production ground to a halt, and the decision was taken to scrap the airframes under construction, salvaging only the wings and empennages for use on the HA-200 project.
