==Biography==

Hederman comes from Ballingarry, the second son in a family of four. Of Glenstal, he said in 2009, "I came here as a boy to school when I was twelve years of age, and apart from about ten years of my life spent in Africa, America and other parts of Europe, I have never lived anywhere else. ... It only existed as a monastery thirty years before I arrived.""Jung Bytes", interview by Lauren Yanks with M.P. Hederman, New York Center for Jungian Studies, November, 2008. Retrieved 2011-04-11.

The election as fifth Abbot of Glenstal by the community of Benedictine monks, to an eight year term, "came as a shock to those who knew him and his work because of the maverick figure that he is in the Irish Church.""Mark Patrick Hederman", introduction to Would you believe show, RTÉ One, c. 2009. Retrieved 2011-03-22. Also, at 64, Hederman was the oldest to be chosen for the position since the monastery became an Abbey in the 1950s.  
In a piece published in early 2011, Abbot Hederman was quoted by novelist and writer Russell Shorto speaking about the sexual-abuse scandals in the Irish Catholic Church.Shorto, Russell, "The Irish Affliction", The New York Times Magazine, February 9, 2011 (February 13, 2011 p. MM42). "Ireland is a prime example of what the church is facing, because they made this island Ireland into a concentration camp where they could control everything. ... And the control was really all about sex. They told you if you masturbated, it meant you were impure and had allowed the devil to work on you. Generations of people were crucified with guilt complexes. Now the game is up. ... Ireland was meant to be the purest country that ever existed, upholding the Catholic ideal of no sex except in marriage and then only for procreation. And the priest was to be the purest of the pure. It’s not difficult to understand how the whole system became riddled with what we now call a scandal but in fact was a complete culture. Because you had people with no understanding of their sexuality, of what sexuality even was, and they were in complete power." Retrieved 2011-02-15.
