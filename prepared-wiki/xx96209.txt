[[Canadian federal election, 1949]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian federal elections by year, 1949 elections in Canada

The Canadian federal election of 1949 was held on June 27 to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 21st Parliament of Canada.  It was the first election in Canada in almost thirty years in which the Liberal Party of Canada was not led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. King had retired in 1948, and was replaced as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by Louis St. Laurent.  It was also the first federal election with Newfoundland voting, having joined Canada in March of that year. The Liberal Party was re-elected with its fourth consecutive majority government, winning just under 50% of the vote. This victory was the third largest majority government in Canadian History.
The Progressive Conservative Party, led by former Premier of Ontario George Drew, gained little ground in this election.
Smaller parties, such as the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Social Credit, a party that advocated monetary reform, lost support to the Liberals, and to a lesser extent, the Conservatives.
Voter turn-out: 73.8%
