Gears, formerly Google Gears,[tpl]cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/happy-birthday-google-gears.html|title=Happy birthday, Google Gears!|date=2008-05-28|publisher=Official Google Blog|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] was software offered by Google that "enables more powerful web applications, by adding new features to the web browser. It allows some online files to be used offline".[tpl]cite web|url=http://gears.google.com/|title=Gears|accessdate=2008-09-01[/tpl] Released under the BSD license,[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/gears/|title=Google Code project for Gears|accessdate=2008-02-26[/tpl] Gears is free and open source software.
In late November 2009, numerous online news sources reported that Google was going to migrate to Web Storage rather than use Gears in the future. A Google spokesman later clarified that Google would, however, continue to support Gears so as not to break sites using it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/11/google-gears.html|title=What's powering Web apps: Google waving goodbye to Gears, hello to HTML5 |date=2009-11-30|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-12-02[/tpl] On 22 November 2011, Google announced that on 1 December 2011, Gears support would be removed from Gmail and Google Calendar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-spring-cleaning-out-of-season.html |title=Official Blog: More spring cleaning out of season |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl]  Gears was removed from Google Chrome stable on June 7, 2011.[tpl]cite web | url=http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2011/06/chrome-stable-release.html | title=Chrome Stable Release[/tpl]

==Components==

There are several major API components to Gears:

==Version history==

==Support==

Several web applications from a variety of companies have used Gears at some point, including Google (Gmail, YouTube, Docs, Reader, Picasa for mobile, Calendar, Wave), MySpace (Mail Search), Zoho (Writer, Mail), Remember The Milk, and Buxfer. WordPress 2.6 added support for Gears, to speed up the administrative interface and reduce server hits.[tpl]cite web | url=http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6965 | title=WordPress Trac ticket - Gears Support[/tpl] However, after Google announced in February 2010 that there would be no further development of Gears (see End of life section), several of these applications have discontinued their support for Gears, including Google Reader[tpl]cite web | url=http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2010/05/spring-cleaning-comments-offline-and.html | title=Google Reader blog - end of offline support[/tpl] and WordPress[tpl]cite web | url=http://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Tools_SubPanel | title=WordPress documentation - Tools Subpanel[/tpl]
Gears can be enabled on sites where it is otherwise unsupported, by using a Greasemonkey user script one of the Gears engineers has created.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/apis/gears/articles/gearsmonkey.html|title=Gearsmonkey: Gears + Greasemonkey|accessdate=2009-08-13[/tpl]
Gears is supported on Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows XP, Vista and Seven, Internet Explorer Mobile 4.01 and later on Windows Mobile, Safari 3.1.1 and later on Mac OS X 10.4 and later (though not with Safari 4 on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard; with no sign of a fix anytime soon), and Firefox 1.5 and later on multiple platforms.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] There is only limited 64 bit support from third parties.
Gears does not support attachment files with sizes greater than 2 GB under Mac OS X Leopard or Snow Leopard currently due to a bug in the Blob handling code.[tpl]cite web|author=Reported by ben.roe...@gmail.com, Oct 21, 2009 |url=http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=960&q=snow%20leopard&colspec=Version%20Milestone%20Owner%20ID%20Summary%20Component |title=Issue 960 - gears - Appears to be a 2Gbyte limit on blob upload on Mac OS X Leopard - Improving Your Web Browser - Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/gears/issues/detail?id=958&q=snow%20leopard&colspec=Version%20Milestone%20Owner%20ID%20Summary%20Component |title=Issue 958 - gears - Appears to be a 2Gbyte limit on blob upload on Mac OS X Snow Leopard - Improving Your Web Browser - Google Project Hosting |publisher=Code.google.com |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl]
On May 29, 2008, Opera Software ASA announced that Opera Mobile 9.5 would support Gears.
The technology preview release of the browser was published on February 20, 2009.
It is currently available for touch-screen devices on Windows Mobile 5 & 6 only. Gears is not built into browsers other than Google Chrome and must be downloaded separately.
The Ruby on Rails framework supports interfaces to Gears without needing to understand the Google Gears API.

==End of life==

On February 19, 2010, the Gears team at Google announced that the development of Google Gears had stopped, as they are working on bringing all of the Gears capabilities into web standards like HTML5. Although development of new features has ceased, Google is planning to continue supporting Gears until they have developed a "simple, comprehensive" method for users' data to be migrated to HTML5 features.[tpl]cite web | url=http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html | title=Hello HTML5[/tpl] Google Gears was removed from the Google Chrome stable on June 7, 2011.
