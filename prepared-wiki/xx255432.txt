A number of the dwellings where originally occupied by mine management.
In 1914, the mine employed 93 people; four years later it employed 287.
In July 1943, a large fire caused the mine to close for 12 months.
The mine was closed in November 1961.  The coal holding lease is still retained by Coal and Allied Limited.
In 2009, a Chinese owned mining company, Austar, was granted approval to construct a surface infrastructure site just south of Kitchener. This facility was built to service the company's Longwall Top Coal Caving mining of the Greta Coal Seam (in the mine previously known as the Southland Coal Mine) south of Kitchener
