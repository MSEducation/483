Even though he retired from Pro Mountain biking in 1996, he continued competing in endurance competitions like the XTERRA Triathlon, and regular road triathlons. While in professional mountain biking, Overend earned the nicknames "Deadly Nedly" and "The Lung", because he was very difficult to beat and for his phenonomenal aerobic endurance at altitude (especially so for a man of his age), respectively. He is the current captain of the Specialized Cross Country Team.
