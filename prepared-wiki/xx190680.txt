Dark Red is a fantasy-based plot-driven webcomic. It is produced using photographs of actors and actresses which are then processed using a variety of photoshop techniques. Although the comic is available on the web, it draws strongly from paper comics in its execution, in particular in the way it is separated into issues and pages. It is updated on a weekly basis, with one page being placed on the website each Friday.
Dark Red was nominated for "Most Outstanding Photographic Comic" in the 2008 Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards.WCCA nominations 2008
