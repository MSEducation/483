[[1917 Pulitzer Prize]]

CATEGORIES: Pulitzer Prizes, 1917 in the United States, 1917 awards

The 1917 Pulitzer Prizes were the very first to be presented. There were only four categories - the others that had been specified in Joseph Pulitzer's bequest were phased in over the next few years.  The winners were selected by the Columbia University trustees. The first prize winner received $2000.  That award was given to French Ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand, who wrote the best book about American history.  Herbert Bayard Swope won a $1000 prize for reporting.[tpl]cite news|title=Columbia Awards Pulitzer Prizes|publisher=New York Times|date=9 June 1917|page=10[/tpl]
