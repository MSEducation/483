Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), also known as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), is a glycoprotein enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland. PSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely.[tpl]cite journal | author = Balk SP, Ko YJ, Bubley GJ | title = Biology of prostate-specific antigen | journal = J.

PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate disorders.[tpl]cite pmid|7512659[/tpl]  The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2012) does not recommend PSA screening, noting that the test may result in “overdiagnosis” and “overtreatment” because "most prostate cancer is asymptomatic for life," and treatments involve risks of complications including impotence (erectile dysfunction) and incontinence.  The USPSTF concludes "the potential benefit does not outweigh the expected harms."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatecancerscript.pdf |title=Talking With Your Patients About Screening for Prostate Cancer |format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl] PSA is not a unique indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Velonas VM, Woo HH, Remedios CG, Assinder SJ | title = Current status of biomarkers for prostate cancer | journal = Int J Mol Sci | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 11034–60 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23708103 | pmc = 3709717 | doi = 10.3390/ijms140611034 [/tpl] Only 30 percent of patients with high PSA have prostate cancer diagnosed after biopsy.

===Prostate cancer===

====Screening====

Clinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial due to uncertainty as to whether the benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and over treatment.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gomella LG, Liu XS, Trabulsi EJ, Kelly WK, Myers R, Showalter T, Dicker A, Wender R | title = Screening for prostate cancer: the current evidence and guidelines controversy | journal = Can J Urol | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 5875–83 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 22018148 | doi = [/tpl]  In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient needs to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test (see below). PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain tissue sample for histopathological analysis.  In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (2005) does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor's advice.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4175856.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doctors warn on ad hoc screening | date=2005-08-23[/tpl]
A review commissioned by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that "Prostate-specific antigen-based screening results in small or no reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality and is associated with harms related to subsequent evaluation and treatments, some of which may be unnecessary," or more simply, "the potential benefit does not outweigh the expected harms" in patients not already diagnosed or being treated for prostate cancer.
While PSA testing may help 1 in 1,000 avoid death due to prostate cancer, 4 to 5 in 1,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests.  Of those found to have prostate cancer, frequent overdiagnosis is common because most cases of prostate cancer are not expected to cause any symptoms.  Men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) elect to receive treatment.  Therefore many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1,000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, 1 will suffer pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and 1 perioperative death.

====Risk stratification and staging====

Men with localized (non-metastatic) prostate cancer may be characterized as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for prostate cancer mortality. PSA level is one of three variables on which the risk-stratification is based; the others are the grade of prostate cancer (Gleason grading system) and the stage of cancer based on physical examination and imaging studies. Criteria for each risk category are as follows:
Researchers are working to identify more accurate prognostic variables for risk-stratification of prostate cancer.

====Post-treatment monitoring====

PSA levels are monitored periodically (e.g., every 6–36 months) after treatment for prostate cancer - more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy (i.e., radical prostatectomy) is successful at removing all prostate tissue (and prostate cancer), PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.2 ng/dL[tpl]Disputed-inline|Post-treatment_monitoring:_no_references._Incorrect_units.3F|date=February 2014|reason=Should units be ng/mL?[/tpl] is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign prostate tissue.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Following radiation therapy of any type for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This makes it more difficult to interpret the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy. PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level is referred to as the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0 ng/dL[tpl]Disputed-inline|Post-treatment_monitoring:_no_references._Incorrect_units.3F|date=February 2014|reason=Should units be ng/mL?[/tpl] above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
If recurrent prostate cancer is detected by a rise in PSA levels after curative treatment, it is referred to as a "biochemical recurrence". The likelihood of developing recurrent prostate cancer after curative treatment is correlated to various risk factors, such as the grade of prostate cancer (Gleason score), PSA level prior to treatment, and the stage of disease prior to treatment. Low-risk cancers the preceding section are the least likely to recur, but they are also the least likely to have required treatment in the first place.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

====Histology====

PSA is produced in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using immunohistochemistry. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and is the cause of elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.[tpl]cite book|author=Leong, Anthony S-Y|author2=Cooper, Kumarason|author3=Leong, F Joel W-M|year=2003|title=Manual of Diagnostic Cytology|edition=2|publisher=Greenwich Medical Media, Ltd.|pages=79–80|isbn=1-84110-100-1[/tpl]
More significantly, PSA remains present in prostate cells after they become malignant. Prostate cancer cells generally have variable or weak staining for PSA, due to the disruption of their normal functioning. Thus, individual prostate cancer cells produce less PSA than healthy cells; the raised serum levels in prostate cancer patients is due to the greatly increased number of such cells, not their individual activity. However, in most cases of prostate cancer, the cells remain positive for the antigen, which can therefore be used to identify metastasis. Since some high-grade prostate cancers may be entirely negative for PSA, however, histological analysis to identify such cases usually uses PSA in combination with other antibodies, such as PSAP and CD57.

===Forensic identification of semen===

PSA was first identified by researchers attempting to find a substance in seminal fluid that would aid in the investigation of rape cases.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Hara M, Inorre T, Fukuyama T. |title=Some physicochemical characteristics of gamma-seminoprotein, an antigenic component specific for human seminal plasma |journal= Jpn J Legal Med. |year=1971 |volume=25 |pages=322–324[/tpl] PSA is now used to indicate the presence of semen in forensic serology.[tpl]Cite news | last = Bill O.

Because PSA is a biomarker that is expressed independently of spermatozoa, it remains useful in identifying semen from vasectomized and azoospermic males.[tpl]cite journal | author = M. Hochmeister, O. Rudin, U.V.Borer, A. Kratzer, Ch. Gehrig and R. Dirnhofer | title = Evaluation of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Membrane Tests for the Forensic Identification of Semen | publisher = Eighth International Symposium on Human Identification | year = 1997 | url = http://www.promega.com/geneticidproc/ussymp8proc/33.html | accessdate = 2008-05-11[/tpl]
PSA can also be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum threshold of interpretation to rule out false positive results and conclusively state that semen is present. While traditional tests such as crossover electrophoresis have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical prostate cancer screening methods have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4 ng/mL.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Manfred N. Hochmeister, Bruce Budowle, Oskar Rudin, Christian Gehrig, Urs Borer, Michael Thali, and Richard Dirnhofer |title=Evaluation of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Membrane Test Assays for the Forensic Identification of Seminal Fluid |journal= Journal of Forensic Science |year=1999 |volume=44 |pages=1057–60 |url= http://projects.nfstc.org/workshops/resources/articles/Evaluation%20of%20prostate-specific%20antigen%20(PSA)%20membrane%20test%20assays%20for%20the%20forensic%20identification%20of%20seminal%20fluid.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-05-11[/tpl] This level of antigen has been shown to be present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk. No studies have been performed to assess the PSA levels in the tissues and secretions of pre-pubescent children. Therefore, the presence of PSA from a high sensitivity (4 ng/mL) test cannot conclusively identify the presence of semen, so care must be taken with the interpretation of such results.

==Mechanism of action==

The physiological function of KLK3 is the dissolution of the coagulum, the sperm entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate it is present as an inactive pro-form which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are ten times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive. Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well regulated manner.

==Biochemistry==

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA, also known as kallikrein III, seminin, semenogelase, γ-seminoprotein and P-30 antigen) is a 34 kD glycoprotein produced almost exclusively by the prostate gland. It is a serine protease ([tpl]EC number|3.4.21.77[/tpl]) enzyme, the gene of which is located on the nineteenth chromosome (19q13) in humans.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lilja H | title = Biology of prostate-specific antigen | journal = Urology | volume = 62 | issue = 5 Suppl 1 | pages = 27–33 |date=November 2003 | pmid = 14607215 | doi = 10.1016/S0090-4295(03)00775-1 | url =   [/tpl]

==History==

The discovery of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is beset with controversy; as PSA is present in prostatic tissue and semen, it was independently discovered and given different names, thus adding to the controversy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rao AR, Motiwala HG, Karim OM | title = The discovery of prostate-specific antigen | journal = BJU Int. | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–10 |date=January 2008 | pmid = 17760888 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07138.x | url =  [/tpl]

In 1971, Hara characterized a unique protein in the semen fluid, gamma-seminoprotein. Li and Beling, in 1973, isolated a protein, E1, from human semen in an attempt to find a novel method to achieve fertility control.[tpl]cite journal | author = Li TS, Beling CG | title = Isolation and characterization of two specific antigens of human seminal plasma | journal = Fertil.

In 1978, Sensabaugh identified semen-specific protein p30, but proved that it was similar to E1 protein, and that prostate was the source.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sensabaugh GF | title = Isolation and characterization of a semen-specific protein from human seminal plasma: a potential new marker for semen identification | journal = J.

PSA was first measured quantitatively in the blood by Papsidero in 1980,[tpl]cite journal|last=Kuriyama|first=M|coauthors=Wang, MC, Papsidero, LD, Killian, CS, Shimano, T, Valenzuela, L, Nishiura, T, Murphy, GP, Chu, TM|title=Quantitation of prostate-specific antigen in serum by a sensitive enzyme immunoassay.|journal=Cancer Research|date=December 1980|year=1980|volume=40|issue=12|pages=4658–62|pmid=6159971[/tpl] and Stamey carried out the initial work on the clinical use of PSA as a marker of prostate cancer.

==Serum levels==

PSA is normally present in the blood at very low levels. The reference range of less than 4 ng/mL for the first commercial PSA test, the Hybritech Tandem-R PSA test released in February 1986, was based on a study that found 99% of 472 apparently healthy men had a total PSA level below 4 ng/mL—the upper limit of normal is much less than 4 ng/mL.

Increased levels of PSA may suggest the presence of prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer can also be present in the complete absence of an elevated PSA level, in which case the test result would be a false negative.[tpl]cite journal | author = Thompson I, Pauler D, Goodman P, Tangen C, Lucia M, Parnes H, Minasian L, Ford L, Lippman S, Crawford E, Crowley J, Coltman C | title = Prevalence of prostate cancer among men with a prostate-specific antigen level ≤4.0 ng per milliliter | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 350 | issue = 22 | pages = 2239–46 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15163773 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa031918[/tpl]

===PSA velocity===

Despite earlier findings,[tpl]cite journal | author = Carter H, Pearson J, Metter E, Brant L, Chan D, Andres R, Fozard J, Walsh P | title = Longitudinal evaluation of prostate-specific antigen levels in men with and without prostate disease | journal = JAMA | volume = 267 | issue = 16 | pages = 2215–20 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1372942 | doi = 10.1001/jama.267.16.2215[/tpl] recent research suggests that the rate of increase of PSA (the 'PSA velocity') is not a more specific marker for prostate cancer,[tpl]cite journal | author= H. Ballentine Carter | title = Assessing Risk: Does This Patient Have Prostate Cancer? | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 98 | issue = 8 | pages = 506–7 | year = 2006 | url = | format = Editorial | pmid = 16622114 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj155 [/tpl] e.g. >0.35 ng/mL/yr [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/030811/page5 |title=PSA Velocity Does Not Improve Prostate Cancer Detection |date=8 Mar 2011 [/tpl]
However, the PSA rate of rise may have value in prostate cancer prognosis. Men with prostate cancer whose PSA level increased by more than 2.0 ng per milliliter during the year before the diagnosis of prostate cancer have a higher risk of death from prostate cancer despite undergoing radical prostatectomy.[tpl]cite journal | author = D'Amico A, Chen M, Roehl K, Catalona W | title = Preoperative PSA velocity and the risk of death from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–35 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15247353 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa032975[/tpl]

===Free PSA===

Most PSA in the blood is bound to serum proteins. A small amount is not protein bound and is called 'free PSA'. In men with prostate cancer the ratio of free (unbound) PSA to total PSA is decreased. The risk of cancer increases if the free to total ratio is less than 25%. (See graph at right.) The lower the ratio is, the greater the probability of prostate cancer. Measuring the ratio of free to total PSA appears to be particularly promising for eliminating unnecessary biopsies in men with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL.[tpl]cite journal | author = Catalona W, Smith D, Ornstein D | title = Prostate cancer detection in men with serum PSA concentrations of 2.6 to 4.0 ng/mL and benign prostate examination. Enhancement of specificity with free PSA measurements | journal = JAMA | volume = 277 | issue = 18 | pages = 1452–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9145717 | doi = 10.1001/jama.277.18.1452[/tpl] However, both total and free PSA increase immediately after ejaculation, returning slowly to baseline levels within 24 hours.

===Inactive PSA===

The PSA test in 1994 failed to differentiate between prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and the commercial assay kits for PSA did not provide correct PSA values.

It is now clear that the term prostate-specific antigen is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dale L. Laux, M.S. & Sarah E. Custis | title = Forensic Detection of Semen III.

In women, PSA is found in female ejaculate at concentrations roughly equal to that found in male semen.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wimpissinger F, Stifter K, Grin W, Stackl W |title=The female prostate revisited: perineal ultrasound and biochemical studies of female ejaculate |journal=J Sex Med |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1388–93; discussion 1393 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17634056 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00542.x |url=[/tpl] Other than semen and female ejaculate, the greatest concentrations of PSA in biological fluids are detected in breast milk and amniotic fluid. Low concentrations of PSA have been identified in the urethral glands, endometrium, normal breast tissue and salivary gland tissue. PSA also is found in the serum of women with breast, lung, or uterine cancer and in some patients with renal cancer.[tpl]Cite book |last=Stanley A Brosman |title= eMedicine: Prostate-Specific Antigen |publisher=WebMD |url= http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC3465.HTM#section~CharacteristicsofProstateSpecificAntigen|accessdate=2008-05-11[/tpl]
Tissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA in order to determine the origin of malignant cells that have metastasized.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chuang AY, DeMarzo AM, Veltri RW, Sharma RB, Bieberich CJ, Epstein JI | title = Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma | journal = Am.

==Interactions==

Prostate-specific antigen has been shown to interact with Protein C inhibitor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Christensson A, Lilja H | title = Complex formation between protein C inhibitor and prostate-specific antigen in vitro and in human semen | journal = Eur.
