==Professional wrestling career==

===NWA Wildside===

Delay made his debut by joining up with NWA Wildside and was a frequent sparring partner with A.J. Styles. On July 5, 2003, Seth defeated Sal Rinauro to capture the NWA Wildside Junior Heavyweight Championship, but lost it two months later to Ray Gordy. Delay also appeared on two episodes of TNA Xplosion in 2003 and 2004, losing to Frankie Kazarian and Chris Sabin, respectively. In 2005, Delay and former enemy Sal Rinauro joined forces in NWA Wildside and toured several National Wrestling Alliance promotions as well as Full Impact Pro and Elite Championship Wrestling.

===Full Impact Pro===

After the breaking away from Sal, Delay began making more frequent appearances with Full Impact Pro, often teaming with Chasyn Rance. However, the duo disbanded in 2006 after Rance created and joined the Y.R.R. (Young, Rich, and Ready For Action) with Kenny King and Steve Madison. Delay would feud with the Y.R.R. leading into 2007 and 2008.

===NWA Anarchy===

On May 21, 2005, Delay reunited with Sal Rinauro and both won a Tag Team Gauntlet match to become the first ever NWA Anarchy Tag Team Champions. They later lost the belts to Adam Roberts and a partner in August of that year. Rinauro and Delay would then go their separate ways. After breaking away from Rinauro, Seth formed a tag team with Adrian Hawkins and the duo became known as "The World's Prettiest Tag Team". The duo still compete together in NWA Anarchy.

===Independent circuit===

In addition to NWA Anarchy and FIP, Delay has debuted in Ring of Honor, Jersey All Pro Wrestling and Alternative Pro Wrestling in 2008 and continues to wrestle in all five promotions.
