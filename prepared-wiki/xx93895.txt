[[Hepatitis C virus]]

CATEGORIES: Hepatitis C virus

Hepatitis C virus (HCV or sometimes HVC) is a small (55–65 nm in size), enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Hepatitis C virus is the cause of hepatitis C in humans.

==Taxonomy==

The hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus a member of the family Flaviviridae. Until recently it was considered to be the only member of this genus. However a member of this genus has been discovered in dogs—canine hepacivirus.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kapoor A, Simmonds P, Gerold G, Qaisar N, Jain K, Henriquez JA, Firth C, Hirschberg DL, Rice CM et al. | year = 2011 | title = Characterization of a canine homolog of hepatitis C virus | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 108 | issue = 28| pages = 11608–13 |bibcode = 2011PNAS..10811608K |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101794108 | pmid = 21610165 | pmc = 3136326 [/tpl] There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses.[tpl]cite journal |author=Burbelo PD, Dubovi EJ, Simmonds P, et al. |title=Serology-enabled discovery of genetically diverse hepaciviruses in a new host |journal=J.

==Structure==

The hepatitis C virus particle consists of a core of genetic material (RNA), surrounded by an icosahedral protective shell of protein, and further encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope of cellular origin. Two viral envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope.

==Genome==

Hepatitis C virus has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome consists of a single open reading frame that is 9600 nucleotide bases long.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kato N |title=Genome of human hepatitis C virus (HCV): gene organization, sequence diversity, and variation |journal=Microb. Comp. Genomics |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=129–51 |year=2000 |pmid=11252351 [/tpl] This single open reading frame is translated to produce a single protein product, which is then further processed to produce smaller active proteins.
At the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA are the UTR, that are not translated into proteins but are important to translation and replication of the viral RNA. The 5' UTR has a ribosome binding site[tpl]cite journal |author=Jubin R |title=Hepatitis C IRES: translating translation into a therapeutic target |journal=Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=278–87 |year=2001 |pmid=11497352 [/tpl] (IRES — Internal ribosome entry site) that starts the translation of a very long protein containing about 3,000 amino acids. The core domain of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES contains a four-way helical junction that is integrated within a predicted pseudoknot.[tpl]cite journal |author=Berry KE, Waghray S, Mortimer SA, Bai Y, Doudna JA |title=Crystal structure of the HCV IRES central domain reveals strategy for start-codon positioning |journal=Structure |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1456–66 |date=October 2011 |pmid=22000514 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2011.08.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969-2126(11)00280-2 |pmc=3209822[/tpl] The conformation of this core domain constrains the open reading frame's orientation for positioning on the 40S ribosomal subunit. The large pre-protein is later cut by cellular and viral proteases into the 10 smaller proteins that allow viral replication within the host cell, or assemble into the mature viral particles.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dubuisson J |title=Hepatitis C virus proteins |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=17 |pages=2406–15 |year=2007 |pmid=17552023 [/tpl]
Structural proteins made by the hepatitis C virus include Core protein, E1 and E2; nonstructural proteins include NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.

==Molecular biology==

The proteins of this virus are arranged along the genome in the following order: N terminal-core-envelope (E1)–E2–p7-nonstructural protein 2 (NS2)–NS3–NS4A–NS4B–NS5A–NS5B–C terminal. The mature nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B) generation relies on the activity of viral proteinases.[tpl]cite journal | author = De Francesco R | year = 1999 | title = Molecular virology of the hepatitis C virus | journal = J Hepatol | volume = 31 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 47–53 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-8278(99)80374-2 | pmid = 10622560 [/tpl] The NS2/NS3 junction is cleaved by a metal dependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3. The remaining cleavages downstream from this site are catalysed by a serine proteinase also contained within the N-terminal region of NS3.
The core protein has 191 amino acids and can be divided into three domains on the basis of hydrophobicity: domain 1 (residues 1–117) contains mainly basic residues with two short hydrophobic regions; domain 2 (resides 118–174) is less basic and more hydrophobic and its C-terminus is at the end of p21; domain 3 (residues 175–191) is highly hydrophobic and acts as a signal sequence for E1 envelope protein.
Both envelope proteins (E1 and E2) are highly glycosylated and important in cell entry. E1 serves as the fusogenic subunit and E2 acts as the receptor binding protein. E1 has 4–5 N-linked glycans and E2 has 11 N-glycosylation sites.
The p7 protein is dispensable for viral genome replication but plays a critical role in virus morphogenesis. This protein is a 63 amino acid membrane spanning protein which locates itself in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cleavage of p7 is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum's signal peptidases. Two transmembrane domains of p7 are connected by a cytoplasmic loop and are oriented towards the endoplasmic reticulum's lumen.
NS2 protein is a 21–23 kiloDalton (kDa) transmembrane protein with protease activity.
NS3 is 67 kDa protein whose N-terminal has serine protease activity and whose C-terminal has NTPase/helicase activity. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a heterodimeric complex with NS4A—a 54 amino acid membrane protein that acts as a cofactor of the proteinase.
NS4B is a small (27 kDa) hydrophobic integral membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains. It is located within the endoplasmic reticulum and plays an important role for recruitment of other viral proteins. It induces morphological changes to the endoplasmic reticulum forming a structure termed the membranous web.
NS5A is a hydrophilic phosphoprotein which plays an important role in viral replication, modulation of cell signaling pathways and the interferon response. It is known to bind to endoplasmic reticulum anchored human VAP proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gupta G, Qin H, Song J |title=Intrinsically unstructured domain 3 of hepatitis C Virus NS5A forms a "fuzzy complex" with VAPB-MSP domain which carries ALS-causing mutations |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=e39261 |year=2012 |pmid=22720086 |pmc=3374797 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0039261 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039261[/tpl]
The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key function of replicating the HCV’s viral RNA by using the viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication.[tpl]cite journal |author=Moradpour D, Penin F, Rice CM |title=Replication of hepatitis C virus |journal=Nat.

The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication.[tpl]cite journal |author=O'Farrell D, Trowbridge R, Rowlands D, Jäger J |title=Substrate complexes of hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase (HC-J4): structural evidence for nucleotide import and de-novo initiation |journal=J.

An 11th has also been described.[tpl]cite journal | author = Walewski JL, Keller TR, Stump DD, Branch AD | year = 2001 | title = Evidence for a new hepatitis C virus antigen encoded in an overlapping reading frame | journal = RNA | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 710–721 | doi = 10.1017/S1355838201010111 | pmid = 11350035 | pmc = 1370123 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Baghbani-arani F, Roohvand F, Aghasadeghi MR, Eidi A, Amini S, Motevalli F, Sadat SM, Memarnejadian A, Khalili G et al. | year = 2012 | title = Expression and characterization of Escherichia coli derived hepatitis C virus ARFP/F protein | journal = Mol Biol (Mosk) | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 251–9 | doi = 10.1134/S0026893312020033 |pmid=22670521 [/tpl] This protein is encoded by a +1 frameshift in the capsid gene. It appears to be antigenic but its function is unknown.

==Replication==

Replication of HCV involves several steps. The virus replicates mainly in the hepatocytes of the liver, where it is estimated that daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty virions (virus particles) with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated.  The virus may also replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, potentially accounting for the high levels of immunological disorders found in chronically infected HCV patients.  HCV has a wide variety of genotypes and mutates rapidly due to a high error rate on the part of the virus' RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The mutation rate produces so many variants of the virus it is considered a quasispecies rather than a conventional virus species.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bartenschlager R, Lohmann V |title=Replication of hepatitis C virus |journal=J. Gen. Virol. |volume=81 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1631–48 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10859368 |url= http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/81/7/1631[/tpl]  Entry into host cells occur through complex interactions between virions and cell-surface molecules CD81, LDL receptor, SR-BI, DC-SIGN, Claudin-1, and Occludin.[tpl]cite pmid | 19273272[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid | 20463075[/tpl]
Once inside the hepatocyte, HCV takes over portions of the intracellular machinery to replicate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lindenbach B, Rice C | title = Unravelling hepatitis C virus replication from genome to function | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = 7053 | pages = 933–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16107832 | doi = 10.1038/nature04077|bibcode = 2005Natur.436..933L [/tpl] The HCV genome is translated to produce a single protein of around 3011 amino acids. The polyprotein is then proteolytically processed by viral and cellular proteases to produce three structural (virion-associated) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Alternatively, a frameshift may occur in the Core region to produce an Alternate Reading Frame Protein (ARFP).[tpl]cite pmid | 15732002[/tpl] HCV encodes two proteases, the NS2 cysteine autoprotease and the NS3-4A serine protease. The NS proteins then recruit the viral genome into an RNA replication complex, which is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes. RNA replication takes places via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, which produces a negative strand RNA intermediate. The negative strand RNA then serves as a template for the production of new positive strand viral genomes. Nascent genomes can then be translated, further replicated or packaged within new virus particles. New virus particles are thought to bud into the secretory pathway and are released at the cell surface.
The virus replicates on intracellular lipid membranes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dubuisson J, Penin F, Moradpour D | year = 2002 | title = Interaction of hepatitis C virus proteins with host cell membranes and lipids | journal = Trends Cell Biol | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 517–523 | doi = 10.1016/S0962-8924(02)02383-8 | pmid = 12446113 [/tpl] The endoplasmic reticulum in particular are deformed into uniquely shaped membrane structures termed 'membranous webs'. These structures can be induced by sole expression of the viral protein NS4B.[tpl]cite journal | author = Egger D, Wölk B, Gosert R, Bianchi L, Blum HE, Moradpour D, Bienz K | year = 2002 | title = Expression of hepatitis C virus proteins induces distinct membrane alterations including a candidate viral replication complex | journal = J Virol | volume = 76 | issue = 12| pages = 5974–84 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.76.12.5974-5984.2002 | pmid = 12021330 | pmc = 136238 [/tpl] The core protein associates with lipid droplets and utilises microtubules and dyneins to alter their location to a perinuclear distribution.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boulant S, Douglas MW, Moody L, Budkowska A, Targett-Adams P, McLauchlan J | year = 2008 | title = Hepatitis C virus core protein induces lipid droplet redistribution in a microtubule- and dynein-dependent manner | journal = Traffic | volume = 9 | issue = 8| pages = 1268–82 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00767.x | pmid = 18489704 [/tpl]

==Genotypes==

Based on genetic differences between HCV isolates, the hepatitis C virus species is classified into seven genotypes (1–7) with several subtypes within each genotype (represented by lower-cased letters).[tpl]cite journal |author=Simmonds P, Holmes EC, Cha TA, et al. |title=Classification of hepatitis C virus into six major genotypes and a series of subtypes by phylogenetic analysis of the NS-5 region |journal=J.

G.|first3=Grace M. L.|first4=Masaya|first5=Masashi[/tpl] Subtypes are further broken down into quasispecies based on their genetic diversity. Genotypes differ by 30–35% of the nucleotide sites over the complete genome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ohno O, Mizokami M, Wu RR, Saleh MG, Ohba K, Orito E, Mukaide M, Williams R, Lau JY et al. | year = 2007 | title = New hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping system that allows for identification of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4, 5a, and 6a | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 201–7 | pmid = 8968908 | pmc = 229539 [/tpl] The difference in genomic composition of subtypes of a genotype is usually 20–25%. Subtypes 1a and 1b are found worldwide and cause 60% of all cases.

===Clinical importance===

Genotype is clinically important in determining potential response to interferon-based therapy and the required duration of such therapy. Genotypes 1 and 4 are less responsive to interferon-based treatment than are the other genotypes (2, 3, 5 and 6).[tpl]cite journal | author = Simmonds P, Bukh J, Combet C, Deléage G, Enomoto N, Feinstone S, Halfon P, Inchauspé G, Kuiken C, Maertens G, Mizokami M, Murphy D, Okamoto H, Pawlotsky J, Penin F, Sablon E, Shin-I T, Stuyver L, Thiel H, Viazov S, Weiner A, Widell A | title = Consensus proposals for a unified system of nomenclature of hepatitis C virus genotypes | journal = Hepatology | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 962–73 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16149085 | doi = 10.1002/hep.20819 | last12 = Murphy | first12 = DG | last13 = Okamoto | first13 = H | last14 = Pawlotsky | first14 = JM | last15 = Penin | first15 = F | last16 = Sablon | first16 = E | last17 = Shin-I | first17 = T | last18 = Stuyver | first18 = LJ | last19 = Thiel | first19 = HJ | last20 = Viazov | first20 = S | last21 = Weiner | first21 = AJ | last22 = Widell | first22 = A[/tpl] Duration of standard interferon-based therapy for genotypes 1 and 4 is 48 weeks, whereas treatment for genotypes 2 and 3 is completed in 24 weeks. Sustained virological responses occur in 70% of genotype 1 cases, ~90% of genotypes 2 and 3, ~65% of genotype 4 and ~80% of genotype 6.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yu ML, Chuang WL | year = 2009 | title = Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Asia: when East meets West | journal = J Gastroenterol Hepatol | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 336–345 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2009.05789.x | pmid = 19335784 [/tpl]
Infection with one genotype does not confer immunity against others, and concurrent infection with two strains is possible. In most of these cases, one of the strains removes the other from the host in a short time. This finding opens the door to replace strains non-responsive to medication with others easier to treat.[tpl]cite journal | author = Laskus T, Wang LF, Radkowski M, Vargas H, Nowicki M, Wilkinson J, Rakela J. | title = Exposure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-positive recipients to HCV RNA-positive blood donors results in rapid predominance of a single donor strain and exclusion and/or suppression of the recipient strain | journal =  Journal of Virology| volume =  75| issue =  5| pages =  2059–66| year =  2001| pmid = 11160710 | doi =10.1128/JVI.75.5.2059-2066.2001 | pmc = 114790 [/tpl]

==Evolution==

Identifying of the origin of this virus has been difficult but genotypes 1 and 4 appear to share a common origin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Salemi M, Vandamme AM | year = 2002 | title = Hepatitis C virus evolutionary patterns studied through analysis of full-genome sequences | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 54 | issue = 1| pages = 62–70 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-001-0018-9 | pmid = 11734899 [/tpl] 
A Bayesian analysis suggests that the major genotypes diverged about 300–400 years ago from the ancestor virus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sarwar MT, Kausar H, Ijaz B, et al. |title=NS4A protein as a marker of HCV history suggests that different HCV genotypes originally evolved from genotype 1b |journal=Virol.

Investigation of the pattern of diversity of hepatitis C virus in relation to times of transmission. Simmonds P, Smith DB.//317[/tpl] The minor genotypes diverged about 200 years ago from their major genotypes. All of the extant genotypes appear to have evolved from genotype 1 subtype 1b.
An study of genotype 6 strains suggests an earlier date of evolution: ∼1,100 to 1,350 years before the present (95% credible region, 600 to >2,500 years ago).[tpl]cite journal | author = Pybus OG, Barnes E, Taggart R, Lemey P, Markov PV, Rasachak B, Syhavong B, Phetsouvanah R, Sheridan I et al. | year = 2009 | title = Genetic history of hepatitis C virus in East Asia | journal = J Virol | volume = 83 | issue = 2| pages = 1071–82 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01501-08 | pmid = 18971279 | pmc = 2612398 [/tpl] The estimated rate of mutation was 1.8 × 10−4 (95% credible region 0.9 × 10−4 to 2.9 × 10−4). This genotype may be the ancestor of the other genotypes.
A study of European, USA and Japanese isolates suggested that the date of origin of genotype 1b was ~1925.[tpl]cite journal | author = Simmonds P, Smith DB | year = 1997 | title = Investigation of the pattern of diversity of hepatitis C virus in relation to times of transmission | journal = J Viral Hepat | volume = 4 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 69–74 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2893.1997.tb00163.x | pmid = 9097281 [/tpl] The estimated dates of origin of types 2a and 3a were 1917 and 1943 respectively. The time of divergence of types 1a and 1b was estimated to be 200–300 years.
A study of genotype 1a and 1b estimated the dates of origin to be 1914–1930 (95% credible interval: 1802–1957) for type 1a and 1911–1944 (95% credible interval: 1806–1965) for type 1b.[tpl]cite journal |author=Magiorkinis G, Magiorkinis E, Paraskevis D, et al. |title=The global spread of hepatitis C virus 1a and 1b: a phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e1000198 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20041120 |pmc=2795363 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000198 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000198[/tpl] Both types 1a and 1b underwent massive expansions in their effective population size between 1940 and 1960. The expansion of HCV subtype 1b preceded that of subtype 1a by at least 16 years (95% credible interval: 15–17 years). Both types appear to have spread from the developed world to the developing world.
The genotype 2 strains from Africa can be divided into four clades that correlate with their country of origin: (1) Cameroon and Central African Republic (2) Benin, Ghana and Burkina Faso (3) Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal (4) Madagascar.[tpl]cite journal |author=Markov PV, Pepin J, Frost E, Deslandes S, Labbé AC, Pybus OG |title=Phylogeography and molecular epidemiology of hepatitis C virus genotype 2 in Africa |journal=J.

These dates from these various countries suggests that this virus may have evolved in South East Asia and was spread to West Africa by traders from Western Europe.[tpl]cite journal | author = Simmonds P | year = 2001 | title = Reconstructing the origins of human hepatitis viruses | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1411| pages = 1013–26 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.0890 | pmid = 11516379 | pmc = 1088496 [/tpl] It was later introduced into Japan once that country's self-imposed isolation was lifted. Once introduced to a country its spread has been influenced by many local factors including blood transfusions, vaccination programmes, intravenous drug misuse and treatment regimes. Given the reduction in the rate of spread once screening for Hepatitis C in blood products was implemented in the 1990s it would seem that at least in recent times blood transfusion has been an important method of spreading for this virus. Additional work is required to determine the dates of evolution of the various genotypes and the timing of their spread across the globe.

==Vaccination==

Unlike hepatitis A and B, there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C infection.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=20625493 | doi=10.1155/2010/548280 | volume=2010 | title=A new insight into hepatitis C vaccine development | pmc=2896694 | year=2010 | author=Yu CI, Chiang BL | journal=J.

==Stability in the environment==

Like many viruses, the hepatitis C virus is gradually inactivated outside the body of a host. The presence of heat can greatly reduce the virus's lifespan outside the body. The virus can remain infectious outside a host for about sixteen days at 25 °C and two days at 37 °C, while it can remain active for more than six weeks at temperatures less than or equal to 4 °C. When heated to temperatures of 60 °C and 65 °C, however, the hepatitis C virus can be inactivated in eight and four minutes, respectively.
