The Soviet relations with Pakistan deteriorated on April 4, 1979, when Bhutto was executed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Earlier, Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, and other members of the Politburo had sent repeated calls for clemency to CMLA General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq who forcefully rejected the Soviet requests. Breznev maintained the issue of Bhutto was Pakistan's internal matter but did not wish to see him executed. When Bhutto was hanged, Brezhnev condemned the act out of "purely humane motives".

====Military dictatorship (1977-1988)====

Shortly after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, military ruler General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq called for a meeting of senior military members and technocrats of his military government.[tpl]cite book|last=Yousaf, PA|first=Brigadier General (retired) Mohammad|title=Silent soldier: the man behind the Afghan jehad General Akhtar Abdur Rahman|year=1991|publisher=Jang Publishers, 1991|location=Karachi, Sindh|pages=106 pages|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cAoNAAAAIAAJ&q=Silent+soldier:+The+man+behind+the+Afghan+Jehad+by+Mohammad+Yousaf&dq=Silent+soldier:+The+man+behind+the+Afghan+Jehad+by+Mohammad+Yousaf&hl=en&ei=q3bDTuTyK473sQKDy_GZCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQ6wEwAA[/tpl]  At this meeting, General Zia-ul-Haq asked the Chief of Army Staff General Khalid Mahmud Arif (veteran of 1965 and 1971 war)  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Muhammad Shariff (who was made POW by India during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971) to lead a specialized civil-military team to formulate a geo-strategy to counter the Soviet aggression. At this meeting, the Director-General of the ISI at that time, Lieutenant-General Akhtar Abdur Rahman advocated for an idea of covert operation in Afghanistan by arming the Islamic extremist, and was loudly heard saying: "Kabul must burn! Kabul must burn!".  As for Pakistan, the Soviet war with Islamist mujaheddin was a complete revenge in retaliation for the Soviet Union's long unconditional support of regional rival, India, notably during the 1965 and the 1971 wars, which led the loss of East Pakistan.
In 1980, the relationship took a dangerous turn, when Soviet press, notable "Pravda" and other Soviet commentators, began to issue threatening statements towards Pakistan. Soviet Commentator, V Baikov, went far enough to say: The axis of United States and China, is trying to secure a base for its rapid deployment force, presumable offering F-16 fighter plans in that view."[tpl]cite book|last=Riccioppi|first=Linda|title=Soviet Policy towards South Asia in 1970|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1994|location=United States|isbn=0-521-41457-1|pages=136–199|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jiUic1s7djMC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=Guddu++Station+and+soviet+union&source=bl&ots=TXmqm-kFkF&sig=jrQtXhLKj9UIJ_0Bvx7yiH7dw-w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=904wULuMB8OniAKbh4CoBQ&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Guddu%20%20Station%20and%20soviet%20union&f=true|accessdate=19 August 2012|format=google books|chapter=USSR and Pakistan relations[/tpl]  Another Soviet commentator "threateningly" asked Pakistan that "If she (Pakistan) thought about where the United States was pulling it in its hostilities with Afghanistan; their aggression was taking place in the vicinity of the USSR". In February 1980, a delegation of TASS in New York maintains that, "One can see the contours of dangerous plans aimed at Pakistan's arch rivals— India, Soviet Union, and Afghanistan.  The change of administration in 1980 and immediate verbal threat of Soviet Union to Pakistan, brought the United States and Pakistan on a six-year trade, economic and military agreement, valuing approximately ~32.5 billions US dollars.
The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan as an integral Cold War struggle, and the CIA provided assistance to anti-Soviet forces through the ISI, in a program called Operation Cyclone. The siphoning off of aid weapons, in which the weapons logistics and coordination were put under the Pakistan Navy in the port city of Karachi, contributed to disorder and violence there, while heroin entering from Afghanistan to pay for arms contributed to addiction problems.Kepel, Jihad, (2002), p.143-4 The Pakistan Navy coordinated the foreign weapons into Afghanistan, while some of its high-ranking admirals were responsible for storing the weapons in the Navy logistics depot, later coordinated the weapons supply to Mujaheddin, out of complete revenge of Pakistan Navy's brutal loss and defeat at the hands of Soviet Navy in 1971.

The Soviet Union and the new Secretary General Yuri Andropov were angry at Pakistan's covert involvement in the support of Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union and her satellite state, Soviet Afghanistan, and expressed his indignation to the General.  Then General Zia took his hand and told him that, "Mr. Secretary General... Believe me, Pakistan wants nothing but good and healthy relations with the Soviet Union". According to Andrei Gromyko, Zia's sincerity had caught off guards and in the meeting, everyone believed him but sadly found out that his words were not followed by his actions. Ironically, Zia directly dealt with the Israel, working to build covert relations with Israel, allowing the country to actively participate in Soviet war in Afghanistan.

====Democratic governments (1989-1991)====

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto (daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) authorized further aggressive military operations in Afghanistan to topple the fragile communist regime and to end the Soviet influence. One of her military authorizations was a military action in Jalalabad of Afghanistan in retaliation for the Soviet Union's long unconditional support of India, a proxy war in Pakistan, and Pakistan's loss in 1971 war. This operation was "a defining moment for her Benazir's government" to prove the loyalty to Pakistan Armed Forces. This operation planned by then-Director General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul, with inclusion of U.S. ambassador to Pakistan  Robert Oakley. Known as Battle of Jalalabad, it was intended to gain a conventional victory on Soviet Union after Soviet Union had withdrawn its troops. But the operation failed miserably and the Afghan army supported by Soviet scuds won the battle resulting in ISI chief being sacked by the Prime Minister
At the end years of Cold War, Soviet Union announced to established a 1000MW commercial nuclear power plant in Pakistan, but after witnessing its aging technology Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, later followed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, did not authorized the purchase and showed any interests in aging Soviet technology.
In 1992, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif released the details and company of Soviet soldiers to the Russian government when Alexander Rutskoy visited the country, after meeting in a committee led by Deputy Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Shahryar Khan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trud.ru/issue/article.php?id=200705105781001 |title=Восставшие в аду Бадабера |author=E.

==Fall of Communism and the 21st century==

===Pakistan—Russian Federation relations===

After the Soviet Union troop withdrawal withdrawing the combatant troops from Communist Afghanistan, relations began to normalize with Pakistan. In the wake of fall of communism, Russian-Pakistan relations were warmed rapidly. In 1989, Soviet ambassador to Pakistan offered Pakistan to install a commercial nuclear power plant in the country, however after the U.S. intervention the plans were sent into cold storage. In 1994-95, Benazir Bhutto attempted to warm the relations with Russia but suffered a major setback with Benazir Bhutto's government recognized Taliban-controlled government in Afghanistan as a legitimate government. In 1996, Russia willingly agreed to launch Pakistan's second satellite, Badr-B, from its Baikonur Cosmodrome for the lowest possible charges. 
In 1997, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif attempted to warm the relations with Russia after sending farewell messages to Russian Federation. In 1998, although Russian congratulated India for conducting second nuclear tests, (see Pokhran-II), Russia did not immediately criticized Pakistan for performing its nuclear tests (see Chagai-I and Chagai-II) in the end week of May 1998. On April 1999 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif paid an important state visit to Kremlin, this was the first trip to Moscow paid by a Pakistan's Prime minister in 25 years, however no breakthrough in this was made.[tpl]cite web|last=Adnan Ali Shah *|title=PAKISTAN-RUSSIA RELATIONS: POST-COLD WAR ERA|url=http://www.issi.org.pk/old-site/ss_Detail.php?dataId=179|publisher=Adnan Ali Shah *|accessdate=19 August 2012[/tpl]  In 1999, Russia welcomed Pakistan and India for making a breakthrough in their relations after proceeding the Lahore Declaration, but vehemently criticized Pakistan for holding Pakistan responsible for the outbreak of Indo-Pakistani War of 1999. During this time, Russia played a major role in ending the war but remained hostile towards Pakistan.
Russia condemned the  military coup d'état against Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 to remove the prime minister from power. On 19 April 2001, the Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Losyukov paid a state visit to Pakistan where both countries agreed upon cooperating in economic development, and to work towards peace and prosperity in the region.[tpl]cite news|last=Staff|title=Islamabad, Moscow seek better ties|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2001/apr2101.html#isla|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=Dawn Archives, April 21, 2001|date=April 21, 2001[/tpl]  In the wake of September 11, 2001 attacks, the relations were warmed rapidly when Pakistan denounced the government of Taliban and joined the NATO coalition to hunt down the Jihadist organizations and al-Qaeda. The decision of Pakistan to join the international struggle against terrorism has led to Russia-Pakistan relations being greatly improved. Russia also played an integral role to ease off the nuclear 2001 Indo-Pakistan tensions.

===Improvement in relations===

Russia vowed its support for Pakistan as Pakistan fight against the Taliban militants. In 2007, the relations between Pakistan and the Russian Federation were reactivated after the 3-day official visit of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov.

The major focus of the visit was to improve bilateral relations with particular emphasis on ways and means to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.
