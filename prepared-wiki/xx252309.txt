The Cateran formed in Edinburgh in the mid-1980s, with a line-up comprising Inverness natives Sandy Macpherson (vocals), Cameron Fraser (guitar), Murdo MacLeod (guitar), Kai Davidson (bass guitar), and Andy Milne (drums).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, ISBN 1-84195-335-0, p. 256-7 Davidson had played in several bands in the early 1980s, including Reasons For Emotion, which also featured Craig and Charlie Reid, who later found fame as The Proclaimers."Kai Davidson", Glasgow Herald, 29 June 2007, p. 27 They were initially influenced by US acts such as Hüsker Dü and The Dead Kennedys, and signed to the DDT label. The band's debut release was the 1986 mini-LP Little Circles, which they promoted by touring with The Proclaimers, for whom Davidson also acted as manager. They moved on to Vinyl Solution for the second album, Bite Deeper in 1988, before moving on again to Imaginary Records later that year for The Black Album EP. The band's third and final album, Ache, was issued in 1989 on the What Goes On label, and the band supported Nirvana on their UK tour that year. A further EP followed in 1990 before the band split in 1991, with MacLeod and Davidson forming a new band, Joyriders, who released two singles, both of which were named "Single of the Week" by the NME, before splitting up in the mid-1990s. A compilation album of the Joyriders recordings was issued in Japan in 2009."Returning Japanese tour for Inverness rock group", Inverness Courier, 11 August 2009, retrieved 10 January 2010
