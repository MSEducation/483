==Biography==

Sidney Eisenshtat was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and his family later lived in Detroit, Michigan.  The family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1926, reportedly in search of a less anti-Semitic atmosphere than they perceived in Detroit.Christina Huh, "Alumnus, famed architect dies at 90," Daily Trojan, March 22, 2005.  He graduated from the University of Southern California architecture school in 1935.Mary Rourke, “Sidney Eisenshtat, 90; Was Known for His Innovative Synagogues,” Los Angeles Times, March 05, 2005.  Early in his career he designed large projects for the United States Department of Defense, tract houses, and retail stores.
It was not until 1951 that he designed his first major religious structure, Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, California.  Eight years later he designed the landmark  Sinai Temple on Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood district of Los Angeles,Samuel D. Gruber, "Sidney Eisenshtat, 90, Leading Synagogue Architect", Forward, April 1, 2005. a building that has been compared to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and which is distinguished by its use of stained glass windows.David Gebhard and Robert Winter, An Architectural Guidebook to Los Angeles (Gibbs Smith, rev. ed. 2003), ISBN 978-1-58685-308-2, p. 143 (excerpt available at Google Books).
Eisenshtat said that his concept of synagogue design was based on his perception that, unlike in some religions, "in Judaism there is no intermediary. Therefore, I see the structure for synagogues not as pyramidal but as horizontal."Evelyn DeWolfe, "AIA Honors Five Southland Architects", Los Angeles Times, April 13, 1986.  Influenced by other modernist architects, notably Erich Mendelsohn, Eisenshat was noted for a use of expressive forms in thin shell concrete, white walls, simple materials, and natural light. Two of his most representative and distinguished buildings are set in arid desert environments. At Temple Mount Sinai in El Paso, Texas (1962) the Ark is a giant open tripod inside a soaring, tent-like concrete sanctuary; one writer has commented that this building "with its soaring arched shell seems to spring out of the rocky Texas soil" and gives the congregants a view of the mountains "through the high glazed arch behind the Ark."Brian de Breffny, The Synagogue (Macmillan, 1st American ed., 1978), ISBN 0-02-530310-4, p.200 This building is also featured in the book American Synagogues by noted architecture critic Samuel D. Gruber, and described as "a dramatically sculptural building perfect for its austere setting."  News release for Samuel D. Gruber, American Synagogues: A Century of Architecture and Jewish Community (Rizzoli, 2003), ISBN 978-0-8478-2549-3. 
The futuristic House of the Book, built in the early 1970s as the synagogue for the Brandeis-Bardin Institute, is set among the Santa Susana Mountains"Cathedrals in the Clouds," Time, December 27, 1971. near Simi Valley, California, and is used as a filming location for science-fiction and other productions, notably including Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,Harry Medved, "Top Ten Jewish silver screen landmarks," The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, November 9, 2006.

Eisenshtat's design for the Hillel House at the University of Southern California was described as one of his best buildings by USC architecture professor James Steele, who said it was representative of "his personality and his attitude toward Judaism," with a building that is "very open, free, full of light," but surrounded by a "bunker"-like "defensive wall."
Eisenshtat also designed the master plan for the campus of the University of Judaism (now American Jewish University) in Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California, completed in 1977.  His notable secular buildings include the Friars Club and Union Bank buildings in Beverly Hills and the Sven Lokrantz School for disabled children in Reseda.Dennis McCarthy, "Beauty above and beyond the surface", Los Angeles Daily News, September 4, 2011 [tpl]subscription required|via=HighBeam Research[/tpl].Dana Bartholemew, ""One Cool Tour: Sleek And Modern, Valley's Post-War Structures Fascinate."

An observant Orthodox Jew, Eisenshtat reportedly did not accept fees for his synagogue projects.   He was honored as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1986.  He died in 2005 at age 90.  USC's Architectural Guild Press has announced that a monograph about Eisenshtat's work is under production, to be written by USC professor James Steele.USC Architectural Guild Press official website(retrieved October 5, 2008)."University of Southern California" (faculty news) at Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture website (retrieved November 9, 2011).
For many years during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Eisenshtat's lead designer was Maxwell Rex Raymer (June 4, 1922–February 27, 2010).[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
