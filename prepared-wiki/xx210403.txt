Nickelodeon Arabia was a satellite, free-to-air channel for Arab children, teens and adults. It was the official Arab arm of Nickelodeon and the last remaining arm to retain the 'splat' logo that was used from 2003 - 2009 in the United States and 2002 - 2010 in Europe.
It was the second channel in the joint venture between MTV Networks International and Arabian Television Network, part of Arab Media Group, the largest media group in the United Arab Emirates, after the successful launch for MTV Arabia (now known as MTV Middle East).
As of 2011, it was the only Nickelodeon channel worldwide that had not changed its logo from the orange splat to the orange text.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Since late 2010, the channel had been suffering a frozen broadcast, broadcasting its usual programmes repetitively without any evidence of upcoming updates.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Its official website went down, and there were no clear indications or citations for why the channel was being heavily neglected.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Regardless, the channel remained live for many months into 2011.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
On September 8,2011, at one minute past midnight in U.A.E. time, and without a mainstream warning, the channel went on an indefinite hiatus without any explanation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The broadcast signal initially displayed nothing but a static message indicating Nickelodeon Arabia's viewers to continue watching Nickelodeon programmes via the Nickelodeon block on MBC 3.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The signal then reverted to a casual test card a few days later [tpl]when?|date=January 2014[/tpl], and the channel was de-listed by various satellite television providers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] A few months later[tpl]when?|date=January 2014[/tpl], the signal itself disappeared completely.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Programming==

The animated shows featured on Nickelodeon Arabia are all dubbed into Arabic, and there had been no means of switching between audio languages.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl] The live-action TeenNick shows aired in English with Arabic subtitles.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl] Original social shows produced by Nickelodeon Arabia's own studio, such as Shoof Kids and Jamaatna, were also in Arabic.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Most of the network shows were outdated, older series at the time of their debut, although they are considered fairly never-before-seen by most of the Arab audience at one time, in either their English or Arabic formats.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl] There were even several series yet to debut on Nickelodeon Arabia, with exception of The Fairly OddParents, which apparently already settled on the Middle Eastern Disney Channel. Although Fairly OddParent characters did appear in activity segments from Nickelodeon Magazine cutouts.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Like most Arab channels, Nickelodeon did feature censorship.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl] This was similar to the censorship on MTV Arabia.[tpl]Citation needed|July 2013|date=July 2013[/tpl]
