===Sidoarjo mud flow===

In May 2006, the Sidoarjo mud flow disaster occurred in East Java, Indonesia. Controversy exists surrounding the probable cause of the disaster which has displaced approximately 10,000 people and covered villages, farms and industrial areas with mud. The eruption is ongoing, though since 2011 the rate of flow has reduced."Sidoarjo Mudflow Erupting at Slower Rate, but No End in Sight, Govt Says" Jakarta Globe 2011-05-09. Retrieved 2013-12-27.
As of 2013, the contended probable causes are: drilling for oil and gas, an earthquake with its epicenter some 250 km distant or a combination of the two.
Santos owned an 18 percent stake in the project which was drilling in the area at the time, under the control of PT Lapindo Brantas and in partnership with private Indonesian oil and gas company MedcoEnergi (50% and 32% stakeholders respectively). Santos' stake in the project was sold to Minarak Labuan, the owner of PT Lapindo Brantas in December of 2008. Labuan also received a payment from Santos of $US22.5 million ($A33.9 million) "to support long-term mud management efforts". The amount was covered by existing provision for costs relating to the incident. Santos had provisioned for $US79 million ($A119.3 million) in costs associated with the disaster. 
Santos had stated in June 2006 that it maintained "appropriate insurance coverage for these types of occurrences"."Mud disaster -Santos no more liable,sells project stake" Industrysearch.com.au 2008-12-12. Retrieved 2013-12-27.
