[[5-Methylcytosine]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleobases, Pyrimidones

5-Methylcytosine is a methylated form of the DNA base cytosine that may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription. When cytosine is methylated, the DNA maintains the same sequence, but the expression of methylated genes can be altered (the study of this is part of the field of epigenetics). 5-Methylcytosine is incorporated in the nucleoside 5-methylcytidine.
In 5-methylcytosine, a methyl group, is attached to the 5th atom in the 6-atom ring (counting counterclockwise from the NH nitrogen at the six o'clock position, not the 2 o'clock). This methyl group distinguishes 5-methylcytosine from cytosine.

==Discovery==

While trying to isolate the bacterial toxin responsible for tuberculosis, W.G. Ruppel isolated a novel nucleic acid named tuberculinic acid in 1898 from Tubercle bacillus.[tpl]cite book |author= Matthews AP |year=2012 |title=Physiological Chemistry |edition= |publisher= Williams & Wilkins Company/RareBooksClub.com |pages=167 |isbn=1130145379[/tpl]  The nucleic acid was found to be unusual, in that it contained in addition to thymine, guanine and cytosine, a methylated nucleotide. In 1925, Johnson and Coghill successfully detected a minor amount of a methylated cytosine derivative as a product of hydrolysis of tuberculinic acid with sulfuric acid.[tpl]cite journal |author= Johnson TB, Coghill RD |year=1925 |title= The discovery of 5-methyl-cytosine in tuberculinic acid, the nucleic acid of the Tubercle bacillus |journal= J Am Chem Soc|volume=47 |issue=11|pages=2838–2844|doi=10.1021/ja01688a030[/tpl]Grosjean H (2009).

This report was severely criticized because their identification based solely on the optical properties of the crystalline picrate, and other scientists failed to reproduce the same result.[tpl]cite journal |author= Vischer E, Zamenhof S, Chargaff E |year=1949 |title= Microbial nucleic acids: the desoxypentose nucleic acids of avian tubercle bacilli and yeast|journal= J Biol Chem|volume=77 |issue=1|pages=429–438|pmid=18107446[/tpl]  But the existence was ultimately proved a fact in 1948, when Hotchkiss separated the nucleic acids of DNA from calf thymus using paper chromatography, by which he detected a unique methylated cytosine, quite distinct from conventional cytosine and uracil.[tpl]cite journal |author= Hotchkiss RD |year=1948|title= The quantitative separation of purines, pyrimidines and nucleosides by paper chromatography|journal=J Biol Chem|volume=175 |issue=1|pages=315–332|pmid=18107446[/tpl] After seven decades, it turned out that it is also a common feature in different RNA molecules, although the precise role is uncertain.[tpl]cite journal |author= Squires JE, Patel HR, Nousch M, Sibbritt T, Humphreys DT, Parker BJ, Suter CM, Preiss T.|year=2012|title= Widespread occurrence of 5-methylcytosine in human coding and non-coding RNA|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=40 |issue=11|pages=5023–5033|pmid=22344696|doi=10.1093/nar/gks144[/tpl]

==In vivo==

5-Methylcytosine is an epigenetic modification formed by the action of DNA methyltransferases.
The function of this chemical varies significantly among species:[tpl]cite journal |author=Colot V, Rossignol JL |title=Eukaryotic DNA methylation as an evolutionary device |journal=Bioessays |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=402–411 |year=1999 |pmid=10376011 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199905)21:53.0.CO;2-B[/tpl]
While spontaneous deamination of cytosine forms uracil, which is recognized and removed by DNA repair enzymes, deamination of 5-methylcytosine forms thymine. This conversion of a DNA base from cytosine (C) to thymine (T) can result in a transition mutation. In addition, active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have beneficial implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution.[tpl]cite journal| author= Chahwan R., Wontakal S.N., and Roa S.| title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10[/tpl] The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood.

==In vitro==

The NH2 group can be removed (deamination) from 5-methylcytosine to form thymine with use of reagents such as nitrous acid; cytosine deaminates to uracil under similar conditions. 
5-Methylcytosine is resistant to deamination by bisulfite treatment, which deaminates cytosine residues. This property is often exploited to analyze DNA cytosine methylation patterns with bisulfite sequencing.[tpl]cite journal |author=Clark SJ, Harrison J, Paul CL, Frommer M |title=High sensitivity mapping of methylated cytosines |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=22 |issue=15 |pages=2990–2997 |year=1994 |pmid=8065911 |doi=10.1093/nar/22.15.2990 |pmc=310266[/tpl]
