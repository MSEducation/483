"Better Now" is a 2004 song by the American alternative rock band Collective Soul, released on their 2004 album, Youth. It was written by singer/guitarist Ed Roland and producer Dexter Green.
The coda features a saxophone solo.  In concert, this is replaced with a guitar solo.  The radio edit version also includes a guitar solo.  Also unusual for a rock song, the bass doesn't come in until the first chorus, and plays prominent alternating root / fifth quarter notes.
