==History==

Golden Monkey Tea is a type of black tea. The invention of black tea can be explained through the Wuyi theory.[tpl]cite web|last=Teavana|title=Black Tea Health Benefits|url=http://www.teavana.com/tea-info/black-tea|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] The emperor demanded the production of loose leaf tea. During the many attempts in creating this loose leaf tea, the tea leaves would turn red, as a sign of fermentation and so, black tea was known as red tea in China because of its red colour.[tpl]cite web|last=Teavana|title=Black Tea Health Benefits|url=http://www.teavana.com/tea-info/black-tea|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] 
Another story in the creation of black tea took place in the 16th century. An army of soldiers passed through the village and stopped the production of green tea.[tpl]cite web|last=Teavana|title=Black Tea Health Benefits|url=http://www.teavana.com/tea-info/black-tea|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] The soldiers made beds out of piles of tea leaves, when they left the village, the tea leaves had turned black.[tpl]cite web|last=Teavana|title=Black Tea Health Benefits|url=http://www.teavana.com/tea-info/black-tea|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl] Tea processing continued with these black leaves, and black tea was born.[tpl]cite web|last=Teavana|title=Black Tea Health Benefits|url=http://www.teavana.com/tea-info/black-tea|accessdate=4 April 2013[/tpl]
