==Biography==

He was born in 1937, in Yakima, Washington, the oldest child of Robert Emerson Lucas and Jane Templeton Lucas.
He received his B.A. in History in 1959 and Ph.D. in Economics in 1964, both from the University of Chicago.  He taught at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now Tepper School of Business) at Carnegie Mellon University until 1975, when he returned to the University of Chicago.
His ex-wife, Rita Lucas, upon their divorce in 1988, had a clause placed in their divorce settlement that she would receive half of any Nobel Prize won by Lucas in the next seven years. When Lucas did win the Nobel Prize in 1995 (falling just within the time limit), she was awarded half of the prize money.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/nobel/1995/1995f.html | work=The Boston Globe | title=Boston Globe Archive access | date=July 19, 2012[/tpl] He has lived with Nancy Stokey. They have collaborated in papers on growth theory, public finance, and monetary theory.
Lucas studied Economics for his PhD on "quasi-Marxist" grounds. He believed that economics was the true driver of history, and so he planned to fully immerse himself in economics and then migrate back to the history department.[tpl]cite web |last=Roberts |first=Russ |title=Lucas on Growth, Poverty and Business Cycles |url=http://www.econtalk.org/archives/_featuring/bob_lucas/ |work=EconTalk |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |authorlink=Russ Roberts |date=February 5, 2007[/tpl]
Robert Lucas has three sons, Stephen Lucas and Joseph Lucas.
A collection of Lucas' papers are housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.[tpl]cite web |url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/lucasrobert/ |title=Robert E. Lucas Papers, 1960–2004 and undated |publisher=Rubenstein Library, Duke University[/tpl]

==Contributions==

===Rational expectations===

Lucas is well known for his investigations into the implications of the assumption of rational expectations. Lucas (1972) incorporates the idea of rational expectations into a dynamic general equilibrium model. The agents in Lucas's model are rational: based on the available information, they form expectations about future prices and quantities, and based on these expectations they act to maximize their expected lifetime utility. He also provide sound theoretical fundamental to Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps's view of the long-run neutrality of money, and provide an explanation of the correlation between output and inflation, depicted by the Phillips curve.

===Lucas critique===

Lucas (1976) challenged the foundations of macroeconomic theory (previously dominated by the Keynesian economics approach), arguing that a macroeconomic model should be built as an aggregated version of microeconomic models (while noting that aggregation in the theoretical sense may not be possible within a given model). He developed the "Lucas critique" of economic policymaking, which holds that relationships that appear to hold in the economy, such as an apparent relationship between inflation and unemployment, could change in response to changes in economic policy. This led to the development of new classical macroeconomics and the drive towards microeconomic foundations for macroeconomic theory.

===Other contributions===

He developed a theory of supply that suggests people can be tricked by unsystematic monetary policy; the Lucas-Uzawa model (with Hirofumi Uzawa) of human capital accumulation; and the "Lucas paradox", which considers why more capital does not flow from developed countries to developing countries. Lucas (1988) is a seminal contribution in the economic development and growth literature. Lucas and Paul Romer heralded the birth of endogenous growth theory and the resurgence of research on economic growth in the late 1980s and the 1990s.
He also contributed foundational contributions to behavioral economics, and has provided the intellectual foundation that enables us to understand deviations from the law of one price based on the irrationality of investors.
In 2003, he proclaimed, the “central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.”[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05krugman.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=The New York Times | date=January 4, 2009[/tpl]
