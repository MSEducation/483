The Max Fatchen Expressway (route M20), previously known as the Northern Expressway,[tpl]cite news|title=More than memory lane: Fatchen's expressway|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-06/max-fatchen-name-for-expressway/5072234|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=ABC News (Australia)[tpl]![/tpl]ABC News|date=6 November 2013[/tpl]   is a 23 kilometre long controlled-access highway in Adelaide, South Australia. It travels from Gawler (on National Highway A20, the Sturt Highway) to Port Wakefield Road (on National Highway A1). The road has been built to four-lane standard and provides a faster route between Adelaide and Gawler, whilst reducing the amount of traffic on Main North Road, which passes through the heart of the northern suburbs and is interspersed with frequent traffic lights. It also allows freight avoid residential areas and go straight to Port Wakefield Road and onto the Port River Expressway (A9) to reach the harbour at Port Adelaide.

==History==

The largest road project undertaken in South Australia in at least sixty years, the expressway was delivered at a cost of approximately $564 million jointly funded by the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments. The Design and Construct contract was awarded to the Fulton Hogan York Joint Venture, a partnership between trans-Tasman contractor Fulton Hogan and South Australian based York Civil. The design joint venture, managed by Fulton Hogan York Joint Venture consisted of Maunsell, SMEC and Dare Sutton Clark. The work included an 8Â km upgrade of the existing Port Wakefield Road. Part of the cost was covered by the AusLink national transport funding.[tpl]cite news |title=Major expressway opens up north |author=Paul Starick |date=15 November 2006 |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20759351-5006301,00.html |accessdate=2006-11-15 | work=The Advertiser[/tpl]
Construction began in 2008 and the road opened on 13 September 2010.[tpl]cite web |title=Northern Expressway open for business |author=Tom Zed, Transport reporter |date=13 September 2010 |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/northern-expressway-open-for-business/story-e6frea83-1225921032131 |accessdate=2010-09-13[/tpl]
The interchanges/bridges along the expressway were all named after famous battles in which Australian forces fought, such as Long Tan, Kokoda, Tobruk and Kapyong.
In November 2013, one year after the death of prominent South Australian author and journalist Max Fatchen, the Northern Expressway was renamed the Max Fatchen Expressway in his honour.

==Proposed Northern Connector==

In early 2008, the South Australian Government announced plans for the Northern Connector, an eight lane connector roadway, linking the Northern Expressway and South Road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://infrastructure.sa.gov.au/northern_connector/content| title=Northern Connector |publisher=Infrastructure S.A. | date= |accessdate=2010-06-12[/tpl] This would involve the construction of a four-way cloverstack interchange at the Port River Expressway / South Road  intersection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://infrastructure.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/41102/Northern_Connector_Brochure_V4_June.pdf |title=northern connector |publisher=Infrastructure S.A. |date= |accessdate=2010-06-12[/tpl] This project would also include a major diversion in the main ARTC interstate rail line, which would run down the middle of the new connector freeway between Dry Creek, South Australia and Taylors Road at Waterloo Corner.
