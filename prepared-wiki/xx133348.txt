==Area history==

The Pictish stones on display at Meigle are a manifestation of the rich early history of the local area. As further testimony to the Pictish era approximately three kilometres to the east is the village of Eassie noted for the presence of the Eassie Stone; this carved Pictish stone is dated to the Early Middle Ages.C.Michael Hogan, Eassie Stone, The Megalithic Portal, ed.

The Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum[ref]Meigle Pictish Stones at Undiscovered Scotland
[/ref] is housed in the former Victorian village school and contains an important collection of more than thirty Pictish Stones, along with some later carvings, dating between the 8th and 10th centuries, many of them superbly carved (Historic Scotland; open April-end September, entrance charge).  This collection is one of the finest of its type in Western Europe.  The village was probably the site of an important Early Medieval Pictish monastery, centred on the present church and churchyard.
Nearby Belmont Castle, constructed from the 15th century, originally as a residence of the Bishops of Dunkeld, was the residence of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1836-1908), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1905-08.  He is buried in the village churchyard. A mural monument to his memory if built into the north-east wall of the church.
