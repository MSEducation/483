Brooks Ulysses Lawrence (January 30, 1925 – April 27, 2000) was a Major League Baseball All-Star pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals (1954–1955), Cincinnati Redlegs (1956–1959), and Cincinnati Reds (1960). 
Lawrence was born in Springfield, Ohio, and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  His career started in the Negro National League, where he earned the nickname "Bull".
His Major League debut came in 1954.  As a 29-year-old rookie, Lawrence went 15–6 with a 3.74 ERA while starting and relieving for the 1954 St. Louis Cardinals.  Lawrence struggled in 1955 and he was demoted to Oakland (in the Pacific Coast League), but he went 5–1 down the stretch and earned a second chance with the big-league club.
Lawrence's best season came in 1956. Prior to that year, St. Louis sent Lawrence and Sonny Senerchia to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Jackie Collum. With the Reds that season, Lawrence posted a 19–10 record and a 3.99 ERA. He opened the season with 13 consecutive wins and earned a spot on the National League All-Star team. That year he led the Reds in wins, innings pitched and shutouts. 
Lawrence's career came to a close in 1960, and he retired with an overall record of 69–62 with a 4.25 ERA in 1,040.7 innings pitched. Thanks largely to his 13-game winning streak and his association with the surprisingly successful 1956 Reds club, Lawrence earned induction into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1976.
After his retirement from baseball, Lawrence worked for International Harvester in his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. He later worked for the Cincinnati Reds in scouting, minor league player development, and radio and television. 
He died on April 27, 2000.
