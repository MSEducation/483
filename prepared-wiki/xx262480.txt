==History==

The idea for Lake Murray Symphony Orchestra began in 2001 when a small group of musicians performed with the Lexington County Choral Society. Several players in that group saw the potential for a larger ensemble and founded a steering committee. Headed by artistic director Dr. Einar Anderson, the committee successfully incorporated the orchestra, recruited additional musicians, obtained non-profit status, held a fund raising event, and organized LMSO's premiere concert, which was presented on March 28, 2004. The first Board of Directors was elected May 18, 2004.

In 2010, the symphony performed for the opening of the Midlands Technical College Harbison Theatre located in Irmo, South Carolina.  Following that performance,MidlandsBiz the Harbison Theatre was selected to be the performance hall home for the symphony.
Their annual fundraiser, the Wine & Waltzes Gala event, is held in September.  Following Wine & Waltzes, the symphony performs at the Saluda Shoals Park Unearth Celebration of Naturally Inspired ArtUnearth Celebration of Naturally Inspired Art in early October.  In addition to public event performances, the symphony also performs an additional three Sunday Concerts during their concert season.
Beginning in the 2012-13 concert season, the Lake Murray Symphony orchestra launched its first annual Young Artist Competition.  This event is a music competition for high school students living in Lexington or Richland counties in South Carolina.  The competition provides cash prizes to the top three young performers, and the grand prize is an invitation to perform the solo work with the symphony.
With the exception of Wine & Waltzes Gala fundraiser event, and in keeping with the mission statement of the Lake Murray Symphony Orchestra, all concerts presented by the symphony are free to the public.
