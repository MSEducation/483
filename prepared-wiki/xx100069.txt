==History==

===Formation===

The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts was started by Sir Paul McCartney and Mark Featherstone-Witty.
It was a meeting of two ideas: McCartney had known since 1985 that the building which had housed his old school — the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys — was becoming increasingly derelict after the school's closure, and wished to find a productive use for it; Mark Featherstone-Witty had set up the Brit School in London, and wanted to try his ideas on a bigger scale.
Featherstone-Witty had been fired up by Alan Parker’s 1980 film Fame, about the New York High School for the Performing Arts. The film inspired him to think about what training would have best prepared him and others for lasting work in the arts and entertainment industry. The film gave him the idea that performing artists needed to train in all three performing arts (acting, dance and music) at the same time. Then he read a book about musicians who had failed to understand they were entering a business, despite the phrase "show business". He also took on board the idea that performers formed the tip of an arts and entertainment employment iceberg. Performers were a fraction of the employment. From these basic concepts, he created a blueprint for a new type of training and then spent three years quizzing the industry and refining his philosophy. By 1985 he had nearly 50 artists, directors, choreographers and entrepreneurs backing him.
Record producer Sir George Martin knew that Featherstone-Witty was looking for somewhere to develop a school, and that McCartney was looking for someone who could save the building, and so introduced them to each other. The struggle to create the facility and the school took seven years and is described in more detail on LIPA's website, and in a book by Featherstone-Witty. It was not easy, but then, as McCartney reminds Featherstone-Witty from time to time, "if it were easy, everyone would be doing it". It took £20m for the facility, the curriculum and the support to maintain and develop all three.

===1996 - today===

LIPA was opened by Her Majesty The Queen on 7 June 1996, and since then its range of courses has expanded with each new academic year. From the start, the desire and so the challenge was to achieve excellence with access.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] The final solution was to offer higher education courses to achieve excellence and a range of open and flexible learning courses to achieve access. To this day, both embody the heart of the Institute.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
LIPA celebrated its tenth birthday in January 2006 with a performance at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall and a new book, 'LIPA - The First Ten Years in Pictures',LIPA - The First Ten Years In Pictureshttp://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0953942325, written by Mark Featherstone-Witty.
There have been a variety of highlights, the most rewarding being the achievement of the initial dream of sustained employment. A recent survey of graduates who left in 2007 showed that 96% were in work, and 87% of those were working in the performing arts.LIPA website In order to sustain this, the curriculum is constantly being revised.‘'LIPA website - About LIPA'' http://www.lipa.ac.uk/content/AboutUs.aspx,
LIPA was designated in 2006 – the first new higher education institution to have been started from scratch in living memory. As a performing arts HEI, LIPA is attended by the highest number of international students in the UK.‘'LIPA website - International Students'' http://www.lipa.ac.uk/content/International.aspx,
LIPA has been awarded the Silver Standard from Investors in People - the only HEI to have achieved this level in the UK.LIPA website - 'LIPA sets new standard in performing arts sector' LIPA also has the highest concentration of Fellows and Associates recognised by The Higher Education Academy.
In March 2012, LIPA announced that it had purchased John Lennon's old art school building, the former Liverpool College of Art for £3.7million to expand its teaching space.BBC News - Paul McCartney's LIPA buys John Lennon's art college building http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17559886,

==Companions==

LIPA does not want to issue its own degrees, so rather than issuing Honorary Degrees like other British universities, it awards "Companionships". LIPA awards companionships to individuals in recognition of their contributions to the world of art and entertainment, particularly within the sectors to which LIPA is linked.
Prospective companions usually attend the Institute at least once before they are invited to become companions in order to give masterclasses to students, or to participate in "Conversation with" type question and answer sessions. Some then revisit the Institute at later dates.
