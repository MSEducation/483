==Pre-Construction==

The Victorian Baseball Association was granted [tpl]A$[/tpl]50,000 by the State Government of Victoria in the early 1980s to construct a grandstand around the outfield fence of Ross Straw Field in Parkville (Then home of the VBA), However due to local resident and City of Melbourne opposition this did not eventuate.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, ISBN 0803264402
After the disappointment of Ross Straw Field the Victorian Baseball Association spent the next 10 years lobbying state government for a venue that Baseball and Softball in Victoria could call their own home. The Department of Sport and Recreation commissioned consultants Loader & Bailey to make a list of locations for a possible venue, A short list of 8 locations was made that included; Brunswick Cricket Ground at number 1, Albert Park at the South Melbourne Cricket Ground, Dandenong North (cnr Heatherton and Stud road) and Altona at number 5.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, ISBN 0803264402

==Construction==

When Altona was selected as the location for the Stadium there was much opposition in the Victorian Baseball Association over its selection, ABC commentator and Waverley Baseball Club coach Dick Mason took his concerns to the Minister for Sport and had the construction postponed while the Government reviewed the location.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, ISBN 0803264402
Former Victorian Baseball Association president and Australia Baseball Federation director Ron Smith was the major driving force behind the selection of the Altona location, he reasoned that the land was free and more money could be spent on developing the venue instead of buying somewhere to build it, However other land more centrally located was also offered for free.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, ISBN 0803264402
In 1988 the funds were released and construction of the stadium started not long after, it was completed in 1989 in time for the maiden season of the ABL. The official opening was held in January 1990 and was officially opened by the Minister for Sport, the Honourable Neil Tresize.Ballpark information Melbourne Ballpark
