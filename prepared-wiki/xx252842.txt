The Roxxxy prototype is claimed to have been modeled after a college-aged Caucasian fine arts student.
According to the website of the company, Roxxxy is not limited to sexual uses and "can carry on a discussion and expresses her love to you. She can talk to you, listen to you and feel your touch." Other features include touch sensors that give Roxxxy the ability to sense when it is being moved. The robot's vocabulary may be updated with the help of a laptop (connected to the back by cables) and the Internet.[tpl]cite news |title= Roxxxy the sex robot focuses on meaningful conversation instead of lifelike movement|author= Peter Svensson|url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iLulKBwj4dp9evDPdb_HGvIBti1Q|agency = The Canadian Press|date= January 11, 2010|accessdate= 2010-01-11[/tpl]

According to Douglas Hines, Roxxxy garnered about 4,000 pre-orders shortly after its AEE reveal in 2010. However, to date, no actual customers have ever surfaced with a Roxxxy doll, and the public has remained skeptical that any commercial Roxxxy dolls have ever been produced.
