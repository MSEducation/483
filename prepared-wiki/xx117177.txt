The Reed Rowdies are the official student support group of Texas A&M University's Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball teams, named for Reed Arena, where the Aggies play.  The loosely-organized group hosts tailgate parties before home games and strives to be as loud and obnoxious toward the opposing team as possible.  The money the group raises through their lone fundraiser, selling Reed Rowdies t-shirts, allows them to purchase signs and banners and to offer discounted road game tickets to their members.
The Reed Rowdies worked with the Aggie Yell Leaders to devise yells fit for the fast pace of a basketball game while adopting several traditional yells to be used during time outs.
During the 2009-10 men's basketball season, the Reed Rowdies were instrumental in helping to set three attendance records in Reed Arena.
