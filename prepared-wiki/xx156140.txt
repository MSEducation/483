As a child, Clare traveled frequently, spending time in Switzerland, England, and France. She returned to Los Angeles for high school, and from then on split her time between California and New York, where she worked at various entertainment magazines and tabloids, including The Hollywood Reporter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ebookstore.sony.com/ebook/cassandra-claire/mortal-instruments-trilogy-sample-of-the-citys/_/R-400000000000000168871 |title=Author's bio at Sony.com[/tpl]
While living in Los Angeles Clare began writing fan fiction using the name Cassandra Claire. The Draco Trilogy based on Harry Potter and The Very Secret Diaries based on The Lord of the Rings were popular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article782039.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|title=The Times article on The Draco Trilogy[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lookingglassreview.com/html/cassandra_clare.html|title=Author's Bio at LookingGlassReview.com[/tpl] However, she deleted her fan fiction from the Internet shortly before her first novel, The City of Bones, was published under the name Cassandra Clare.
She is also friends with author Holly Black, and their books occasionally overlap, Clare mentioning characters from Black's novels and vice versa, such as Val and Luis from Black's Valiant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cassandraclare.com/cms/faqs#valiant|title=www.cassandraclare.com/cms/faqs#valiant[/tpl]
Clare is also credited by her publisher with creating the "City of Fallen Angels treatment" where a tangible "letter" from one character to another is attached to the back of physical copies of a book. The goal is to spur print book sales.[tpl]cite news|last=Kaplan|first=David A.|title=A most unusual father-daughter professional pairing|url=http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/29/cassandra-clare-richard-rumelt/|newspaper=CNN Money|date=August 29, 2012[/tpl]

==The Mortal Instruments series==

In 2004, Clare started working on her first-published novel, City of Bones, inspired by the urban landscape of Manhattan. City of Bones was released by Simon & Schuster in 2007.
City of Bones, a contemporary fantasy story revolving around characters Clary Fray, Jace Wayland, and Simon Lewis, became a New York Times bestseller upon its release. City of Ashes and City of Glass (Mortal Instruments) completed the trilogy. In 2009, a fourth installment, City of Fallen Angels, was announced. It was published on April 5, 2011.[tpl]cite web | work=goodreads.com| title=City of Fallen Angels (Mortal Instruments, #4)| url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6752378-city-of-fallen-angels | year=2009| accessdate=23 September 2009[/tpl]
Clare has stated that City of Fallen Angels is actually the start of a second Mortal Instruments cycle, which will include two other books named City of Lost Souls and City of Heavenly Fire. She said this new cycle is going to be centered on the same characters as in the first cycle, as well as a few new characters we will meet in the new books.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cassandraclare.livejournal.com/41645.html|title=the news!|first=Cassandra|last=Clare|date=6 August 2010|work=Cassandra Clare's Blog|publisher=LiveJournal|accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl]
In 2009, Clare also announced a new series of prequels called The Infernal Devices set in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but in the Victorian era. This series is planned to consist of three books: Clockwork Angel, published on August 31, 2010, Clockwork Prince, published on December 6, 2011, and Clockwork Princess, published on March 19, 2013.[tpl]cite web | title=What are the publication dates of Clockwork Princess and City of Heavenly Fire?| url=http://www.cassandraclare.com/?qa_faqs=publication[/tpl]
