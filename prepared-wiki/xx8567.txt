[[Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands

Politics of the Northern Mariana Islands takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic system, whereby the Governor is head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. The Northern Mariana Islands are a commonwealth in political union with the United States. Executive power is exercised by the governor. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Local government is carried out through three regional mayors.
The Northern Mariana Islands and the United States of America reached a Covenant Agreement which became fully effective on November 4, 1986. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on January 1, 1978.

==Political culture==

Historically the Northern Mariana Islands have been subject to the colonizing powers of Spain, Germany, Japan, and the United States under a United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands Agreement.  Each power contributed elements that mixed with local indigenous cultures to form the current political culture of the Northern Mariana Islands.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
When United States citizenship was granted in 1986 to people who qualified as descendants of the Northern Marianas, few among the island's native population had been adequately prepared for democracy.  As a result, politics in the Northern Mariana Islands is often "more a function of family relationships and personal loyalties" where the size of one's extended family is more important than a candidate's personal qualifications. Both scholarly works and the authors of the controversial website Saipansucks.com charge that this is nepotism carried out within the trappings of democracy.http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/58992651http://www.saipantribune.com/archives/newsstoryarch.aspx?cat=3&newsID=1594&archdte=3/30/1999%2012:00:00%20AM.[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
