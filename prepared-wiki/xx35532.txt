The area is an ancient landscape which has been above sea level for well over 200 million years and remained unglaciated. As a result, the area is home to many primitive relict species.[tpl]cite AHD|9816|Cape Le Grand National Park|date=2010|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl]
Established in 1966, the park is managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation.
The name Le Grand is from one of the officers on L'Esperance, one of the ships in the 1792 expedition of Bruni d'Entrecasteaux.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.australiannationalparks.com/westernaustralia/CapeLeGrand/default.htm |title= Cape Le Grande |work=Australian National Parks |year=2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010[/tpl]
