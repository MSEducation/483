==Life and career==

===Early life===

Brewster was born in Longmeadow, Massachusetts,Kabaservice, 17 the son of Florence Foster (née Besse), a 1907 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College,Kabaservice, 16–17Cutter, 967 and Kingman Brewster, Sr., a 1906 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Amherst College and a 1911 graduate of the Harvard Law School.Jones, 235–521Kabaservice, 16Obituary: "Kingman Brewster, Jr." New York Times. November 9, 1988. He was a direct lineal descendant of Elder William Brewster (c. 1567 - April 10, 1644), the Mayflower passenger, Pilgrim colonist leader, and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, through his son Jonathan Brewster; he was also descended from Mayflower passenger John Howland.[ref]

In 1923, when he was 4, his parents separated and later divorced.Kabaservice, 17 He and his surviving sister, Mary, were raised by their mother first in Springfield, Massachusetts and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother was a firm influence but never overbearing. One of Brewster's friends characterized her as "one of those people whose presence you always felt when she was in the room".Kabaservice, 18 Another friend remembered that "she knew poetry, she knew music, she knew art, she knew architecture, and believe me, she knew Kingman."Kabaservice, 18
Brewster wrote that his mother was a "marvelously speculative and philosophical type," a "free-thinking spirit...given to far-out enthusiasms and delighting in sprightly arguments with her more intellectually conventional friends.Kabaservice, 17Kabaservice, 18
His mother remarried in 1932 to Edward Ballantine, a music professor at Harvard University and composer she had known since childhood. Brewster was, however, without a real father role, until his uncle, Arthur Besse, stepped into that role. Besse was by all accounts a very good surrogate father;Kabaservice, 20 one of Besse's sons described him as "a man of tremendous warmth and honesty, a generous and wonderfully moral person." Brewster described his stepfather as "marvelous, and sensitive to the point of vulnerability." Besse had no children of his own and did not want to play a fatherly role.Kabaservice, 20

===Marriage and family===

In 1942, while serving in the armed services, Brewster married Mary Louise Phillips in Jacksonville, Florida.Obituary: "Mary Louise Brewster" Yale University Office of Public Affairs. April 19, 2004.Kabaservice, 92–115–294 Phillips was born August 30, 1920 in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Mary and Eugene James Phillips,Kabaservice, 89 (he was a 1905 graduate of Yale College, and a 1907 graduate of Yale Law School). She graduated in 1939 from the Wheeler School and attended but did not graduate from Vassar College. She died on April 14, 2004 at her home in Combe, Berkshire, England at age 83. She was buried next to her husband in the Grove Street Cemetery.Obituary: "Mary Louise Brewster" Yale Bulletin&Calendar. April 23, 2004.
Brewster and his wife had 5 children. Their granddaughter is actress Jordana Brewster. His first cousin was Janet Huntington BrewsterJones, 235–521Kabaservice, 486Sperber, 11–12–15–16–17–22–50 (September 18, 1910 –December 18, 1998) who was an American philanthropist, writer, radio broadcaster and relief worker during World War II in London. She was married to Edward R. Murrow (April 25, 1908 – April 27, 1965) who was an American broadcast journalist. His uncle, Stanley King, (May 11, 1883 – April 28, 1951) was the eleventh president of Amherst College. He held that position from 1932 to 1946.Kabaservice, 32

===Education and war years===

After graduating from Belmont Hill SchoolKabaservice, 25–28–51 in Belmont, Massachusetts, Brewster entered Yale University,Kabaservice, 51 graduating in 1941 where he was chairman of the Yale Daily News.  His junior year, he turned down an offer of membership in Skull and Bones becoming a legend in Yale undergraduate lore.
Like many students at the time, he was an ardent opponent of America's intervention into World War II and was an outspoken isolationist.  He idolized fellow isolationist Charles Lindbergh.  He was entranced by his Trans-Atlantic flight, and remained, in his words, "bug-eyed about aviation" his entire life. He invited Lindbergh in 1940 to speak at Yale. At the time of the invitation, Lindbergh was the nation's best-known isolationist and the most prominent private citizen advocating to keep America out of the war. He and Lindbergh strategized on AFC.Kabaservice, 74
With the fall of France, he founded the America First Committee (AFC) along with other students at Yale.Kabaservice, 70  The founding members of the AFC included many of the East Coast Universities' best and the brightest, from valedictorians to football all-Americans to campus newspaper editors. Many of these men later achieved national reputations.  They included future President Gerald Ford; the first director of the Peace Corps Sargent Shriver; future Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart, and Congressman Jonathan Brewster Bingham.  AFC became the most prominent organization in the struggle to keep America out of the European war.
Brewster also took great care to ensure that the noninterventionist movement on campus was not led by social outcasts or malcontents but by "students who had attained relative respect and prominence during their undergraduate years".  He emphasized again and again that his group represented mainstream campus opinion, and that its views were "in agreement with the great majority of Americans of all ages".Kabaservice, 70
Before the end of his senior year, he had officially resigned from the committee after the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. He said at the time, "I still believe it outrageous to commit this country to the outcome of the war abroad and wish to limit that commitment as much as possible," he wrote Potter Stewart, but "the question from now on is not one of principle it is one of military strategy and administrative policy." Since the passage of Lend-Lease into law, "there is no room for an avowed pressure group huing [tpl]sic[/tpl] a dogmatic line.  Whether we like it or not America has decided what its ends are, and the question of means is not longer a legislative matter.  A national pressure group therefore is not aiming to determine policy, it is seeking to obstruct it.  I cannot be a part of that effort."Kabaservice, 83
With the attack on Pearl Harbor on the morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941, he immediately volunteered for service in the U.S. Navy.Kabaservice, 99 During World War II he was a Navy aviator and flew on submarine-hunting patrols over the Atlantic. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1946. After the war he entered Harvard Law School, becoming note editor and treasurer of the Harvard Law Review. In 1948, he received his law degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School.Kabaservice, 98

===Career===

====Marshall Plan====

Brewster's first job after graduating was to accompany Professor Milton Katz to Paris, France to serve as his assistant at the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan.Kabaservice, 114  Professor Katz, was a teacher and scholar of international law at Harvard Law School and the administrator of the United States Marshall Plan. Though he flourished in the job, he stayed only one year, returning in 1949 -at Katz's advice- to be a research associate in MIT's Department of Economics and Social Science.

====Massachusetts Institute of Technology====

From 1949 and 1950, Brewster was a research associate in the Department of Economics and Social Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

====Harvard University====

From 1950 to 1953, he was an assistant professor of law at Harvard University, and from 1953 to 1960 he was a full professor at Harvard Law School.

====Yale====

In 1960, Brewster accepted the post of provost at Yale, serving from 1960 to 1963. After the death of Yale's president, A. Whitney Griswold, despite the fact that Brewster was considered Griswold's logical successor, Yale conducted a lengthy, open, and agonizing search (for Brewster) that lasted five months. On October 11, 1963, the Yale Corporation offered him the presidency by a vote of 13-2; the opposition came from two senior members of the Corporation who feared that the liberal Republican would push too hard for change in their beloved institution.Karabel, 342 He served as president of Yale University from 1963 to 1977."Kingman Brewster, Jr. succeeds Dr. Griswold as President" New York Times. October 13, 1963."Kingman Brewster, Jr. installed as 17th President" New York Times. April 5, 1964.
Brewster was known for the improvements he made to Yale's faculty, curriculum, and admissions policies. He was president of the University when Yale began admitting women as undergraduates.Karabel, 421–423 Academic programs in various disciplines were expanded. He was also president when the faculty voted to terminate academic credit for the Reserve Officers Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) program in June 1971 due to the belief that the ROTC program made the University complicit in the war in Vietnam. Alumni relations grew testy at times, yet fundraising increased throughout his tenure.
Brewster's appointment of liberal theologian Rev. William Sloane Coffin to the post of university chaplain is described in Coffin's autobiography, Once to Every Man.Coffin, William Sloan, Once to Every Man: A Memoir, autobiography, Athenaeum Press, 1977, ISBN 0-689-10811-7 After his appointment, Coffin, a former CIA operative, Williams College chaplain and Skull & Bones alum, became an ardent anti-war activist. In 1967, along with Benjamin Spock, Yale 1925, he organized a mass protest in Boston, Massachusetts and then sent hundreds of draft cards back to the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, D.C. When Brewster defended Coffin, who was arrested in 1968 together with Spock for encouraging draft resistance, he did so citing academic freedom. This action only complicated his dealings with an increasingly wary alumni association.Kabaservice, 319
Brewster was chairman of the National Policy Panel of the United Nations in 1968. He was a member of the President's Commission on Selective Service in 1966 and 1967 and of the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice from 1965 to 1967.

=====Wallace Affair=====

In 1963, Governor George Wallace was invited by the Yale Political Union to speak at Yale; Provost Brewster asked the Yale Political Union to revoke its invitation for security reasons. The result was a massive outcry across campus. The Woodward Report on free speech, commissioned by Brewster in 1974 was issued in 1975. Historian C. Vann Woodward chaired the committee. The committee labeled the so-called “Wallace Affair” an outright failure."Report of the Woodward Committee" December 23, 1974.

=====Black Panthers=====
