The Nathan and Mary (Polly) Johnson properties are a National Historic Landmark (NHL) at 17-19 and 21 Seventh Street in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Originally two structures, one dating to the 1820s and an 1857 house joined with the older one shortly after construction. They have since been restored and now house the New Bedford Historical Society.[tpl]cite web|title=Restorations|url=http://www.newbedfordhistory.org/restor.html|publisher=New Bedford Historical Society|accessdate=2008-07-21[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The Johnsons were free African-Americans and Quakers who ran a meetinghouse and are known to have sheltered escaped slaves using the Underground Railroad from 1822 on. Both were also successful in local business; Nathan as a pharmacist and Polly as a confectioner.
One escaped slave who passed through the Johnsons' house was Frederick Douglass, who settled in New Bedford in 1838. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, when it was designated an NHL.NHL Listing
