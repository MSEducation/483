The Jinfo Mountain salamander (Pseudohynobius jinfo) is a species of salamander in the Hynobiidae family. It is endemic to China, known only from Nanchuan District in Chongqing (formerly Sichuan). Its type locality is a spring-fed pond on Mount Jinfo. Pseudohynobius from Nanchuan were first assumed to be yellow-spotted salamanders (P. flavomaculatus), but genetic methods, and later on, discovery of adult salamanders, allowed them to be identified as a new species.[tpl]cite journal| volume = 2149| pages = 62â€“68| last = Wei| first = Gang| coauthors = Jian-Li Xiong, Mian Hou, Xiao-Mao Zeng| title = A new species of hynobiid salamander (Urodela: Hynobiidae: Pseudohynobius) from Southwestern China| journal = Zootaxa | year = 2009[/tpl]
