February Son is the major label debut album from post-grunge band Oleander. It was released on Universal Records in 1999 and eventually went gold.

==Promotion and touring==

The album features Oleander's breakout lead single, "Why I'm Here," and "I Walk Alone." The latter had a music video while the lead single was featured on the popular TV series Dawson's Creek. A cover of The Cure's "Boys Don't Cry" would serve as a UK single backed by a video in the summer of 2000. Directed by Cousin Mike, the video stars Bloodhound Gang leader Jimmy Pop who played a nerdy man living in an apartment. Oleander surrounds him as they loudly perform the song, forcing him to weep. Frontman Thomas Flowers explained that the song "really typifies and exemplifies everything that I'm already trying to say on the album."Gottlieb, Meridith Oleander Taps Bloodhound Gang's Pop For Video MTV.com (June 12, 2000).

"Why I'm Here" appeared on Now, Vol. 3 and Universal Smash Hits. "I Walk Alone" landed on the Bravo Hits, Vol. 28 and Shine! compilations, and Gravity Games 2000: Summer Sounds, Vol. 1 featured "Where Were You Then?".

==Reception==

February Son received some criticism for allegedly imitating the influential grunge flagship Nirvana, particularly on "Why I'm Here" which begins with a similar note pattern as "Heart-Shaped Box."[tpl]cite web | title=Thomas Flowers of Oleander | author=Michael Christopher | url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/oleander-030505/ | accessdate=2013-12-07 | publisher=PopMatters[/tpl]  However, despite the accusation, other songs have been cited as boasting unique and enjoyable melodies, and the album managed to sell over a half-million copies.
Adrianne Stone of Rolling Stone also described the album with content. She cited, "Razor sharp guitars on 'Lost Cause,' violin enhancing the warm tones of first single 'Why I'm Here,' and a surprise false ending on 'Never Again' are typical augmentations on a riff-laden album that hints of Nirvana's pained alterna-pop."Stone, Adrianne Oleander Toy With Love, Agression, Melody  Rolling Stone (February 24, 1999).
