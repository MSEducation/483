There are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet. The impact of AIDS is particularly notable on life expectancy in many African countries. According to predictions made by the United Nations (UN) in 2002,"World Population Prospects — The 2002 Revision", 2003, page 24 the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:
The UN's predictions were too pessimistic. Actual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.Life expectancy by country, Global Health Observatory Data Repository, World Health Organization
During the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In the United States, African people have shorter life expectancies than their European counterparts. For example, white Americans born in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but African Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since at least 1975. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993."Deaths: Final Data for 2010", National Vital Statistics Reports, authored by Sherry L. Murphy, Jiaquan Xu, and Kenneth D. Kochanek, volume 61, number 4, page 12, 8 May 2013 In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health - Asian American/Pacific Islander Profile. Retrieved 2013-10-01 The life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years.

===Economic circumstances===

Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is several years longer than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.Department of Health -Tackling health inequalities: Status report on the Programme for Action In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world; life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54 – 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only eight kilometres away.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7584056.stm#Life%20expectancy|title=Social factors key to ill health|date=2008-08-28|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7584450.stm|title=GP explains life expectancy gap|date=2008-08-28|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl]
A 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy.[tpl]cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|title=Research ties economic inequality to gap in life expectancy|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/research-ties-economic-inequality-to-gap-in-life-expectancy/2013/03/10/c7a323c4-7094-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=March 10, 2013[/tpl] However, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually increased during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172530.htm|title=Did The Great Depression Have A Silver Lining? Life Expectancy Increased By 6.2 Years|date=2009-09-29|accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] The authors suggest that when people are working extra hard during good economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.
Life expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have shorter than average life expectancies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, obesity, access to health care, diet, exercise, tobacco smoking, drug use and excessive alcohol use.

===Gender differences===

Women tend to have a lower mortality rate at every age. In the womb, male fetuses have a higher mortality rate (babies are conceived in a ratio estimated to be from 107 to 170 males to 100 females, but the ratio at birth in the United States is only 105 males to 100 females).Kalben, Barbara Blatt. "Why Men Die Younger: Causes of Mortality Differences by Sex". Society of Actuaries", 2002, p. 17.http://www.soa.org/library/monographs/life/why-men-die-younger-causes-of-mortality-differences-by-sex/2001/january/m-li01-1-05.pdf Among the smallest premature babies (those under 2 pounds or 900 g), females again have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8 years in 1979 to 5.3 years in 2005, with women expected to live to age 80.1 in 2005.[tpl]cite web | last = Hitti | first = Miranda | title = U.S. Life Expectancy Best Ever, Says CDC| work = eMedicine | publisher = WebMD | date = February 28, 2005 | url = http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/news/20050228/us-life-expectancy-best-ever-says-cdc | accessdate = 2011-01-18 [/tpl]
In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age. This is no longer the case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor socio-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational or war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide).[tpl]cite web | author=World Health Organization | year= 2004 | work = The world health report 2004 - changing history | title = Annex Table 2: Deaths by cause, sex and mortality stratum in WHO regions, estimates for 2002 | url = http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2008-11-01[/tpl] Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema,prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.
Some argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger (size) individuals (within a species) tend, on average, to have shorter lives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jerrymondo.tripod.com/lgev/id1.html |title=Telemores, sexual size dimorphism and gender gap in life expectancy |publisher=Jerrymondo.tripod.com |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl]Samaras, Thomas T. und Heigh, Gregory H.: How human size affects longevity and mortality from degenerative diseases. Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients 159: 78-85, 133-139 This biological difference occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.
In her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. With the exception of birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.Kalben, Barbara Blatt.

There is a recent suggestion that mitochondrial mutations that shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.Fruit flies offer DNA clue to why women live longerEvolutionary biologist, PZ Myers agrees. Mother’s Curse

===Centenarians===

In developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.United Nations "World Population Ageing 2009"; ST/ESA/SER.A/295, Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York, Oct. 2010, liv + 73 pp. Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.Japan Times "Centenarians to Hit Record 44,000". The Japan Times, Sept. 15, 2010. Okinawa (667 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants in September 2010, had been for a long time the Japanese prefecture with the largest ratio of centenarians, partly because it also had the largest loss of young and middle-aged population during the Pacific War.
In the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants)."Resident Population. National Population Estimates for the 2000s. Monthly Postcensal Resident Population, by single year of age, sex, race, and Hispanic Origin", Bureau of the Census (updated monthly). Different figures, based on earlier assumptions (104,754 centenarians on Nov.1, 2009) are provided in "Older Americans Month: May 2010", Bureau of the Census, Facts for Features, March 2, 2010, 5 pp.

==Evolution and aging rate==

Various species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms that, by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle, live for long periods whilst avoiding accidents, disease, predation, etc., are likely to have genes that code for slow aging — which often translates to good cellular repair. This is theorized to be true because if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, then there will be less natural selection to increase intrinsic life span.[tpl]cite journal |author=Williams G |title=Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence |journal=Evolution |volume=11 |pages=398–411 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2406060 |issue=4 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution |jstor=2406060 [/tpl] The finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad,[tpl]cite journal |author=Austad SN |title=Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums |journal=J. Zool.

One prominent and very popular theory attributes aging to a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kirkwood TE |title=Evolution of aging |journal=Nature |volume=270 |pages=301–304 |year=1977 |doi=10.1038/270301a0 |pmid=593350 |issue=5635 [/tpl] Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats), shows a near doubling of life span due to a very limited calorific intake. Support for this theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy.http://physrev.physiology.org/content/87/4/1175.fullhttp://www.discoverymedicine.com/S-J-Olshansky/2009/07/25/what-determines-longevity-metabolic-rate-or-stabilityhttp://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/20/2399.full This is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long.http://www.immortalhumans.com/the-longevity-secret-for-tortoises-is-held-in-their-low-metabolism-rate/ Studies of humans with 100+ year life spans have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.
In a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between the fertility of the animal and its life span.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ricklefs RE, Cadena CD |title=Lifespan is unrelated to investment in reproduction in populations of mammals and birds in captivity |journal=Ecol.

==Calculating life expectancies==

The starting point for calculating life expectancies is the age-specific death rates of the population members. In the past, a very simple model of age-specific mortality used the Gompertz function, although these days more sophisticated methods are used.Anderson, Robert N. (1999) Method for constructing complete annual U.S. life tables. Vital and health statistics. Series 2, Data evaluation and methods research ; no. 129 (DHHS publication ; no. (PHS) 99-1329) PDF
In cases where the amount of data is relatively small, the most common methods are to fit a mathematical formula, such as an extension of the Gompertz function, to the data, or to look at an established mortality table previously derived for a larger population and make a simple adjustment to it (e.g. multiply by a constant factor) to fit the data.
With a large amount of data, one looks at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age, and applies smoothing (e.g. by cubic splines) to iron out any apparently random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next.
While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking and recapturing them.Linda J Young; Jerry H Young (1998) Statistical ecology : a population perspective. Kluwer Academic Publishers. p. 310 The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications, e.g. in aircraft, methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.Eliahu Zahavi,Vladimir Torbilo & Solomon Press (1996) Fatigue Design: Life Expectancy of Machine Parts. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-8970-4
Life expectancy is by definition an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from ages 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in year 1850, for example), of course, it can simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. These estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.
It is important to note that this statistic is usually based on past mortality experience, and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.
However for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used, thus assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have done in the past. This is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; however, some models do exist to account for the evolution of mortality (e.g., the Lee–Carter modelRonald D. Lee and Lawrence Carter. 1992. "Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality," Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (September): 659-671.).
As discussed above, on an individual basis, there are a number of factors that have been shown to correlate with a longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use including smoking and alcohol consumption, disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.

==Life expectancy forecasting==

Forecasting life expectancy and mortality forms an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs like U.S. Social Security and pension systems, because the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in PAYGO systems). With longer life expectancies, these systems see increased cash outflow; if these systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they won't be prepared for the large payments that will inevitably occur as humans live longer and longer.
Life expectancy forecasting usually is based on two different approaches:

==Policy uses of life expectancy==

Life expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation, along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/6.html |title=International Human Development Indicators — UNDP |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl]
Life expectancy is also used in describing the physical quality of life of an area.
Disparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support.
Life expectancies are also used when determining the value of a life settlement, a life insurance policy sold for a cash asset.

==Life expectancy vs. life span==

Life expectancy is often confused with life span to the point that they are nearly synonyms; when people hear 'life expectancy was 35 years' they often interpret this as meaning that people of that time or place had short life spans. Just because the life expectancy is set to a certain number doesn't mean that one can't exceed this set number. It's more like an average [ref]
