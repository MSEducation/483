The current publication started as two separate journals. The first publication, Istorik-Marksist ([tpl]lang-ru|Историк-марксист[/tpl]) was published from 1926 to 1941. The second publication, begun in 1931, was known as Borba Klassov ([tpl]lang-ru|Борьба классов[/tpl]), but in 1937 changed its name to Istoricheskii Zhurnal ([tpl]lang-ru|Исторический журнал[/tpl]). Istorik-Marksist was merged into Istoricheskii Zhurnal in 1941. In 1945 the journal's name was changed to the current Voprosy Istorii.
In 1957 the Russian historian Édourd Burdzhalov was dismissed as deputy editor of the journal after he published an article about the Bolshevik's confusion following the February Revolution in 1917.[ref]
