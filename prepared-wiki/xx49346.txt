[[Golden spiral]]

CATEGORIES: Spirals, Golden ratio

In geometry, a golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is [tpl]math|φ[/tpl], the golden ratio.Chang, Yu-sung, "Golden Spiral", The Wolfram Demonstrations Project. That is, a golden spiral gets wider (or further from its origin) by a factor of [tpl]math|φ[/tpl] for every quarter turn it makes.

==Formula==

The polar equation for a golden spiral is the same as for other logarithmic spirals, but with a special value of the growth factor [tpl]math|b[/tpl]:[tpl]cite book | title = Divine Proportion: [tpl]math|Φ[/tpl] Phi in Art, Nature, and Science | author = Priya Hemenway | isbn = 1-4027-3522-7 | publisher = Sterling Publishing Co | year = 2005 | pages = 127–129[/tpl]
or
with [tpl]math|e[/tpl] being the base of natural logarithms, [tpl]math|a[/tpl] being an arbitrary positive real constant, and [tpl]math|b[/tpl] such that when [tpl]math|θ[/tpl] is a right angle (a quarter turn in either direction):
Therefore, [tpl]math|b[/tpl] is given by

where the constant [tpl]math|c[/tpl] is given by:
which for the golden spiral gives [tpl]math|c[/tpl] values of:
if [tpl]math|θ[/tpl] is measured in degrees, and
if [tpl]math|θ[/tpl] is measured in radians.

==Approximations of the golden spiral==

There are several similar spirals that approximate, but do not exactly equal, a golden spiral.[tpl]cite book | title = Fractals in Music: introductory mathematics for musical analysis | author = Charles B. Madden | isbn = 0-9671727-6-4 | publisher = High Art Press | year = 1999 | pages = 14–16 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JhnERQLm4lUC&dq=rectangles+approximate+golden-spiral[/tpl] These are often confused with the golden spiral.
For example, a golden spiral can be approximated by first starting with a rectangle for which the ratio between its length and width is the golden ratio. This rectangle can then be partitioned into a square and a similar rectangle and the rectangle can then be split in the same way. After continuing this process for an arbitrary amount of steps, the result will be an almost complete partitioning of the rectangle into squares. The corners of these squares can be connected by quarter-circles. The result, though not a true logarithmic spiral, approximates a golden spiral (See image on top right).
Another approximation is a Fibonacci spiral, which is constructed similarly to the above method except that you start with a rectangle partitioned into 2 squares and then in each step add to the rectangle's longest side a square of the same length. Since the ratio between consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio as the Fibonacci numbers approach infinity, so too does this spiral get more similar to the previous approximation the more squares are added. (See image on middle right).

==Spirals in nature==

Approximate logarithmic spirals can occur in nature (for example, the arms of spiral galaxies[ref]
