Functional training is a classification of exercise which involves training the body for the activities performed in daily life.

==Origins==

Functional training has its origins in rehabilitation.  Physical and Occupational therapists often use this approach to retrain patients with movement disorders. Interventions are designed to incorporate task and context specific practice in areas meaningful to each patient, with an overall goal of functional independence.[tpl]cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Susan B.|title=Physical Therapy 5th Edition|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=glossary|isbn=0-8036-1247-8|pages=1335[/tpl] For example, exercises that mimic what patients did at home or work may be included in treatment in order to help them return to their lives or jobs after an injury or surgery.  Thus if a patient's job required repeatedly heavy lifting, rehabilitation would be targeted towards heavy lifting, if the patient were a parent of young children, it would be targeted towards moderate lifting and endurance, and if the patient were a marathon runner, training would be targeted towards re-building endurance. However, treatments are designed after careful consideration of the patient’s condition, what he or she would like to achieve, and ensuring goals of treatment are realistic and achievable. 
Functional training attempts to adapt or develop exercises which allow individuals to perform the activities of daily life more easily and without injuries.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jessec4.htm | title = Functional training | accessdate = 2007-08-26 | last = Cannone | first = Jesse[/tpl]
In the context of body building, functional training involves mainly weight bearing activities targeted at core muscles of the abdomen and lower back. Fabio Martella wrote that most fitness facilities have a variety of weight training machines which target and isolate specific muscles.  As a result the movements do not necessarily bear any relationship to the movements people make in their regular activities or sports.  
In rehabilitation, training does not necessarily have to involve weight bearing activities, but can target any task or a combination of tasks that a patient is having difficulty with. Balance (ability) training, for example, is often incorporated into a patient’s treatment plan if it has been impaired after injury or disease.

==Benefits==

===Functional training for sports===

Functional training, if performed correctly, will lead to better joint mobility and stability, as well as more efficient motor patterns. Improving these factors decreases the potential for an injury sustained during an athletic endeavor. performance in a sport.

Norfolk, Virginia, USA. Apr. 2013. [/tpl]  In comparison, though machines appears to be safer to use, they restrict movements to a single plane of motion, which is an unnatural form of movement for the body and may potentially lead to faulty movement patterns or injury.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.3dpts.com/ArchiveArticles/BodyArticle/2007-03-Bodyarticle.htm | title = What is Functional Resistance Training | first = Craig | last = Burton | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-26[/tpl] In 2009 Spennewyn conducted research, published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research which compared functional training to fixed variable training techniques, this was considered the first research of its type comparing the two methods of strength training.
Results of the study showed very substantial gains and benefits in the functional training group over fixed training equipment. Functional users had a 58% greater increase in strength over the
fixed-form group. Their improvements in balance were 196% higher over fixed and reported an overall decrease in joint pain by 30%.[ref]Spennewyn,K. 2008.

===Functional training rehabilitation in patients after stroke===

Rehabilitation after stroke has evolved over the past 15 years from conventional treatment techniques to task specific training techniques which involve training of basic functions, skills and endurance (muscular and cardiovascular).[tpl]cite journal|author=Timmermans, A.

Studies have also shown that patients make larger gains in functional tasks used in their rehabilitation and since they are more likely to continue practicing these tasks in everyday living, better results during follow-up are obtained.

==Equipment==

Standard resistance training machines are of limited use for functional training – their fixed patterns rarely mimic natural movements, and they focus the effort on a single muscle group, rather than engaging the stabilizers and peripheral muscles.
Some options include:

In rehabilitation however, equipment is mainly chosen by its relevance to the patient. In many cases equipment needs are minimal and include things that are familiar and useful to the patient.

===Cable machines===

Cable machines, also known as pulley machines, are large upright machines, either with a single pulley, or else a pulley attached to both sides.  They allow an athlete to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes.  Cable machines also provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions, provide a constant tension on the muscle, peak-contraction is possible at the top of each rep, a safe means of performing negative repetitions, and a variety of attachments that allow great flexibility in the exercises performed and body parts targeted.

==Components of a functional exercise program==

To be effective, a functional exercise program should include a number of different elements which can be adapted to an individual's needs or goals:
