[[Juno Awards of 1995]]

CATEGORIES: Juno Awards by year, 1995 music awards, 1995 in Canadian music, Culture of Hamilton, Ontario

The Juno Awards of 1995, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 26 March 1995 in Hamilton, Ontario at a ceremony in the Copps Coliseum. Mary Walsh, Rick Mercer and other regulars of the television series This Hour Has 22 Minutes were the hosts for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television. Almost 10,000 people were in attendance, and over 6,500 public tickets were sold.
Nominees were announced on 1 February 1995. Susan Aglukark and Jann Arden were among the prominent nominees this year. Vancouver rock band 54-40's album Smilin' Buddha Cabaret was accidentally left off the nomination list for Best Alternative Album; after realizing the error, the Academy decided to add them to the category, and rather than remove another band's album simply widened the category to six nominees.[tpl]cite news |title=Juno admits to goof, adds B.C. band to list |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=24 February 1995 |page=C10 [/tpl]
Leonard Rambeau, the long-time manager of Anne Murray, received a special lifetime achievement award; Rambeau died later that year of cancer.
