This list of theatrical animated feature films consists of animated films released by The Walt Disney Studios, the film division of The Walt Disney Company.
Currently, the The Walt Disney Studios releases films from Disney-owned and non-Disney owned animation studios. Most films listed below are from Walt Disney Animation Studios which began as the animation division of Walt Disney Productions, producing animated short films since 1923. The studio produced its first feature-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and as of 2014 has produced a total of 53 feature films.Animated films listed as produced by Walt Disney were either entirely produced prior to 1986 as part of the animation department of Walt Disney Productions or by the restructured studio unit Walt Disney Feature Animation, known after 2006 as Walt Disney Animation Studios. Some films may have been animated at various satellite animation studios as well.

Other studio units have also released films theatrically, namely Walt Disney Television Animation (now DisneyToon Studios) and the studio's distribution unit, which acquires film rights from outside animation studios to release films under the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, or previously owned Miramax film labels.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]  In 1996, The Walt Disney Studios signed a deal with Tokuma Shoten for distribution rights to the theatrical works of Studio Ghibli world-wide (excluding Asia except for Japan and Taiwan and excluding Grave of the Fireflies which was not published by Tokuma), including what then was the most recent film, Princess Mononoke.  The deal later grew to include DVD rights and newer Ghibli movies;  the English language Disney release of Spirited Away won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.  Studio Ghibli remains wholly independent of Disney and maintains strict creative control over the handling of the foreign language localization Disney produces.The Disney-Tokuma Deal //.

All of the theatrical Ghibli back catalog originally included in the deal have since been released to DVD in North America (except Only Yesterday) and several other countries. Other studios globally have released films through Walt Disney Pictures which maintains distribution rights in certain territories.
