On his return to London in 1770 he set up as a maker of busts and monuments at 9, Mortimer Street, where he built up a large practice. Although he preferred working on mythological subjects, it was through his portrait busts that he became famous and one of the most fashionable portrait sculptors in Britain.
He enjoyed the patronage of king George III and went on to sculpt a number of British political figures, including George III himself, William Pitt the Younger, Charles James Fox,  the Duke of Bedford and Charles Watson-Wentworth. He also made busts of  figures from the arts such as Benjamin West. Most of his subjects were represented in classical costume.
Although he took great care over the modelling of the details of his sculptures, the marble versions were normally made by assistants,[tpl]sfn|Whinney|1971|page=113[/tpl] such as Sebastian Gahagan who carved Nollekens' statue of William Pitt for the Senate House at Cambridge,[tpl]cite web|url=http://217.204.55.158/henrymoore/sculptor/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=1020&from_list=true&x=0|title=Sebastian Gagahan|work=A Biographical Dictionary of Sculptors in Britain, 1660–1851|publisher=Henry Moore Institute/Paul Mellon Centre|accessdate=6 February 2012[/tpl] and L.
