==Implementations==

In its simplest form, layered graph drawing algorithms may require O(mn) time in graphs with n vertices and m edges, because of the large number of dummy vertices that may be created. However, for some variants of the algorithm, it is possible to simulate the effect of the dummy vertices without actually constructing them explicitly, leading to a near-linear time implementation.[tpl]citation|contribution=An efficient implementation of Sugiyama’s algorithm for layered graph drawing|first1=Markus|last1=Eiglsperger|first2=Martin|last2=Siebenhaller|first3=Michael|last3=Kaufmann|title=Graph Drawing, 12th International Symposium, GD 2004, New York, NY, USA, September 29-October 2, 2004, Revised Selected Papers|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=3383|year=2005|pages=155–166|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_17[/tpl].
The "dot" tool in Graphviz produces layered drawings. A layered graph drawing algorithm is also included in Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout[ref]
