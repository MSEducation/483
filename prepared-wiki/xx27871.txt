Zorah ([tpl]lang-he|צרעה[/tpl]) or Tzorah, perhaps "place of wasps," was a biblical town in the low country of Judah.

==Location==

Zorah was situated on the crest of a hill overlooking the valley of Sorek, and was fortified by Rehoboam ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Chronicles|11:10|HE[/tpl]). It has been identified with Sar'a, 23 kilometers west of Jerusalem near Nahal Sorek.

==History==

Zorah was mentioned together with Ajalon in the Amarna letters as a city attacked by the Apiru.
In [tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|19:41|HE[/tpl], Zorah is mentioned in the allotment of the Tribe of Judah, on the border with the Tribe of Dan. It was most likely the Danites that occupied Zorah [tpl]bibleverse||Judges|18:2|HE[/tpl], probably the same as Zoreah ([tpl]bibleverse||Joshua|15:33|HE[/tpl]). This was Samson's birthplace ([tpl]bibleverse||Judges|13:2|HE[/tpl]), and near it he may be found in a grave ([tpl]bibleverse||Judges|16:31|HE[/tpl]). 
Zorah is also the name of an Egyptian sun god which is in line with other sun-worshiping villages in the area, Eshtaol (valley of fire) and Beit Shemesh (house of sun).
The Palestinian village Sar'a was located in the presumed location of the ancient town. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.
A kibbutz of this Hebrew name is now located nearby.
