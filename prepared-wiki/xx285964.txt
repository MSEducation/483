CATEGORIES: Swedish record labels

PRYDA FRIENDS (PRYF) is an independent record label that was started in 2006 by Eric Prydz, who uses it to release music created by his friends. Pryda Friends is the third imprint launched by the Swede. Prydz' first two labels, Pryda Recordings and Mouseville Records, are dedicated to releasing his own productions; the former for progressive house records produced under his birth name and the Pryda pseudonym, while the latter serves as an outlet for the darker techno that Prydz produces under the "Cirez D" alias.
The first ever release on the Pryda Friends imprint came from a collaborative project between Prydz and Axwell called AxEr, with single releases following from Henrik B, Paolo Mojo, Sébastien Léger and Felix da Housecat, among others. Swedish countryman Jeremy Olander was the first artist to receive a multi-release deal on the label, solidifying his spot among dance music's most popular musicians with back to back to back successes from his Evade and Fairfax EPs, and one of the label's top selling releases, his progressive single "Let Me Feel". Fehrplay is the most recent Pryda Friends signee, releasing an unprecedented five records on the imprint, ranging from dark house tracks like "I Can't Stop It" and "Nightride", to his more recent techy tracks like "Monte" and "Talk to Me".
In August 2013, the first ever Pryda Friends tour sees Jeremy Olander and Fehrplay take on five USA dates called "the summer's most anticipated North American tour" by DJ Mag,[tpl]cite web|last=Barton|first=Andrew|title=Pryda Friends debut tour: Fehrplay + Jeremy Olander|url=http://www.djmag.ca/2013/07/12/pryda-friends-debut-tour/|work=DJ Magazine Canada|publisher=IHM Global Media Corp|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] with stops in Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Chicago, and San Francisco.
