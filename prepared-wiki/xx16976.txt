The Ionian Sea ([tpl]lang-el|Ιόνιο Πέλαγος[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-el|iˈonio ˈpelaɣos[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|Mar Ionio[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-it|mar ˈjɔːnjo[/tpl], [tpl]lang-al|Deti Jon[/tpl]), is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea, south of the Adriatic Sea. It is bounded by southern Italy including Calabria, Sicily and the Salento peninsula to the west, southern Albania to the north, and west coast of Greece.
All major islands in the sea belong to Greece. They are collectively referred to as the Ionian Islands, the major ones being Corfu, Zakynthos, Kephalonia, Ithaca, and Lefkada.
There are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward.

==Name==

The name Ionian comes from Greek language [tpl]lang|grc|Ἰόνιον (πέλαγος)[/tpl].  Its etymology is unknown.Babiniotis, Lexiko tis Neoellinikis Glossas. Ancient Greek writers, especially Aeschylus, linked it to the myth of Io. In Ancient Greek the adjective Ionios ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἰόνιος[/tpl]) was used as an epithet for the sea because Io swam across it.LSJ, A Greek-English Lexicon s.v. Ἰόνιος.  There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures; according to one version, Ionius was a son of Adrias (eponymic for the Adriatic Sea); according to another, Ionius was a son of Dyrrhachus, eponymic for the ancient Illyrian city of Dyrrhachium (modern Durrës in Albania). When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers, Heracles, who was passing through the area, came to his aid, but in the fight the hero killed his ally's son by mistake. The corpse was cast into the sea, which thereafter was called the Ionian Sea.
