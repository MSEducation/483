==Origin==

Although the term armlet may be technically similar, it is taken to mean an item that sits on the upper shoulder: an arm ring.  The origin of the term 'bracelet' is from the Greek 'brachile' meaning 'of the arm', via the Old French 'barcel'. A bracelet is also a small brace or bracer (an arm-guard used by archers).

==Cultural significance==

The history of Egyptian bracelets is as old as 5000 BCE. Starting with materials like bones, stones and woods to serve religious and spiritual interests. From the National Geographic Society, the Scarab Bracelet is one of the most recognized symbols of ancient Egypt. The scarab represented rebirth and regeneration. Carved scarabs were worn as jewelry and wrapped into the linen bandages of mummies. Myth told of the scarab god, Khepri, pushing the sun across the sky.

===Charm bracelet===

A charm bracelet is an item of jewelry worn around the wrist. It carries personal charms: decorative pendants or trinkets which are signifiers of important things in the wearer's life.

===Bangles===

Rigid bracelets, usually from metal, wood, or plastic, are referred to as bangles or bangle bracelets.  They can be smooth, textured or set with stones. In India, glass bangles are common.

In India, it is also common that young children will wear thin gold bangles on their hands and ankles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/bangles.html |title=Bangles|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=4 March 2013[/tpl]

===Slap bracelets===
