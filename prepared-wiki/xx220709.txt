The first season, produced in 2007, was entitled [tpl]Nihongo|Ōkiku Furikabutte|おおきく振りかぶって[/tpl]. It was produced by the Japanese animation studio A-1 Pictures and directed by Tsutomu Mizushima. It was released in English by Funimation under the title Big Windup! – Oofuri. The series contains 25 episodes which aired between April 12 and September 27 on a number of Japanese television networks including TBS, MBS, BS-i, and CBC. An additional special episode based on the one shot "The Basic of Basics" was only included in the 9th volume of the DVD's.
The story follows the story of Ren Mihashi, a pitcher who was blamed by his middle school team for their string of losses, and as a result suffers from low self-esteem and transfers to a different high school. There, the school's first baseball team is being formed and Mihashi reluctantly joins as their Ace Pitcher. Assisted by his new teammates (and especially the catcher, Takaya Abe), he grows in stature, confidence and skill, helping his team excel with his own abilities. There are two opening and ending theme songs for the series. The first is [tpl]nihongo|"Dramatic"|ドラマチック|Doramachikku[/tpl], sung by Base Ball Bear, and the second is "Seishun Line" ([tpl]nihongo2|青春ライン[/tpl]), by Ikimonogakari.

It was produced by the same team as the first season and contains thirteen episodes which aired between April 1 and June 24 on several Japanese television networks, such as TBS and MBS.
The story picks up where the first season left off, as the Nishiura High School baseball team continues to compete in the High School Baseball Invitational Tournament with the aim of playing in the finals at legendary Hanshin Kōshien Stadium.
