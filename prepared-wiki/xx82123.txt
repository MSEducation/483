[[Ami jakushi]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese cooking tools

Ami jakushi (網杓子) is a ladle or scoop used in the Japanese kitchen. The ladle is made from a fine wire mesh and is used to remove small pieces of unwanted food or foam from a liquid. For example in deep frying, the ami jakushi is used to remove small drops of batter during the frying of tempura. Another example would be the removal of foam from a miso soup to achieve a more pleasing aesthetic.
