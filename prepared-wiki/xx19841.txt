Sussex ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|s|ɨ|k|s[/tpl]; abbreviated Sx),[tpl]cite web |title=Counties Abbreviations |work=LangScape: The language of landscape |url=http://www.langscape.org.uk/about/CountyAbbreviations.html|accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] from the Old English Sūþsēaxe ('South Saxons'), is an historic county in South East England corresponding roughly in area to the ancient Kingdom of Sussex.  Clockwise, it is bounded to the west by Hampshire; north by Surrey, north-east by Kent, south by the English Channel and is divided for local government into West Sussex and East Sussex and the city of Brighton and Hove.  Brighton and Hove was created as a unitary authority in 1997, and was granted City status in 2000.  Until then, Chichester had been Sussex's only city.
Sussex has three main geographic sub-regions, each orientated approximately east to west.  In the south-west of the county lies the fertile and densely populated coastal plain.  North of this lie the rolling chalk hills of the South Downs, beyond which lies the well-wooded Sussex Weald.
The name 'Sussex' derives from the Kingdom of Sussex, according to legend it was founded by Ælle of Sussex in 477 AD, then in 825 it was absorbed into the kingdom of Wessex and the later kingdom of England.  The region's roots go back further to the location of some of Europe's earliest hominid finds at Boxgrove.  Sussex has been a key location for England's major invasions, including the Roman invasion of Britain and the Battle of Hastings.
In 1974, the Lord-Lieutenant of Sussex was replaced with one each for East and West Sussex, which became separate ceremonial counties.  Sussex continues to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region.  It has had a single police force since 1968 and its name is in common use in the media.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/sussex/|title=BBC News - Sussex|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 February 2013[/tpl]  In 2007, Sussex Day was created to celebrate Sussex's rich culture and history. Based on the traditional emblem of Sussex, a blue shield with six gold martlets, the flag of Sussex was recognised by the Flag Institute in 2011. In 2013, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England's 39 historic counties, including Sussex.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eric-pickles-celebrate-st-george-and-englands-traditional-counties|title=Eric Pickles: celebrate St George and England's traditional counties|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/eric-pickless-championing-of-traditional-english-counties-is-something-we-can-all-get-behind-8568394.html|title=Eric Pickles's championing of traditional English counties is something we can all get behind|publisher=The Independent|first=Simon|last=Kelner|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://abcounties.com/news/government-formally-acknowledges-the-historic-counties-to-celebrate-st-georges-day/|title=Government 'formally acknowledges' the Historic Counties to Celebrate St George's Day|publisher=Association of British Counties|first=Michael|last=Garber|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl]

==Toponymy==

The name "Sussex" is derived from the Middle English Suth-sæxe, which is in turn derived from the Old English Suth-Seaxe which means (land or people) of the South Saxons[tpl]cite web|url=http://websters.yourdictionary.com/sussex|title=Sussex, Definition of Sussex from Webster's New World College Dictionary|publisher=Webster's New World College Dictionary|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] (cf. Essex, Middlesex and Wessex). The South Saxons were a Germanic tribe that settled in the region from the North German Plain during the 5th and 6th centuries.
The earliest known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: Australes Saxones) is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, Noðhelm, although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.
The New Latin word Suthsexia was used for Sussex by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in his 1645 map.[tpl]cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5642936?q&l-decade=164&l-year=1645&c=map&versionId=6566045|title=1645, Latin, Map edition: Suthsexia; vernacule Sussex|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=5 February 2013[/tpl]

==Symbols==

The flag of Sussex consists of six gold martlets, or heraldic swallows, on a blue background, blazoned as Azure, six martlets or. Officially recognised by the Flag Institute on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the heraldic shield of Sussex that first appeared in an atlas by John Speed in 1622. The significance of the six martlets may be to represent the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as rapes. It may also be a canting reference to the title of the historic leading Sussex family, the Earls of Arundel, seated at Arundel Castle in the county, as the French for swallow is hirondelle.
Sussex by the Sea is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by William Ward-Higgs in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of Rudyard Kipling's poem entitled Sussex. Adopted by the Royal Sussex Regiment and popularised in World War I, it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at Lewes Bonfire, and at sports matches, including those of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club and Sussex County Cricket Club.
The county day, called Sussex Day, is celebrated on 16 June, the same day as the feast day of St Richard of Chichester, Sussex's patron saint, whose shrine at Chichester Cathedral was an important place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.
Sussex's motto, We wunt be druv, is a Sussex dialect expression meaning 'we will not be pushed around' and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women. The round-headed rampion, also known as the 'Pride of Sussex', was adopted as Sussex's county flower in 2002.

==Geography==

===Landscape===

thumb|right|The South Downs meets the sea at the Seven SistersThe physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the Wealden anticline, the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the Weald itself and the South Downs. Natural England has identified the following seven National Character Areas in Sussex:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/englands/character/areas/southeast.aspx|title=South East and London National Character Area map|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=30 April 2012[/tpl]
At 280m, Blackdown is the highest point in Sussex, or county top. Ditchling Beacon (248m) is the highest point in East Sussex. At [tpl]convert|113|km|mi|abbr=off[/tpl] long, the River Medway is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the River Arun, which is [tpl]convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off[/tpl] long. Sussex's largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is Bewl Water on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is Ardingly Reservoir.

===Climate===

The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring Hampshire are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom. The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitsussex.org/page/weather-and-climate/|title=Weather and Climate in Sussex|publisher=Visit Sussex|accessdate=14 April 2012[/tpl] Most of Sussex lies in Hardiness zone 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.
Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with [tpl]convert|950|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] of rainfall per year. The close proximity of Sussex to the Continent of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.
The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures. Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.
In winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland. Selsey is known as a tornado hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000, with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/so/print.html|title=Southern England: climate|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=14 April 2012[/tpl]
The sunshine average is approximately 1900 hours a year, this is much higher than the UK average of 1340 hours a year.

===Conurbations===

Most of Sussex's population is distributed in an east-west line along the English Channel coast or on the east-west line of the A272. The exception to this pattern is the 20th century north-south development on the A23-Brighton line corridor, Sussex's main link to London. Sussex's population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of over 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex's population. According to the ONS urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 5 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):

==Population==

The combined population of Sussex is about 1.6 million.[tpl]cite web|last=Office for National Statistics|title=Census 2011 result shows increase in population of the South East|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/census-2011-result-shows-increase-in-population-of-the-south-east/censussoutheastnr0712.html|accessdate=4 December 2012[/tpl]Combined population of local authority areas of Brighton and Hove (273,400), East Sussex, (527,200) and West Sussex (808,900)  In 2011, Sussex had a population density of 425 per km2, higher than the average for England of 407 per km2.
The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede, who describes the county as containing in 681 land of 7,000 families; allowing ten to a family (a reasonable estimate at that date), the total population would be 70,000.
In 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21,537 houses. The 1801 census found that the population was 159,311. The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries, although after the massacre of St Bartholomew upwards of 1,500 Huguenots landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many more refugees were added to the county.
The area of the ancient county is [tpl]convert|933887|acre[/tpl] with a population in 1891 of 550,446 and in 1901 of 605,202.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Finds at Eartham Pit in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or Homo heidelbergensis. At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last Neanderthals in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7466735.stm | work=BBC News | first=Christine | last=McGourty | title='Neanderthal tools' found at dig | date=23 June 2008[/tpl] The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, mammoth and woolly rhinos.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3345244/Neanderthal-tools-reveal-advanced-technology.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Roger | last=Highfield | title=Neanderthal tools reveal advanced technology | date=23 June 2008 | location=London[/tpl] Around 6000BC the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their Mesolithic kinsmen to the south. Later in the Neolithic period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important flint-mining centres.[tpl]Harvnb|Kerridge|Standing|2000|p=10.[/tpl] The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500BC to 3750BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Chalk from Cissbury has been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.[tpl]cite web| url=http://steyningmuseum.org.uk/prehistory.htm|title=Prehistory: The Downs Above Steyning|publisher=Steyning Museum|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]
Sussex is rich in remains from the Bronze and Iron Ages, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the Devil's Jumps and Cissbury Ring, one of Britain's largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC people from the Atrebates, one of the tribes of the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and German stock, started invading and occupying southern Britain.Armstrong. A History of Sussex. Ch. 3. This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under Julius Caesar that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55BC.
Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic Regnenses tribe under their leader Commius occupied the Manhood Peninsula. Tincomarus and then Cogidubnus followed Commius as rulers of the Regnenses.

===Roman Canton===

At the time of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an oppidum in the southern part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region.Cunliffe. Iron Age communities in Britain. p. 169. A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.Osprey Publishing - Military History Books - The Roman Invasion of Britain
Sussex was home to the magnificent Roman Palace at Fishbourne, by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the Regnenses or Regni, with its capital at Noviomagus Reginorum, modern-day Chichester. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at Bignor. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the 5th century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in Britain, probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the Roman departure from Britain around 410 AD.[tpl]Cite journal|last=White|first= Sally et al|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol42/42_088_093.pdf|title=A Mid-Fifth Century Hoard of Roman and Pseudo-Roman Material from Patching, West Sussex|year=1999|publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies|accessdate=16 November 2011|pages=88–93[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Saxon Kingdom===

The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which states that in the year AD 477 Ælle landed with his three sons.Welch. Anglo-Saxon England p.9ASC Parker MS. 477AD.. Having fought on the banks of the Mearcredesburna,[ref]ASC 485 Parker MS: This year Ælle fought with the Welsh nigh Mecred's- Burnsted.
[/ref] it seems Aelle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty.Welch. Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex; pp. 24-25 After Aelle’s forces seized the Saxon Shore fort of Anderida, the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of Romano-British control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at Highdown Hill. Aelle was recognised as the first 'Bretwalda' or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the Anglo-Saxon kings and led the ill-fated campaign against King Arthur at Mount Badon.
By the end of the 7th century, the region around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom. In the 660s-670s, King Aethelwealh of Sussex formed an alliance with the Mercian king Wulfhere and together they took the Isle of Wight from the West Saxons, probably at the battle of Biedanheafele. As Mercia's first Christian king, Wulfhere insisted that Æthelwealh also convert to Christianity. Æthelwealh was baptised in Mercia, with Wulfhere as his sponsor. Wulfhere gave the Isle of Wight and Meon Valley to Aethelwealh, with Wulfhere acting as overlord. The alliance with Mercia was sealed with Æthelwealh taking the hand of Eabe, a Mercian princess in marriage.
Wilfrid, the exiled bishop of York, came to Sussex in 681 and with King Æthelwealh's approval set up a mission to convert the people of Sussex to Christianity. Æthelwealh gave Wilfrid land on the Manhood peninsula, close to his own royal estate and Wilfrid founded Selsey Abbey. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh was killed by Cædwalla, a prince of Wessex. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land and Wilfrid built his Selsey Abbey. Cædwalla was driven out by the South Saxon nobles Berthun and Andhun.
The South Saxons fought off the West Saxons in 722 and again in 725. At the end of the 8th century, Ealdwulf was perhaps the last independent king of Sussex, after which Sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under Mercian rule. Mercia's grip was shattered in 825 at the battle of Ellendun, after which Sussex and the other southern kingdoms came under the control of Wessex, which later grew into the kingdom of England.

===Norman Sussex===

Sussex was the venue for the momentous Battle of Hastings, the decisive victory in the Norman conquest of England. In September 1066, William of Normandy landed with his forces at Pevensey and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area.Bates William the Conqueror pp. 79–89Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, pp. 198–199; Orderic, vol. 2, pp. 168–171 The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, Harold Godwinson, who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief seat was probably in Bosham.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41737|title=Victoria County History A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, The Rape of Chichester[/tpl] After having marched his exhausted army all the way from Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated.[tpl]Cite book|last=Seward|first=Desmond|title=Sussex|publisher=Random House|year=1995|location=London|isbn=0-7126-5133-0|pages=5–7[/tpl] William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle, with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar.
Sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans, for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion.[tpl]cite book | last = Brandon | first = Peter | title = The Shaping of the Sussex Landscape | year = 2009 | publisher = Snake River Press[/tpl]
The county was of great importance to the Normans; Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy.Armstrong. A History of Sussex. pp. 48-58 The county's existing sub-divisions, known as rapes, were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of William's most trusted barons. Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Sussex's bishop, Æthelric II, was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with and William the Conqueror's personal chaplain, Stigand.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly|first= S.E|title= Anglo-Saxon Charters VI, Charters of Selsey|year= 1998|publisher=OUP for the British Academy| isbn=0-19-726175-2[/tpl] The Normans also built Chichester Cathedral and moved the seat of Sussex's bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea.
In 1264, the Sussex Downs were the location of the Battle of Lewes, in which Simon de Montfort and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward (later Edward I), the son and heir of Henry III. The subsequent treaty, known as the Mise of Lewes, led to de Montfort summoning the first parliament in English history without any prior royal authorisation. A provisional administration was set up, consisting of de Montfort, the Bishop of Chichester and the Earl of Gloucester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached.[ref][tpl]Citation|last=Powicke|first=F.

===Sussex under the Plantagenets===

During the Hundred Years War, Sussex found itself on the frontline, convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates.[tpl]Cite book|last=Lowerson|first=John|title=A Short History of Sussex|publisher=Dawson Publishing|year=1980|location=Folkestone|isbn=978-0-7129-0948-8[/tpl] Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period and all three towns became part of the Cinque Ports, a loose federation for supplying ships for the country's security. Also at this time, Amberley and Bodiam castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers.

===Early modern Sussex===

Like the rest of the country, the Church of England's split with Rome during the reign of Henry VIII was felt in Sussex.Peter Wilkinson. The Struggle for Protestant Reformation 1553-1564: in Kim Leslie's. An Historical Atlas of Sussex. pp. 52-53 In 1538 there was a royal order for the demolition of the shrine of Saint Richard, in Chichester Cathedral,Stephens Memorials of the See of Chichester. pp. 213-214 with Thomas Cromwell saying that there was "a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine". In the reign of Queen Mary, 41 people in Sussex were burnt at the stake for their Protestant beliefs. Elizabeth re-established the break with Rome when she passed the 1559 Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity. Under Elizabeth I, religious intolerance continued albeit on a lesser scale, with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs.
Sussex escaped the worst ravages of the English Civil War, although in 1642 there were sieges at Arundel and Chichester, and a skirmish at Haywards Heath when Royalists marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local Parliamentarians. The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1642-south.htm|title=1642: Civil War in the South East|accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl] Despite its being under Parliamentarian control, Charles II was able to journey through the county after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 to make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham.

===Late modern and contemporary Sussex===

The Sussex coast was greatly modified by the social movement of sea bathing for health which became fashionable among the wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. Resorts developed all along the coast, including at Brighton, Hastings, Worthing, and Bognor. At the beginning of the 19th century agricultural labourers' conditions took a turn for the worse with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed, those in work faced their wages being forced down.Harrison. The common people. pp. 249-253 Conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the House of Lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers (seasonal workers) had been found dead of starvation. The deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots, first in neighbouring Kent, and then in Sussex, where they lasted for several weeks, although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the Swing Riots.Horspool. The English Rebel. pp. 339 -340
Railways spread across Sussex in the 19th century and county councils were created for Sussex's eastern and western divisions in 1889.
During World War I, on the eve of the Battle of the Somme on 30 June 1916, the Royal Sussex Regiment took part in the Battle of the Boar's Head at Richebourg-l'Avoué.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.royalsussex.org.uk/Richebourg.htm|title=The Day Sussex Died|accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl] The day subsequently became known as The Day Sussex Died. Over a period of less than five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed, including 12 sets of brothers, including three from one family. A further 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner.
With the declaration of the World War II, Sussex found itself part of the country's frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the Battle of Britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed.Kim Leslie and Marlin Mace. Sussex Defences in the Second World War in Kim Leslie. An Historical Atlas of Sussex. pp. 118-119. As the Sussex regiments served overseas, the defence of the county was undertaken by units of the Home Guard with help from the First Canadian Army.Brandon. Sussex. pp. 302-309. During the lead up to the D-Day landings, the people of Sussex were witness to the build up of military personnel and materials, including the assembly of landing crafts and construction of Mulberry harbours off the county's coast.
In the post-war era, the New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of a new town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap23.htm|title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions: Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence. Supplementary memorandum by Crawley Borough Council (NT 15(a))|accessdate=2 April 2008|publisher=The Information Policy Division, Office of Public Sector Information|year=2002|work=United Kingdom Parliament Publications and Records website[/tpl]  As part of the Local Government Act 1972, the eastern and western divisions of Sussex were made into the ceremonial counties of East and West Sussex in 1974. Boundaries were changed and a large part of the rape of Lewes was transferred from the eastern division into West Sussex, along with Gatwick Airport, which was historically part of the county of Surrey.

==Governance==

===Politics===

From 1290, Sussex returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of England. Each county returned two MPs and each borough designated by Royal charter also returned two MPs. After the union with Scotland two members represented the county in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. After the Reform Act 1832 some of the larger industrial towns of northern England were enfranchised for the first time and smaller English boroughs (known as Rotten Boroughs) were disenfranchised, including Bramber, East Grinstead, Seaford, Steyning and Winchelsea in Sussex.  The Reform Act of 1832 divided what had been a single county constituency into eastern and western divisions, with two representatives elected for each division.Horsfield. The History, Antiquities and Topography of the County of Sussex. Volume II. Appendix pp. 23-75.  The reforms of the 19th century made the electoral system more representative, but it was not until 1928 that there was universal suffrage.Richard Childs. Parliamentary Representation in Leslies, An Historical Atlas of Sussex. pp. 72-73.

===Law===

Headquartered in Lewes, Home Office policing in Sussex has been provided by Sussex Police since 1968.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.police-recruitment.co.uk/sussex-police-recruitment/|title=Sussex Police Force|accessdate=7 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The first-tier Crown Court for all of Sussex is Lewes Crown Court, which has courts in Lewes, Brighton and Hove. Like other first-tier Crown Courts it has its own resident High Court Judge. There is also a third-tier Crown Court at Chichester. The local prison in Sussex for men is Lewes Prison[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldpolicecellsmuseum.org.uk/page_id__488_path__.aspx|title=Lewes Crown Court & Prison|accessdate=7 August 2012[/tpl] and there is also a Category D prison at Ford.

===Administrative divisions===

====Historic sub-divisions====

A rape was a traditional sub-division of the county of Sussex. Their origin is unknown, but they appear to predate the Norman Conquest.The origin was still reported as "contested" as late as 1942 (Helen Maud Cam (preface dated 1942), Liberties & communities in medieval England: Collected Studies in Local Administration and Topography, 1944:193). Each rape was split into several hundreds.
At the time of the Norman Conquest, there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The rape of Bramber was created later in the 11th century and the rape of Chichester was created in the 13th century.

====Modern local authority areas====

Sussex is divided into two administrative counties and one unitary authority, Brighton and Hove.
The divisions of east Sussex and west Sussex have their roots in the church's division of the county at the river Adur into east and west parts (divided from at least the 11th century into the archdeaconry of Chichester and the archdeaconry of Lewes). With Sussex's cathedral located at Chichester in the far west of the county, 9 miles from the western boundary and 90 miles from the eastern boundary, it became practical to divide the county into two sections. The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex.
An act of Henry VII dating from 1504 directed that, for convenience, the two halves of the county should have separate administrations (Quarter Sessions). This situation was recognised by the County of Sussex Act 1865. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions became two administrative counties (along with three county boroughs: Brighton, Hastings and, from 1911, Eastbourne).CONNECTIONS 12 .pdf

===Monarchy and peerage===

Created in the fifth century, the kingdom of Sussex continued until its absorption into the kingdom of Wessex and later England in 825. In charters, Sussex's monarchs were sometimes referred to as ealdormen, or Dux in Latin, which is sometimes translated as 'duke'. The early Earls of Arundel, up to 1243, were often also called Earls of Sussex. In 1801 the title of Duke of Sussex was created and conferred on The Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son of George III. Since he had no legitimate issue, the title became extinct on his death in 1843.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Augustus Frederick|volume=2[/tpl]   Although there was speculation that the dukedom would pass to Prince Andrew or Prince William[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/11/16/kate-middleton-will-inherit-a-host-of-titles-115875-22720690/ |title=Kate Middleton will inherit a host of titles |work=Daily Mirror |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl] the title is currently one of six inactive British royal titles.

==Economy==

Much of the Sussex Weald consists of wet sticky clays or drought-prone acid sands and is often broken up into to small irregular fields and woods by the topography, making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming. In these areas pastoral or mixed farming has always been the pattern, with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period. Sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen, which continued to be used in the Weald longer than in other parts of England.   The chalk downlands were traditionally grazed by large numbers of small Southdown sheep, suited to the low fertility of the pasture, until the coming of artificial fertiliser made cereal growing worthwhile. There are still fishing fleets, notably at Rye and Hastings, but the number of boats is much reduced. There are working harbours at Rye, Hastings, Newhaven and Shoreham; whilst Pagham and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft, as does Brighton Marina. Sussex had an iron working industry since the Roman period. The large supply of wood in the county made it a favourable centre for the industry, all smelting being done with charcoal till the middle of the 18th century.Ankers. Sussex Cavalcade. p. 46  The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border in the early 13th century and flourished till the 17th century.Brandon. Sussex. pp. 175 -176. The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the first quarter of the 20th century.
Tourism in Sussex is well-established, and includes seaside resorts and the South Downs National Park. Brighton and Hove has a high density of businesses involved in media, particularly digital or "new media"; since the 1990s Brighton has been referred to as "Silicon Beach".Brighton's Silicon beach Tech Cluster Finally Breaks Shore  The University of Sussex and the University of Brighton provide employment for many more.
