Temelín Nuclear Power Station ([tpl]lang-cs|Jaderná elektrárna Temelín[/tpl], abbreviation JETE) is located near Temelín, a small village in the Czech Republic. Temelín NPP is owned by ČEZ Group, which employs 1000 workers at this site. The adjacent castle Vysoký Hrádek serves as an information centre.
In spring 2003, the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant, with its 2,000 MW of installed capacity, became the largest power resource in the Czech Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cez.cz/en/power-plants-and-environment/nuclear-power-plants/temelin.html |title=CEZ Group | Temelín |publisher=Cez.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl]

==History==

Planning began in the late 1970s and the final project was submitted in 1985. Construction of four operating units began in 1987. The project was expected to be completed in 1991 with estimated building costs of 35 billion Kčs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/4279 |title=Český rozhlas: Z historie Temelína |publisher=Radio.cz |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] Six villages were demolished by the then-Communist government to make way for the power station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theses.cz/id/5hf8le/ |title=Economic, social and environmental impact of building and functioning of the nuclear power plants Temelín on Southern Bohemia |publisher=Theses.cz |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]
After the Velvet revolution in 1990 the Czechoslovakian government decided to cease construction of the third and fourth reactors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ekolist.cz/zprava.shtml?x=1932667 |title=Ekolist: Historie výstavby Jaderné elektrárny Temelín |publisher=Ekolist.cz |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] Work continued on the first two reactors; in the 1990s alterations to the original design were made by Westinghouse in conjunction with SUJB and the IAEA to bring reliability and safety levels into conformance with Western European standards. The standards audit was carried out by Halliburton NUS. As part of the alterations information and control systems were added, electrical modifications carried out, and cabling, reactor core and fuel elements were replaced. In 1993 the Czech government decided to complete the plant in the face of delays and cost overruns, with expected completion at the time estimated for 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/WebGovRes/6925AD93BE283D82C12571B6006FCE61?OpenDocument |title=USNESENÍ VLÁDY ČESKÉ REPUBLIKY ze dne 10. března 1993 č. 109 k problematice dostavby jaderné elektrárny Temelín |publisher=Kormoran.vlada.cz |date=10 March 1993 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] In 1994 an opinion poll reported that 68% of Czech citizens were in favor of nuclear power development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stem.cz/clanek/111 |title=Rozvoj jaderné energetiky u nás podporují necelé tři pětiny občanů |publisher=Stem.cz |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]
In 1998 construction still was not completed and costs reached 71 CZK billion. The Czech government again reconsidered completion of the plant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/WebGovRes/2C601D0777983566C12571B6006BD92C?OpenDocument |title=USNESENÍ VLÁDY ČESKÉ REPUBLIKY ze dne 12. srpna 1998 č. 516 o postupu nezávislého posouzení projektu dostavby jaderné elektrárny Temelín |publisher=Kormoran.vlada.cz |date=12 August 1998 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] In 1999 the decision was made to continue, hoping for an expected completion in 2000 with a maximum cost of 98.6 CZK billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kormoran.vlada.cz/usneseni/usneseni_webtest.nsf/WebGovRes/7038A0CA78622833C12571B6006D3428?OpenDocument |title=USNESENÍ VLÁDY ČESKÉ REPUBLIKY ze dne 12. května 1999 č. 472 k návrhu postupu řešení situace jaderné elektrárny Temelín |publisher=Kormoran.vlada.cz |date=12 May 1999 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The project was controversial; national and international (mainly Austrian) opposition was stronger than in the early 1990s. In a 1999 opinion poll 47% of Czech citizens were in favor and 53% against nuclear power development. 
As early as 1993 there were local and international protests against the plant's construction.[tpl]cite web|author=WISE Amsterdam |url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/389/3795.html |title=WISE – Nuclear issues information service |publisher=0.antenna.nl |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] Large grassroots civil disobedience actions took place in 1996[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/RESIST.HTM | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100917090149/http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/RESIST.HTM | archivedate=17 September 2010 | title=Resistance | work=ecn.cz | accessdate=16 March 2012 [/tpl] and 1997.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/blockade.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100917090032/http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/blockade.htm | archivedate=17 September 2010 | title=Blockade 1997 | work=ecn.cz | accessdate=16 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/block97/block97.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609001628/http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/block97/block97.htm | archivedate=9 June 2007 | title=Chernobyl Broadcast System | work=ecn.cz | accessdate=16 March 2012 [/tpl] These were organized by the so-called Clean Energy Brigades.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/BRIGADES.HTM#How%20do%20I%20get | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100917090106/http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/BRIGADES.HTM#How%20do%20I%20get | archivedate=17 September 2010 | title=Citizen's Energy Brigades | work=ecn.cz | accessdate=16 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/space.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100917091909/http://www.ecn.cz/temelin/space.htm | archivedate=17 September 2010 | title=The Seminar of Positive Actions to Conserve Energy (SPACE) | work=ecn.cz | accessdate=16 March 2012 [/tpl] In September and October 2000, Austrian anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated against the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant and at one stage temporarily blocked all 26 border crossings between Austria and the Czech Republic.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/926434.stm |title=Anti-nuclear protest on Czech border |publisher=BBC News  |date=15 September 2000 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/963826.stm |title=Austrian anti-nuclear protests continue |publisher=BBC News  |date=14 October 2000 |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] The first reactor was finally commissioned in 2000 and the second in 2002.

==New reactors==

Plans to build all four original reactors were reopened in 2005.  However in 2014 the prospective plans were cancelled.
In 2007 planning was suspended because a new government agreed not to promote nuclear energy; a Green Party was a member of the coalition government. However, in July 2008 ČEZ requested the Ministry of the Environment conduct an environmental impact assessment for two additional reactors. In 2009 regional approval was granted for the new build. 
In August 2009, ČEZ sought bids for two pressurized water reactors (PWRs).[ref]

Shortly after the Fukushima nuclear accidents, Prime Minister Petr Nečas announced that the construction of new reactors will continue according to the original plans,[tpl]cite web|author=jw |url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/temelin-dostavime-vzkazal-po-havarii-fukusimy-premier-necas-p5e-/domaci.asp?c=A110317_144606_domaci_jw |title=Temelín dostavíme, vzkázal po havárii Fukušimy premiér Nečas – iDNES.cz |publisher=Zpravy.idnes.cz |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl] but with the tender selection delayed to 2013.[tpl]cite news |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2011/02/21/%C4%8Dez-delays-temel%C3%ADn-completion-deadline-5-yrs-2025 |title=ČEZ delays Temelín completion deadline by 5 yrs to 2025 |date=21 February 2011 |newspaper=Prague Daily Monitor |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]
In July 2012 ČEZ opened bids for the public contract for completing the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant in the presence of the bidders’ - Areva, a consortium of the Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC and WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC ČR, and a consortium of ŠKODA JS, Atomstroyexport, and Gidropress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cez.cz/en/cez-group/media/press-releases/3867.html |title=CEZ Group | ČEZ Has Today Opened Bids From Three Qualified Bidders Interested in Completing the Temelín NPP and have Thus Started the Bid Evaluation Process |publisher=Cez.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl]
In October 2012 ČEZ informed Areva that they have in their bid failed to meet statutory requirements for building two new units of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. Moreover, Areva has not fulfilled some other crucial criteria defined in the tender. Since the award procedure has been conducted in accordance with the Public Procurement Act, Areva’s bid had to be excluded from further evaluation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cez.cz/en/cez-group/media/press-releases/3972.html |title=CEZ Group | Areva Failed to Comply with Public Contract Requirements Defined for Building Temelín NPP Units 3 and 4; ČEZ Had to Disqualify This Bidder |publisher=Cez.cz |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl]
In March 2013, a Russian led consortium, comprising Atomstroyexport, Gidropress and Skoda, signed contracts with the three Czech companies ZAT, HOCHTIEF CZ and UJV Rez, for the construction, if it wins, of the two new nuclear reactor units for Temelín-3 and Temelín-4. The reactors proposed are the MIR-1200 (Modernised International Reactor).
ZAT will supply automated systems for the plant, HOCHTIEF CZ will be responsible for construction of the nuclear island, and UJV Rez will help compile project documentation for the nuclear and turbine islands, and also create working documentation for construction of the plant. A statement said the consortium is aiming for a “localisation level” of 75 percent.
The other running project for the contract is now Westinghouse with its AP1000 reactor. The winner of the contract is scheduled to be announced at the end of 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nucnet.org/all-the-news/2013/03/15/mir-1200-consortium-signs-temel-n-contracts-with-czech-companies |title=MIR-1200 Consortium Signs Temelín Contracts With Czech Companies |publisher=Nucnet.org |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2014-03-07[/tpl]
In April 2014, CEZ cancelled the project after the Czech government stated it does not plan to provide guarantees or other mechanisms to support the construction of low-emission power plants following discussions in the EU. The CEZ CEO stated:
[tpl]quote|While originally the project was fully economically feasible given the market price of electricity and other factors, today all investments into power plants, which revenues depend on sales of electricity in the free market, are threatened.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newscez-cancels-temelin-34-project-4213193 |title=CEZ cancels Temelin 3&4 project |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
