Rubbing alcohol, USP / Surgical spirit, B.P. is a liquid prepared and used primarily for topical application. It is prepared from a special denatured alcohol solution and contains approximately 70 percent by volume of pure, concentrated ethanol (ethyl alcohol) or isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol).See Industrial Alcohol In Washington State, "Rubbing Alcohol is a cooling and soothing liquid for external application that contains approximately 70 percent denatured ethyl alcohol or isopropanol." Individual manufacturers can use their own "formulation standards" in which the ethanol content usually ranges from 70-99% v/v.[tpl]cite book|last=Wilson|first=Charles|coauthors=John H.

It is colorless. The melting point is -89 °C. The boiling point is 82.5 °C. 
The term "rubbing alcohol" has become a general non-specific term for either isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) or ethyl alcohol (ethanol) rubbing-alcohol products.

==Properties==

Rubbing alcohol is a  volatile and flammable liquid.  It has an extremely bitter taste from its additives and (in the absence of added odorous substances) a characteristic odor. The specific gravity of Formula 23-H is between 0.8691 and 0.8771 at 15.56 °C.
Isopropyl rubbing alcohol USP/B.P. contains 68–99% of isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) by volume, the remainder consisting of water, with or without color additives, suitable stabilisers, and perfume oils.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Isopropyl alcohol is oxidised by the liver into acetone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/812411-overview|title=Toxicity, Alcohols|last=Levine|first= Michael D |coauthors=Tobias D Barker|date=August 27, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-20[/tpl]  Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, central nervous system depression, nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, and coma.

It contains 87.5-91% by volume of absolute ethyl alcohol. The rest consists of water and the denaturants, with or without color additives, and perfume oils.  Rubbing alcohol contains in each 100 mL not less than 355 mg of sucrose octaacetate or not less than 1.40 mg of denatonium benzoate. The preparation may be colored with one or more color additives.  A suitable stabilizer may also be added.Expert Committee:(PA2)Pharmaceutical Analysis 2, USP28–NF23 Page 62, Pharmacopeial Forum:Volume No.27(3)Page 2507 http://www.newdruginfo.com/pharmacopeia/usp28/v28230/usp28nf23s0_m1270.htm
