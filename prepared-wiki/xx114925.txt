Rick Muther (August 13, 1935 - March 12, 1995), was an American racecar driver.
Muther was born in Alhambra, California. He was for the most part The Indy 500's first Hippy race driver. Muther started in SCCA sports car racing in Southern California at Riverside winning the prestigious Tim Mayer award. He drove in the USAC and CART Championship Car series, racing in the 1967-1975 USAC and 1980 CART seasons, with 46 combined career starts, including the Indianapolis 500 in 1970-1971 and 1974 and finished in the top ten 13 times. A highlight of Rick's career was racing for four-time Indy winner AJ Foyt in the 1975 California 500.
