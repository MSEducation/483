[[Heidi moment]]

CATEGORIES: Sports terminology, Television terminology

''Heidi'' moment is a term referring to a network or television station cutting away from a sports program before its completion in favor of the next scheduled program, with the sporting event completed after the event was taken off the air. The term was based on the so-called Heidi Game incident involving NBC coverage of a game involving the Oakland Raiders and the New York Jets on November 17, 1968.
