==Proposed parents==

Several different sets of parents have been proposed for Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit (as well as Meritaten Tasherit).

===Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten===

She is most commonly held to have been the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten (a daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten) and Akhenaten himself.Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), ISBN 0-500-27621-8 p 234  The title of the princess is thought to have been "Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit, born of Ankehenpaaten, born of the King's Great Wife Nefertiti". If we assume that Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit was the daughter of Ankhesenpaaten and Akhenaten, she must have been born towards the very end of Akhenaten's reign. Since Ankhesenpaaten was born around the 5th year of her father's reign, the earliest year  she could have had a child was around Year 16 of his reign.

===Kiya and Akhenaten===

Since both Ankhesenpaaten Tasherit and another princess, Meritaten Tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned Akhenaten's second wife Kiya, it is also possible that they were children of Akhenaten and Kiya, or that they were fictional, replacing the name of Kiya's daughter, who might have been Beketaten, more commonly thought to be Tiye's child.[tpl]dodson[/tpl], p.148 Dr. Marc Gabolde: The End of the Amarna Period Kramer, "Enigmatic Kiya" in A.

===Meritaten and Smenkhare===

Dodoson proposed Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit was a daughter of the young royal couple Meritaten and Smenkhare. The young princess would have been named after Meritaten's sister.
