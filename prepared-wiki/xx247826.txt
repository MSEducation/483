This is a list of members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1941 to 1944, as elected at the 1941 state election.
During this term, the opposition United Australia Party merged with the new Commonwealth Party to form the Democratic Party in late 1943. The merger was only at a state level, however; the federal United Australia Party, however, remained intact during this period.
