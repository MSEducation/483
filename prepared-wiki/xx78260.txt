[[Flag of Namibia]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Africa, National symbols of Namibia, 1990 introductions, Flags adopted through competition

The flag of Namibia was adopted on March 21, 1990 upon independence from South Africa.
The main colours were taken from the flag of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the most important liberation movement in Namibia. That flag was adopted in 1971  and comprises diagonal stripes of blue-red-green, the most important colours of the Ovambos, the largest ethnic group in the country. The flag also represents the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, another Namibian political party. The gold sun, which is similar to the national emblem of the Republic of China, represents life and energy. 
The chairman of the subcomittee that chose the flag—after a competition for which 850 designs were submitted—has also explained the symbolism of the flag's colours:
Red, white, and blue were the colours of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, and blue, red, and green, the colours of SWAPO.
