[[Christian radicalism]]

CATEGORIES: Christian radicalism, Christian terms

Christian radicalism (radical Christianity or radical discipleship) encompasses a number of different movements and actions in practical theology.[tpl]cite book |title=William Stringfellow in Anglo-American Perspective |last=Dancer |first=Anthony |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=16–18 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=de-LhhZNLd4C&lpg=PA18&dq=practical%20theology%20Radical%20discipleship&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= |quote=[/tpl] It entails a radical re-orientation towards the root truths of Christian discipleship through personal reflection and action.[tpl]cite book |title=Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus |last=Myers |first=Ched |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Orbis Books |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=The first is repentance, which for us implies not only a conversion of heart, but a concrete process of turning away from empire, it's distractions and seductions, it's hubris and iniquity. The second is resistance, which involves shaking off the powerful sedation of a society that rewards ignorance and trivializes everything political, in order to discern and take concrete stands in our historical moment, and to find meaningful ways to 'impede imperial progress.' Both themes demand a commitment to nonviolence, as a personal and interpersonal way of life and as a militant and revolutionary political practice.[/tpl]

==Radical re-orientation and reflection==

"Radical" refers to the need for perpetual re-orientation towards the root truths of Christian discipleship. Radical is derived from the Latin word radix meaning "root."[tpl]cite book |title=Return to Christianity |last=Ferré |first=Nels Fredrick Solomon |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1943 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location= |isbn= |page=14 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=Christianity must, in short, become radical. 'Radical' comes from the Latin radix, meaning 'root.' Radical Christianity is simply root Christianity. Every great reform in Christianity has come from going back to the root.[/tpl] One way Christians achieve this is to revisit the Sermon on the Mount or the Gospel of Mark, the earliest of the canonical gospels.[tpl]cite book |title=Radical Discipleship: Reflections on the Sermon on the Mount |last=Chia |first=Roland |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus |last=Myers |first=Ched |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Orbis Books |location= |isbn= |page=13 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=As the earliest Gospel, it has stood at the center of critical efforts to reconstruct the life of Jesus[/tpl] Alternatively this re-orientation may consist of Christians re-examining their roots or discovering an anti-imperialist heritage within their own traditions, such as Methodists studying John Wesley, Baptists remembering the Anabaptists or Catholics finding Francis of Assisi.[tpl]cite book |title=Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus |last=Myers |first=Ched |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Orbis Books |location= |isbn= |page=7 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=…reexamining their roots (Latin radix, whence 'radical'). For many there was a rediscovery of a nonimperial heritage within their own traditions: Lutherans found Bonhoeffer, Baptists remembered the Anabaptists, Methodists reread Wesley and the Abolitionists, Catholics found Francis and a host of martyrs, and so on.[/tpl] Christian radicals, such as Ched Myers, Lee Camp and Shane Claiborne, believe mainstream Christianity has moved away from its origins, namely the core teachings and practices of Jesus such as turning the other cheek and rejecting materialism.[tpl]cite book |title=Mere Discipleship: Radical Christianity in a Rebellious World |last=Camp |first=Lee C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Brazos Press |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=19–30 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Radical Discipleship[/tpl]

==Personal action==

Radical discipleship calls Christians to follow the will of God through personal action and example.[tpl]cite book |title=Mere Discipleship: Radical Christianity in a Rebellious World |last=Camp |first=Lee C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Brazos Press |location= |isbn= |page=133 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=The gospel is not merely a belief system...The gospel calls us to participate in the kingdom of heaven, to embody the will of God on earth, empowered by the Holy Spirit to do so.[/tpl] This may encompass theological ideas and actions that are perceived to be subversive or extreme, and therefore unacceptable to either the Church or State. The methods by which radical Christians attempt to transform the social order can vary widely, from constructive activism to destructive fanaticism, as Christopher Rowland explains:
[tpl]quote|Christian radicalism has had its roots in the Bible. Both those committed to violence, and those who resorted to peaceful means to bring about change, have appealed to the Bible, albeit using different hermeneutical strategies. We cannot understand Christian history without recognising the interweaving of destructive fanaticism and constructive activism, and, what is more, the knee-jerk reaction to radicalism, of whatever hue, from the wielders of power, whether secular or ecclesiastical.[tpl]cite book |last=Rowland |first=Christopher |authorlink= |editor=Timmerman, Hutsebaut, Mels, Nonneman and Van Herck |title=Faith-based Radicalism: Christianity, Islam and Judaism Between Constructive Activism And Destructive Fanaticism |year=2007 |publisher=Peter Lang |location= |isbn=90-5201-050-1 |page= |pages=115–129 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIRq7DgTZV0C&lpg=PP1&dq=Faith-based%20Radicalism%3A%20Christianity%2C%20Islam%20and%20Judaism%20Between%20Constructive%20Activism%20And%20Destructive%20Fanaticism&pg=PA115#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= |quote= Radical Christian Writings[/tpl][/tpl]
Examples of nonviolent radicalism include Martin Luther King, Jr., Toyohiko Kagawa, Leo Tolstoy, Gerrard Winstanley, William Blake and Gustavo Gutiérrez, whilst examples of violent radicalism include the Münster Rebellion, Thomas Müntzer and Camilo Torres Restrepo.
