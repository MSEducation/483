[[Hyperbolic spiral]]

CATEGORIES: Spirals

A hyperbolic spiral is a transcendental plane curve also known as a reciprocal spiral. A hyperbolic spiral is the opposite of an Archimedean spiral and are a type of Cotes' spiral.
It has the pol equation:
It begins at an infinite distance from the pole in the centre (for θ starting from zero r = a/θ starts from infinity), and it winds faster and faster around as it approaches the pole; the distance from any point to the pole, following the curve, is infinite. Applying the transformation from the polar coordinate system:
leads to the following parametric representation in Cartesian coordinates: 
where the parameter t is an equivalent of the polar coordinate θ.
The spiral has an asymptote at y = a: for t approaching zero the ordinate approaches a, while the abscissa grows to infinity:
It was Pierre Varignon who studied the curve as first, in 1704. Later Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes worked on the curve.
