[[Destrin]]

Destrin or DSTN (also known as actin depolymerizing factor or ADF) is a protein which in humans is encoded by the DSTN gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: Destrin | url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11034 | accessdate =[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hawkins M, Pope B, Maciver SK, Weeds AG | title = Human actin depolymerizing factor mediates a pH-sensitive destruction of actin filaments | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 32 | issue = 38 | pages = 9985–93 |date=September 1993 | pmid = 8399167 | doi = 10.1021/bi00089a014| url = | issn = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Deloukas P, Matthews LH, Ashurst J, et al. | title = The DNA sequence and comparative analysis of human chromosome 20 | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6866 | pages = 865–71 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11780052 | doi = 10.1038/414865a | url = | issn = [/tpl] Destrin is a component protein in microfilaments.
The product of this gene belongs to the actin-binding proteins ADF (Actin-Depolymerizing Factor)/cofilin family. This family of proteins is responsible for enhancing the turnover rate of actin in vivo. This gene encodes the actin depolymerizing protein that severs actin filaments (F-actin) and binds to actin monomers (G-actin). Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.

==Structure==

The tertiary structure of destrin was determined by the use of triple-resonance multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR.  The secondary and tertiary structures of destrin are similar to the gelsolin family which is another actin-regulating protein family.
There are three ordered layers to destrin which is a globular protein.  There is a central β sheet that is composed of one parallel strand and three antiparallel strands.  This β sheet is between a long α helix along with a shorter one and two shorter helices on the opposite side.  The four helices are parallel to the β strands.

==Function==

In a variety of eukaryotes, destrin regulates actin in the cytoskeleton.  Destrin binds actin and is thought to connect it as gelsolin segment-1 does.  Furthermore, the binding of actin by destrin and cofilin is regulated negatively by phosphorylation.  Destrin can also sever actin filaments.
