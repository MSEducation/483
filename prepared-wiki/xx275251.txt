The course circumnavigates the roads of Tonbridge and the Kent countryside. The route starts at K College on Brook Street and takes runners out of Tonbridge along Molescroft Way, Upper Hayesden Lane, and Ensfield Road to the village of Leigh. Runners pass through the village then head along the B2027 towards Hildenborough, turning left into Watts Cross Road and then left again at every junction back into Leigh. The final leg of the course takes runners back through Leigh village centre onto Ensfield Road, Hayesden Lane, then leading back to Brook Street to the finish.[tpl]cite web|author=iC Business Solutions Ltd www.ic-limited.co.uk |url=http://www.tonbridgehalfmarathon.co.uk/ |title=Tonbridge Half Marathon |publisher=Tonbridge Half Marathon |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/events/viewevent.asp?en=60038&sp=&v=1 |title=Events |publisher=Runnersworld.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
