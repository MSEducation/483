New Hope Christian Fellowship, based in Honolulu, Hawaii, is a chartered church of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. Started by Pastor Wayne Cordeiro in 1996, New Hope has 14,500 attendees weekly with five locations on Oahu and more than 100 affiliate churches worldwide. New Hope International is the leadership training and church planting arm of New Hope.

==History of New Hope==

Pastor Wayne Cordeiro (born October 20, 1952 in Fort Belvoir, Virginia) and his wife Anna moved from Oregon to Hilo, Hawaii in 1983 and started a church in the Waiakea Villas area.  It then moved to the Holo Women's Club and then to the Hilo Boy's and Girl's Club. In 1990, the "Gathering Place" facility was built and the church grew to 2000.
In September 1995, Cordeiro and Anna moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to start New Hope. From 1996 to 2012 the church met in the auditorium of Farrington High School in the Kalihi neighborhood of Honolulu. Since 2013 the New Hope Ministry Center has been located at 290 Sand Island Access Road in Honolulu.
Since its inception, New Hope has grown to over 124 churches in the Pacific Rim and beyond, including Las Vegas, Seattle, Simi Valley, Japan, Myanmar and Australia.
The Honolulu Star-Bulletin described New Hope as "a local personification of the nationwide phenomenon of mega-churches and the mushrooming of evangelical and pentecostal Christianity."  According to Cordeiro, "God said to me, 'Build big people, not a big church.'
New Hope Christian College, formerly Eugene Bible College, is affiliated with the church and is located in Eugene, Oregon.

==Partnership with Farrington High School==

From 1996 to 2012, New Hope partnered with Farrington High School by not only renting its auditorium for its weekend services, but also by helping maintain the campus.  According to Farrington's principal, the school was initially going to close its auditorium because it was run down and the school had no money to fix it.  The church responded by installing air conditioning and a sound system, while volunteers painted the auditorium, gym and several classrooms.  Volunteers also help perform custodial duties, such as clearing trash and mowing the lawns on campus.[tpl]cite news|last=Adamski|first=Mary|title=Faithful expansion|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/09/03/features/story1.html|accessdate=2013-09-02|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=2005-09-03[/tpl]
On Friday, November 23, 2012, Farrington's auditorium roof collapsed during a heavy rainstorm. The incident caused New Hope to relocate its services initially to Farrington's gymnasium for the remainder of 2012 and then to its present location at Sand Island in January 2013.
In August 2013, three New Hope churches and two others were sued by a group alleging that the churches underpaid for the use of school facilities. The suit claims that the five churches collectively underpaid by $5.6 million, of which New Hope Oahu alone was responsible for $3.2 million over the course of six years.[tpl]cite news|last=Sakahara|first=Tim|title=Lawsuit claims churches are stealing from public schools|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23152827/lawsuit-claims-churches-are-stealing-from-public-schools|accessdate=2013-09-02|newspaper=Hawaii News Now|date=2013-08-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=McDonald|first=Sherri Buri|title=Eugene pastor embroiled in lawsuit|url=http://www.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/30350927-75/hope-churches-hawaii-cordeiro-international.html.csp|accessdate=2013-09-03|newspaper=The Register Guard|date=2013-08-31[/tpl]
