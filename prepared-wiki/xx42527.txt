[[The World of the Partridge Family]]

CATEGORIES: The Partridge Family albums, 1974 compilation albums, Bell Records albums, Albums produced by Wes Farrell

The World of the Partridge Family was a compilation by The Partridge Family.  This was their only 2-record set as well as their last release on the Bell label, featuring 20 songs from the previous albums (except Christmas Card and Crossword Puzzle), including all their charted hits.  
Shortly after this release, which did not chart, Bell Records was sold and renamed Arista.  The album was renumbered as Arista 4021, but no new copies were printed.   Existing copies were merely shipped under the new Arista code number.  Only albums released in 1974 were renumbered; likewise, David Cassidy solo LP's were also renumbered.
