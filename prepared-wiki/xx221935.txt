CATEGORIES: House (TV series) characters, Fictional police detectives

Detective Michael Tritter is a recurring fictional character in the medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse.  He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007.  Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum.  After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers the doctor's Vicodin addiction.  Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab.  When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and finishing his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict he tried to make him out to be.
The character was created as somebody who could go "toe-to-toe" with House.  Morse, who had never seen the show before, was unsure if he could portray the character and was not impressed after familiarizing himself with the show.  The excited reaction of his friends to the acting opportunity finally convinced him to take the role.  Initial critical responses to the character were mostly positive, but critics later felt that the seven-episode Tritter story arc became "boring"; however, Morse was praised for his portrayal and gained an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series Emmy Award nomination for his appearance in the episode "Finding Judas".  Morse stated in a 2006 TV Guide interview that, although he had discussed it with writers of the show, bringing the character back on the show would be "practically impossible".

==Storyline==

Tritter first appears in the episode "Fools for Love".  His character is a police detective who suffers from a severe irritation in the area of his groin, which he believes to be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, and who becomes a patient of the walk-in clinic.  Although House diagnoses Tritter with dry skin, a common side effect of the nicotine gum that Tritter is chewing, Tritter requests that a sample be tested.  House declines on the grounds that he has already met this month's quota for indulging "stubborn idiots".  After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists he has to take Tritter's temperature rectally.  After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning.  Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would rather "beat the crap out of" House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize.  Later that night, Tritter pulls House over for a traffic violation and arrests him after finding unprescribed Vicodin pills in his pocket.  Other charges brought up against House include resisting arrest and driving under the influence (DUI).
In the next episode, "Que Será Será", Tritter searches House's apartment and finds a large quantity of Vicodin pills and two apparently forged prescriptions that bear the name of House's friend James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard).[tpl]cite episode|title=Que Sera Sera|episodelink=Que Sera Sera (House)|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Moran, Thomas L|network=Fox|airdate=7 November 2006|season=3|number=6[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap During "Son of Coma Guy" and "Whac-A-Mole", Tritter pressures Wilson and members of House's diagnostic team to testify against him, but they all refuse.[tpl]cite episode|title=Son of Coma Guy|episodelink=Son of Coma Guy|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Egan, Doris|network=Fox|airdate=14 November 2006|season=3|number=7[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap[tpl]cite episode|title=Whac-A-Mole|episodelink=Whac-A-Mole (House)|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Davis, Pam|network=Fox|airdate=21 November 2006|season=3|number=8[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap In "Finding Judas", Cuddy finds Tritter spending his day off looking through the hospital's log for evidence against House. She accuses him of not having a life and "personalizing every slight". Tritter responds that "nobody the hospital is innocent", as everyone allows House to treat patients despite knowing of his Vicodin addiction and that it takes a police detective to uncover what the doctors are deliberately hiding. At the end of the episode, Wilson visits Tritter and indicates his willingness to testify.[tpl]cite episode|title=Finding Judas|episodelink=Finding Judas|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Hass, Sara|network=Fox|airdate=28 November 2006|season=3|number=9[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap
In "Merry Little Christmas", Tritter and Wilson work out a deal to allow House to continue practicing medicine if he pleads guilty and spends two months in rehab. Meanwhile, House uses a dead patient's name to obtain Oxycodone pills as a Vicodin replacement drug. When he visits Tritter early the next morning to agree to the deal, Tritter says the deal is off, after going through the pharmacy's log and reading that House signed for a dead man's drugs.[tpl]cite episode|title=Merry Little Christmas|episodelink=Merry Little Christmas|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Friedman, Liz|network=Fox|airdate=12 December 2006|season=3|number=10[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap
In the final days leading up to House's court case, House realizes the severity of the situation and finally apologizes to Tritter (episode "Words and Deeds"). When Tritter refuses to accept the apology, House goes into rehab, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, but Tritter cites his experiences with addicts as evidence House has not changed. The judge tells Tritter that she does not believe House to be the drug dealer that Tritter tried to show him to be and orders Tritter to move on. Just before the bailiff escorts House out of the courtroom, Tritter tells him: "Good luck. I hope I'm wrong about you."[tpl]cite episode|title=Words and Deeds|episodelink=Words and Deeds|series=House, M.D.|serieslink=House (TV series)|credits=Shore, David; Dick, Leonard|network=Fox|airdate=1 January 2007|season=3|number=10[/tpl] Television Without Pity Recap

==Creation and casting==

The Tritter character was created as someone to go "toe-to-toe" with House. The producers envisioned a character with an inner strength, intelligence, and single-mindedness to match that of House.[tpl]cite news|title=David Morse a 'House' Cop With a Problem|url=http://www.austin360.com/tv/content/tv/stories/2006/11/9davidmorse.html|first=Bridget|last=Byrne|work=The Associated Press|location=Los Angeles, California|date=8 November 2006|accessdate=15 August 2008[/tpl] In 2006, House creator David Shore contacted actor David Morse, with whom he had previously worked on Hack, for a guest-starring episode arc on the show. According to Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News, Morse's earlier portrayals of "scary" cops (in 16 Blocks and Hack) helped him clinch the role.[tpl]cite news|title=David Morse makes a "House" call|first=Ellen|last=Gray|date=26 October 2006|publisher=Philadelphia Daily News|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl]
Morse was unfamiliar with the show. After watching several House episodes, he was surprised that the show had a strong audience with "such a total jerk" as the lead character. It was not until Morse told a few long-time friends about the job offer that their enthusiastic reaction convinced him to take the role. Katie Jacobs, executive producer of House, was impressed by Morse's performance. In a 2006 TV Guide interview, Morse said that, although he discussed the possibility with House writers, it would be "practically impossible" to get the character to return in any later seasons.[tpl]cite news|title=David Morse Prescribes Big Trouble for Dr. House|first=Angel|last=Cohn|date=31 October 2006|publisher=TV Guide|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl]

==Reception==

Initial responses to the character were mostly positive. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune declared Tritter the best male villain of the fall of 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2006/10/fall_tvs_best_n.html#more|title=Fall TV's best new characters|author=Ryan, Maureen|date=19 October 2006|publisher=The Watcher, Chicago Tribune|accessdate=8 November 2008[/tpl] Lisa Edelstein, who portrays Lisa Cuddy on House, named David Morse as one of her favorite House guest stars, saying that he did a great job portraying the character.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/house/exclusive-interview-house-star-11812.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview: 'House' Star Lisa Edelstein|author=Kubicek, John|date=2 October 2007|publisher=BuddyTV|accessdate=15 November 2008[/tpl] Barbara Barnett from Blog Critics Magazine and Charles McGrath of The New York Times compared Tritter to Inspector Javert of Les Misérables,[tpl]cite news|first=Barbara|last=Barnett|date=10 April 2008|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2008/04/10/1158232.php|title=House, MD: Revisiting the "Tritter Arc"|publisher=Blog Critics|accessdate=22 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/theater/07morse.html?pagewanted=print|title=Discovering Irishness, Recovering Niceness|author=McGrath, Charles|date=7 January 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=12 December 2008[/tpl] and Alynda Wheat from Entertainment Weekly stated that Tritter annoyed House more than any other character, surpassing other antagonists such as Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), and Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20225048,00.html|title=Who Annoyed Dr. House Most?|author=Wheat, Alynda|date=12 September 2008|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] Variety[tpl]'[/tpl]s Stuart Levine considered Tritter a "worthy foe" for House.[tpl]cite news|title=Big events shocked the pants off auds: shows push buttons to keep viewers glued|work=Variety|author=Levine, Stuart|date=13 August 2007[/tpl]

However, the continued character arc increasingly bored critics. Staci Krause of IGN found the first few episodes of Season 3, in which House recovers from being shot, more interesting. In a review of "Que Sera Sera", Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'[/tpl]s Michelle Kung noted that while David Morse is a fine actor, "his cop is so ridiculously one-note and revenge-bent that his scenes are often just excruciating to sit through".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1556339,00.html|title=Heavy Hands|work=On "House," oppressive cop Tritter draws Wilson into his case against the doc, and the team struggles to diagnose 600 pounds of patient|author=Kung, Michelle|date=8 November 2006|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] In a review for "Fools for Love", Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity doubted that Tritter's revenge on House was worth his time and aggravation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/house/fools_for_love.php?page=11|author=Morrison, Sara|title=Awkward|date=31 October 2006|publisher=Television Without Pity|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] and later called the Tritter arc an "insane quest for ass-thermometer justice".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/house/que_ser_ser.php|author=Morrison, Sara|title=Vogler II: Electric Vog-a-loo|date=7 November 2006|publisher=Television Without Pity|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] The Star-Ledger[tpl]'[/tpl]s Alan Sepinwall stated that "pitting House against a comedy-impaired cop was both dull and not a fair fight".[tpl]cite news|url=http://blog.nj.com/alltv/2007/11/sepinwall_on_tv_house_gets_a_c.html|title=Sepinwall on TV: 'House' gets a creative shot in the arm|author=Sepinwall, Alan|publisher=The Star-Ledger|date=27 November 2007|accessdate=18 November 2008[/tpl]
The show's fans had shown dislike for other antagonists with multi-episode guest-starring arcs, and critics suspected that Tritter's character would receive similar disdain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2006/10/the_tease_house.html|title=The Tease: 'House' Returns with David Morse|author=Fienberg, David|date=30 October 2006|publisher=Zap2it|accessdate=4 October 2008[/tpl] The conclusion of the storyline, and Tritter's departure from the show, were described by USA Today critic Robert Bianco as a Christmas gift for fans of the show. Morse jokingly stated after his departure that various fans had told him of their hate for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/we_ask_david_morse_of_the_seaf.html|title=We Ask David Morse of ‘The Seafarer’ Who's Tougher: The Devil or House?|author=Latifi, Sadia|date=12 June 2007|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2008[/tpl]
Morse, however, gained mainly positive responses to his portrayal of Tritter. The Star-Ledger[tpl]'[/tpl]s Alan Sepinwall called Morse a "superb actor", and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated that Morse's "understated performance" made Tritter all the more scary. Zap2it's Daniel Fienberg regarded Morse as "one of our very best character actors".
