==History==

The twin villages of Al-Tall and nearby Al-Nahr were both sites of ancient settlements atop the tel of Kabri.[tpl]cite book | title=The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land | publisher=Israel Exploration Society & Carta, Simon and Schuster | author=Stern, E., Lewinson-Gilboa, A., Avriam, J. | year=1993 | location=Jerusalem | pages=839-841 | isbn=0-13-276312-5 | volume=3[/tpl] Recent excavations indicate habitation back to the eighteenth century BC.Aaron Kempinsky, 1987: Israel Exploration Journal 37:176. Cited in Khalidi (1992), p. 27-28
In the  Ottoman period, a mill was shown here on   Pierre Jacotin´s map from 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 160
In 1875 the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called Et-Tell. He described it: "Below the village extend fresh and verdant gardens where the water flows and murmurs  incessantly in little canals, and where lofty poplars and great nut-trees, which recall Europe, mingle with the trees of Palestine.	Near here is a mill, worked by water falling from a higher basin, which acts as a reservoir for a spring as abundant as that of Ras el 'Ain. After leaving the mill, the water forms a stream which fertilises the adjacent orchards. This raised and broad reservoir, whence the water escapes by an opening made for the purpose in the edge of the reservoir, is of modern construction, as is shown by the stones; but its first building must be ancient, because it is difficult to believe that the ancients should have neglected to get all the advantage possible from so important a spring."Guérin, 1880,  p. 31-32, as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, p.   148  
In 1881  the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as "A stone and adobe village, containing about 200
Moslems, with figs,  olive, pomegranate, and mulberry trees  and gardens;  there are two streams of water at this village."Conder and Kitchener, SWP, 1881, I, p. 148 The layout of the village was rectangular. Its houses were built from stone and concrete or from mud.Makhul, 1977, p 117.   Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.32

===1948 War and aftermath===

Al-Tall was captured by the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami.
There are no recorded Israeli settlements on the village land.Khalidi, 1992, p.32
According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures on the village land were in 1992:
"The site is covered with the rubble of stone houses and is overgrown with wild grass. One stone house still stands but its facade is missing and it is about to crumble.  Cactuses and fig trees grow on the southern slopes of the site. There are four identifiable Roman and Byzantine tombs in the cemetery that lies on the northern slopes, a Christ-thorn tree stands in its midst. Recent excavations has uncovered several ancient graves, and the place has been turned into an archaeological site."
In 1993, when A. Petersen visited the place, the only structure he found standing was a  cistern, known as Birket al-Mafshukh,Meaning "Pool of the split (rock &c)", according to Palmer, 1881, p. 41 located north of the tell. In 1881, it had been described as a "birket of masonry, and a large perennial spring, with a stream flowing from it to the sea; the stream is called Nahr Mefshukh; gives very plentyful supply of water."Conder and Kitchener, 1881;  Birket al-Mafshukh p.158 According the Petersen, the birkat was  "rectangular with a semi-circular extension at the west end."Petersen, 2001, p. 290
