Perhaps the most notable researcher arguing for a strong genetic influence on these average score differences was [[Arthur Jensen]] who restarted the debate in 1969 with his paper "[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?]]", but many others e.g. [[Philippe Rushton]], [[Richard Lynn]], are also hereditarians (those who think that genetics plays some role in race differences in IQ/g). In contrast, other researchers such as [[Richard Nisbett]] argue that environmental factors can explain all of the average group differences.<ref>[tpl]Cite book|title=Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count |last=Nisbett |first=Richard E. |authorlink=Richard E.

However, in the case of Griggs v. Duke Power Co. in 1971, for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the use of IQ tests in employment, except when linked to job performance via a Job analysis. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting neurotoxins, have as one of their goals raising, or preventing a decline in, intelligence.
A diagnosis of intellectual disability is in part based on the results of IQ testing. Borderline intellectual functioning is a categorization where a person has below average cognitive ability (an IQ of 71–85), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below).
In the United Kingdom, the eleven plus exam which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from 1945 to decide, at eleven years old, which type of school a child should go to. They have been much less used since the widespread introduction of comprehensive schools.

==Criticism and views==

===Relation between IQ and intelligence===

IQ is the most researched attempt at measuring intelligence and by far the most widely used in practical setting. However, although IQ attempts to measure some notion of intelligence, it may fail to act as an accurate measure of "intelligence" in its broadest sense. IQ tests only examine particular areas embodied by the broadest notion of "intelligence", failing to account for certain areas which are also associated with "intelligence" such as creativity or emotional intelligence.
There are critics such as Keith Stanovich who do not dispute the stability of IQ test scores or the fact that they predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively. They do argue, however, that to base a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone is to ignore many important aspects of mental ability.The Waning of I.Q. by David Brooks, The New York Times

===Criticism of g===

Some scientists dispute IQ entirely. In The Mismeasure of Man (1996), paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould criticized IQ tests and argued that they were used for scientific racism. He argued that g was a mathematical artifact and criticized:
Arthur Jensen responded:
Psychologist Peter Schönemann was also a persistent critic of IQ, calling it "the IQ myth". He argued that g is a flawed theory and that the high heritability estimates of IQ are based on false assumptions.Psychometrics of Intelligence.  K. Kemp-Leonard (ed.)  Encyclopedia of Social Measurement, 3, 193-201: http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~phs/pdf/89.pdf[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1018358504373 |first1=Peter H. |last1=Schönemann |title=On models and muddles of heritability |pmid=9463078 |year=1997 |pages=97–108 |issue=2–3 |volume=99 |journal=Genetica |url=http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~phs/pdf/81.pdf[/tpl]
Jensen has rejected the criticism by Gould and also argued that even if g were replaced by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. All tests of cognitive ability would continue to be highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jensen Arthur | year = 1982 | title = The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons | url = http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html | journal = Contemporary Education Review | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 121–135 [/tpl]

===Test bias===

The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that in the United States IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for Caucasians.
However, IQ tests may well be biased when used in other situations. A 2005 study stated that "differential validity in prediction suggests that the WAIS-R test may contain cultural influences that reduce the validity of the WAIS-R as a measure of cognitive ability for Mexican American students,"[tpl]cite journal |last1=Verney |first1=S.

Other recent studies have questioned the culture-fairness of IQ tests when used in South Africa.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Shuttleworth-Edwards |first1=Ann |last2=Kemp |first2=Ryan |last3=Rust |first3=Annegret |last4=Muirhead |first4=Joanne |last5=Hartman |first5=Nigel |last6=Radloff |first6=Sarah |title=Cross-cultural Effects on IQ Test Performance: A Review and Preliminary Normative Indications on WAIS-III Test Performance |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=903–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15742541 |doi=10.1080/13803390490510824[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Cronshaw |first1=Steven F. |last2=Hamilton |first2=Leah K. |last3=Onyura |first3=Betty R. |last4=Winston |first4=Andrew S. |title=Case for Non-Biased Intelligence Testing Against Black Africans Has Not Been Made: A Comment on Rushton, Skuy, and Bons (2004) |journal=International Journal of Selection and Assessment |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=278–87 |year=2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2389.2006.00346.x[/tpl] Standard intelligence tests, such as the Stanford-Binet, are often inappropriate for children with autism; the alternative of using developmental or adaptive skills measures are relatively poor measures of intelligence in autistic children, and may have resulted in incorrect claims that a majority of children with autism are mentally retarded.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Goldberg Edelson |first1=M. |title=Are the Majority of Children With Autism Mentally Retarded?: A Systematic Evaluation of the Data |journal=Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=66–83 |year=2006 |doi=10.1177/10883576060210020301[/tpl]

===Outdated methodology===

According to a 2006 article by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, contemporary psychological researches often did not reflect substantial recent developments in psychometrics and "bears an uncanny resemblance to the psychometric state of the art as it existed in the 1950s."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Borsboom |first1=Denny |title=The attack of the psychometricians |journal=Psychometrika |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=425–40 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11336-006-1447-6 |ref=harv |pmc=2779444 |pmid=19946599[/tpl]

==="Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns"===

In response to the controversy surrounding The Bell Curve, the American Psychological Association's Board of Scientific Affairs established a task force in 1995 to write a report on the state of intelligence research which could be used by all sides as a basis for discussion, "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns". The full text of the report is available through several websites.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Neisser |pages=77–101 |first1=Ulric |last2=Boodoo |first2=Gwyneth |last3=Bouchard |first3=Thomas J., Jr. |last4=Boykin |first4=A. Wade |last5=Brody |first5=Nathan |last6=Ceci |first6=Stephen J. |last7=Halpern |first7=Diane F. |last8=Loehlin |first8=John C. |last9=Perloff |first9=Robert |displayauthors=9 |volume=51 |issue=2 |year=1996 |title=Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77 |journal=American Psychologist |url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/Correlation/Intelligence.pdf[/tpl]
In this paper the representatives of the association regret that IQ-related works are frequently written with a view to their political consequences:  "research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications".
The task force concluded that IQ scores do have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They stated that individual differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by both genetics and environment.
The report stated that a number of biological factors, including malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances, and various prenatal and perinatal stressors, result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, saying:
The APA journal that published the statement, American Psychologist, subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations.

===Dynamic assessment===

Notable and increasingly influentialMindes, G. Assessing young children. Merrill/Prentice Hall, 2003, p. 158Haywood, H. Carl & Lidz, Carol Schneider. Dynamic Assessment in Practice: Clinical And Educational Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 1 alternative to the wide range of standard IQ tests originated in the writings of psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934) of his most mature and highly productive period of 1932-1934. The notion of the zone of proximal development that he introduced in 1933, roughly a year before his death, served as the banner for his proposal to diagnose development as the level of actual development that can be measured by the child's independent problem solving and, at the same time, the level of proximal, or potential development that is measured in the situation of moderately assisted problem solving by the child.Vygotsky, L.S. (19332-34/1997). The Problem of Age. in The Collected Works of L. S. Vygotsky, Volume 5, 1998, pp. 187-205 The maximum level of complexity and difficulty of the problem that the child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates the level of potential development. Then, the difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of proximal development. Combination of the two indexes[tpl]--[/tpl]the level of actual and the zone of the proximal development[tpl]--[/tpl]according to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone.Chaiklin, S. (2003). "The Zone of Proximal Development in Vygotsky's analysis of learning and instruction." In Kozulin, A., Gindis, B., Ageyev, V. & Miller, S. (Eds.) Vygotsky's educational theory and practice in cultural context. 39-64. Cambridge: Cambridge UniversityZaretskii,V.K. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development What Vygotsky Did Not Have Time to Write. Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, vol. 47, no. 6, November–December 2009, pp. 70–93
The ideas on the zone of development were later developed in a number of psychological and educational theories and practices. Most notably, they were developed under the banner of dynamic assessment that focuses on the testing of learning and developmental potentialSternberg, R.S. & Grigorenko, E.L. (2001). All testing is dynamic testing. Issues in Education, 7(2), 137-170Sternberg, R.J. & Grigorenko, E.L. (2002). Dynamic testing: The nature and measurement of learning potential. Cambridge (UK): University of CambridgeHaywood, C.H. & Lidz, C.S. (2007). Dynamic assessment in practice: Clinical and educational applications. New York: Cambridge University Press (for instance, in the work of Reuven Feuerstein and his associates,Feuerstein, R., Feuerstein, S., Falik, L & Rand, Y. (1979; 2002). Dynamic assessments of cognitive modifiability. ICELP Press, Jerusalem: Israel who has criticized standard IQ testing for its putative assumption or acceptance of "fixed and immutable" characteristics of intelligence or cognitive functioning). Grounded in developmental theories of Vygotsky and Feuerstein, who recognized that human beings are not static entities but are always in states of transition and transactional relationships with the world, dynamic assessment received also considerable support in the recent revisions of cognitive developmental theory by Joseph Campione, Ann Brown, and John D. Bransford and in theories of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg.Dodge, Kenneth A. Foreword, xiii-xv. In Haywood, H. Carl & Lidz, Carol Schneider.

==IQ classification==

IQ classification is the practice by IQ test publishers of designating IQ score ranges as various categories with labels such as "superior" or "average."[tpl]Cite book |title=Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence |last1=Kaufman |first1=Alan S. |last2=Lichtenberger |first2=Elizabeth |authorlink1=Alan S. Kaufman |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Hoboken (NJ) |isbn=978-0-471-73553-3 |laysummary=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471735531.html |laydate=22 August 2010[/tpl] IQ classification was preceded historically by attempts to classify human beings by general ability based on other forms of behavioral observation. Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based on IQ tests.

==High IQ societies==

There are social organizations, some international, which limit membership to people who have scores as high as or higher than the 98th percentile on some IQ test or equivalent. Mensa International is perhaps the best known of these. There are other groups requiring a score above the 99th percentile.
