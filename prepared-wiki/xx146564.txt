Nyamninia is a village in western part of Kenya in Nyanza Province. It is part of Yala division of Siaya District. Situated approximately 30 miles from Kisumu city, Nyamninia is home to the 100 kilowatts medium wave radio transmitters set up by Voice of Kenya (VoK); now renamed Kenya Broadcastic Corporation (KBC).  It was the birthplace of the legendary Gem clan chief, Odera Kang'o who started a rice plantation scheme in the area about one hundred years ago. The Gem chief was responsible for construction the numerous schools in the region before his enforced exile in 1915, to Kampala, Uganda by the British colonialists. 
At present, it is a business centre. Both Nyamninia Primary School and Nyamninia Secondary School are located within the centre.
Nyamninia is occupied mainly by the Luo and the Kisa tribe (Luhya), an indigenous Luhya sub-tribe.http://www.abeingo.org/SUBTRIBE%20DOCS/KISA.pdf
