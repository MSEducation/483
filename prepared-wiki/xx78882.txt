===Politics and international relations===

The Duke considers himself a Conservative and took his seat in the House of Lords on his father's death in 1992. He is one of two dukes to have re-entered the House (of the 24 non-royal dukes eligible) following the House of Lords Act 1999, having been one of the 92 peers chosen or elected by the others sitting. The other duke in the upper house among these 92 is the Duke of Norfolk, who did not technically have to stand for election as his right to sit is deemed automatic, as he holds the Royal Office of Earl Marshal.  
The Duke of Montrose was a shadow minister for the Scotland Office before the 2010 General Election. He has also spent some time in China promoting renewable energy and environmental measures, and he is a fluent speaker of Mandarin.
