Lee Harvey Oswald (October 18, 1939 – November 24, 1963) was, according to five government investigations,These were investigations by: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1963), the Warren Commission (1964), the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979), the Secret Service, and the Dallas Police Department. the sniper who assassinated John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.
Oswald was a former U.S. Marine who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959. He lived in the Soviet Union until June 1962, at which time he returned to the United States. Oswald was initially arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit, who was killed on a Dallas street approximately 45 minutes after President Kennedy was shot. Oswald would later be charged with the assassination of President Kennedy as well but denied shooting anybody, claiming he was a patsy.Lee Oswald claiming innocence (film), Youtube.comWarren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, Kantor Exhibit No. 3—Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination Two days later, while being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail, Oswald was shot and mortally wounded by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in full view of television cameras broadcasting live.
In 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy, firing three shots. This conclusion was supported by prior investigations carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and Dallas Police Department.John F. Kennedy, Dallas Police Department Collection[tpl]cite book|author=John R.

Despite forensic, ballistic, and eyewitness evidence supporting the lone gunman theory, public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that a majority of Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone, but conspired with others to kill the president,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1813/most-americans-believe-oswald-conspired-others-kill-jfk.aspx |title=Gallop: Most Americans Believe Oswald Conspired With Others to Kill JFK |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012[/tpl] and the assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories. In 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Oswald fired the shots that killed Kennedy, but differed from previous investigations in concluding that "scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that two gunmen fired at President John F. Kennedy".[tpl]cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html[/tpl]House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report, pp. 65-75.

==Early life==

===Childhood===

Lee Harvey Oswald was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1939,Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 799, CE 1963, Schedule showing known addresses of Lee Harvey Oswald from the time of his birth. to World War I veteran Robert Edward Lee Oswald (March 4, 1896 – August 19, 1939)[tpl]cite web|title=Robert Edward Lee Oswald|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=29264820|publisher=Find a Grave[/tpl] and Marguerite Frances Claverie (July 19, 1907 – January 17, 1981).[tpl]cite web|title=Marguerite Frances Claverie|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=59563475|publisher=Find a Grave[/tpl] Robert had died of a heart attack two months prior to Lee's birth. Lee's elder brother Robert Jr. (born April 7, 1934) is also a former Marine. Through Marguerite's first marriage to Edward John Pic, Jr., Lee and Robert Jr. are the half-brothers of Air Force veteran John Edward Pic (January 17, 1932 – April 25, 2000).[tpl]cite web|title=John Edward Pic|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=32062078|publisher=Find a Grave[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-13.html |title=Warren Commission Report, Appendix 13: Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, pages 670–682 |publisher=Archives.gov |year=1964[/tpl]
In 1944, Marguerite moved the family from New Orleans to Dallas, Texas. Oswald entered the 1st grade in 1945 and over the next half-dozen years attended several different schools in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas through the 6th grade. Oswald took an IQ test in the 4th grade and scored 103; "on achievement tests in 4 to 6, he twice did best in reading and twice did worst in spelling."
As a child, Oswald was described by several people who knew him as withdrawn and temperamental.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html |title=Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7, page 378 |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=February 27, 2009[/tpl] In August 1952, when Oswald was 12, his mother took him to New York City where they lived for a short time with Oswald's half-brother, John. Oswald and his mother were later asked to leave after an argument in which Oswald allegedly struck his mother and threatened John's wife with a pocket knife.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Warren Commission Hearings |url=http://www.jfk-assassination.de/warren/wch/vol11/page38.php |title=Testimony of John Edward Pic[/tpl]Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 687, CE 1382, Interview with Mrs. John Edward Pic.
Oswald attended the 7th grade in the The Bronx, New York, but was often truant, which led to a psychiatric assessment at a juvenile reformatory. The reformatory psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, described Oswald as immersed in a "vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power, through which Oswald tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations." Dr. Hartogs detected a "personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive-aggressive tendencies" and recommended continued treatment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/JA/DR/.dr16.html |title=Report of Renatus Hartogs, May 1, 1953 |publisher=Acorn.net |date=May 1, 1953 |accessdate=September 17, 2010[/tpl]
In January 1954, Oswald's mother returned to New Orleans, taking Oswald with her.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, p. 123, CE 2223, Big Brothers of New York, Inc., Case file of Lee Harvey Oswald. At the time, there was a question pending before a New York judge as to whether Oswald should be removed from the care of his mother to finish his schooling,Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald.

In New Orleans, Oswald completed the 8th and 9th grades. He entered the 10th grade in 1955 but quit school after one month.[tpl]cite journal |last=Bagdikian |first=Ben H. |authorlink=Ben Bagdikian |editor1-first=Clay |editor1-last=Blair Jr. |editor1-link=Clay Blair |date=December 14, 1963 |title=The Assassin |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |issue=44 |page=23 |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Company |location=Philadelphia, PA. 19105[/tpl] After leaving school, Oswald worked for several months as an office clerk and messenger in New Orleans. In July 1956, Oswald's mother moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas, and Oswald re-enrolled in the 10th grade for the September session at Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth. A few weeks later in October, Oswald quit school at age 17 to join the Marines (see below); he never received a high school diploma.
By the age of 17, he had resided at 22 different locations and attended 12 different schools.[ref]
The schools were: [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

Though the young Oswald had trouble spelling and writing coherently,Warren Commission Report, Chapt. 7, p. 383. he read voraciously. By age 15, he claimed to be a Marxist, writing in his diary, "I was looking for a key to my environment, and then I discovered socialist literature. I had to dig for my books in the back dusty shelves of libraries." At 16 he wrote to the Socialist Party of America for information on their Young People's Socialist League, saying he had been studying socialist principles for "well over fifteen months."Warren Commission Hearings, CE 2240, FBI transcript of letter from Lee Oswald to the Socialist Party of America, October 3, 1956.
However, Edward Voebel, "whom the Warren Commission had established was Oswald's closest friend during his teenage years in New Orleans..... said that reports that Oswald was already 'studying Communism' were a 'lot of baloney.' " Voebel said that "Oswald commonly read 'paperback trash.'"Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol, United States House Select Committee on Assassinations, vol. 9, 4, p. 107.Testimony of Edward Voebel, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 10, 12.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 235. ISBN 1-56924-739-0
As a teenager, in 1955, Oswald attended Civil Air Patrol meetings in New Orleans. Oswald's fellow cadets recalled him attending C.A.P. meetings "three or four" times, or "10 or 12 times" over a one- or two-month period.Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol, House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 9, 4, pp. 107-115.Summers 1998, p. 234.PBS Frontline "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald", broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).

===Marine Corps===

Oswald enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, just after his seventeenth birthday. Because he was underage, his brother Robert Jr. signed the forms as his guardian. Oswald also named his mother and his half-brother John as beneficiaries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.modbee.com/2013/11/25/3052132/bob-ray-sanders-a-monday-of-funerals.html|title=A Monday of funerals, and learning a bit more about the man who killed Kennedy|first=Bob Ray|last=Sanders|date=25 November 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram[/tpl] Oswald idolized his older brother Robert Jr.; a photograph taken after Lee Harvey's arrest by Dallas police shows him wearing his brother's Marine Corps ring.Bob Goodman, Triangle of Fire (Laquerian Publishing Co., 1993).
John Pic (Oswald's half-brother) testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald's enlistment was motivated by wanting "to get from out and under ... the yoke of oppression from my mother."Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7, p. 384, Lee Harvey Oswald: Background and Possible Motives, Return to New Orleans and Joining the Marine Corps.
Oswald's enlistment papers record his vital statistics as [tpl]convert|5|ft|8|in|m|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] in height, [tpl]convert|135|lb[/tpl] in weight, with hazel eyes and brown hair. His primary training was radar operation, a position requiring a security clearance. A May 1957 document states that he was "granted final clearance to handle classified matter up to and including CONFIDENTIAL after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data."Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 665, Administrative Remarks.
In the Aircraft Control and Warning Operator Course he finished seventh in a class of thirty. The course "included instruction in aircraft surveillance and the use of radar."Marines Warren Commission Report, Appendix 13, page 682–683.Summers 1998, p. 91.
He was assigned first to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in July 1957,Warren Commission Hearings, Marine Corps service record of Lee Harvey Oswald. then to Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Japan in September as part of Marine Air Control Squadron 1.
Like all Marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting and he scored 212 in December 1956, slightly above the requirements for the designation of sharpshooter. In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to marksman.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: The Assassin, Oswald's Marine Training
Oswald was court-martialed after accidentally shooting himself in the elbow with an unauthorized .22 handgun, then court-martialed again for fighting with a sergeant whom he thought was responsible for his punishment in the shooting matter. He was demoted from private first class to private and briefly imprisoned in the brig. He was later punished for a third incident: while on night-time sentry duty in the Philippines, he inexplicably fired his rifle into the jungle.Gerald Posner "Case Closed" Random House, New York, 1993 pg. 28
Slightly built, Oswald was nicknamed Ozzie Rabbit after the cartoon character; he was also called OswaldskovichAffidavit of James Botelho because he espoused pro-Soviet sentiments. In November 1958, Oswald transferred back to El Toro[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tYi9AAAAQBAJ&pg=PT46&lpg#v=onepage&q&f=false |authorlink=Jean Davison |title=Oswald's Game |publisher=W W Norton & Co Inc |work=books.google.com |year=2013 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 [/tpl] where his unit's function "was to serveil [tpl]sic[/tpl] for aircraft, but basically to train both enlisted men and officers for later assignment overseas." An officer there said that Oswald was a "very competent" crew chief and was "brighter than most people."Testimony of John E. Donovan, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 290-298.Summers 1998, p. 94.
While in the Marines, Oswald made an effort to teach himself rudimentary Russian. Although this was an unusual endeavor, in February 1959, he was invited to take a Marine proficiency exam in written and spoken Russian. His level at the time was rated "poor."Summers 1998, pp. 94, 99. On September 11, 1959, he received a hardship discharge from active service, claiming his mother needed care, and was put on reserve.[ref]Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 19, Folsom Exhibit No. 1, p. 85, Request for Dependency Discharge.

===Defection to the Soviet Union===

In October 1959, just before turning 20, Oswald traveled to the Soviet Union, a trip he planned well in advance. Along with his self-taught Russian, he had saved $1,500 of his Marine Corps salary.[ref]Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, p. 705, CE 1385, Notes of interview of Lee Harvey Oswald conducted by Aline Mosby in Moscow in November 1959. Oswald: "When I was working in the middle of the night on guard duty, I would think how long it would be and how much money I would have to save. It would be like being out of prison. I saved about $1500." During Oswald's 2 years and 10 months of service in the Marine Corps he received $3,452.20, after all taxes, allotments and other deductions as well as his GED.

Oswald spent two days with his mother in Fort Worth, then embarked by ship from New Orleans on September 20 to Le Havre, France, and immediately proceeded to the United Kingdom. Arriving in Southampton on October 9, he told officials he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for one week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland. However, on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, where he was issued a Soviet visa on October 14. Oswald left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the Soviet border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October 16.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, The Journey From USA to USSR at Russian Books His visa, valid only for a week, was due to expire on October 21.
Almost immediately after arriving, Oswald told his Intourist guide of his desire to become a Soviet citizen. When asked why by the various Soviet officials he encountered—all of whom, by Oswald's account, found his wish incomprehensible—he said that he was a communist, and gave what he described in his diary as "vauge sic answers about 'Great Soviet Union'".Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 94, CE 24, Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary", entries of October 16, 1959 to October 21, 1959. On October 21, the day his visa was due to expire, he was told that his citizenship application had been refused, and that he had to leave the Soviet Union that evening. Distraught, Oswald inflicted a minor but bloody wound to his left wrist in his hotel room bathtub soon before his Intourist guide was due to arrive to escort him from the country, according to his diary because he wished to kill himself in a way that would shock her. Delaying Oswald's departure because of his self-inflicted injury, the Soviets kept him in a Moscow hospital under psychiatric observation until October 28, 1959.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 95, CE 24, Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary", entries of October 21, 1959 to October 28, 1959.
According to Oswald, he met with four more Soviet officials that same day, who asked if he wanted to return to the United States; he insisted to them that he wanted to live in the Soviet Union as a Soviet national. When pressed for identification papers, he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 96, CE 24, Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary", entries of October 28, 1959 to October 31, 1959.
On October 31, Oswald appeared at the United States embassy in Moscow, declaring a desire to renounce his U.S. citizenship.[ref]Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, Moscow Part 1 at Russian Books

He told the U.S. embassy interviewing officer, Richard Edward Snyder, that " he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and that he had voluntarily stated to unnamed Soviet officials that as a Soviet citizen he would make known to them such information concerning the Marine Corps and his specialty as he possessed. He intimated that he might know something of special interest."Foreign Service Dispatch from the American Embassy in Moscow to the Department of State, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 98, CE 908

Though Oswald had wanted to attend Moscow State University, he was sent to Minsk to work as a lathe operator at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. Stanislau Shushkevich, who later became independent Belarus's first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time, and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nv-online.info/by/251/printed/41936/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2-%D0%A8%D0%A3%D0%A8%D0%9A%D0%95%D0%92%D0%98%D0%A7-%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE.htm |title=Stanislau Shushkevich, biographical sketch (in Russian) |publisher=Nv-online.info |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2012[/tpl] Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay—all in all, an idyllic existence by working-class Soviet standards,Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, Minsk Part 3 at Russian Books though he was kept under constant surveillance.Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, Minsk Part 2 at Russian Books
Oswald grew bored in Minsk.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7 
He wrote in his diary in January 1961: "I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying. The work is drab, the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling alleys, no places of recreation except the trade union dances. I have had enough."Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 16, p. 102, CE 24, Lee Harvey Oswald's "Historic Diary", entry of January 4–31, 1961.
Shortly afterwards, Oswald (who had never formally renounced his U.S. citizenship) wrote to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow requesting return of his American passport, and proposing to return to the U.S. if any charges against him would be dropped.[ref]Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 18, p. 131, CE 931, Undated letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to the American Embassy in Moscow.

In March 1961, Oswald met Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova, a 19-year-old pharmacology student; they married less than six weeks later in April.Though later reports described her uncle, with whom she was living, as a colonel in the KGB, he was a lumber industry expert in the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) with a bureaucratic rank of Polkovnik.

The Oswalds soon settled in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where Lee's mother and brother lived. Lee began a manuscript on Soviet life, though he eventually gave up the project.Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, Warren Report, Appendix 13, p. 714. The Oswalds also became acquainted with a number of anti-Communist Russian and East European émigrés in the area.Biography of Lee Harvey Oswald, Warren Report, Appendix 13, p. 716.Summers 1998, p. 152. In testimony to the Warren Commission, Alexander Kleinlerer said that the Russian émigrés sympathized with Marina, while merely tolerating Oswald, whom they regarded as rude and arrogant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-7.html#relationship |title=Warren Commission Report Chapter 7 – Relationship with Wife |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2009[/tpl]Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, p. 123, Affidavit of Alexander Kleinlerer: "Anna Meller, Mrs. Hall, George Bouhe, and the deMohrenschildts, and all that group had pity for Marina and her child.

In July 1962, Oswald was hired by Dallas' Leslie Welding Company; he disliked the work and quit after three months. In October, he was hired by the graphic-arts firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall as a photoprint trainee. A fellow employee at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall testified that Oswald's rudeness at his new job was such that fights threatened to break out, and that he once saw Oswald reading a Russian-language publication.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 199-205, Testimony of Dennis Hyman Ofstein.

General Walker was an outspoken anti-communist, segregationist, and member of the John Birch Society. In 1961, Walker had been relieved of his command of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army in West Germany for distributing right-wing literature to his troops.Scott, Peter Dale. Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993), pp. 34, 50. ISBN 0-520-20519-7Summers 1998, pp. 161–162. Walker's later actions in opposition to racial integration at the University of Mississippi led to his arrest on insurrection, seditious conspiracy, and other charges. He was temporarily held in a mental institution on orders from President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, but a grand jury refused to indict him.Summers 1998, p. 162.
To the end of his life, Walker believed that there was another man serving as Oswald's accomplice, and he spent decades attempting to learn the identity of that accomplice. Unsatisfied with the Dallas Police's investigation into the shooting, he hired a private investigator and he himself interviewed witnesses. In his testimony, he accused the Commission and FBI of blocking his access to Coleman.TESTIMONY OF MAJ. GEN. EDWIN A. WALKER Walker also testified in a letter to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that the bullet that the committee called the Walker bullet was not the bullet that almost killed him; "It is not the bullet that was fired at me and taken out of my house by the Dallas City Police on April 10, 1963. The bullet you have was not gotten from me or taken out of my house by anyone at anytime."
Marina Oswald testified that her husband told her that he traveled by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle.Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald, Warren Commission Hearings, volume 1, pg. 17.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#walker |title=Warren Commission Report | page=187 |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|date= |accessdate=December 3, 2011[/tpl] She said that Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a "fascist organization.""Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 16, Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. A note Oswald left for Marina on the night of the attempt, telling her what to do if he did not return, was not found until ten days after the Kennedy assassination.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 392–393, CE 1785, Secret Service report dated December 5, 1963, on questioning of Marina Oswald about note Oswald wrote before he attempted to kill General Walker.Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 393–394."Oswald Notes Reported Left Before Walker Was Shot At", Dallas Morning News, December 31, 1963, sec. 1, p. 6.Summers 1998, pp. 163-164.
Before the Kennedy assassination, Dallas police had no suspects in the Walker shooting,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/hsca/report/pdf/HSCA_Report_1A_LHO.pdf |title=HSCA Final Report: I.

but Oswald's involvement was suspected within hours of his arrest following the assassination."Officials Recall Sniper Shooting at Walker Home", Dallas Morning News, November 23, 1963, sec. 1, p. 15. The Walker bullet was too damaged to run conclusive ballistics studies on it,"FBI Unable to Link Walker Slug, Rifle", Dallas Morning News, December 20, 1963, sec. 1, p. 7. but neutron activation analysis later showed that it was "extremely likely" that it was made by the same manufacturer and for the same rifle make as the two bullets which later struck Kennedy.[ref]United States House Select Committee on Assassinations,
Testimony of Dr. Vincent P. Guinn:
George de Mohrenschildt testified that he "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker."Testimony of George de Mohrenschildt, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 249. Regarding this, De Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne, recalled an incident that occurred the weekend following the Walker assassination attempt. The De Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife, Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" When asked about Oswald's reaction to this question, George de Mohrenschildt told the Warren Commission that Oswald "smiled at that."Testimony of George de Mohrenschildt, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, pp. 249-250. When George's wife, Jeanne was asked about Oswald's reaction, she said, "I didn't notice anything"; she continued, "we started laughing our heads off, big joke, big George's joke."Testimony of Jeanne de Mohrenschildt, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, pp. 314-317. Jeanne de Mohrenschildt testified that this was the last time she or her husband ever saw the Oswalds.Testimony of Jeanne de Mohrenschildt, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 314.Summers 1998, p. 172.

===New Orleans===

Oswald returned to New Orleans on April 24, 1963.The Warren Report, Chapter 7, p. 403, Lee Harvey Oswald – Background and Possible Motives; Personal Relations Marina's friend, Ruth Paine, drove her by car from Dallas to join Oswald in New Orleans the next month in May.The Warren Report, Chapter 6, p. 284, Investigation of Possible Conspiracy; Background of Lee Harvey Oswald On May 10, Oswald was hired by the Reily Coffee Company whose owner, William Reily, was a backer of the Crusade to Free Cuba Committee, an anti-Castro organization.Scott, Peter Dale. Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993), p. 95. ISBN 0-520-20519-7Summers 1998, pp. 220-221. Oswald worked as a machinery greaser at Reily, but he was fired in July "...because his work was not satisfactory and because he spent too much time loitering in Adrian Alba's garage next door, where he read rifle and hunting magazines."The Warren Report, Chapter 7, pp. 403–404, Lee Harvey Oswald – Background and Possible Motives; Personal RelationsSummers 1998, p. 219.
On May 26, Oswald wrote to the New York City headquarters of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, proposing to rent "a small office at my own expense for the purpose of forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans."Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 2, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 512. Three days later, the FPCC responded to Oswald's letter advising against opening a New Orleans office "at least not ..... at the very beginning."Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 3, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 515. In a follow-up letter, Oswald replied, "Against your advice, I have decided to take an office from the very beginning."Lee (Vincent T.), Exhibit No. 4, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 518.
As the sole member of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswald ordered the following items from a local printer: 500 application forms, 300 membership cards, and 1,000 leaflets with the heading, "Hands Off Cuba."FBI Report of Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities for Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New Orleans, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, pp. 770, 773. According to Lee Oswald's wife Marina, Lee told her to sign the name "A.J. Hidell" as chapter president on his membership card.Political Activities, Warren Commission Report, Chapter 7, p. 407.
On August 5 and 6, according to anti-Castro militant Carlos Bringuier, Oswald visited him at a store he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans delegate for the anti-Castro organization Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE). Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald's visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 10, pp. 34–37, Testimony of Carlos Bringuier. On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out pro-Castro leaflets. Bringuier confronted Oswald, claiming he was tipped off about Oswald's leafleting by a friend. A scuffle ensued and Oswald, Bringuier, and two of Bringuier's friends were arrested for disturbing the peace.Summers 1998, p. 211. Before leaving the police station, Oswald asked to speak with an FBI agent. Agent John Quigley arrived and spent over an hour talking to Oswald.Marrs, Jim. Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, (New York: Carroll & Graf, 1989), p. 146. ISBN 0-88184-648-1Summers 1998, pp. 217-218.
A week later, on August 16, Oswald again passed out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets with two hired helpers, this time in front of the International Trade Mart. The incident was filmed by WDSU, a local TV station.Summers 1998, pp. 211–212. The next day, Oswald was interviewed by WDSU radio commentator William Stuckey, who probed Oswald's background.Douglas, James. JFK and the Unspeakable, (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008), p. 65. ISBN 978-1-4391-9388-4[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy9k5C94ENw&feature=player_embedded |title=Lee Harvey Oswald interview with William K Stuckey part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011[/tpl] A few days later, Oswald accepted Stuckey's invitation to take part in a radio debate with Carlos Bringuier and Bringuier's associate Edward Scannell Butler, head of the right-wing Information Council of the Americas (INCA).Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 21, p. 633, Stuckey Exhibit 3, Literal transcript of an audio-tape recording of a debate among Lee Harvey Oswald, Carlos Bringuier, and Edward Butler on August 21, 1963, Radio station WDSU, New Orleans.Summers 1998, p. 212.
One of Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba leaflets had the address "544 Camp Street" hand-stamped on it, apparently by Oswald himself.544 Camp Street and Related Events, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 123. The address was in the "Newman Building" which, from October 1961 to February 1962, housed a militant anti-Castro group, the Cuban Revolutionary Council.544 Camp Street and Related Events, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, pp. 123–4.Marrs, Jim. Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, (New York: Carroll & Graf, 1989), p. 235. ISBN 0-88184-648-1Summers 1998, p. 222. Around the corner but located in the same building, with a different entrance, was the address 531 Lafayette Street—the address of "Guy Banister Associates", a private detective agency run by former FBI agent Guy Banister. Banister's office was involved in anti-Castro and private investigative activities in the New Orleans area (a CIA file indicated that in September 1960, the CIA had considered "using Guy Banister Associates for the collection of foreign intelligence, but ultimately decided against it").Marrs, Jim. Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy, (New York: Carroll & Graf, 1989), pp. 100, 236. ISBN 0-88184-648-1544 Camp Street and Related Events, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, pp. 126–7.Summers 1998, p. 230.
In the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) investigated the possible relationship of Oswald to Banister's office. While the committee was unable to interview Guy Banister (who died in 1964), the committee did interview his brother Ross Banister. Ross "told the committee that his brother had mentioned seeing Oswald hand out Fair Play for Cuba literature on one occasion. Ross theorized that Oswald had used the 544 Camp Street address on his literature to embarrass Guy."544 Camp Street and Related Events, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 13, p. 128.
Guy Banister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told author Anthony Summers that she saw Oswald at Banister's office, and that he filled out one of Banister's "agent" application forms. She said, "Oswald came back a number of times. He seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with the office."Summers 1998, p. 229. The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts' claims and said that "because of contradictions in Roberts' statements to the committee and lack of independent corroboration of many of her statements, the reliability of her statements could not be determined."544 Camp Street and Related Events, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 8, p. 129.
Oswald's 1963 New Orleans activities were later investigated by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, as part of his prosecution of Clay Shaw in 1967–1969. Garrison was particularly interested in an associate of Guy Banister—a man named David FerrieDavid Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 12, p. 110. and his possible connection to Oswald, which Ferrie himself denied.FBI Interview of David Ferrie, November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, p. 286. Ferrie died before Garrison could complete his investigation.David Ferrie, House Select Committee on Assassinations – Appendix to Hearings, vol. 10, 12, p. 105. Charged with conspiracy in the JFK assassination, Shaw was found not guilty.
The Warren Commission examined Oswald's involvement with a New Orleans Civil Air Patrol troop he briefly attended in 1955 with high school friend Edward Voebel. Several witnesses testified that David Ferrie was the Civil Air Patrol unit's commander during at least some of the time that Oswald attended C.A.P. meetings.FBI Interview of Edward Voebel, November 25, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 281–283.New Orleans Police Department Interview of Edward Voebel, November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 22, pp. 826-827, Commission Exhibit 1413Testimony of Edward Voebel, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 8, pp. 14-15.Oswald, David Ferrie and the Civil Air Patrol, House Select Committee on Assassinations, Volume 9, 4, pp. 110-115. However, the FBI interviewed Ferrie shortly after the assassination and concluded there was no relationship of significance in regards to Oswald.FBI Interview of David Ferrie, November 25, 1963 & November 27, 1963, Warren Commission Document 75, pp. 285–297, 199–200. A more extensive investigation was done by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, which interviewed several of Oswald's former fellow cadets and others, none of whom recalled Ferrie and Oswald interacting. These fellow cadets said that Oswald attended some 8 to 10 C.A.P. meetings over a two-month period. In 1993, the PBS television program Frontline obtained a photograph taken in 1955 showing Oswald and Ferrie at a C.A.P. cookout with other cadets.PBS Frontline "Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald", broadcast on PBS stations, November 1993 (various dates).Summers 1998, pp. 233-234.

===Mexico===

Marina's friend, Ruth Paine, transported Marina and her child by car from New Orleans to the Paine home in Irving, Texas, near Dallas, on September 23, 1963.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 7–9, Testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine Resumed. Oswald stayed in New Orleans at least two more days to collect a $33 unemployment check. It is uncertain when he left New Orleans; he is next known to have boarded a bus in Houston on September 26—bound for the Mexican border, rather than Dallas—and to have told other bus passengers that he planned to travel to Cuba via Mexico.Mexico City, Warren Commission Report, Appendix 8, p. 732.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, pp. 214–215, Affidavit of John Bryan McFarland and Meryl McFarland. He arrived in Mexico City on September 27, where he applied for a transit visa at the Cuban Embassy,Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 25, p. 418, CE 2564, Cuban visa application of Lee Harvey Oswald, September 27, 1963. claiming he wanted to visit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. The Cuban embassy officials insisted Oswald would need Soviet approval, but he was unable to get prompt co-operation from the Soviet embassy.
After five days of shuttling between consulates—that included a heated argument with an official at the Cuban consulate, impassioned pleas to KGB agents, and at least some CIA scrutiny(undated) Oswald's Foreign Activities (Coleman and Slawson to Rankin) (page 94) at The Assassination Archives and Research Center—Oswald was told by a Cuban consular officer that he was disinclined to approve the visa, saying "a person like Oswald in place of aiding the Cuban Revolution, was doing it harm."Warren Commission Report, p. 413 Later, on October 18, the Cuban embassy approved the visa, but by this time Oswald was back in the United States and had given up on his plans to visit Cuba and the Soviet Union. Still later, eleven days before the assassination of President Kennedy, Oswald wrote to the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., saying, "Had I been able to reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana, as planned, the embassy there would have had time to complete our business."Oswald: Myth, Mystery, and Meaning, FRONTLINE, November 20, 2003HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 8, p. 358, Letter from Lee Oswald to Embassy of the U.S.S.R., Washington, D.C., November 9, 1963. CIA Report on Oswald's Stay in Mexico, December 13, 1963. (page 19) at The Assassination Archives and Research Center.
While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had visited Mexico City and the Cuban and Soviet consulates, questions regarding whether someone posing as Oswald had appeared at the embassies were serious enough to be investigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Later, the Committee agreed with the Warren Commission that Oswald had visited Mexico City and concluded that "the majority of evidence tends to indicate" that Oswald in fact visited the consulates, but the Committee could not rule out the possibility that someone else had used his name in visiting the consulates.House Select Committee on Assassinations, 1996 Release: Oswald, the CIA, and Mexico City ("Lopez Report"), p. 121.

===Return to Dallas===

On October 2, 1963, Oswald left Mexico City by bus and arrived in Dallas the next day. Ruth Paine said that her neighbor told her, on October 14, that there was a job opening at the Texas School Book Depository, where her neighbor's brother, Wesley Frazier, worked. Mrs. Paine informed Oswald, who was interviewed at the Depository and was hired there on October 16 as a $1.25 an hour order filler.The Warren Report, Chapter 1, pp. 14–15, Summary and Conclusions Oswald's supervisor, Roy S. Truly (1907-1985), said that Oswald "did a good day's work" and was an above-average employee.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 216, Testimony of Roy Sansom Truly.Summers 1998), p. 282. During the week, Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming house (under the name "O.H. Lee"),[tpl]cite journal |last=Bagdikian |first=Ben H. |authorlink=Ben Bagdikian |editor1-first=Clay |editor1-last=Blair Jr. |editor1-link=Clay Blair |date=December 14, 1963 |title=The Assassin |journal=The Saturday Evening Post |issue=44 |page=26 |publisher=The Curtis Publishing Company |location=Philadelphia, PA. 19105[/tpl] but he spent his weekends with Marina at the Paine home in Irving. Oswald did not drive, but commuted to and from Dallas on Mondays and Fridays with his co-worker Wesley Frazier. On October 20, the Oswalds' second daughter, Audrey, was born.
FBI agents twice visited the Paine home in early November, when Oswald was not present, and spoke to Mrs. Paine.Warren Commission Report, p. 739. Oswald visited the Dallas FBI office about 2 to 3 weeks before the assassination, asking to see Special Agent James P. Hosty. When he was told that Hosty was unavailable, Oswald left a note that, according to the receptionist, read: "Let this be a warning. I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" signed "Lee Harvey Oswald." The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to "blow up the FBI" or merely "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, "If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.HSCA Final Assassinations Report, House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 195–196.Summers 1998, pp. 283-286.

==Kennedy and Tippit shootings==

In the days before Kennedy's arrival, several newspapers described the route of the presidential motorcade as passing the Book Depository.Dallas Morning News, November 19, 1963. Dallas Times Herald, November 19, 1963, p. A-13. On November 21 (a Thursday) Oswald asked Frazier for an unusual mid-week lift back to Irving, saying he had to pick up some curtain rods. The next morning (Friday) he returned to Dallas with Frazier; he left behind $170 and his wedding ring,Warren Commission Hearings, vol. I, p. 72–73, Testimony of Marina Oswald. but took with him a paper bag.

Oswald's co-worker, Charles Givens, testified to the Commission that he last saw Oswald on the 6th floor of the TSBD at approximately 11:55 a.m.—35 minutes before the assassination.Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of Charles Givens. The Commission report stated that Oswald was not seen again "until after the shooting."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wr/html/WCReport_0090b.htm |publisher=History Matters Archive|page=156|title=Warren Report |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 4, 2013[/tpl] However, in an FBI report taken the day after the assassination, Givens said that the encounter took place at 11:30 a.m. and that he later saw Oswald reading a newspaper in the first floor domino room at 11:50 a.m.FBI Interview of Charles Givens, November 23, 1963, Warren Commission Document 5, p. 329.Summers 1998), p. 58.

He said that during that time he did not see Oswald, or anyone else, on the sixth floor and felt he was the only one up there.Summers 1998, pp. 59-60. However, he also said that some boxes in the southeast corner may have prevented him from seeing deep into the "sniper's nest."Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 170, Testimony of Bonnie Ray Williams. Carolyn Arnold, the secretary to the Vice President of the TSBD, informed the FBI that as she left the building to watch the motorcade, she caught a glimpse of a man whom she believed was Oswald standing in the first floor hallway of the building just prior to the assassination.FBI Gemberling Report, November 30, 1963, Warren Commission Document 5, p. 41.In 1978, Arnold told author Anthony Summers that the FBI report misquoted her, and that she "clearly" saw Oswald sitting in the second floor lunchroom at 12:15 p.m or slightly after. However, no other depository employee reported seeing Oswald on the second floor between 12 noon and 12:30 pm  (e.g., Mrs. Pauline Sanders, who left the second floor lunchroom at "approximately 12:20 pm," did not see Oswald at all that day).
According to several government investigations, including the Warren Commission, as Kennedy's motorcade passed through Dallas's Dealey Plaza at about 12:30 p.m. on November 22, Oswald fired three rifle shots from the sixth-floor, southeast corner window of the Book Depository,The Shots from the Texas School Book Depository, Warren Commission Report, chapter 3, p. 117. killing the President and seriously wounding Texas Governor John Connally. One shot apparently missed the limousine entirely, another struck Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally, and another struck Kennedy in the head.Warren Report, chapter 1, p. 19. Bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from a small piece of curbstone that fragmented when struck by one of the bullets. Howard Brennan, a steamfitter who was sitting across the street from the Texas School Book Depository, notified police that as he watched the motorcade go by, he heard a shot come from above, and looked up to see a man with a rifle make another shot from a corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking out the window.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 143, Testimony of Howard Brennan.

According to the investigations, after the attack, Oswald hid and covered the rifle with boxes and descended using the rear stairwell. About ninety seconds after the shooting, in the second-floor lunchroom, Oswald encountered police officer Marrion Baker accompanied by Oswald's supervisor Roy Truly; Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 263, Testimony of Marrion L. Baker. Truly said that Oswald appeared "startled" when Baker aimed his gun at him.[tpl]cite web|title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, Chapter 4|page=152|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=February 4, 2013[/tpl]Summers 1998, p. 63. Mrs. Robert Reid—clerical supervisor at the Depository, returning to her office within two minutes of the assassination—said that she saw Oswald who "was very calm" on the second floor with a Coke in his hands.Summers 1998, p. 64. As they walked past each other, Mrs. Reid said to Oswald, "The President has been shot" to which he mumbled something in response, but Reid did not understand him.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 273–275, Testimony of Mrs. Robert A.

At about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a city bus but (probably due to heavy traffic) he requested a transfer from the bus driver and got off two blocks later.Bus transfer (.gif) at Kennedy Assassination Home Page Oswald took a taxicab to his rooming house, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, arriving at about 1:00 p.m. He entered through the front door and, according to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, immediately went to his room, "walking pretty fast".Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 6, pp. 438–439, Testimony of Earlene Roberts. Roberts said that Oswald left "a very few minutes" later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier. As Oswald left, Roberts looked out of the window of her house and last saw him standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus stop in front of her house.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, p. 439, Affidavit of Earlene Roberts.Summers 1998, p. 66. ISBN 1-56924-739-0
The Warren Commission concluded that at approximately 1:15 p.m., Dallas Patrolman J. D. Tippit drove up in his patrol car alongside Oswald—presumably because Oswald resembled the police broadcast description of the man seen by witness Howard Brennan firing shots at the presidential motorcade. Patrolman Tippet's encounter with Oswald occurred near the corner of East 10th Street and North Patton Avenue.Oswald was [tpl]convert|5|ft|9|in|m[/tpl] tall and weighed [tpl]convert|150|lb|kg[/tpl]. Warren Commission Hearings Vol. 26, p. 521.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 1, pg. 6. This location is about nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 km) southeast of Oswald's rooming house—a distance that the Warren Commission concluded "Oswald could have easily walked."The Warren Report, Appendix 12, p. 648, Oswald's Movements Between 12:33 and 1:15 PM Tippit pulled alongside Oswald and "apparently exchanged words with him through the right front or vent window."Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4, p. 165, The Assassin, The Killing of Patrolman J.D. Tippit. "Shortly after 1:15 p.m.",The first report of Tippit's shooting was transmitted over Police Channel 1 some time between 1:16 and 1:19 p.m., as indicated by verbal time stamps made periodically by the dispatcher. Specifically, the first report began 1 minute 41 seconds after the 1:16 time stamp. Before that, witness Domingo Benavides could be heard unsuccessfully trying to use Tippit's police radio microphone, beginning at 1:16. Dale K. Myers, With Malice: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Murder of Officer J.D. Tippit, 1998, p. 384. ISBN 0-9662709-7-5. Tippit exited his car and was immediately struck and killed by four shots.The third eyewitness was Jack Ray Tatum. Oswald–Tippit Associates, HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 12, p. 40–41.
Numerous witnesses heard the shots and saw Oswald flee the scene holding a revolver; nine positively identified him as the man who shot Tippit and fled.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: The Assassin, Description of Shooting.By the evening of November 22, five of them (Helen Markham, Barbara Jeanette Davis, Virginia Davis, Ted Callaway, Sam Guinyard) had identified Lee Harvey Oswald in police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth (William Scoggins) did so the next day. Three others (Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, Warren Reynolds) subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two witnesses (Domingo Benavides, William Arthur Smith) testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One witness (L.J. Lewis) felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive identification. Warren Commission Hearings, CE 1968, Location of Eyewitnesses to the Movements of Lee Harvey Oswald in the Vicinity of the Tippit Killing. Four cartridge cases found at the scene were identified by expert witnesses before the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee as having been fired from the revolver later found in Oswald's possession, to the exclusion of all other weapons. However, the bullets taken from Tippit's body could not be positively identified as having been fired from Oswald's revolver as the bullets were too extensively damaged to make conclusive assessments.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, pp. 466–473, Testimony of Cortlandt Cunningham.

===Capture===

Shoe store manager Johnny Brewer testified that he saw Oswald "ducking into" the entrance alcove of his store. Suspicious of this activity, Brewer watched Oswald continue up the street and slip into the nearby Texas Theatre without paying.Testimony of Johnny Calvin Brewer, 7 H 3–5. He alerted the theater's ticket clerk, who telephoned policeTestimony of Julia Postal, 7 H 11. at about 1:40 p.m.
As police arrived, the house lights were brought up and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near the rear of the theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that he was the first to reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to surrender saying, "Well, it is all over now." However, Officer McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed.Warren Commission Hearings, Testimony of M. N. McDonald.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv5vemBcjok. Brewer and McDonald testify on film to a reporter at the sites of the shoe store and inside the Texas Theater. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality."Oswald and Officer McDonald:The Arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald". Retrieved June 21, 2011.
At about 2 p.m., Oswald arrived at the Police Department building, where he was questioned by Detective Jim Leavelle about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it as that of the Book Depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination.Copy of an undated statement made by Richard M. Sims and E. L. Boyd concerning the events surrounding the assassination, 21 H 512–514.Testimony of J.W. Fritz, 4 H 206. Oswald was formally arraigned for the murder of Officer Tippit at 7:10 p.m., and by the end of the night (shortly after 1:30 a.m.) he had been arraigned for the murder of President Kennedy as well.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 5: Detention and Death of Oswald, Chronology. p. 198.Tippit murder affidavit: text, cover. Kennedy murder affidavit: text, cover.
Soon after his capture Oswald encountered reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, "I didn't shoot anybody" and, "They've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, "Did you kill the President?" and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." As he was led from the room the question was called out, "What did you do in Russia?" and, "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, "A policeman hit me."Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, Kantor Exhibit No. 3 – Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination.Lee Oswald claiming innocence (film), YouTube.com.Lee Oswald's Midnight Press Conference, YouTube.com.

==Police interrogation==

Oswald was interrogated several times during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He admitted that he went to his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a .38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 66. ISBN 1-56924-739-0 However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit; denied owning a rifle; said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes; denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get curtain rods for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch); and denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald also denied knowing an "A. J. Hidell". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, "Alek James Hidell" that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying "...you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do."Warren Commission Report, pp. 180–182.vol. XVII of the Warren report with facsimile of card (CE 795) with Commission notation: "A spurious Selective Service System notice of classification card in the name "Alek James Hidell." See for the card (illustrated at right)
The first interrogation of Oswald was conducted by FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz on Friday, November 22. Asked to account for himself at the time of the assassination, Oswald replied that he was eating his lunch in the first floor lounge (known as the "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he was encountered by Dallas motorcycle policeman (Marrion L. Baker).Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 4, Testimony of James P. Hosty, Jr., pp. 467–468Testimony of Capt. J.W.

Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two "Negro employees" walking by, one he recognized as "Junior" and a shorter man whose name he could not recall.[tpl]cite web|title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl] Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had "walked through" the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.[tpl]cite web|title=Warren Commission Hearings, Volume III|url=http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0105a.htm|publisher=History Matters Archive|accessdate=February 5, 2013[/tpl]Summers 1998, p. 59. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was at the time of the shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman (Marrion L. Baker).Testimony of Harry D. Holmes, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 7, pp. 297-302.
Oswald asked for legal representation several times while being interrogated, as well as in encounters with reporters. But when representatives of the Dallas Bar Association met with him in his cell on Saturday, he declined their services, saying he wanted to be represented by John Abt, chief counsel to the Communist Party USA, or by lawyers associated with the American Civil Liberties Union.Testimony of H. Louis Nichols, 7 H 328–329.Testimony of Harry D. Holmes, 7 H 299–300. Both Oswald and Ruth Paine tried to reach Abt by telephone several times Saturday and Sunday,Jesse E.

Oswald also declined his brother Robert's offer on Saturday to obtain a local attorney.Robert L. Oswald, Lee: A Portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald by His Brother, Coward–McCann, 1967, p. 145.
During an interrogation with Captain Fritz, when asked, "Are you a communist?", he replied, "No, I am not a communist. I am a Marxist."Bugliosi, Vincent (2008) Four Days in November: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy pp.416-7, quote: "No, I am not a Communist," Oswald says.

==Death==

On Sunday, November 24, Oswald was being led through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters toward an armored car that was to take him to the nearby county jail. At 11:21 a.m., Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby stepped from the crowd and shot Oswald in the chest, the bullet striking several organs, penetrating his stomach, and tearing his vena cava and aorta.The Nook: An Investigation of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Official Autopsy Report of Lee Harvey Oswald, November 24, 1963. Accessed 2013-01-09. Oswald was taken unconscious by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where doctors tried to save President Kennedy's life two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 p.m. Oswald's death was announced on a TV news broadcast by Dallas police chief Jesse Curry (1913-1980). An autopsy was performed by the Dallas County Medical Examiner at 2:45 p.m. the same day. The stated cause of death in the autopsy report was "hemorrhage secondary to gunshot wound of the chest."The Nook: An Investigation of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Official Autopsy Report of Lee Harvey Oswald, November 24, 1963. Accessed 2013-01-02.

The event was also captured in several well-known photographs.

===Ruby's motive===

Ruby later said he had been distraught over Kennedy's death and that his motive for killing Oswald was "...saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial."Testimony of Jack Ruby, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 5, pp. 198–200. Others have hypothesized that Ruby was part of a conspiracy. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel 
for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: "The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever."[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=0MeH1Z-Dd-QC&pg=PA71&dq=Goldfarb,+Ronald.+Perfect+Villains,+Imperfect+Heroes:+Robert+F.+Kennedy's+War+stalk#v=onepage&q=stalked&f=false |last=Goldfarb |first=Ronald |title=Perfect Villains, Imperfect Heroes: Robert F.

==Official investigations==

===Warren Commission===

The Warren Commission, created by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination, concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy (this view is known as the lone gunman theory). The Commission could not ascribe any one motive or group of motives to Oswald's actions:

The proceedings of the commission were closed, though not secret, and about 3% of its files have yet to be released to the public, which has continued to provoke speculation among researchers."Two misconceptions about the Warren Commission hearing need to be clarified...hearings were closed to the public unless the witness appearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. No witness except one...requested an open hearing...Second, although the hearings (except one) were conducted in private, they were not secret. In a secret hearing, the witness is instructed not to disclose his testimony to any third party, and the hearing testimony is not published for public consumption. The witnesses who appeared before the Commission were free to repeat what they said to anyone they pleased, and all of their testimony was subsequently published in the first fifteen volumes put out by the Warren Commission." (Bugliosi, p. 332)

===Ramsey Clark Panel===

In 1968, the Ramsey Clark Panel[tpl]explain[/tpl] examined various photographs, X-ray films, documents, and other evidence, concluding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone, and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its right side.1968 Panel Review of Photographs, X-Ray Films, Documents and Other Evidence Pertaining to the Fatal Wounding of President John E Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas (.txt) at Kennedy Assassination Home Page

===House Select Committee===

In 1979, after a review of the evidence and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy.Bugliosi, Reclaiming History, p.376 However, late in the Committee's proceedings a dictabelt recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired. After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a "high probability that two gunmen fired" at Kennedy and that Kennedy "was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy." Although the Committee was "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy," it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved.Findings of the Select Committee on Assassinations HSCA Final Report, pp. 3. Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.
The acoustical evidence has since been discredited.[tpl]cite book|author=Ballard C.

In a 2001 article in the journal Science & Justice, D.B. Thomas wrote that the NAS investigation was itself flawed. He concluded with a 96.3 percent certainty that there were at least two gunmen firing at President Kennedy and that at least one shot came from the grassy knoll.Donald B. Thomas, "Echo Correlation Analysis and the Acoustic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination Revisited", Science & Justice, vol. 41(1), 2001, pp. 21-32. Retrieved April 10, 2010. In 2005, Thomas' conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.Linsker R., Garwin R.L., Chernoff H., Horowitz P., Ramsey N.F., "Synchronization of the acoustic evidence in the assassination of President Kennedy". Science & Justice, vol. 45(4), 2005, pp. 207–226. In 2010, D.B. Thomas challenged in a book the 2005 Science & Justice article and restated his conclusion that there were at least two gunmen.[tpl]cite journal | title=Hear No Evil: Social Constructivism and the Forensic Evidence in the Kennedy Assassination | author= Donald Byron Thomas | ISBN=0980121396| year=2010[/tpl]

==Other investigations and dissenting theories==

Some critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories, such as that Oswald conspired with others, or was not involved at all and was framed.
In October 1981, with Marina's support, Oswald's grave was opened to test a theory propounded by writer Michael Eddowes: that during Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union he was replaced with a Soviet double; that it was this double, not Oswald, who killed Kennedy and who is buried in Oswald's grave; and that the exhumed remains would therefore not exhibit a surgical scar Oswald was known to carry. Dental records positively identified the exhumed corpse as Oswald's, and the scar was present.W. Tracy Parnell, The Exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswald. Contrary to reports, the skull of Oswald had been autopsied and this was also confirmed at the exhumation. W. Tracy Parnell, My Interview With Dr. Vincent J.M. Di Maio.

===Fictional trials===

Several films have fictionalized a trial of Oswald. The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1964); The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald (1977); and On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald (1986) have fictionalized a trial of Oswald. In 1988, a 21-hour unscripted mock trial was held on television, argued by lawyers before a  judge,Bugliosi, Reclaiming History with unscripted testimony from surviving witnesses to the events surrounding the assassination; the jury returned a verdict of guilty. In 1992 the American Bar Association conducted two mock Oswald trials. The first trial ended in a hung jury. In the second trial the jury acquitted Oswald.

==Backyard photos==

The "backyard photos", taken by Marina Oswald probably around March 31, 1963 using a camera belonging to Oswald, show Oswald holding two Marxist newspapers—The Militant and The Worker—and a rifle, and wearing a pistol in a holster.Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: The Assassin, Photograph of Oswald With Rifle Shown the pictures after his arrest, Oswald insisted they were forgeries,Warren Commission Report, Chapter 4: The Assassin, Denial of Rifle Ownership. but Marina testified in 1964 that she had taken the photographs at Oswald's request—Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 15, Testimony of Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. testimony she reaffirmed repeatedly over the decades.[ref]
These photos were labelled CE 133-A and CE 133-B. CE 133-A shows the rifle in Oswald's left hand and newspapers in front of his chest in the other, while the rifle is held with the right hand in CE 133-B. Oswald's mother testified that on the day after the assassination she and Marina destroyed another photograph with Oswald holding the rifle with both hands over his head, with "To my daughter June" written on it.Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 1, p. 146, Testimony of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald.
The HSCA obtained another first-generation print (from CE 133-A) on April 1, 1977, from the widow of George de Mohrenschildt. The words "Hunter of fascists—ha ha ha!" written in block Russian were on the back. Also in English were added in script: "To my friend George, Lee Oswald, 5/IV/63 5, 1963."HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, p. 151, Figure IV-21. Handwriting experts for the HSCA concluded the English inscription and signature were by Oswald. After two original photos, one negative and one first-generation copy had been found, the Senate Intelligence Committee located (in 1976) a third backyard photo (CE 133-C) showing Oswald with newspapers held away from his body in his right hand.
These photos, widely recognized as some of the most significant evidence against Oswald, have been subjected to rigorous analysis.HSCA Appendix to Hearings, vol. 6, "The Oswald Backyard Photographs".
