==Background==

In the early 1900s, Claude "Pop" Laval moved from his home state of Pennsylvania to the rural city of Fresno, California.  In pursuit of a career in photography, he invested in new equipment and began documenting various incidents with his camera.  His photography also encompassed a wide variety of nature scenes though.  In fact, much of his career was spent with the renowned photographer Ansel Adams, as they captured the essence of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Working with Adams taught him how to be meticulous in keeping ledgers and records of all of his photographs.  These ledgers have proven to be a source of great insight into the development of California's Central Valley.  Laval's photographs portray various aspects of life in the Central Valley, including but not limited to, agricultural practices, city-wide events, family gatherings, and even infrastructural change.  As his career progressed, he became a pioneer in movie cameras, which thrust him into a media career.  He worked with various news stations to broadcast events in the Central Valley to people throughout the world.  Today, his negatives are in the process of being digitized in order to preserve the rich and diverse history of the Central Valley.Pop Laval Foundation, http://www.poplavalfoundation.org/index.php?c=4, "About Us"
