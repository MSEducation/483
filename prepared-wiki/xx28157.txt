Cenovis is a product based on yeast extract similar to Marmite and Vegemite, rich in vitamin B1. In the form of a dark brown food paste, it is used to flavour soups, sausages and salads. The most popular way to consume Cenovis, however, is to spread it on a slice of buttered bread, as stated on the product's packaging.
Cenovis is popular in Switzerland, (particularly Romandy).  It was developed in Rheinfelden in 1931, on the initiative of a master brewer called Alex Villinger,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cenovis.ch/de/tradition/ |title=Cenovis: a tradition |publisher=Cenovis.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-02-27[/tpl] and was subsequently produced  by the company Cenovis SA.
In 1999, a trio of entrepreneurs from Geneva, Michel Yagchi, Didier Fischer and Frank Guemara purchased the brand and relaunched it applying modern marketing methods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.domainepublic.ch/files/articles/html/8897.shtml|title=Marques suisses, Cenovis: Le r√©seau de la tartine (Swiss brands: the network of spreads for your bread |publisher=Marco Danesi |year=2005 |accessdate=2005-12-23[/tpl]
On 29 February 2008, the three entrepreneurs transferred the brand, acquired in 1999, to the Gustav Gerig AG, an Aargau company, and the product thereby returned to its canton of origin.
The company presents the following story behind Cenovis:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cenovis.ch/en/tradition_en.html |title=Cenovis: a tradition |publisher=Cenovis.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
 
 "In 1931, a brewer recycled the yeast used for the fermentation of beer: vegetal substances very rich in vitamin B1. After several tests, the product was perfected and a group of Swiss brewers launched Cenovis; the product was an immediate success and the famous spread was so good that from 1955[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cenovis.ch/fr/tradition/ |title=Cenovis: a tradition |publisher=Cenovis.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-02-27[/tpl] it was included in the rations for Swiss soldiers... Healthy and strong soldiers!"
