Gallium minerals were not known before August 1875, when the element itself was discovered. It was one of the elements that the inventor of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev, had predicted to exist six years earlier. While examining the spectroscopic lines in zinc blende the French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found indications of a new element in the ore. In just three months he was able to produce a sample, which he purified by dissolving it in a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and sending an electric current through it. The next month he presented his findings to the French Academy of Sciences, naming the new element after the Greek name for Gaul, modern France.Emsley, pp. 158–159[tpl]Cite journal|title = The discovery of the  elements.

It can be argued that the last confirmed element in the boron group, ununtrium, was not really "discovered", but "created" or synthesized. The element's synthesis is credited jointly to the Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research team in Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, though it was the Dubna team who successfully conducted the experiment in August 2003. Element 113 (ununtrium) was discovered in the decay chain of element 115, or ununpentium, which produced a few precious atoms of ununtrium or "eka-thallium". The results were published in January of the following year. Since then around 13 atoms have been synthesized and various isotopes characterized.[tpl]cite journal|title=Experiments on the synthesis of element 115 in the reaction 243Am(48Ca,xn)291-x115| doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.69.021601|year=2004|journal=Physical Review C| volume=69| page=021601| last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu.

===Etymology===

The name "boron" comes from the Arabic word for the mineral borax,(بورق, boraq) which was known before boron was ever extracted. The "-on" suffix is thought to have been taken from "carbon"; so the name can regarded as a portmanteau of "borax" and "carbon".[tpl]Cite book|title=Word-Building Strategies in Modern English|last=Lavrova|first=Natalie|page=95|year=2010 |isbn=978-3-640-53719-8|location=Germany |publisher=GRIN Verlag |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Uy0uwU6n84wC&pg=PA95[/tpl] Aluminium was named by Humphry Davy in the early 1800s.

==Occurrence and abundance==

===Boron===

Boron, with its atomic number of 5, is a very light element. Almost never found free in nature, it is very low in abundance, composing only 0.001% (10 ppm)[tpl]cite book|title = Chemistry and chemical reactivity |author=Kotz, John C.; Treichel, Paul and Townsend, John Raymond|publisher = Thomson Books| year = 2009 |location = Belmont, Ca, USA|isbn = 0-495-38712-6|volume= 2 | page=979|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jcn6sgt7RpoC&pg=PA979[/tpl] of the Earth's crust. It is known to occur in over a hundred different minerals and ores, however: the main source is borax, but it is also found in colemanite, boracite, kernite, tusionite, berborite and fluoborite.Klein, Cornelis and Hurlbut, Cornelius Jr. (1985) Manual of Mineralogy, Wiley, 20th ed., pp. 343–347, ISBN 0-471-80580-7 Major world miners and extractors of boron include the United States, Turkey, Argentina, China, Bolivia and Peru. Turkey is by far the most prominent of these, accounting for around 70% of all boron extraction in the world. The United States is second, most of its yield coming from the state of California.[tpl]Cite journal|journal = Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review|volume = 9|issue = 1–4|year = 1992|pages = 245–254|doi = 10.1080/08827509208952709|title = Mining and Processing of Borates in Turkey|author = Zbayolu, G.; Poslu, K.[/tpl]

===Aluminium===

Aluminium, in contrast to boron, is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, and the third most abundant element. It composes about 8.2% (82,000 ppm) of the Earth, surpassed only by oxygen and silicon. It is like boron, however, in that it is uncommon in nature as a free element. This is due to aluminium’s tendency to attract oxygen atoms, forming several aluminium oxides. Aluminium is now known to occur in nearly as many minerals as boron, including garnets, turquoises and beryls, but the main source is the ore bauxite. The world's leading countries in the extraction of aluminium are Ghana, Surinam, Russia and Indonesia, followed by Australia, Guinea and Brazil.Emsley, pp. 22–26

===Gallium===

Gallium is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust and is not found in as many minerals as its lighter homologues. Its abundance on the Earth is a mere 0.0018% (18 ppm). Its production is very low compared to other elements, but has increased greatly over the years as extraction methods have improved. Gallium can be found as a trace in a variety of ores, including bauxite and sphalerite, and in such minerals as diaspore and germanite. Trace amounts have been found in coal as well.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Determination of gallium in coal and coal fly ash by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry using slurry sampling and nickel chemical modification|author = Shan Xiao-quan, Wang Wen and Wen Bei|journal = Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry|year = 1992|volume = 7|page = 761| doi = 10.1039/JA9920700761|issue = 5[/tpl]
The gallium content is greater in a few minerals, including gallite (CuGaS2), but these are too rare to be counted as major sources and make negligible contributions to the world's supply.

===Indium===

Indium is another rare element in the boron group. Even less abundant than gallium at only 0.000005% (0.05 ppm), it is the 61st most common element in the earth's crust. Very few indium-containing minerals are known, all of them scarce: an example is indite. Indium is found in several zinc ores, but only in minute quantities; likewise some copper and lead ores contain traces. As is the case for most other elements found in ores and minerals, the indium extraction process has become more efficient in recent years, ultimately leading to larger yields. Canada is the world's leader in indium reserves, but both the United States and China have comparable amounts.[tpl]cite book|title = Indium: geology, mineralogy, and economics |last = Schwarz-Schampera, M.

===Thallium===

Thallium is neither rare nor common in the Earth's crust, but falls somewhere in the middle. Its abundance is estimated to be 0.00006% (0.6 ppm). Thallium is the 56th most common element in the earth's crust, more abundant than indium by a sizeable amount. It is found on the ground in some rocks, in the soil and in clay. Many sulfide ores of iron, zinc and cobalt contain thallium. In minerals it is found in moderate quantities: some examples are crookesite (in which it was first discovered), lorandite, routhierite, bukovite, hutchinsonite and
sabatierite.
There are other minerals that contain small amounts of thallium, but they are very rare and do not serve as primary sources. Macedonia is a notable thallium extractor and producer.

===Ununtrium===

Ununtrium is an element that is never found in nature but has been created in a laboratory. It is therefore classified as a synthetic element with no stable isotopes.

==Applications==

With the exception of synthetic ununtrium, all the elements in the boron group have numerous uses and applications in the production and content of many items.
Boron has found many industrial applications in recent decades, and new ones are still being found. A common application is in fiberglass.[tpl]Cite book|title=Group 13 chemistry III: industrial applications |last=Roesky, Atwood |first=H.W, David A. |pages=3–10 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin, Germany |year=2003 |isbn=3-540-44105-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HLVrEzba4UUC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] There has been rapid expansion in the market for borosilicate glass; most notable among its special qualities is a much greater resistance to thermal expansion than regular glass. Another commercially expanding use of boron and its derivatives is in ceramics. Several boron compounds, especially the oxides, have unique and valuable properties that have led to their substitution for other materials that are less useful. Boron may be found in pots, vases, plates, and ceramic pan-handles for its insulating properties. The compound borax is used in bleaches, for both clothes and teeth. The hardness of boron and some of its compounds give it a wide array of additional uses. A small part (5%) of the boron produced finds use in agriculture.
Aluminium is a metal with numerous familiar uses in everyday life. It is most often encountered in construction materials, in electrical devices, especially as the conductor in cables, and in tools and vessels for cooking and preserving food. Aluminium's lack of reactivity with food products makes it particularly useful for canning. Its high affinity for oxygen makes it a powerful reducing agent. Finely powdered pure aluminium oxidizes rapidly in air, generating a huge amount of heat in the process (burning at about [tpl]j|5500 °F[/tpl] or [tpl]j|3037 °C[/tpl]), leading to applications in welding and elsewhere that a large amount of heat is needed. Aluminium is a component of alloys used for making lightweight bodies for aircraft. Cars also sometimes incorporate aluminium in their framework and body, and there are similar applications in military equipment. Less common uses include components of decorations and some guitars. The element is also sees use in a diverse range of electronics.[tpl]Cite book|title=the elements of economic geology |last=Gregory |first=J.W |page=152 |year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I6IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA152[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Uses Of Metals And Metallic Minerals|last=Chatterjee |first=K.K. |page=9|publisher=New Age International |year=2007|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JfIaFtRqt3cC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-81-224-2040-1[/tpl]
Gallium and its derivatives have only found applications in recent decades. Gallium arsenide has been used in semiconductors, in amplifiers, in solar cells (for example in satellites) and in tunnel diodes for FM transmitter circuits. Gallium alloys are used mostly for dental purposes. Gallium ammonium chloride is used for the leads in transistors.[tpl]Cite book|title=Metallurgy for the non-metallurgist |last=Chandler |first=Harry |page=59 |publisher=ASM International |year=1998 |isbn=0-87170-652-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=arupok8PTBEC&pg=PA59 [/tpl] A major application of gallium is in LED lighting. The pure element has been used as a dopant in semiconductors,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] and has additional uses in electronic devices with other elements. Gallium has the property of being able to 'wet' glass and porcelain, and thus can be used to make mirrors and other highly reflective objects. Gallium can be added to alloys of other metals to lower their melting points.
Indium's uses can be divided into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the production is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications.[tpl]Cite book|title=Minerals Yearbook: Metals And Minerals; 2005 |last= US Department of the Interior |pages=36–1 |publisher=US Government Printing Office | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4113-1980-6 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1jFYedAYAVAC&pg=SA36-PA1 [/tpl] Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.[tpl]cite book|title = Indium: geology, mineralogy, and economics |last = Schwarz-Schampera, M.

Thallium is used in its elemental form more often than the other boron-group elements. Uncompounded thallium is used in low-melting glasses, photoelectric cells, switches, mercury alloys for low-range glass thermometers, and thallium salts. It can be found in lamps and electronics, and is also used in myocardial imaging. The possibility of using thallium in semiconductors has been researched, and it is a known catalyst in organic synthesis. Thallium hydroxide (TlOH) is used mainly in the production of other thallium compounds. Thallium sulfate (Tl2SO4) is an outstanding vermin-killer, and it is a principal component in some rat and mouse poisons. However, the United States and some European countries have banned the substance because of its high toxicity to humans. In other countries, though, the market for the substance is growing. Tl2SO4 is also used in optical systems.[tpl]cite book|title =Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety |last = Mager |first = Jeanne |publisher = International Labor Organization Publications| year = 1998|location = Geneva, Switzerland | page= section 63.40 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nDhpLa1rl44C&pg=PT145|isbn =978-92-2-109816-4 [/tpl]

==Biological role==

None of the group-13 elements has a major biological role in complex animals, but some are at least associated with a living being. As in other groups, the lighter elements usually have more biological roles than the heavier. The heaviest ones are toxic, as are the other elements in the same periods. Boron is essential in most plants, whose cells use it  for such purposes as strengthening cell walls. It is found in humans, certainly as a trace element, but there is ongoing debate over its significance in human nutrition. Boron's chemistry does allow it to form complexes with such important molecules as carbohydrates, so it is plausible that it could be of greater use in the human body than previously thought. Boron has also been shown to be able to replace iron in some of its functions, particularly in the healing of wounds.[tpl]Cite book|title=The nutritional trace metals |last=Reilly |first=Conor |page=217 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing | year=2004 |isbn=1-4051-1040-6 |location=Ames, Iowa |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VEcFymWfnYUC&pg=PA217 [/tpl] Aluminium has no known biological role in plants or animals. Gallium is not essential for the human body, but its relation to iron(III) allows it to become bound to proteins that transport and store iron.[tpl]Cite book|title=Biological inorganic chemistry: an introduction |last=Crichton |first=Robert R. |page=9 | year=2008 |isbn=978-0-444-52740-0 |location=UK |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&pg=PA192[/tpl] Gallium can also stimulate metabolism. Indium and its heavier homologues have no biological role, although indium salts in small doses, like gallium, can stimulate metabolism.

==Toxicity==

All of the elements in the boron group can be toxic, given a high enough dose. Some of them are only toxic to plants, some only to animals, and some to both.
As an example of boron toxicity, it has been observed to harm barley in concentrations exceeding 20 mM.[tpl]cite book |title=Advances in plant and animal boron nutrition |last=Fangsen  |first=Xu |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |page=84 |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Al8-rzgMqWoC&pg=PA82|isbn=1-4020-5382-7[/tpl] The symptoms of boron toxicity are numerous in plants, complicating research: they include reduced cell division, decreased shoot and root growth, decreased production of leaf chlorophyll, inhibition of photosynthesis, lowering of stomata conductance, reduced proton extrusion from roots, and deposition of lignin and suborgin.[tpl]cite journal |title=Early effects of excess boron on photosynthesis and growth|year=1984 |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |pages=297–305|doi=10.1093/jxb/35.3.297 |last1=Lovatt |first1=Carol J. |last2=Bates |first2=Loretta M. |volume=35 |issue=3[/tpl]
Aluminium does not present a prominent toxicity hazard in small quantities, but very large doses are slightly toxic. Gallium is not considered toxic, although it may have some minor effects. Indium is not toxic and can be handled with nearly the same precautions as gallium, but some of its compounds are slightly to moderately toxic.
Thallium, unlike gallium and indium, is extremely toxic, and has caused many poisoning deaths. Its most noticeable effect, apparent even from tiny doses, is hair loss all over the body, but it causes a wide range of other symptoms, disrupting and eventually halting the functions of many organs. The nearly colorless, odorless and tasteless nature of thallium compounds has led to their use by murderers. The incidence of thallium poisoning, intentional and accidental, increased when thallium (with its similarly toxic compound, thallium sulfate) was introduced to control rats and other pests. The use of thallium pesticides has therefore been prohibited since 1975 in many countries, including the USA.
Ununtrium is a highly unstable element and decays by emitting alpha particles. Due to its strong radioactivity, it would definitely be extremely toxic, although significant quantities of ununtrium (larger than a few atoms) have not yet been assembled.[tpl]cite book |title=Clinical neurotoxicology: syndromes, substances, environments |last=Dobbs |first=Michael |year=2009 |publisher=Saunders |page=277 |location=Philadelphia |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pmcy24y2HyMC&pg=PA277|isbn=978-0-323-05260-3[/tpl]
