[[Sprung rhythm]]

CATEGORIES: Poetic rhythm, Sonnet studies, Victorian poetry

Sprung rhythm is a poetic rhythm designed to imitate the rhythm of natural speech. It is constructed from feet in which the first syllable is stressed and may be followed by a variable number of unstressed syllables."Sprung Rhythm in Hopkins", Britannica Online The British poet Gerard Manley Hopkins claimed to have discovered this previously unnamed poetic rhythm in the natural patterns of English in folk songs, spoken poetry, Shakespeare, Milton, et al. He used diacritical marks on syllables to indicate which should be drawn out (acute e.g. á ) and which uttered quickly (grave e.g. è ).
Some critics believe he merely coined a name for poems with mixed, irregular feet, like free verse. However, while sprung rhythm allows for an indeterminate number of syllables to a foot, Hopkins was very careful to keep the number of feet he had per line consistent across each individual work, a trait that free verse does not share. Sprung rhythm may be classed as a form of accentual verse, due to its being stress-timed, rather than syllable-timed,In the classic mode: the achievement of Robert Bridges, by Donald Elwin Stanford, 1978, pp. 81–92; see p. 81 for "Sprung rhythm … is a special kind of accentual verse" and while sprung rhythm did not become a popular literary form, Hopkins's advocacy did assist in a revival of accentual verse more generally."Accentual verse", Dana Gioia

 Pied Beauty
 
 Glory be to God for dappled things—
 For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;
 For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;
 Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;
 Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;
 And áll trades, their gear and tackle and trim.
 
 All things counter, original, spáre, strange;
 Whatever is fickle, frecklèd (who knows how?)
 With swíft, slów; sweet, sóur; adázzle, dím;
 He fathers-forth whose beauty is pást change:
 Práise hím.
 
 —Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889)
