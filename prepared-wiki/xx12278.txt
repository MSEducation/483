==Space weather==

Weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  Like all stars, the sun's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.  Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather.  Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the solar system as Saturn.Bill Christensen. Shock to the (Solar) System: Coronal Mass Ejection Tracked to Saturn. Retrieved on 28 June 2008.  The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces.  The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae,AlaskaReport. What Causes the Aurora Borealis?
