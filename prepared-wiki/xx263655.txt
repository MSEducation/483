There are also a number of teams in the Division one which in turn is divided in regions north, west, east, south A and south B.

==History==

The first league was created in 1987, and is called Division 1. This league had a variable number of teams distributed in some small regional leagues, followed by a national playoff. During the 2007â€“08 season, the best Division 1 teams qualified for the new league Riksserien which became the top tier league, while the Division 1 became the second level of the women's hockey in Sweden.
Riksserien is composed of eight teams. They face every opponent in four games, twice at home and twice away. The first two teams qualify for the semi-finals. The teams classified in third to sixth place have a playoff qualifying round which takes place in three matches. The semi-finals, the match for the third place and final depend on a simple match. The seventh and eighth teams face the top two from Division 1 to stay in Riksserien or to Division 1.
