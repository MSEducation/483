[[List of fictional heirs apparent who never acceded]]

CATEGORIES: Heirs apparent who never acceded, Fictional royalty, Lists of fictional characters by occupation

This is a list of fictional characters who were legally heirs apparent, but never acceded to the throne or title to which they were entitled. This may be because they died before inheriting it, the throne was abolished, a usurper took the inheritance, or they simply chose not assert their birthright. While claiming a birthright can be a powerful motif in literature, some stories instead draw upon the tragedy or frustration of not being able to claim a title to which a character seemed destined to succeed.
