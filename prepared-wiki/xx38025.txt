James Vernon Taylor (born March 12, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Taylor was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.Rock Hall of Fame - http://rockhall.com/inductees/james-taylor/
Taylor achieved his breakthrough in 1970 with the No. 3 single "Fire and Rain" and had his first No. 1 hit the following year with "You've Got a Friend", a recording of Carole King's classic song. His 1976 Greatest Hits album was certified Diamond and has sold 12 million US copies. Following his  1977 album, JT, he has retained a large audience over the decades. His commercial achievements declined slightly until a resurgence during the late 1990s and 2000s, when he recorded some of his best-selling and most-awarded work (including Hourglass, October Road and Covers).

==Biography==

===Early years===

James Taylor was born at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on March 12, 1948, where his father, Isaac M. Taylor, was a resident physician.Current Biography Yearbook 1972, p. 428.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 51.  His father was from a well-off family of Southerners of Scottish ancestry. His mother, the former Gertrude Woodard, studied singing with Marie Sundelius at the New England Conservatory of Music and was an aspiring opera singer before the couple's marriage in 1946.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 50–51.  James was the second of five children, the others being Alex (1947–1993), Kate (born 1949), Livingston (born 1950), and Hugh (born 1952).White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 51, 52, 59.
In 1951, when James was three, the family moved to what was then the countryside of Chapel Hill, North Carolina,Susan Broili. "Native son coming to Carolina for tribute - Chapel Hill naming Morgan Creek bridge after James Taylor on April 26", The Chapel Hill Herald (Chapel Hill, NC), March 27, 2003, page 1: "Even though Taylor was born in Boston on March 12, 1948, he moved to Chapel Hill when he was three and considers himself a North Carolinian." when Isaac took a job as Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 55, 57.  They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off of what is now Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated. James would later say, "Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, the seasons, the way things smelled down there, I feel as though my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people."White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 61.  James attended public primary school in Chapel Hill.  Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home, either on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica during 1955–1956.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 68–69.  Isaac Taylor later rose to become Dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971."Carolina on my mind: The James Taylor story", exhibit at the Chapel Hill Museum, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Information retrieved 2007-12-24. The family spent summers on Martha's Vineyard beginning in 1953.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 68.
Taylor first learned to play the cello as a child in North Carolina, and switched to the guitar in 1960.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 93, 98. His style on that instrument evolved from listening to hymns, carols, and Woody Guthrie, while his technique derived from his bass clef–oriented cello training and from experimenting on his sister Kate's keyboards: "My style was a finger-picking style that was meant to be like a piano, as if my thumb were my left hand, and my first, second, and third fingers were my right hand."White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 106–107.  He began attending Milton Academy, a prep boarding school in Massachusetts in Fall 1961; summering before then with his family on Martha's Vineyard, he met Danny Kortchmar, an aspiring teenage guitarist from Larchmont, New York.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 102, 103. The two began listening to and playing blues and folk music together, and Kortchmar quickly realized that Taylor's singing had a "natural sense of phrasing, every syllable beautifully in time. I knew James had that thing."White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 105. Taylor wrote his first song on guitar at age 14, and continued to learn the instrument effortlessly.  By the summer of 1963, he and Kortchmar were playing coffeehouses around the Vineyard, billed as "Jamie & Kootch".White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 111.
Taylor faltered during his junior year at Milton, not feeling at ease in the high-pressured college prep environment despite a good scholastic performance.  The Milton headmaster would later say, "James was more sensitive and less goal oriented than most students of his day."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878920,00.html | title=James Taylor: One Man's Family of Rock | magazine=Time | date=1971-03-01[/tpl]  He returned home to North Carolina to finish out the semester at Chapel Hill High School.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 111–112, 114.  There he joined a band his brother Alex had formed called The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs), playing electric guitar; in 1964 they cut a single in Raleigh that featured James's song "Cha Cha Blues" on the B-side.  Having lost touch with his former school friends in North Carolina, Taylor returned to Milton for his senior year.
There, Taylor started applying to colleges, but soon descended into depression; his grades collapsed, he slept twenty hours a day, and he felt part of a "life that I was unable to lead".  In late 1965 he committed himself to the renowned McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, where he was treated with Thorazine and where the organized days began to give him a sense of time and structure.  As the Vietnam War built up, Taylor received a psychological rejection from Selective Service System when he appeared before them with two white-suited McLean assistants and was uncommunicative.  Taylor earned a high school diploma in 1966 from the hospital's associated Arlington School.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 115.  He would later view his nine-month stay at McLean as "a lifesaver ... like a pardon or like a reprieve",[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.james-taylor.com/text/globe-1-2002.shtml | title = Shrink Wrapped Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll Were Regular Features of Life at McLean Psychiatric Hospital in Belmont | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | date = November 26, 2001 | last = Beam | first = Alex | work =The Boston Globe[/tpl] and both his brother Livingston and sister Kate would later be patients and students there as well.  As for his mental health struggles, Taylor would think of them as innate, and say: "It's an inseparable part of my personality that I have these feelings."[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30916F73B5F127A93C3AB1789D85F458785F9 | title=James Taylor, a New Troubadour | author=Braudy, Susan | magazine=The New York Times Magazine | date=February 21, 1971[/tpl]

===1966–1969: Early career===

Taylor checked himself out of McLean and, at Kortchmar's urging, moved to New York City to form a band.  They recruited Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band The King Bees, to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of noted academic Jerome Wiesner) to play bass, and—after Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him—called themselves The Flying Machine.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 116.  They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as "Knocking 'Round the Zoo", "Don't Talk Now", and "The Blues Is Just a Bad Dream".  In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, although he was plagued by self-doubt.  By summer 1966 they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village alongside acts such as The Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 117.
Taylor associated with a motley collection of people and began using heroin, to Kortchmar's dismay, and wrote the "Paint It, Black"–influenced "Rainy Day Man" to depict his drug experience.  In a hasty recording session in late 1966, the group cut a single, Taylor's "Brighten Your Night with My Day," backed with his "Night Owl".White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 118–119. Released on Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, it received some radio airplay in the Northeast, but charted to only No. 102 nationally.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p00456.htm | title=James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine - 1967 | author=Dexter, Kerry | publisher=Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-12-26[/tpl]  Other songs had been recorded during the same session, but Jubilee declined to go forward with an album.  After a series of poorly chosen appearances outside New York, culminating with a three-week stay at a failing nightspot in Freeport, Bahamas for which they were never paid, The Flying Machine broke up.  (A UK band with the same name emerged in 1969 with the hit song "Smile a Little Smile for Me".  The New York band's recordings were later released in 1971 as James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine.)
Taylor would later say of this New York period, "I learned a lot about music and too much about drugs."[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30611FB3A5D0C7B8CDDAD0894D9484D81 | title=Taylor: After the Turmoil and Wanderlust | author=Palmer, Robert | newspaper=The New York Times | date=1981-04-08[/tpl]  Indeed, his drug use had developed into full-blown heroin addiction during the final Flying Machine period: "I just fell into it, since it was as easy to get high in the Village as get a drink."  He hung out in Washington Square Park, playing guitar to ward off depression and then passing out, letting runaways and criminals stay at his apartment.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 120–123.  Finally out of money and abandoned by his manager, he made a desperate call one night to his father. Isaac Taylor flew to New York and staged a rescue, renting a car and driving all night back to North Carolina with James and his possessions.  Taylor spent six months getting treatment and making a tentative recovery; he also required a throat operation to fix vocal cords damaged from singing too harshly.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 126.
Taylor decided to try being a solo act and a change of scenery.  In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living variously in Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 127–129.  He recorded some demos in Soho and, capitalizing on Kortchmar's connection to The King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), took the demos to Peter Asher, who was A&R head for The Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 134–135.  Asher showed the demos to Paul McCartney, who later said, "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great ... and he came and played live, so it was just like, 'Wow, he's great.'"  Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple.  Living chaotically in various places with various women, Taylor wrote additional material, including "Carolina in My Mind", and rehearsed with a new backing band.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 136–137.  Taylor recorded what would become his first album from July to October 1968 at Trident Studios, at the same time The Beatles were recording The White Album.[tpl]cite book | last=Lewisohn | first=Mark | authorlink=Mark Lewisohn | title=The Beatles: Recording Sessions | publisher=Harmony Books | year=1988 | isbn=0-517-57066-1[/tpl] p. 146.  McCartney and an uncredited George Harrison guested on "Carolina in My Mind", whose lyric holy host of others standing around me referred to the Beatles, while the title phrase of Taylor's "Something in the Way She Moves" provided the lyrical starting point for Harrison's classic "Something".White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 137–140.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.beatles-discography.com/song-by-song/?s=something |title=Beatles songs - S |last=Cross |first=Craig |year=2004 |archiveurl=http://www.beatles-discography.com/song-by-song/?s=something |archivedate=2004-06-03 |accessdate=2004-06-03[/tpl]  McCartney and Asher brought in arranger Richard Hewson to add both orchestrations to several of the songs and unusual "link" passages  between them; these would receive a mixed reception at best.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jamestaylor/albums/album/113822/review/5945820/james_taylor | title=Album Reviews: James Taylor | author=Landau, Jon | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=1969-04-19[/tpl]
During the recording sessions, Taylor fell back into his drug habit, using heroin and methedrine.  He underwent physeptone treatment in a British program, returned to New York and was hospitalized there, and then finally committed himself to the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, which emphasized cultural and historical factors in trying to treat difficult psychiatric disorders.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 142–144.  Meanwhile, Apple released his debut album, James Taylor, in December 1968 in the UK and February 1969 in the U.S.  Critical reaction was generally good, including a positive Jon Landau review in Rolling Stone which said "this album is the coolest breath of fresh air I've inhaled in a good long while. It knocks me out".  The record's commercial potential suffered from Taylor's inability to promote it due to his hospitalization and it sold poorly; "Carolina in My Mind" was released as a single, but failed to chart in the UK and reached only No. 118 in the U.S.
Apple Corps itself had fallen into chaos, with anarchic business planning and freeloaders taking advantage of it in every direction.[tpl]cite book | last=Schaffner | first=Nicholas | authorlink=Nicholas Schaffner | title=The Beatles Forever | publisher=Cameron House | year=1977 | isbn=0-8117-0225-1[/tpl] p. 103.  In early 1969, to clean up the situation, three of the Beatles brought in Allen Klein, who began purging Apple personnel.Schaffner, Beatles Forever, p. 123.  Asher did not like Klein; he resigned of his own accord and offered to manage Taylor, to which Taylor agreed.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 146.  Klein wanted to hit Taylor with a $5-million lawsuit for leaving,Schaffner, Beatles Forever, p. 125. but McCartney (a Klein antagonist), and then the other Beatles, overruled him on the grounds that artists should not be holding each other to contracts.
In July 1969 Taylor headlined a six-night stand at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. On July 20 he performed at the Newport Folk Festival as the last act, and was cheered by thousands of fans who stayed in the rain to hear him.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/dt/james-taylor-fine-art-print/FFN690720-02-FP.html | title=James Taylor Fine Art Print | publisher=Wolfgang's Vault | accessdate=2008-12-26[/tpl]Current Biography Yearbook 1972, p. 429.  Shortly thereafter, he broke both hands and both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha's Vineyard and was forced to stop playing for several months.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 144–145, 147.  But while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969, signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.

===1970–1972: Fame and commercial success===

Once recovered, Taylor moved to California, keeping Asher as his manager and record producer. In December 1969, he held the recording sessions for his second album there. Entitled Sweet Baby James, and with the participation of Carole King, the album was released in February 1970 and was Taylor's critical and popular triumph, buoyed by the single "Fire and Rain", a song about Taylor's experience in psychiatric institutions and the suicide of his friend, Suzanne Schnerr.   Both the album and the single reached No. 3 in the Billboard charts, with Sweet Baby James selling more than 1½ million copies in its first year and eventually more than 3 million in the United States alone.  Sweet Baby James was received at its time as a folk-rock masterpiece, an album that effectively showcased Taylor's talents to the mainstream public, marked the direction he would take in following years, and made Taylor one of the main forces of the nascent movement. It earned several Grammy Award nominations including one for Album of the Year.  (It would be listed at No. 103 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, with "Fire and Rain" listed as No. 227 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time the year after.)
During the time Sweet Baby James was released, Taylor appeared with Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys in a Monte Hellman film, Two-Lane Blacktop. In October 1970, he performed with Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, and the Canadian band Chilliwack at a Vancouver benefit concert that funded Greenpeace's protests of 1971 nuclear weapons tests by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission at Amchitka, Alaska. (This performance would be released in 2009 on the album Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace.) In January 1971, sessions for Taylor's next album began.
His career success so far, and appeal to female fans of various ages, piqued tremendous interest in Taylor, prompting a March 1, 1971, Time magazine cover story.  It compared his strong-but-brooding persona to that of Wuthering Heights[tpl]'[/tpl]s Heathcliff and to The Sorrows of Young Werther, and said that, "Taylor's use of elemental imagery—darkness and sunlight, references to roads traveled and untraveled. to fears spoken and left unsaid—reaches a level both of intimacy and controlled emotion rarely achieved in purely pop music." Released in April, Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon also gained critical acclaim and contained Taylor's biggest hit single in the U.S., a version of the Carole King standard "You've Got a Friend" (featuring backing vocals by Joni Mitchell), which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late July. The follow-up single, "Long Ago and Far Away," also made the Top 40 and reached No. 4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The album itself reached No. 2 in the album charts, which would be Taylor's highest position ever on this list.  In early 1972, Taylor received his first Grammy Award, for (Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male) for "You've Got a Friend" (King also won Song of the Year for the same song in that ceremony).  The album went on to sell 2½ million copies in the United States alone.
November 1972 saw the release of Taylor's fourth album, One Man Dog. A concept album primarily recorded in his home recording studio, it featured cameos by Linda Ronstadt and consisted of eighteen short pieces of music put together. It was received with generally lukewarm reviews and, despite making the Top 10 of the Billboard Album Charts, overall sales were disappointing. The lead single "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight" peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100, and the follow-up, "One Man Parade", barely reached the Top 75. Almost simultaneously, Taylor married fellow singer-songwriter Carly Simon on November 3, in a small ceremony at her Murray Hill, Manhattan, apartment.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 208. A post-concert party following a Taylor performance at Radio City Music Hall turned into a large-scale wedding party, and the Simon-Taylor marriage would find much public attention over the following years.  They had two children, Sarah Maria "Sally" Taylor, born January 7, 1974, and Benjamin Simon "Ben" Taylor, born January 22, 1977.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 216, 243.

===1973–1976: Career ups and downs===

Taylor spent most of 1973 enjoying his new life as a married man, and he did not return to the recording studio until January 1974, when sessions for his fifth album began. Walking Man was released in June and featured appearances of Paul and Linda McCartney and guitarist David Spinozza. The album was a critical and commercial disaster, being his first album to miss the Top 5 since his contract with Warner. It received poor reviews and sold 300,000 copies in the United States. The title track was a disappointment, and failed to appear on the Top 100.
However, James Taylor's artistic fortunes spiked again in 1975 when the Gold album Gorilla reached No. 6 and provided one of his biggest hit singles, a cover version of Marvin Gaye's "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)", which featured wife Carly in backing vocals and reached No. 5 in America and No. 1 in Canada. On the Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, the track also reached the top, and the follow-up single, the feel-good "Mexico" also reached the Top 5 of that list. A critically well received album, Gorilla showcased Taylor's  electric, lighter side that was evident on Walking Man. However, it was arguably a more consistent and fresher-sounding Taylor, with classics such as "Mexico", "Wandering" and "Angry Blues". It also featured a song about his daughter Sally, "Sarah Maria".
Gorilla was followed in 1976 by In the Pocket, Taylor's last studio album to be released under Warner Bros. Records. The album found him with many colleagues and friends, including Art Garfunkel, David Crosby, Bonnie Raitt and Stevie Wonder (who co-wrote a song with Taylor and contributed a harmonica solo). A melodic album, it was highlighted with the single "Shower the People", an enduring classic that hit No. 1 Adult Contemporary and almost hit the Top 20 of the Pop Charts. But the album was not  well received, reaching No. 16 and being criticized, particularly by Rolling Stone. Nevertheless 1976 was a boom year in the recording business — the year of inception of the "Platinum" disc — and In The Pocket was certified Gold.
With the close of Taylor's contract with Warner, in November the label released Greatest Hits, the album that comprised most of his best work between 1970 and 1976. It became with time his best-selling album, ever. It was certified eleven times Platinum in the US, earning a Diamond certification by the RIAA and eventually selling close to twenty million copies worldwide.

===1977–1981: Move to Columbia and continued success===

In 1977 Taylor signed with Columbia Records. Between March and April, he quickly recorded his first album for the label. JT, released that June, gave Taylor his best reviews since Sweet Baby James, earning a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year in 1978. Rolling Stone was particularly favorable to the album – "JT is the least stiff and by far the most various album Taylor has done. That's not meant to criticize Taylor's earlier efforts .... But it's nice to hear him sounding so healthy."[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] JT reached 4 in the Billboard charts, selling more than 3 million copies in the United States alone.  The album's Triple Platinum status ties it with Sweet Baby James as Taylor's all-time biggest selling studio album. It was propelled by the successful cover of Jimmy Jones and Otis Blackwell's "Handy Man", which hit No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart and reached No. 4 on the Hot 100, earning Taylor another Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his cover version. The song also topped the Canadian charts. The success of the album propelled the release of two further singles—the up-tempo pop "Your Smiling Face" (an enduring live favorite) reached the American Top 20; however, "Honey Don't Leave L.A.", penned by Danny Kortchmar did not enjoy much success, only reaching number 61.
Back in the forefront of popular music, Taylor collaborated with Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in the recording of a cover of Sam Cooke's "Wonderful World", which reached the Top 20 in the U.S. and topped the AC charts in early 1978. After briefly working on Broadway, he took a one-year break, reappearing in the summer of 1979 with the cover-studded Platinum album Flag, featuring a Top 30 version of Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "Up on the Roof". (Two selections from Flag, "Millworker" and "Brother Trucker", were featured on the PBS production of the Broadway musical based on Studs Terkel's non-fiction book Working, and James himself appeared in that production as a trucker; he performed "Brother Trucker" in character.) Taylor also appeared on the No Nukes concert in Madison Square Garden, where he made a memorable live performance of "Mockingbird" with his wife Carly. The concert appeared on both the No Nukes album and film.
On December 7, 1980, Taylor had an encounter with Mark David Chapman, who would assassinate John Lennon just one day later. Taylor told the BBC in 2010 "The guy had sort of pinned me to the wall and was glistening with maniacal sweat and talking some freak speak about what he was going to do and his stuff with how John was interested, and he was going to get in touch with John Lennon. And it was surreal to actually have contact with the guy 24 hours before he shot John." The next night Taylor, who lived in the next building from Lennon, heard the assassination occur. Taylor commented "I heard him shot—five, just as quick as you could pull the trigger, about five explosions".Lennon's death: I was there BBC 7 December
In March 1981, James Taylor released the album Dad Loves His Work, whose themes concerned his relationship with his father, the course his ancestors had taken, and the effect he and Simon had had on each other.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 275–276. The album was another Platinum success, reaching No. 10 and providing Taylor's final real hit single in a duet with J. D. Souther, "Her Town Too", which reached No. 5 Adult Contemporary and No. 11 on the Hot 100 in Billboard.

===1981–1996: Troubled times and new beginnings===

Simon announced her separation from Taylor in September 1981 saying "Our needs are different; it seems impossible to stay together" and their divorce became final in 1983.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 279–280, 286.  Taylor was living on West End Avenue in Manhattan and on a methadone maintenance program.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 281–286.  Over the course of four months starting in September 1983, spurred on in part by the deaths of his friends John Belushi and Dennis Wilson and in part by the desire to be a better father to his children, he dropped methadone and finally kicked his habit for good.
Taylor had thoughts of retiring by the time he played the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/sting/3799 | title=Sting and James Taylor get Rock In Rio off to a gentle start | author=Rossi, Valeria Rossi and Vianna, Luciano | magazine=NME | date=2001-01-13 | accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl] He was encouraged by the nascent democracy in Brazil at the time, buoyed by the positive reception he got from the large crowd and other musicians, and musically energized by the sounds and nature of Brazilian music.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 287–288. "I had... sort of bottomed-out in a drug habit, my marriage with Carly had dissolved, and I had basically been depressed and lost for a while, " he recalled in 1995. "I sort of hit a low spot. I was asked to go down to Rio de Janeiro to play in this festival down there. We put the band together and went down and it was just an amazing response. I played to 300,000 people. They not only knew my music, they knew things about it and were interested in aspects of it that to that point had only interested me. To have that kind of validation right about then was really what I needed. It helped get me back on track." "James Taylor: At home on the road", by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, May 4, 1995. The song "Only a Dream in Rio" was written in tribute to that night, with lines like I was there that very day and my heart came back alive. The October 1985 album, That's Why I'm Here, from which that song came, started a series of studio recordings that, while spaced further apart than his previous records, showed a more consistent level of quality and fewer covers, most notably the Buddy Holly song "Everyday", released as a single reached No. 61.
On December 14, 1985, Taylor married actress Kathryn Walker at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 288. Taylor's next albums were partially successful – in 1988, he released Never Die Young, highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum New Moon Shine provided Taylor some popular songs with the melancholic "Copperline" and the upbeat "(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' About That", both hit singles in the AC radio. During the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer amphitheater circuit. His later concerts feature songs from throughout his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc Live album captures this, with a highlight being Arnold McCuller's descants in the codas of "Shower the People" and "I Will Follow". In 1995, Taylor performed the role of the Lord in Randy Newman's Faust.

===1997–present: Successful comeback===

After six years since his last studio album, Taylor released Hourglass, an introspective album that gave him the best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album had much of its focus on Taylor's troubled past and family. "Jump Up Behind Me" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 318.  "Enough To Be On Your Way" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 306. The themes were also inspired by Taylor and Walker's divorce, which took place in 1996.White, Long Ago and Far Away, p. 301. Rolling Stone found that "one of the themes of this record is disbelief", while Taylor told the magazine that it was "spirituals for agnostics"."In 'Up From Your Life,' you sing, "For an unbeliever like you/ There's not much they can do." In "Gaia," you call yourself a 'poor, wretched unbeliever.'" Interview, Rolling Stone, June 24, 1997. Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and Hourglass was a commercial success, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard 200 (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on "Little More Time With You". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998.
On February 18, 2001, at the Emmanuel Episcopal Church, Boston, Taylor wed for the third time, marrying Caroline ("Kim") Smedvig, the director of public relations and marketing for the Boston Symphony Orchestra.White, Long Ago and Far Away, pp. 310–311.  They had begun dating in 1995, when they met as he appeared with John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra.  Part of their relationship was worked into the album October Road, on the song "On the 4th of July".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/t/taylorjames-october.shtml | title=James Taylor: October Road | author=Glauber, Gary | publisher=PopMatters | date=2002-08-13 | accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl]  The couple reside in the town of Washington, Massachusetts,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.myspace.com/jamestaylormyspace | title=James Taylor | publisher=MySpace | accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl] with their twin boys, Rufus and Henry, born in April 2001.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,621850,00.html | title=James Taylor: Twins! | author=Silverman, Stephen M. | magazine=People | date= [/tpl]
Flanked by two greatest hit releases, Taylor's Platinum-certified October Road appeared in 2002 to a receptive audience. It featured a number of quiet instrumental accompaniments and passages. Overall, it found Taylor in a more peaceful frame of mind; rather than facing a crisis now, Taylor said in an interview that "I thought I'd passed the midpoint of my life when I was 17."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/08/13/2002-08-13_taylor_sto_happiness.html | title=Taylor's 'Road' to Happiness | author=David Hinckley | newspaper=New York Daily News | date=2002-08-13 | accessdate=2009-03-17[/tpl]  The album appeared in two versions, a single-disc version and a "limited edition" two-disc version which contained three extra songs including a duet with Mark Knopfler, "Sailing to Philadelphia", which also appeared on the title track of Knopfler's album by the same name. Also in 2002, Taylor teamed with bluegrass musician Alison Krauss in singing "The Boxer" at the Kennedy Center Honors Tribute to Paul Simon. They later recorded the Louvin Brothers duet, "How's the World Treating You?" In 2004, after he chose not to renew his record contract with Columbia/Sony, he released James Taylor: A Christmas Album with distribution through Hallmark Cards.
Always visibly active in environmental and liberal causes, in October 2004 Taylor joined the Vote for Change tour playing a series of concerts in American swing states. These concerts were organized by MoveOn.org with the  goal of mobilizing people to vote for John Kerry and against George W. Bush in that year's presidential campaign. Taylor's appearances were joint performances with the Dixie Chicks.
Taylor performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Game 2 of the World Series in Boston on October 24, 2004, and again on October 25, 2007 and "America" before the game on October 24, 2013. In December 2004, he appeared as himself in an episode of The West Wing entitled "A Change Is Gonna Come". He sang Sam Cooke's classic "A Change Is Gonna Come" at an event honoring an artist played by Taylor's wife Caroline. Later on, he appeared on CMT's Crossroads alongside the Dixie Chicks. In early 2006, MusiCares honored Taylor with performances of his songs by an array of notable musicians. Before a performance by the Dixie Chicks, lead singer Natalie Maines acknowledged that he had always been one of their musical heroes, and had for them lived up to their once-imagined reputation of him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKka3yYpBaE|title=Musicares Honoring James Taylor|last=Dixie Chicks|year=2006|work=Video of Stage Performance|publisher=Grammy Award Sponsored Musicares|accessdate=2008-12-31[/tpl] They performed his song, "Shower the People", with a surprise appearance by Arnold McCuller, who has sung backing vocals on Taylor's live tours and albums for many years.
In the fall of 2006, Taylor released a repackaged and slightly different version of his Hallmark Christmas album, now entitled James Taylor at Christmas, and distributed by Columbia/Sony. In 2006, Taylor performed Randy Newman's song "Our Town" for the Disney animated film Cars. The song was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for the Best Original Song. On January 1, 2007, Taylor headlined the inaugural concert at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, honoring newly sworn in Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer.
Taylor's next album, One Man Band was released on CD and DVD in November 2007  on Starbucks' Hear Music Label, where he joined with Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell.  The introspective album grew out of a three-year tour of the United States and Europe—featuring some of Taylor's most beloved songs and anecdotes about their creative origins—accompanied solely by the "one man band" of his longtime pianist/keyboardist, Larry Goldings. The digital discrete 5.1 surround sound mix of One Man Band won a TEC Award for best surround sound recording in 2008.Mix Foundation. 2008 TEC Awards Winners. Retrieved May 20, 2009.
On November 28–30, 2007, Taylor, accompanied by his original band and Carole King, headlined a series of six shows at The Troubadour. The appearances marked the 50th anniversary of the venue, where Taylor, King and many others, such as Tom Waits, Neil Diamond, and Elton John, began their music careers. Proceeds from the concert went to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council, MusiCares, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank, a member of America's Second Harvest—the Nation's Food Bank Network. Parts of the performance shown on CBS Sunday Morning in the December 23, 2007, broadcast showed Taylor alluding to his early drug problems by saying, "I played here a number of times in the 70s, allegedly". Taylor has used versions of this joke on other occasions, and it appears as part of his One Man Band DVD and tour performances.
In December 2007 James Taylor at Christmas was nominated for a Grammy Award.  In January 2008 Taylor recorded approximately 20 songs by others for a new album with a band including Luis Conte, Michael Landau, Lou Marini, Arnold McCuller, Jimmy Johnson, David Lasley, Walt Fowler, Andrea Zonn, Kate Markowitz, Steve Gadd and Larry Goldings. The resulting live-in-studio album, named Covers, was released in September 2008."James Taylor makes a new CD as an unsigned artist", Boston Herald, 2008.  This album forays into country and soul while being the latest proof that Taylor is a more versatile singer than his best known hits might suggest.  The Covers sessions stretched to include "Oh What a Beautiful Morning", from the musical Oklahoma—a song that his grandmother had caught him singing over and over at the top of his lungs when he was seven years old.Hiatt, Brian. "James Taylor's Country Soul" Rolling Stone. Iss. 1062. Meanwhile, in summer 2008, Taylor and this band toured 34 North American cities with a tour entitled James Taylor and His Band of Legends. An additional album, called Other Covers, came out in April 2009, containing songs that were recorded during the same sessions as the original Covers but had not been put out to the full public yet.James Taylor Newsletter March/April 2009
