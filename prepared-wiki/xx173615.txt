CATEGORIES: 2008 books, Travel books

The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World is the New York Times bestselling humorous travel memoir by longtime National Public Radio foreign correspondent Eric Weiner. In the book, Weiner travels to spots around the globe -- including Iceland, Bhutan, Moldova and Qatar -- to search out how different countries define and pursue happiness. Weiner is also the author of Man Seeks God: My Flirtations with the Divine.
According to Kirkus Reviews, the book is "Part travelogue, part personal-discovery memoir....reads like Paul Theroux channeling David Sedaris on a particularly good day."
