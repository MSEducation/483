The Kalleby Runestone is an enigmatic Iron Age runestone inscribed in Proto-Norse with the Elder Futhark:
This short text has been the subject of several interpretations where þrawijan, which means "yearning", is interpreted as either a name or an epithet. The words haitinaz was mean "was named", and so the text is open to various interpretations, such as:
The stone is [tpl]convert|2.1|m|ft[/tpl] tall and [tpl]convert|1.6|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and it was formerly part of a bridge.
