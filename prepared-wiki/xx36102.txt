Barry William Zito (born May 13, 1978) is an American professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball who is currently a free agent. He stands [tpl]convert|6|ft|2|in|m[/tpl] tall and weighs [tpl]convert|205|lb|kg[/tpl]. He previously played for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. He bats and throws left-handed. His pitching repertoire consists of a curveball (his strikeout pitch), a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a circle changeup, and a cutter-slider.
Zito was drafted three times during college and attended three colleges: UC Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Pierce College, and the University of Southern California. When he was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round in 1999, he chose to sign. A year later, he was in the major leagues, finishing fifth in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. He struggled to begin the 2001 season but improved greatly down the stretch, finishing the year 11–1 over his final two months.  He won 23 games (while only losing five) in 2002 and won the Cy Young Award. His record was only 14–12 in 2003, but he still made the All-Star team for the second year in a row. In 2004, he had his worst season at the time, going 11–11 with a career-high 4.48 earned run average. He became Oakland's Opening Day starter in 2005 and finished fifth in the AL with 171 strikeouts. In 2006, he made the All-Star team and posted a 15–1 record when receiving two or more runs of support.
Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the San Francisco Giants in December, 2006. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides comforts of home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.

==Early life==

Zito was born May 13, 1978, in Las Vegas, Nevada. His family moved to San Diego, California, to help him concentrate on his baseball career. His father even stopped working to coach him. He transferred from El Cajon's Grossmont High School to University of San Diego High School, a Roman Catholic school.[tpl]cite web |last=Jenkins |first=Chris |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/oct/23/belated-start-zito-world-series/ |title=A belated start for Zito in World Series |work=UT-San Diego |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2013[/tpl]
Zito then attended UC Santa Barbara where he earned Freshman All-America Honors with 125 strikeouts in 85⅓ innings. In his sophomore season, Zito transferred to Los Angeles Pierce College so that he could be eligible for the Major League Baseball draft. At Pierce, he posted a 2.62 earned run average (ERA), went 9–2 with 135 strikeouts in 103 innings, and was named to the all-state and all-conference teams.[tpl]cite web |last=Kowalick |first=Vince |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/19/sports/sp-30663 |title=At Pierce, Zito Has a View of Future |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 19, 1998 |accessdate=October 18, 2013[/tpl]
He then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), where he was a first-team All-America selected by USA Today Baseball Weekly, Collegiate Baseball, and Baseball America. With a 12–3 record, a 3.28 ERA, and 154 strikeouts in 113⅔ innings, Zito was named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year.

Zito was taken by the Seattle Mariners in the 59th round (1,586th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, and in the third round (83rd overall) by the Texas Rangers in 1998, but did not sign with either team.

=====2001=====

In 2001, Zito finished third in the American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts (205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage (.680).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/z/zitoba01.shtml |title=Barry Zito Statistics| work=Baseball-Reference| accessdate=October 1, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071005115928/http://www.baseball-reference.com/z/zitoba01.shtml| archivedate= October 5, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through the early part of the 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=2001 |title=Barry Zito 2001 Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 21, 2013[/tpl]

=====2002=====

In 2002, Zito became one of the best pitchers in baseball. On June 22, Zito won his 10th game of the season. It was the earliest that an A's pitcher had reached the 10-win mark since Bob Welch got there on June 15, 1990. Zito was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his career. On July 18, he went 7.1 innings while giving up no runs against the Angels. That win gave Zito a team-record 16th straight win at home. Zito again faced the Angels in his next start and produced similar results. He went 6.1 innings and gave up just one run. That win gave Zito the most wins by an AL pitcher (14). Zito would become the AL's first 15-game winner when he beat the Rangers. On August 23, Zito recorded his 18th win of the season, giving him one more than his previous career high of 17, in a game against the Detroit Tigers.
On August 28, Zito earned his 19th win of the season against the Kansas City Royals. However, he lost his bid for a perfect game in the sixth inning when Neifi Pérez singled with one out. Zito gave credit to Pérez. "I wasn't pitching to maintain a no-hitter or something," Zito said. "I left the ball up over the middle to Pérez, and he hit it up the middle. It was a good piece of hitting."[tpl]cite web |last=Eskew |first=Alan |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20020829&content_id=115429&vkey=news_oak&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Zito wins 19th, A's win 15th straight |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=August 29, 2002 |accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl]
On September 8, Zito became the first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins. "I'm not pitching for the Cy Young," Zito said. "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series."[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20020908&content_id=124473&vkey=news_oak&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Beating Twins for 20 special for Zito |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=September 8, 2002 |accessdate=October 24, 2013[/tpl] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, "It would go to that young man who pitched for the Oakland team. There are other deserving pitchers, but Zito has won 21 games and he competes well."[tpl]cite web |last=Street |first=Jim |url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20020914&content_id=128510&vkey=news_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea |title=Zito dazzles M's as hopes fade |work=Mariners.MLB.com |date=September 14, 2002 |accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl]
In his last start of the season, Zito went six innings and allowed just a run against the Texas Rangers. In his last 10 starts, Zito went 8–0, boosting his chances of winning the AL Cy Young Award. "Barry pitched another gem," said Oakland manager Art Howe. "He's certainly had a Cy Young-type season. He's just been steady all season long."[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20020929&content_id=141179&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Zito shines in regular-season finale |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=September 29, 2002 |accessdate=October 22, 2013[/tpl]
In Game 3 of the ALDS, Zito went six innings and gave up three earned runs against the Twins, earning the win. However, the Twins defeated the Athletics in five games, making the Athletics the first team to lose the deciding game of a series three years in a row.[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20021006&content_id=151467&vkey=ds2002news&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Again, A's fall short in ALDS |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=October 6, 2002 |accessdate=October 25, 2013[/tpl]
Zito would go on to win the AL Cy Young Award with a 23–5 record, narrowly defeating Pedro Martínez in the voting. He led the league with 23 wins, was second in winning percentage (.821), and third in both ERA (2.75) and strikeouts (182). Zito's 23 wins were the most by an AL left-hander since Frank Viola had 24 wins for Minnesota in 1988. Zito also allowed a .185 average to opposing hitters, the lowest in the AL. Martínez, who'd led the AL in ERA (2.26), strikeouts (239), and winning percentage (.833), became the first pitcher since the introduction of the award to lead his league in each of the three categories and not win the award.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/martipe02.shtml |title=Pedro Martinez Statistics| work=Baseball-Reference[/tpl] Zito became the first A's pitcher to win the Cy Young Award since Dennis Eckersley did it in 1992. Zito was also named AL TSN Pitcher of the Year.

=====2003=====

In 2003, Zito started off with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 straight games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, "I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he has that kind of command, you can see what happens."[tpl]cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=230418111 |title=A's return to winning ways at home |work=ESPN |date=April 18, 2003 |accessdate=October 24, 2013[/tpl] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny."[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-07-10/sports/0307100255_1_zito-devil-six-innings |title=Devil Rays Rout Zito |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=July 10, 2003 |accessdate=October 20, 2013[/tpl] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.
In 2003, Zito was seventh in the AL in ERA (3.30). He had a 14–12 record and 146 strikeouts over a career-high [tpl]frac|231|2|3[/tpl] innings pitched.
In Game 2 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, Zito went seven innings, striking out nine, walking two, allowing one earned run, and earning the win in Oakland's 5–1 triumph. In Game 5, Zito went six innings and allowed four earned runs, taking the loss as the Red Sox won the game and the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=0&post=1 |title=Barry Zito Postseason Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 26, 2013[/tpl]

Oakland manager Ken Macha would have let him throw a complete game, but Zito said, "I was worrying about being fresh for the next game.

In Game 1 of the ALDS, he allowed one run and four hits over eight innings, outdueling Johan Santana and earning the win in a 3–2 victory over the Twins and setting the stage for an Oakland sweep.[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061003&content_id=1696727&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Zito punches holes in Twins' lineup |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061006&content_id=1702380&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Chavez, Zito savor A's trip to ALCS |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=October 6, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2013[/tpl] Zito did not fare as well in Game 1 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Tigers, allowing five runs over [tpl]frac|3|2|3[/tpl] innings in a 5–1 defeat.[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061010&content_id=1707638&vkey=news_oak&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Zito hit hard as A's drop ALCS Game 1 |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=October 11, 2006 |accessdate=November 6, 2013[/tpl] The Tigers went on to sweep the Athletics in four games.[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061014&content_id=1712903&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=A's fight hard, but can't avoid sweep |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=October 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 6, 2013[/tpl]

====San Francisco Giants (2007 – 2013)====

=====2007=====

Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the San Francisco Giants worth $126 million, plus $18 million option for 2014 with a $7 million buyout. Zito's contract on December 29, 2006, became the highest for any pitcher in Major League history at the time.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2714583 |title=Zito passes physical, making $126 million deal official |accessdate=July 19, 2009|agency=Associated Press |date=December 30, 2006|publisher=ESPN.com[/tpl]
During spring training in 2007, he and Barry Bonds made shirts that read "Don't ask me, ask Barry" with an arrow pointing to the other Barry. By all accounts, Zito and Bonds got along well during their short time as teammates, and Zito made a point of saying he would stand by Bonds through onslaughts from the media.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2880193 |title=Let Barry be Barry| last=Zito| first=Barry| work=ESPN| date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=October 30, 2013[/tpl]
In his first start as a member of the Giants, Opening Day (April 3), Zito went five innings and allowed two earned runs against the San Diego Padres. He would take the loss. In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=2007 |title=Barry Zito 2007 Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 6, 2013[/tpl] Zito would earn his first win as a member of the Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. "I've been trying to have a good game," Zito said. "You can't try to do anything. You either do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I wasn't aggressive." Rockies manager Clint Hurdle gave Zito credit by saying,"We faced a tough pitcher. We are not playing the way that we believe we can play. We have to continue to believe what we believe in, but you can't let your confidence get swayed."[tpl]cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270416127 |title=Zito goes six solid innings as Giants rout Rockies |work=ESPN |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2013[/tpl]
On May 18, Zito made his return to Oakland as a Giant. He lasted only four innings as he gave up seven runs while walking seven, including two bases-loaded walks. The A's beat the Giants, 15–3.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070518&content_id=1972990&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Zito battered in return to Oakland| last=Haft| first=Chris| work=Giants.MLB.com| date=May 19, 2007|accessdate=November 6, 2013[/tpl] He faced his old team again on June 9, this time in San Francisco.

Zito made his first Major League relief appearance on August 5 against the Padres due to an early exit by starter Noah Lowry and an overworked bullpen. He pitched a scoreless seventh inning.[tpl]cite web| url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070805&content_id=2131647&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf | title=Lowry hurt, Zito has relief outing in loss| last=Haft| first=Chris| work=Giants.MLB.com| date=August 5, 2007| accessdate=September 4, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070818175846/http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070805&content_id=2131647&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf| archivedate= August 18, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He recorded his first career run batted in (RBI) two days later against the Nationals' Mike Bacsik, in the same game that Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th career home run.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070807&content_id=2135836&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Bonds' 756th comes in loss to Nats| last=Haft| first=Chris| work=Giants.MLB.com| date=August 8, 2007[/tpl]
After Zito's start on August 12, his ERA was 5.13. Over his final nine starts, he posted the fifth-best ERA in the NL, at 3.10. He also had a 3–2 record. He admitted that he had put pressure on himself to perform because of the large contract and was learning that he just needed to be himself. Zito also said that it had been difficult for him to adjust to a new league, team, and ballpark.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/03/SPN1RU5CK.DTL | title=By being himself, Zito is again Zito| last=Shea| first=John| work=San Francisco Chronicle| date=September 3, 2007| accessdate=September 3, 2007[/tpl] On the final day of the season, in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, Zito allowed two runs on five hits and had four strikeouts in an 11–2 win. For the first time in his career, Zito had a losing record, as he finished the season at 11–13. He failed to reach 200 innings ([tpl]frac|196|2|3[/tpl]) for the first time since 2000 and posted a career-high 4.53 ERA.

Zito began the 2008 season as the oldest starter and the veteran presence in the Giants' starting rotation.[tpl]cite web |last=Schulman |first=Henry |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/17/SP5SV38PG.DTL |title=Burden's on Giants' youthful starters |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] In April, Zito went 0–6 with a 7.53 ERA and 11 strikeouts.

On June 13, Zito became the first pitcher to record 10 losses in the Major Leagues following a 5–1 loss to Oakland. His 5.1 walks per nine innings pitched for the season, 51.5% first-pitch-strike percentage, and 14 sacrifice flies allowed, were all the worst in the majors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-standard-pitching.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball Standard Pitching |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-pitches-pitching.shtml |title=2008 Major League Baseball Pitching Pitches |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 12, 2013[/tpl] Beginning June 25, Zito saw some improvement, as he posted an 8–6 record for the rest of the season to go along with a 4.33 ERA. He finished the year 10–17 with a career-high 5.15 ERA and 120 strikeouts. His 17 losses led the National League and were the second-worst total in San Francisco history (Ray Sadecki lost 18 games in 1968).

=====2009=====

The 2009 season seemed to mark a rebound in Zito's pitching performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended the season with an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 had it not been for his first two starts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=2009 |title=Barry Zito 2009 Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2013[/tpl] Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound.[tpl]cite web |last=Shea |first=John |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Giants-get-win-Zito-does-not-3221499.php |title=Giants get win, Zito does not |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2013[/tpl] On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning.

=====2010=====

Zito started the 2010 season by pitching six shutout innings against the Houston Astros to earn a win; it was the first time he had won his season opening start since 2003. On April 24, Zito stifled the St. Louis Cardinals, throwing eight shutout innings with ten strikeouts for his third victory of the season, en route to starting the season 5–0 for the first time in his career. It was the best start by a Giants' pitcher since 2004, when Lowry started 6–0. On June 12, 2010, Zito earned his first win against his former team, the Athletics, which gave him victories against every MLB team.
Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After a strong start to the season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 with a 4.97 ERA the rest of the way.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=2010 |title=Barry Zito 2010 Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 14, 2013[/tpl] He finished the season 9–14 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. In fact, he was left completely off the Giants' 25-man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad.[tpl]cite web |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&content_id=15460598&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Guillen, Zito not on Giants' NLDS roster |work=Giants.MLB.com |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011[/tpl] Nevertheless, he won his first World Series ring as a member of the full roster.

Early in the 2011 season Zito experienced his first trip to the disabled list after an injury to his right foot during a fielding play.

=====2013=====

On April 5, 2013, during the Giants' home opener, Zito held the Cardinals scoreless over seven shutout innings, earning the 1–0 win.[tpl]cite web |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_04_05_slnmlb_sfnmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=sf |title=Zito leads Giants to home-opener victory |work=Giants.MLB.com |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl] He followed this performance with seven more shutout innings and some personal offensive contribution at the plate against the Rockies in a 10–0 win to complete a 3-game series sweep.[tpl]cite web |last=Kroner |first=Steve |url=http://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Giants-beat-Rockies-10-0-to-finish-sweep-4425072.php |title=Giants beat Rockies 10-0 to finish sweep |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl] It was the Giants' 16th straight victory in a row in games started by Zito (including the 2012 regular season and postseason), the longest such streak by a Giants pitcher since 1936 by Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Carl Hubbell. However, Zito struggled for the rest of the season, going 2–10 with a 6.24 ERA after April 21 and losing his rotation spot a couple times late in the year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=zitoba01&t=p&year=2013 |title=Barry Zito 2013 Pitching Gamelogs |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130905&content_id=59687350&notebook_id=59689492&vkey=notebook_sf&c_id=sf |title=Giants not planning to give Zito another start |work=Giants.MLB.com |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] On September 25, Bochy decided to give Zito one final start with the Giants as a tribute to his tenure with the team. Zito responded by allowing two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers.[tpl]cite web |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_09_25_lanmlb_sfnmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=sf |title=Zito's swan song ends with solid win over Dodgers |work=Giants.MLB.com |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl] However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6.[tpl]cite web |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article/sf/giants-barry-zito-earns-huge-ovation-in-final-appearance?ymd=20130929&content_id=62197090&vkey=news_sf |title=Zito earns huge ovation in final appearance |work=Giants.MLB.com |date=September 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl] He finished the 2013 season at 5-11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts.

==Pitching style==

Zito's fastball has hovered between 84 and 88 mph.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/preview07/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=2809709|title=Baseball's obsession with the fastball|last=Crasnick|first=Jerry| work=ESPN| date=March 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 27, 2013[/tpl] He augments it with a circle changeup and a curveball that he uses as a strikeout pitch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=944&position=P |title=Barry Zito |work=Fangraphs |accessdate=November 26, 2013[/tpl] His curveball was voted the best in the Major Leagues in a player poll conducted by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he had never seen anything like Zito's curveball, commenting: "It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you're not going to hit it."[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1113038/index.htm|work=CNN|title=Dangerous Curve|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=November 1, 2013[/tpl]
Since mid-2004, Zito has added a two-seam fastball and a cutter-slider hybrid to his arsenal. In the 2009 season, this cutter-slider became a prominent part of his repertoire, being used more frequently than his changeup. Zito's diminished velocity at the start of the 2007 season (his fastball velocity slowed to 83–85 mph) and loss of command were the key mechanical reasons for his struggles that year, as he more often got behind in the count and had to rely more on his fastball.[tpl]cite web |last=Jordan |first=Pat |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/sports/playmagazine/0914play-ZITO.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=The Mystery of Barry Zito  |work=New York Times |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=November 26, 2013[/tpl] During the 2009 season, Zito made changes to his delivery, lowering his arm slot from an over the top angle to a three quarters delivery. This change helped his fastball velocity go back up to the 86–89 mph range as well as sharpening the break of his curveball. However, in 2011, he was once again in the 84–87 mph range with his fastball. In 2012, Zito relied mostly on his two-seam fastball and cutter, and reduced his reliance on the four-seamer, which was the slowest four-seamer in MLB among starting pitchers that year, at 84.6 mph.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/pitchfx/leaderboards/index.php?hand=&reportType=pfx&prp=P&month=&year=2012&pitch=FA&ds=velo&lim=200|title=PitchFX Leaderboards|work=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=October 22, 2012[/tpl]
Addressing his finesse pitching style, Zito said, "My fastball is set up by my offspeed, that's no secret. So if I can command my fastball to both sides of the plate and throw most of my offspeed for strikes, I'll get them to miss the barrel. That's what I'm going for."[tpl]cite web|last=Castrovince |first=Anthony |url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121019&content_id=39935134&vkey=news_sf&c_id=sf |title=Zito exceeds expectations with sensational start |work=Cardinals.MLB.com |date=October 20, 2012 |accessdate=November 1, 2013[/tpl]

==Legacy==

From 2000 through 2004 with the Athletics, Zito, Hudson, and Mulder were known as the "Big Three."[tpl]cite web |last=Urban |first=Mychael |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20041222&content_id=925052&vkey=news_oak&fext=.jsp&c_id=oak |title=Mailbag: Life after Big Three |work=Athletics.MLB.com |date=December 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] Of the three, Zito had the highest single-season win total and was the only one to win the Cy Young Award.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/muldema01.shtml |title=Mark Mulder Statistics & History |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] Zito's .618 winning percentage is 10th all-time in Athletics history. His 6.896 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched ranks seventh, his 1,096 strikeouts rank eighth, and his 222 games started rank 10th. Zito also holds a couple more dubious positions on Oakland's list: his 148 home runs allowed rank fifth, and his 65 hit by pitches rank fourth (although he trails Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Rube Waddell in that category).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/leaders_pitch.shtml |title=Oakland Athletics Top 10 Pitching Leaders |work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] Zito's .821 winning percentage in 2002 is tied with Bender's in 1910 for 10th among Athletics' single-season totals. His 8.608 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched in 2001 rank seventh, and his 205 strikeouts in 2001 are tied for 10th (with Dave Stewart's 1987 total and Todd Stottlemyre's 1995 total).
Zito's regular season performance with the Giants was not as impressive; he went 63-80 with a 4.62 ERA. However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. Zito did not pitch in the playoffs that year, but he did pitch in the playoffs in 2012, outdueling Verlander in Game 1 of the World Series as the Giants won their second World Series in three years.

However, in August 2011, Zito became a Christian, saying he "committed to Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior." Zito explained that God got his attention through his being left off the 2010 Giants postseason roster and a car accident and freak foot injury in early 2011. He got a tattoo (his only one) of a golden calf on the inside of his right bicep as a reminder for him to "not worship false idols" and to remember that God comes first.
