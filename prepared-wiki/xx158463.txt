==History==

Plans for a park in Washington County began in the late 1990s.[tpl]cite news |last=Colby |first=Richard |title=Building excitement |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 23, 2005[/tpl] By 2001 a master plan had been completed and the acquisition of land for the park began.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/STEWART/stewart_more.shtml#project |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070905021842/http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/STEWART/stewart_more.shtml#map |archivedate=2007-09-05 |title=Stub Stewart State Park: Stewart timeline. |publisher=Oregon Parks and Recreation Department |accessdate=2011-07-01[/tpl] Construction began in 2003 when roads were installed to the park area from Highway 47. By 2005 construction of the facilities and campgrounds had begun on the $18 million facility. The park was scheduled to open for the Memorial Day weekend in May 2007, but the opening was delayed until July 8, 2007.[tpl]cite news |title=Make reservations at the newest state park |newspaper=The Hillsboro Argus |date=July 20, 2007[/tpl]
The working name for the park was Washington County State Park, but was later changed to Hare's Canyon State Park. In 2005, it was changed to the current name which honors the memory of Stub Stewart who had died in January of that year. He had served an extended time on the Oregon Parks and Recreation Commission, the co-owner of lumber company and a noted philanthropist.[tpl]cite news |last=Gorman |first=Kathleen |title=Park laying groundwork for outdoors enthusiasts |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=August 10, 2006[/tpl] The park opened mountain bike-only trails in June 2012, the first in the state.[tpl]cite news|last=Richard|first=Terry|title=Stub Stewart State Park opens mountain bike trails|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/north-of-26/index.ssf/2012/06/stub_stewart_state_park_opens.html|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 1, 2012[/tpl]
