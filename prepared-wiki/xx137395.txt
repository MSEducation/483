Kwame Ayew ([tpl]lang-ak|pronunciation:[/tpl] [tpl]IPAc-en|æ|'|j|juː[/tpl] [tpl]respell|a|YEW|'[/tpl]; born 28 December 1973) is a Ghanaian retired footballer who played as a striker. 
During nearly 20 years he played professionally in six countries, mainly in Portugal where he appeared for four teams in the 90s, amassing top division totals of 130 games and 50 goals over the course of six seasons.

==Club career==

Born in Tamale, Ayew started playing professionally in France at only 17, spending a couple of Ligue 1 seasons with FC Metz, then moved to Qatar with Al Ahli SC and played in another country in the following two years, Italy, appearing and scoring sparingly for U.S. Lecce (for instance, he netted four goals in 1993–94's Serie A as his club ranked last with only 28 goals, a competition-worst).
Ayew moved to Portugal in 1995, and would remain there in the following five years. He started with União de Leiria and Vitória de Setúbal, then impressed at Boavista F.C. also in the top division, scoring 15 times in 27 games in his second season to earn his side a best-ever (at the time) runner-up place, behind neighbours F.C. Porto.
After nearly 50 official goals for the Checquereds, Ayew moved to country giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Even though he was never an automatic first-choice at the club (having to battle for a starting berth with Alberto Acosta, Edmilson and Mbo Mpenza), he netted seven goals in 13 starts as the Lions ended a 18-year drought and conquered the national championship. 
In the following years Ayew would play in Turkey (two seasons) and China (five), rarely settling with a club. In January 2007 the 33-year-old returned to former side Setúbal, contributing solidly as the Sadinos avoided top flight relegation by one point; he retired from the game shortly after.

==International career==

Ayew was a member of the Ghana national football team that won the bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, scoring six goals in as many games.[tpl]FIFA player|93135[/tpl] In total, he won 25 senior caps.
