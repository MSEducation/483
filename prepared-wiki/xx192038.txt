Fort Leonard Wood is a United States Army installation located in the Missouri Ozarks. The main gate is located on the southern boundary of St. Robert. The post was created in December 1940 and named in honor of General Leonard Wood (former Chief of Staff) in January 1941. Originally intended to train infantry troops, in 1941 it became an engineer training post with the creation of the Engineer Replacement Training Center.http://www.wood.army.mil/wood_cms/manscen/505.shtml [tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] During World War II Italian and German POWs were interned at the fort.
In 1984, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process, most of the U.S. Army Engineer School's operations were consolidated at Fort Leonard Wood.  Before that, officer training was conducted at Fort Belvoir Virginia.
In 1999, again as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process, Fort McClellan, Alabama was closed, and the U.S. Army Chemical Corps and Military Police Corps schools were transferred to Fort Leonard Wood, which was concurrently redesignated the U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center.
In 2009, the U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center was redesignated the U.S. Army Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE); the "center of excellence" designation was placed on almost all U.S. Army training institutions.
The current commanding general is Major General Leslie C. Smith and the command sergeant major is Command Sergeant Major Terrence Murphy.

==History==

The installation has historically had a training role under TRADOC (Training and Doctrine Command) rather than a FORSCOM (Forces Command) role dating back to its origins in World War II as an engineer replacement training post.[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2011[/tpl] During the Gulf War, the 5th Engineer Battalion from the fort saw action in the Middle East.http://www.wood.army.mil/4MEB/history.htm [tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]
After the beginning of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 94th Engineer Battalion was restationed from Germany to Fort Leonard Wood, as were the 92nd Military Police Battalion, 193rd Brigade Support Battalion, and 94th Signal Company (part of the 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade). The 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade was activated at the fort on 2 October 2008.

==Initial Entry Training==

The Maneuver Support Center of Excellence offers Basic Combat Training (BCT) for most non-combat arms soldiers, and Advanced Individual Training (AIT) for MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) 88M (motor transport operator) and MOS 74D (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear specialists). It also provides non-combat engineer MOS training, OSUT (One-Station Unit Training) for combat engineers and bridging engineers (MOS 12B and 12C), and AIT and military police (31B & 31E). All training is gender integrated as in Fort Jackson, except for combat engineers (MOS 12B), which like all combat arms is closed to women.http://www.wood.army.mil/wood_cms/252.shtml [tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Transportation==

Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field serves the community with air service. Even though it is on Fort Leonard Wood, it is jointly run by the cities of Waynesville and St. Robert, and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service.
The major east-west route is 20px Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was 20px U.S. Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil's Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for U.S. Route 66 vary – at different places, it's called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and 20px Route 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.
Major north-south routes include:
Major attractions along U.S. Route 66 include the Old Stagecoach Stop in downtown Waynesville, which is now a museum but began as a tavern and boarding house and is the oldest standing structure in the county. It was used as a Civil War hospital for Union troops who were garrisoned above the city in Fort Wayne, which was demolished after the war. The Old Courthouse Museum in downtown Waynesville is near the Old Stagecoach Stop. Three bridges cross the Big Piney River at Devil's Elbow—the modern Interstate 44 bridge, the later U.S. Route 66 alignment on Highway Z that was made possible by the Hooker Cut through a steep hillside, and the original U.S. Route 66 alignment on Teardrop Road that includes a historic bridge that's in the process of renovation. The Elbow Inn is a biker bar that's a frequent stop on the original U.S. Route 66 alignment.
Fort Leonard Wood also has its own post utility railway connecting to the national railway system.  The rail system is operated by a contractor, Base Services, Inc., primarily carrying heavy equipment in support of the training center.  Consisting of 27 miles of track, 18 of which connect the post with BNSF Railway at Bundy Junction, its operations are conducted from Monday through Friday, 0800 to 1600.  The system uses two EMD GP10 locomotives numbered USA 4606 and USA 4607 and one GP40-2 numbered USA 4654.  Previous motive power consisted of USA 2002 and USA 2024, EMD SW8 locomotives built in 1951 that had been used by Army railway operating battalions in Korea during the war.  The post also had two GE 80-ton centercab locomotives for on-post switching.
Most of the main line between the post and Bundy Junction has a grade 1.5% grade, and in some places it reaches 3%.  The grade is so steep that only 20 cars can be pulled at a time up or down the mainline.  The line has four sidings used for storing rail cars.  At one time the line had centralized traffic control (CTC) signals, but today the signals and CTC equipment are long gone.
At one time, Fort Leonard Wood featured a busy rail operation. Not only did it receive vehicles and containers by rail, but also boxcars full of goods and equipment, coal for the base power plant, propane for various functions around post, and even diesel fuel for vehicles.
Today all that remains are half a dozen tracks with loading ramps on the ends, located in a warehouse area. In addition, there is a small staging yard next to the warehouses, an engine house and a small wye. The engine house was extended so that both locomotives can fit inside.

Fort Leonard Wood is in Pulaski County and a high percentage of military personnel live off post in surrounding communities, especially St. Robert and Waynesville but also the farther-out cities of Richland, Crocker, and Dixon, and the unincorporated communities of Laquey, Swedeborg and Devil's Elbow, all of which have a lower housing cost than nearer housing in St. Robert and Waynesville. Military personnel assigned to training areas on the south end of the post sometimes choose to live in the unincorporated areas of Big Piney and Palace in Pulaski County, or the northern Texas County communities of Plato and Roby.

==New Years Eve tornado==

On the morning hours of 31 December 2010, an EF3 tornado had touched down near the army base's training and cantonment area (east side of the base). It caused damage to many houses, government buildings, and even an old house built during the World War II era. The most  damage was in the North Piney Hills Housing Area. There were only minor injuries.http://www.fox2now.com/news/ktvi-ky3-fort-leonard-wood-hit-by-ef3-t-123110,0,5181957.story?track=rss [tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]
