===Early years===

Chizik began his coaching career at Seminole High School, serving as their defensive coordinator and inside linebacker coach from 1986 to 1988. He then became a graduate assistant at Clemson from 1988 to 1989, working with the outside linebackers.

His next assignment was at Stephen F. Austin State University, serving as their linebackers coach from 1992 to 1995. SFA advanced to the Division I-AA semifinals in 1995.

Chizik later employed a very similar scheme at Auburn, where he served again as the defensive coordinator and secondary coach from 2002–04. During this time, he had some of the greatest successes of his career to date. He coached in three bowl games, the 2003 Capital One Bowl, 2004 Music City Bowl, and 2005 Sugar Bowl.

===Iowa State===

In November 2006, Chizik was hired to replace outgoing coach Dan McCarney as head football coach of Iowa State.  McCarney resigned after going 4–8 in his final season, despite five bowl appearances during his tenure, the most of any Iowa State coach. Chizik's contract with ISU was a six-year deal worth a guaranteed $6.75 million.

===Auburn===

On December 13, 2008, Auburn University hired Chizik to succeed former head coach Tommy Tuberville, who resigned from the position after finishing 5–7 in the 2008 season.Dienhart, Tom (2008-12-13).

Chizik first retained James Willis to continue coaching linebackers.  However, less than one month later, Willis would leave Auburn to coach for the University of Alabama.  Ted Roof would eventually replace Willis and serve as Auburn's linebacker coach and defensive coordinator.  Roof had previously been the defensive coordinator at Minnesota before coming to Auburn. Chizik hired Gus Malzahn as his offensive coordinator.  Malzahn enjoyed the nation's top offense at Tulsa the previous two seasons. He subsequently hired Curtis Luper and Trooper Taylor, both of whom were coaching at Oklahoma State, to coach running backs and wide receivers. Chizik also brought Jay Boulware from his ISU staff to be the special teams coordinator and hired former Auburn player Tracy Rocker away from Arkansas to coach the defensive line. The final hire was UNC linebackers coach Tommy Thigpen as safeties coach.
Chizik's incentive-laden contract at Auburn was for five years with a salary of approximately $1.9 million per year, an $800,000 increase from his Iowa State contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jaygtate.blogspot.com/2009/09/we-have-contracts.html|title=We have contracts|last=Tate|first=Jay|publisher=The Hottest Auburn Blog on The Net|accessdate=2009-09-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/college-football/article/2009-09-08/auburn-coach-chizik-make-19m-plus-incentives|title=Auburn coach Chizik to make $1.9M, plus incentives|publisher=Sporting News|accessdate=2009-09-08[/tpl] Iowa State was paid $750,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/goldmine/2008/12/chiziks_auburn_deal_worth_abou.html|title=Chizik's Auburn deal worth about $2 million a year|last=Goldberg|first=Charles|publisher=Birmingham News|accessdate=2008-12-14[/tpl] by Chizik to be released from his contract which was paid by a loan from Auburn that is forgiven $150,000 for every year Chizik coaches, and will be paid off entirely if he reaches the end of the five-year deal.

In his first year, Chizik led the Tigers to the 2010 Outback Bowl, a fairly quick turnaround for a team that went 5-7 the year before.  The next year, he led the team to a 14-0 record and the BCS National Championship—the first undisputed national championship in school history.  With the loss of several players from that team who opted to go pro, Chizik's third team slipped to 8-5.  The 2012 season, however, was more than disappointing as the team finished 3-9 and was outscored 150-21 in its final three SEC games—including a 49-0 loss to Alabama in the Iron Bowl. Overall, Auburn went 33-19 during Chizik's tenure as head football coach.
Chizik was fired after four seasons and it cost Auburn $11.09 million. Chizik will get $7.5 million based on his December 1 contractual buyout amount and assistant coaches will get the remainder.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/index.ssf/2012/11/auburn_on_the_hook_for_1109_mi.html|title=Auburn on the hook for $11.09 million in buyouts for Gene Chizik, assistants|work=AL.com|date=2012-11-25|accessdate=2012-11-25[/tpl]
