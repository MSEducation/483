==Academics==

Vistas was created to provide resources for students who are at risk of not graduating, so they can work at an accelerated pace to complete high school.[ref]
</ref> Only students who have spent a semester in a regular high school program are eligible for enrollment.<ref name="prospectus">
</ref> Each student receives a wireless laptop; students may take on-line courses and/or complete a course in less time than at a traditional school. Faculty and students are screened to ensure a willingness to work as part of a team focused on the possibility of graduation for each student. Attaining the recommended high school diploma is the standard for all.<ref>[http://www.kleinisd.net/docs/kisd.heb.pdf "What Makes the KISD an Excellent District for Students and Staff?"], ''Klein ISD.net''</ref>  Students who are graduated receive a diploma from their zoned high schools.<ref name="brochure"/>

==High schools==

Under the program are four high schools: Klein High School, Klein Collins High School, Klein Forest High School and Klein Oak High School.
