[[1973 RAC Rally]]

The 1973 Daily Mirror RAC Rally was the 22nd running of the British rally, and the twelfth round of the inaugural World Rally Championship season.  Run in mid-November in the County of Yorkshire in England, the rally was run primarily on gravel, with some sections of tarmac as well.  The rally carried the name of its title sponsor, a popular British newspaper, The Daily Mirror.
In 1973, and for several years afterward, only manufacturers were given points for finishes in WRC events.  Britain was home terrain for the Fords and the RS1600 wrapped up all three podium spots.  While both Alpine Renault and Fiat finished in the points, neither had their points applied to championship standings.  This however didn't hurt either one's chances, as they still placed first and second respectively at the end of the season.
