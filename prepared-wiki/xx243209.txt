Waxiang ([tpl]zh|t=瓦鄉話|s=瓦乡话|p=wǎxiānghuà[/tpl]) is a divergent variety of Chinese, spoken in the northwestern part of Hunan province. Differences from Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang are both great, and syntactic reversal phenomena[tpl]clarify|date=August 2012[/tpl] are frequent. Waxiang Hua is used by Waxiang people, an unrecognized ethnic minority group in Hunan province, China.
It has been suggested that perhaps Waxianghua is a mixed language of Hunanese and Miao.

==Distribution==

Waxianghua is found in Luxi, Guzhang and Yongshun counties in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture,  Zhangjiajie prefecture-level city (in Dayong 大庸), and Chenxi, Xupu and Yuanling counties in Huaihua prefecture-level city. Neighboring languages include Southwestern Mandarin, Xiang Chinese, Tujia, Qo Xiong, and Hm Nai.
The word Wa 瓦 is only a phonetic transcription.
Wu & Shen (2010) report Waxianghua to be spoken in the following villages.
