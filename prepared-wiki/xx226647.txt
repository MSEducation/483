Hurricane Norman was the most recent tropical system to make landfall in California. The 14th named storm, 11th hurricane and 6th major hurricane of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season, Norman evolved from a tropical disturbance noted [tpl]convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of Acapulco on the afternoon of August 29. The system moved westward and developed into a tropical depression on August 30. Modest strengthening ensued, and the cyclone became a tropical storm that evening and a hurricane on the evening of August 31 as it turned to the west-northwest. Late on the night of September 1, Norman became a major hurricane with a 40-mile wide eye, and a nearby ship reported seas of [tpl]convert|41|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. The center grazed the northeast side of Socorro Island on the afternoon of September 2. Moving over cooler waters west of Baja California, the cyclone slowly weakened. By early on September 4, moisture from the hurricane spread north into California initiating rains in the Golden State. A developing trough to its west caused the initial influx of moisture and Norman's turn to the north as a weakening tropical storm. Eventually turning north-northeast towards southern California, the cyclone did eventually turn north-northeast towards southern California, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression as it passed the 30th parallel. Hurricane Norman made landfall in California on September 5, as a minimal tropical depression. The tropical cyclone became a remnant low shortly after California landfall, and the final advisory was issued at 00:00 GMT, on September 6. Over [tpl]convert|7.01|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain occurred in the Sierra Nevada range.[tpl]cite web|title=Hurricane Norman - August 30-September 6|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/norman1978.html|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] Rare snowfall was also reported.

nearby ship reported seas of 41 feet. The center grazed the northeast side of Socorro Island on the afternoon of the 2nd.
Moving over cooler waters west of Baja California, the cyclone slowly weakened.
By early on September 4 moisture from the hurricane spread north into California initiating rains in the Golden State.  A developing trough to its west caused the initial influx of moisture and Norman's turn to the north as a weakening tropical storm.

A flash flood watch was issued for the mountainous terrain and the desert region from Kern County to the California-Mexico border by the National Weather Service. 
Several inches of rain was produced, with over [tpl]convert|7.01|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] of rain occurred in the Sierra Nevada range at Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park. Rainfall was most intense on September 5 and September 6 with amounts exceeding [tpl]Convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in the mountains of southern California.[tpl]cite news|title=Hurricanes in the Western US|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/whhcalif.htm|author=Jack Williams|publisher=USA TODAY|accessdate=2011-12-02|date=May 17, 2005[/tpl] In addition, Norman produced waves up to [tpl]Convert|15|ft|in[/tpl] high.[tpl]cite news|title=Los Angeles Braced For Storm's Remnants|author=United Press International|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3oRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MI8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6191,4573272&dq=tropical+storm+california&hl=en|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|accessdate=2011-12-02|date=1978-09-05[/tpl] The extratropical remains of Hurricane Norman also moved into Nevada produced very significant amounts of rainfall in the extreme central to northern portion of the state.[tpl]cite news|title=Tropical Storm Weaker|author=Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HcNHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b4AMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1068,6352909&dq=tropical+storm+nevada&hl=en|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|accessdate=2013-06-02|date=1978-09-06[/tpl] Power lines were knocked down, and caused a brief power failure from Santa Barbara to San Diego, reported by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the Southern California Edison and the San Diego Gas and Electric. The high winds tossed about ships in local harbors and damaging agricultural crops in Southern California, such as raisin crops, and damage to raisins were extensive throughout Kern, Tulare, and Stanislaus Counties. The rainfall also damaged grapes and other varieties of grapes. Over 1,500 people had to be rescued due to high waves. A 25-foot, $15,000 cruiser was smashed and destroyed when a surf 150 foot from ashore came at Dana Point. Rare late summer snow was also reported in some areas of the Sierra (especially Mt. Whitney), and the blizzard killed at least four people, and at least seventeen others were missing. It dumped at least [tpl]convert|5|in|mm[/tpl] of snow to many hiking areas. The snow also produced surging tides at the Los Angeles Harbor, and swept a 10,000-ton tanker from its moorings.[tpl]cite news|title=Summer Snow Brings Death To Four Hikers|author=Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=reBGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bvgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1459,921856&dq=tropical+storm+california&hl=en|newspaper=The Day|date=1978-09-07|accessdate=2013-06-02[/tpl] Many search and rescue teams in Inyo County went on a search, and many hikers had to be rescued.
