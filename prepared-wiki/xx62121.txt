===Shutterbug===

"Shutterbug", a song from this album, was written by Louise Post. She was the lead singer for the song, with Nina Gordon performing backing vocals.
Post has said that the three parts of the song are like snapshots from different times in her life. The "she" featured in the song is PJ Harvey.
Veruca Salt performed "Shutterbug" on Saturday Night Live. Because Sting was hosting the show that evening, he performed one of his solo songs instead of Veruca Salt performing a second song.
