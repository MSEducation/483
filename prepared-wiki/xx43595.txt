The Mercury Phoenix Trust is a charity organisation that fights AIDS worldwide.
After the death of Freddie Mercury from AIDS-related causes in London in 1991, the remaining members of Queen and Jim Beach, their manager, organised The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, the proceeds of which were used to launch The Mercury Phoenix Trust. The organisation has been active ever since.
The current Trustees are: Brian May, Jim Beach, Mary Austin (Freddie Mercury's longtime love) and Roger Taylor.
