He was intended to be a companion for Prince Albert Kamehameha but the prince died in 1862.[tpl]cite journal |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |title= Reminiscences of the court of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma |author= Curtis Piʻehu ʻIaukea |id= [tpl]hdl|10524/961[/tpl] |year= 1930 |volume= |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages=17–27 [/tpl]
