Deepak Chopra ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|p|ɑː|k|_|ˈ|tʃ|oʊ|p|r|ə[/tpl]; born October 22, 1947) is an Indian-American author and alternative medicine/New Age guru. A licensed physician, he began a medical career in hospitals and universities in the Northeastern United States, becoming Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH). In 1985, Chopra met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who invited him to study Ayurveda. Chopra left his position at the NEMH and became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and was later named medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center. In 1996, Chopra and fellow physician-turned-alternative-medicine-advocate David Simon founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing, advertising it as having a "holistic view of life".
Chopra has enjoyed business success from the sale of a range of books, courses and alternative and complementary health products. He has written more than 50 books which have been translated into 35 languages. Chopra is a controversial figure. According to a 2008 article in Time magazine, he is "a magnet for criticism", primarily from those involved in science and medicine. Critics have taken issue with his "nonsensical" references to quantum theory, criticized his descriptions of AIDS and cancer, and said the claims he makes for ineffective alternative medicine may bring "false hope" to people who are sick.

==Early life==

Chopra was born in New Delhi, India. His father, Krishan Chopra, was a prominent Indian cardiologist and head of the department of medicine and cardiology at Mool Chand Khairati Ram Hospital, New Delhi, for over 25 years,[tpl]cite web|author=Krishan Chopra, M.D. |url=http://www.hayhouse.com/authorbio.php?id=137 |title=Krishan Chopra, M.D. bio at Hayhouse web site |publisher=Hayhouse.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] and a lieutenant in the British army. His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the British Army who looked to Ayurveda for treatment for a heart condition when the condition did not improve with Western medicine.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.streeteditors.com/2010/03/31/international-dreamer-deepak-chopra/ |title=international dreamer – deepak chopra |publisher=Streeteditors.com |date=March 31, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] His mother tongue is Punjabi.[tpl]cite book|last=Chopra|first=Deepak|title=Brotherhood: Dharma, Destiny, and the American Dream|year=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,|isbn=0544032101|page=161|coauthors=Sanjiv Chopra|quote=There are a lot of different languages spoken in India. Not just different dialects but different languages. Mine is Punjabi...[/tpl]
Chopra completed his primary education at St. Columba's School in New Delhi and graduated from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in 1968. He spent his first months as a doctor working in rural India.
Chopra's subsequent career falls into two parts. At first, Chopra adhered to mainstream medical practice; he then became an advocate of alternative medicine and a wealthy businessman[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]continuing the long tradition of entrepreneurialism in the American medical system.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1525/maq.2003.17.2.233|title=The Work of Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra—Two Holistic Health/New Age Gurus: A Critique of the Holistic Health/New Age Movements|year=2003|last1=Baer|first1=Hans A.|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=17|issue=2|pages=233–50|pmid=12846118[/tpl]

==East Coast years==

After immigrating to the US in 1970, Chopra undertook a clinical internship at Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey. He then did a residency at the Lahey Clinic and the University of Virginia Hospital. He later became Chief of Staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH) in Stoneham, Massachusetts, later known as Boston Regional Medical Center.
Chopra earned his license to practice medicine in the state of Massachusetts in 1973,[tpl]cite web|url=http://profiles.massmedboard.org/MA-Physician-Profile-View-Doctor.asp?ID=6568 |title=Massachusetts Board of Registration Physician Profile |publisher=Profiles.massmedboard.org |date=January 24, 1973|accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] becoming board-certified in internal medicine and specializing in endocrinology.
Visiting New Delhi in 1981, Chopra met the Ayurvedic doctor Brihaspati Dev Triguna, whose advice prompted Chopra to begin investigating Ayurvedic medicine.
In 1985, Chopra met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who instructed him to establish an Ayurvedic health center. Chopra left his position at the NEMH and became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, and was later named medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine.[tpl]cite web | first=Rosamund | last=Burton | title=Peace Seeker | url=http://www.novamagazine.com.au/article_archive/2006/06_04_Peace%20seeker.htm | publisher= Nova Magazine | accessdate = November 2013[/tpl] In 1989, the Maharishi awarded Chopra the title "Dhanvantari (Lord of Immortality), the keeper of perfect health for the world".[tpl]Cite book| publisher = Zondervan| isbn = 978-0-310-26999-1| last = O'Mathúna| first = Dónal| title = Alternative Medicine| date = 2007-01-01|page=96[/tpl]
By 1992, Chopra was serving on the National Institute of Health's ad hoc panel on alternative medicine. Chopra said one of the reasons for leaving mainstream medicine was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs, since in his view "80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit".

==West Coast years==

In 1993, Chopra moved to California and began working for Sharp HealthCare, heading their new Institute for Human Potential and Mind-Body Medicine. Chopra did not at first apply for a license to practice medicine in California, preferring to teach and write; in 2004 he was licensed in California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/WLLQRYNA$LCEV2.QueryView?P_LICENSE_NUMBER=51479&P_LTE_ID=789 |title=California Physician Profile |publisher=.dca.ca.gov |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]
Chopra left the Transcendental Meditation movement in January 1994. According to his own account, Chopra was accused by the Maharishi of attempting to compete with the Maharishi's position as guru.The Maharishi Years – The Untold Story: Recollections of a Former Disciple, 13 February 2008. According to Robert Todd Carroll, Chopra left the TM organization when it "became too stressful" and was a "hindrance to his success".[tpl]cite book|first=Robert Todd|last=Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&pg=PA48|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3|page=48[/tpl]

===Alternative medicine business===

In 1996 Sharp HealthCare changed ownership and broke off its relationship with Chopra. With neurologist David Simon, Chopra founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing at the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California. The new center promoted itself as having a "holistic view of life that sees human beings as networks of energy and information, integrating body, mind and spirit".
The publication of Chopra's Ageless Body, Timeless Mind: The Quantum Alternative to Growing Old (1993) gained him an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show and coverage in People magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/07/magazine/tm-29576/2|title=So Rich, So Restless|last=Perry|first=Tony|date=7 Seprember 1997|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Writing in 1997, Tony Perry of the Los Angeles Times puts the "explosion of interest" in Chopra down to his broad alignment with the desires of contemporary society.
In his 2013 book Do You Believe in Magic?, Paul Offit writes that Chopra's business grosses approximately $20 million annually, and is built on the sale of various alternative medicine products such as herbal supplements, massage oils, books, videos and courses. A year's worth of products for "anti-aging" can cost up to $10,000.
According to medical anthropologist Hans Baer, Chopra – as a wealthy individual – is an example of the American success story, but one who has failed to explore some of the potential benefits of a truly alternative, holistic approach to health. Instead he merely offers an alternative form of medical hegemony, focused on the individual – particularly well-off members of the upper and middle-classes; the "worried well".

===Education, charity and advisory roles===

Chopra established the Chopra Foundation in 2009 with a mission to advance the cause of mind/body spiritual healing, education, and research through fundraising for selected projects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://deepakchopra.com/chopra-foundation/about/ |title=Sages and Scientists Symposium |publisher=Deepakchopra.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] Chopra founded the American Association for Ayurvedic Medicine (AAAM) and Maharishi AyurVeda Products International, though he later distanced himself from these organizations.[tpl]cite book|first=J.

In 2005 Chopra was made a Senior Scientist at The Gallup Organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/corporate/19318/Gallup-Senior-Scientists.aspx |title=Gallup Senior Scientists |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] He currently serves as an Adjunct Professor of Executive Programs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/execed/programs/LEAD13/faculty.htm |title=The Soul of Leadership |publisher=Kellogg.northwestern.edu |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl]

In 2012, Chopra joined the board of advisors for tech startup State.com, creating a browsable network of structured opinions.

==Ideas and reception==

===Aging===

Chopra has advanced the notion that human aging can be retarded or reversed, saying that "contrary to our traditional notions of aging, we can learn to direct the way our bodies metabolize time",[tpl]citation |url=http://www.skepdic.com/chopra.html |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |first=Robert Todd |last=Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=Deepak Chopra |date=19 May 2013 |accessdate=April 2014[/tpl] and that "aging is simply learned behaviour".[tpl]cite news |title=Junk medicine; The triumph of mumbo jumbo |type=Book review |first=Mark |last=Henderson |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 2004 |page=4[/tpl] Actress Demi Moore has been reported as believing she might attain the age of 130 by following Chopra's teachings, and Chopra himself has said he expects "to live way beyond 100".[tpl]cite book|author=Francis Wheen|title=How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short History of Modern Delusions|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zFjebcPiBdwC&pg=PA46|date=6 July 2005|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-0-7867-2352-2|pages=46–[/tpl]
Conversely, Chopra also says that aging can be accelerated, for example by a person engaging in "cynical mistrust".[tpl]cite journal |journal=Forbes |title=Lord of immortality |type=Book review |year=1994 |last=Moukheiber |first=Zina |volume=153 |issue=8 |page=132[/tpl]
Robert Todd Carroll has characterized Chopra's promotion of lengthened life as a selling of "hope", but that it seems to be "a false hope based on an unscientific imagination seeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish".

===Alternative medicine===

Chopra has been described as "America's most prominent spokesman for Ayurveda". He mixes ideas associated with quantum mechanics with ayurvedic medicine in what he calls "quantum healing".
Chopra has described the AIDS virus as emitting "a sound that lures the DNA to its destruction". The condition can be treated, according to Chopra, with "Ayurveda's primordial sound". Taking issue with this view, medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that, "to put it mildly, Dr. Chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for AIDS that has no supporting empirical data".[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12964263|year=2003|last1=Schneiderman|first1=LJ|title=The (alternative) medicalization of life|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–7|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2003.tb00080.x[/tpl]
A 2008 article in Time magazine by Ptolemy Tompkins commented that for most of his career Chopra had been a "magnet for criticism": Tompkins wrote that the medical and scientific communities had voiced negative opinions of Chopra, which ranged from the "dismissive" to the "outright damning", particularly because Chopra's claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine could lure sick people away from effective treatments. Tompkins however considered Chopra a "beloved" individual whose basic messages centered on "love, health and happiness" had made him rich because of their popular appeal.

====Quantum healing====

Chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a person's health "imbalance" is corrected by quantum mechanical means. Chopra claimed that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. He has attempted to integrate Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics, in order to justify his teachings. According to Robert Carroll, he "charges $25,000 per lecture performance, where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism".
Chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state, corresponding to a jump to "a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer". Physics professor Robert L. Park has written that physicists "wince" at the "New Age quackery" in Chopra's cancer theories, and characterizes them as a cruel fiction, since adopting this view in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt, and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure.[tpl]cite book|editor1-first=Keith|editor1-last=Ashman|editor2-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Barringer|title=After the Science Wars: Science and the Study of Science|chapter=Chapter 9: Voodoo medicine in a scientific world|first=Robert L|last=Park|authorlink=Robert L. Park|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|year=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-97774-3|page=137[/tpl]
Chopra's claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a "systematic misinterpretation" of modern physics.[tpl]cite web|last=Cox |first=Brian |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/02/20/why-quantum-theory-is-so-misunderstood/ |title=Why Quantum Theory Is So Misunderstood - Speakeasy - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com|date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-12-15[/tpl] Chopra's connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid. The main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical, omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aske-skeptics.org.uk/magic_of_quantum_physics.html |title='Magic' of Quantum Physics |publisher=Aske-skeptics.org.uk |accessdate=2012-12-15[/tpl]

====Distance healing====

In 2001, ABC News aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer. In it Chopra said that "there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance". Chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room, whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between Chopra's periods of concentration and the subject's periods of relaxation. After the show, a poll of its viewers found that 90% of them believed in distance healing.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Skeptical Enquirer |first=Gary P |last=Posner |title=Hardly a Prayer on ABC's 20/20 Downtown |year=2001 |issue=November/December |url=http://www.gpposner.com/downtown.html[/tpl]
Christopher Wanjek has criticized the experiment, saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing, but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed. Wanjek characterized the broadcast as "an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news" which had "a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound".[tpl]cite book|first=Christopher |last=Wanjek |title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O |series=Wiley Bad Science Series |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oIJ5TKh7mPgC&pg=PA224|year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-46315-3 |pages=224- |authorlink=Christopher Wanjek[/tpl]

===Spirituality and religion===

Chopra acknowledges that his thought has been inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti and others.[tpl]cite book | title=Krishnamurti: 100 Years | last=Blau | first=Evelyne | page=233 | publisher=Stewart, Tabori, & Chang |date=May 1995 | isbn=978-1-55670-407-9 [/tpl]
In 2012, reviewing War of the Worldviews – a book co-authored by Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow – physics professor Mark Alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, "covering all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God". Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition, and says that "the counterpoint to Chopra's speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses," but rather Occam's razor.
In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the creation-evolution controversy and Intelligent design, which were criticized by science writer Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society.[tpl]cite news | last=Chopra | first=Deepak | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/intelligent-design-withou_b_6105.html | title=Intelligent Design Without the Bible | publisher=The Huffington Post | date=August 23, 2005|accessdate=November 30, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last= Shermer | first= Michael | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-shermer/skyhooks-and-cranes-deep_b_6179.html | title=Skyhooks and Cranes: Deepak Chopra, George W.

===Attack against skepticism===

Paul Kurtz has written that the popularity of Chopra's views is associated with increasing antiscientific attitudes in society, and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new, alternative, forms of validation for ideas. Kurtz argues that medical claims must always be submitted to open-minded but proper scrutiny, and that skepticism "has its work cut out for it".[tpl]cite book|author=Paul Kurtz|title=Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q34zdaoq0xIC&pg=PA110|year=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3411-7|page=110|authorlink=Paul Kurtz[/tpl]
In 2013 Chopra published an article on what he saw as "skepticism" at work in Wikipedia, arguing that a "stubborn band of militant skeptics" were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as Rupert Sheldrake. The result, Chopra argued, was that the encyclopedia's readers lost out through not being able to read of attempts to "expand science beyond its conventional boundaries". Biologist Jerry Coyne responded saying that it was instead Chopra himself who was losing out, as his views were being "exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding psychobabble".
More broadly, Chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole, writing in The Huffington Post that "No skeptic, to my knowledge, ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others".[tpl]cite web |work=The Huffington Post |first=Deepak |last=Chopra |title=The Perils Of Skepticism |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=April 2014 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-perils-of-skepticism_b_373788.html[/tpl] Astronomer Phil Plait said this statement trembled "on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie", listing Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Stephen Jay Gould, and Edward Jenner as some among "thousands of other scientists are skeptics" who he said were counterexamples to Chopra's statement.[tpl]cite web |title=Deepak Chopra: redefining 'wrong' |authorlink=Phil Plait |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/01/deepak-chopra-redefining-wrong/#.U05wM4XePN0 |journal=Discover |accessdate=April 2014[/tpl]

===Use of scientific terminology===

Reviewing Susan Jacoby's book, The Age of American Unreason, Wendy Kaminer sees Chopra's popular reception in America as being symptomatic of many Americans' historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) "to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science". Chopra's "nonsensical references to quantum physics" are placed in a lineage of American religious pseudoscience, extending back through Scientology to Christian Science. Physics professor Chad Orzel has written that "to a physicist, Chopra's babble about 'energy fields' and 'congealing quantum soup' presents as utter gibberish", but that Chopra's writing gifts enable him to construct a compelling narrative that non-scientists can find convincing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2013/10/11/malcolm-gladwell-is-deepak-chopra|title=Malcolm Gladwell Is Deepak Chopra|last=Orzel|first=Chad|date=11 October 2013|publisher=ScienceBlogs|accessdate=13 October 2013[/tpl]
Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement, decoherence and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.[tpl]cite journal| last=Stenger | first=Victor J|authorlink=Victor J. Stenger|title=Quantum Quackery | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/quantum_quackery | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | year=2007 | volume=27| issue=1|page=37-[/tpl] In 1998, Chopra was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics for "his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness".[tpl]cite web | title=Winners of the Ig Nobel Prize | url=http://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1998 | work=Improbable Research | accessdate=December 1, 2008[/tpl] When interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the Channel 4 (UK) documentary The Enemies of Reason, Chopra said that he used the term "quantum physics" as "a metaphor" and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics. In March 2010, Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer at Caltech on the question "Does God Have a Future?" Shermer and Harris criticized Chopra's use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/FaceOff/nightline-face-off-god-future/story?id=10170505 |title=Nightline Face-Off Does God Have a Future – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl]
Others have argued that Chopra's misuse of the word "quantum" has undermined the public's confidence in genuine science and has discouraged people from engaging with conventional medicine.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Brian Cox says that "for some scientists, the unfortunate distortion and misappropriation of scientific ideas that often accompanies their integration into popular culture is an unacceptable price to pay."

===Yoga===

In April 2010, Aseem Shukla criticized Chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have origins in Hinduism but is an older Indian spiritual tradition.[tpl]cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/dr_chopra_honor_thy_heritage.html |title=April 28, 2010 |publisher=Newsweek.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl] Chopra later said that yoga was rooted in "consciousness alone" expounded by Vedic rishis long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He accused Shukla of having a "fundamentalist agenda". Shukla responded by saying Chopra was an exponent of the art of "How to Deconstruct, Repackage and Sell Hindu Philosophy Without Calling it Hindu!", and he said Chopra's mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate.[tpl]cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/dr_chopra_honor_thy_heritage.html |title=Dr. Chopra: Honor thy heritage |publisher=Newsweek.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/hinduism_and_sanatana_dharma_one_and_the_same.html |title=On Faith Panelists Blog: Hinduism and Sanatana Dharma: One and the same – Aseem Shukla |publisher=Newsweek.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=July 9, 2010[/tpl]

==Legal actions==

In 1991 the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article on Ayurvedic medicine that Chopra had co-authored.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=1817464 |doi= 10.1001/jama.265.20.2633 |title=Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern insights into ancient medicine |year=1991 |last1=Sharma |first1=H.
