London overspill is the term given to the communities created - largely consisting of publicly provided housing (council houses and new towns) - as a result of the Government policy of moving residents out of Greater London, England into other towns around the South East, East Anglia and beyond.

==Policy development==

The policy was instigated in the 1930s but started in earnest after the Second World War, as a reaction to the housing shortages caused by enemy bombing and large amounts of substandard housing in the capital. This policy existed until the late 1970s reinforced by a widespread dislike of ribbon development. Started by the London County Council the task was completed by its successor, the Greater London Council. In the 1960s the Location of Offices Bureau dispersed office workers away from the capital. In 1960, the Greater London Plan proposed that over one million Londoners should be relocated from Inner London. The great majority of overspill families were relocated either to expanded towns or to new towns within south east England. As a short term expedient, viewed as regrettable,  to meet an urgent need, "quasi-satellites" were created around the edge of Greater London, or close by, at South Oxhey, Debden and Harold Hill.[ref]

==Consequences==

In some places, where the incomers did not easily blend in with the local residents,  the term London overspill scum could be, and was, used in a derogatory way. The situation of new overspill communities was portrayed in the 1960s soap opera, The Newcomers, partly filmed in Haverhill. The series showed problems of estrangement from a familiar environment and integration with an established community, through the experiences of one family. An additional issue was that the easy link to London, the train service, was withdrawn as part of the concurrent "Beeching Axe"; this added to the sense of isolation.
