CATEGORIES: Villages in Turkey

Hacı Osman köyü is a small village in Manyas district of Balıkesir Province, Turkey.
It had a population of 134, according to a 2000 census.
This village was a farming community, not unlike many others in the world. What distinguished Hacı Osman köyü from all the other farming villages in the world was the fact that, until 1992, it was one of the few villages where the inhabitants spoke the Ubykh language in their daily lives. The last speaker of Ubykh, Tevfik Esenç, was born, and died, in this village.
Other villages where Ubykh was spoken included Kırkpınar and Hacı Yakup.
