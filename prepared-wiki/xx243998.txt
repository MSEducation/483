Worcester Lunch Car Company was a manufacturer of diners based in Worcester, Massachusetts from 1906 to 1957. 

==History==

Philip H. Duprey founded the company in 1906 as the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company. It was named for Worcester, Massachusetts, where the company was based. The company produced over 600 diners between 1906 and 1957, when manufacturing ceased. All of Worcester Lunch Car's assets were auctioned in 1961.
