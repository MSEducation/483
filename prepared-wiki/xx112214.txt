The west Clackamas High School campus lies on [tpl]convert|42|acre[/tpl] with a small wetland nearby. The building itself has [tpl]convert|265355|sqft|m2[/tpl] of floor space and is much larger than the older school. It has four classroom hallways on two floors, a commons area, an arts wing, and an athletic wing,  centered on an administrative ring in the middle of the school.
The classroom hallways are on the north end of the school with 100 and 200 halls on the east side, and 300 and 400 halls on the west. The commons area is on the north side of the administrative offices, at the entrance to 100 and 200 halls, and is primarily used for dining and some multi-purpose use. The arts wing of the school is  centered on the schools' auditorium and contains rooms for art classes, choir classes, and band classes, as well as a wood shop, a stage shop, and changing and makeup rooms. The athletic wing contains a large gym, a smaller upper gym, locker rooms, a wrestling room, and a weight training room. The administrative ring, located in the center of the school, contains the main office, the bookkeeper's office, the attendance office, the student management office, the schools' career and vocation center, the athletic office, and the counseling office, all  centered on a small courtyard.
This building has served as a model for other high schools and has been designated a green building. Clackamas High School was built in 2002 to a design by Portland's Boora Architects and was the first high school in the country to be certified LEED Silver.DJC.COM: ‘I wish I could go to a school just like this’, provided by Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce NewspaperThe Oregonian: Oregon schools: It's not easy, or cheap, being green "The district already has an officially certified school. In 2002, North Clackamas High School was the first high school in the nation to achieve a LEED silver certification, according to the U.S. Green Building Council." Clackamas High is also one of the first "solar schools" in Oregon with the installation of 2 kW solar panels on the roof in 2003.

The east campus, formerly Sunrise Middle School, is arranged around one straight main hallway connecting two twin classroom halls on one end with two gyms, a dance studio, and miscellaneous classrooms on the other. The interior was redecorated to feel more like Clackamas High School for the 2010–2011 school year.
