[[Major League Baseball Triple Crown]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball pitching, Baseball terminology, Batting (baseball), Major League Baseball trophies and awards

In Major League Baseball, a player earns the Triple Crown when he leads a league in three specific statistical categories. When used without a modifier, the Triple Crown generally refers to a batter who leads either the National or American leagues in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) over a full regular season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/miguel-cabrera-has-shot-at-triple-crown-060210|title=Cabrera has a legit shot at triple crown|last=Morosi|first=Jon Paul|date=June 4, 2010|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  The Triple Crown epitomizes three separate attributes of a good hitter: hitting for average, hitting for power, and producing runs.  It has been accomplished 17 times, with Miguel Cabrera being the most recent to accomplish the feat in 2012, the first since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967. 
The pitching Triple Crown is accomplished by a pitcher who leads the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2007/jul/09/cheers_jeers_as_major_league_season_hits_midway_/|title=Cheers and jeers as Major League season hits midway point|last=Connolly|first=Dan|date=July 9, 2007|work=The Post and Courier|location=Charleston, South Carolina|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  The pitching Triple Crown has been accomplished 38 times, including 8 since 1997. 
Generally, the Triple Crown refers to leading a specific league such as the National League (NL) or the American League (AL) in these categories.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lockwood|first=Wayne|date=December 1997|title=A Batter's Top Challenge: Winning the Triple Crown|journal=Baseball Digest|publisher=Lakeside|volume=56|issue=12|pages=60–63|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6S4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=triple+crown+baseball#v=onepage&q=triple%20crown%20baseball&f=false[/tpl] However, if a player leads all of Major League Baseball in all three categories, he might be said to have captured a "Major League Triple Crown".  Furthermore, it is not a requirement for a player to be the sole leader in each category; only a tie of first place in each category is needed in order to be eligible. Yastrzemski tied with Harmon Killebrew for the American League lead in home runs (44) when he won the Triple Crown in 1967.

==Batting Triple Crown==

The most batting Triple Crowns won by a player is two. Rogers Hornsby was the first to accomplish it, winning his first in 1922 and then leading all major leagues in 1925 en route to his second Triple Crown, both with the St. Louis Cardinals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1922-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1922 National League Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1925-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1925 Major League Baseball Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Ted Williams later matched this mark in the AL, winning in 1942 and 1947 with the Boston Red Sox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1942-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1942 American League Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1947-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1947 American League Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] The Cardinals have won the most batting Triple Crowns as a franchise with four.

==Pitching Triple Crown==

The most pitching Triple Crowns captured by one player is three, accomplished by three players. Grover Cleveland Alexander captured his first two in consecutive seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies (1915–1916), and won a third in 1920 with the Chicago Cubs. Alexander is the only pitching Triple Crown winner to win his titles with more than one team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1915-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1915 National League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1916-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1916 National League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1920-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1920 National League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Walter Johnson won his three Triple Crowns with the first Washington Senators, leading the league in all three categories in 1913, 1918, and 1924.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1913-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1913 American League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1918-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1918 American League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1924-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1924 American League Pitching Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Sandy Koufax was the most recent to capture three Triple Crowns, winning his three within four seasons for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1963, 1965–1966); all of Koufax's wins were Major League crowns, the most for any player.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1963-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1963 Major League Baseball Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1965-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1965 Major League Baseball Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1966-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1966 Major League Baseball Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]

==Records==

The first Triple Crown winner was Tommy Bond, who won the NL pitching crown in 1877. The following year, Paul Hines won the first batting Triple Crown in the NL; he and Miguel Cabrera are the only two batting Triple Crown winners from the NL or the AL who are not in the Hall of Fame. The highest home run and RBI totals by a batting winner were achieved by Mickey Mantle and Lou Gehrig, respectively; Mantle hit 52 home runs in 1956, and Gehrig batted in 165 runs in 1934, their only Triple Crown seasons. In the National League, Hornsby is the leader in home runs, with 42, and Medwick's 154 RBI lead as well. Hugh Duffy's .440 average in 1894 is the highest ever during a winning season, and the AL leader is Nap Lajoie (.426). Among the pitching triple crown winners, the lowest ERAs belong to Johnson (1.14 in the 1913 AL) and Alexander (1.22 in the 1915 NL). Johnson is also the AL leader in wins (36), but Charles Radbourn's NL total is over 20 wins higher; his 59 wins in 1884 are a Major League Baseball single-season record.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/W_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders & Records for Wins|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Radbourn also struck out 441 batters that season, the highest total for a Triple Crown winner; Pedro Martínez struck out 313 in the 1999 season to notch the highest strikeout total for an AL winner. The highest strikeout total for a Triple Crown winner in both the modern era (post-1900) and the live-ball era (post-1920) is Koufax's 382 in 1965, which was also a modern-era record at that time.
