Dollywood is a theme park owned by entertainer Dolly Parton and Herschend Family Entertainment. It is located in the Knoxville-Smoky Mountains metroplex in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Hosting over 3 million guests in a typical—Presidents' Day through the Christmas holidays—season, Dollywood is the biggest "ticketed" tourist attraction in Tennessee.King, Caitlin R., "Dolly Parton Celebrates as Dollywood Turns 25", Associated Press report as published on the ABC News website, April 14, 2010, retrieved April 18, 2010
In addition to standard amusement park thrill rides, Dollywood features traditional crafts and music of the Smoky Mountains area. The park hosts a number of concerts and musical events each year, including appearances by Parton and her family, as well as other national and local musical acts, and is the site of the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame.

==History==

The park first opened in 1961 as a small tourist attraction by the Robins Brothers from Blowing Rock, NC, named "Rebel Railroad", featuring a steam train, general store, blacksmith shop, and saloon.  In the spirit of the Civil War centennial visitors could ride the train and experience an attack by Union soldiers. The train and its riders were protected by Confederates who fought off the attack, thus the name "Rebel Railroad". The park was modeled after their first successful theme park Tweetsie in Blowing Rock.  In 1970, Rebel Railroad was renamed "Goldrush Junction" when it was bought by Art Modell, who also owned the Cleveland Browns football team.Company Info Dollywood.com  (accessed July 16, 2010)http://www.pigeonforge.com/dolly_parade.asp PigeonForge.com (accessed July 16, 2010)  In 1976, Jack and Pete Herschend bought Goldrush Junction and renamed it "Goldrush" for the 1976 season.  But in 1977, they renamed it "Silver Dollar City Tennessee" as a sister park to their original Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri.
In 1986, Dolly Parton became a co-owner, and the park was renamed "Dollywood".  In 2010, Parton said she became involved with the operation because, "I always thought that if I made it big or got successful at what I had started out to do, that I wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great, something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area."
Dollywood has 3,000 people on its payroll, making it the largest employer in that community.[tpl]cite news |last=Blackhurst |first=Rob |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5d08011c-6ce0-11de-af56-00144feabdc0.html |title=Is Dollywood one big kitsch joke? |work=Financial Times |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=12 July 2009[/tpl] 
From 1986 to 2010, the park doubled in size to [tpl]convert|150|acre|km2[/tpl].  In 2009, the park had a six percent decline in attendance, which a park spokesman attributed to bad weather, although many other theme parks in the United States suffered attendance drops that year, as often happens to relatively high-priced tourist attractions in recessions.  As of 2010, prices for admission to the park were $56 for adults and $45 for children.
On November 16, 2010, Dollywood earned the industry's most prestigious award, the Liseberg Applause Award, which was accepted by Dolly Parton during a ceremony at IAAPA Attractions Expo 2010 in Orlando.Dolly Parton theme park wins top industry award // Reuters, November 16, 2010
Parton said in 2010 that she would like to open more Dollywood parks in the future. "We definitely want to expand with new things every year, eventually with a resort," she said. "We may eventually have Dollywoods in other parts of the country, where we can kind of be true to whatever's going on in that part of the world."
During an announcement on August 21, 2013, Parton announced Dollywood's DreamMore Resort.[tpl]cite web|title=10 Year Announcement|url=http://www.dollywood.com/Media/Press-Releases/10-Year-Announcement.aspx|publisher=The Dollywood Company|accessdate=11 December 2013[/tpl]
