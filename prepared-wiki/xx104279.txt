"I Don't See Me in Your Eyes Anymore" is a popular song, written by Bennie Benjamin and George David Weiss and published in 1949. The song was popularized that year by Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra (vocals by The Stardusters) and by Perry Como.
The song received renewed popularity in 1974, when country singer Charlie Rich released a cover version he had recorded during the mid-1960s. Rich's rendition reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in June 1974, crossing the Top 50 Of the "Hot 100" survey and peaking in the top ten of the "Easy Listening" chart.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

===Gordon Jenkins===

The recording by Gordon Jenkins was released by Decca Records as catalog number 24576 and first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 25, 1949 and lasted 21 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 6. 

===Perry Como===

The recording by Perry Como was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog numbers 20-3347 (78 rpm) and 47-2892 (45 rpm). It was the flip side of "Forever and Ever." It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on May 6, 1949 and lasted 15 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 11. 

===Charlie Rich===

Rich's version came about during his stint at RCA's rhythm and blues subsidiary, Groove Records, and association with producer Chet Atkins, one of the architects of the Nashville Sound. Like many of Atkins-produced songs of the era, "I Don't See Me ..." featured choral backing and strings, a style prominent on other Rich recordings of the time. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Cook said that Rich's musical style "landed somewhere between the raw sound of his Sun hits ... and the pop crossover tone of his Epic smashes."Cook, Stephen, Big Boss Man: The Groove Sessions by Charlie Rich, review at Allmusic.
Although recorded in the mid-1960s, "I Don't See Me ..." was never released as a single. Then, in 1973, Rich had million-selling hits with "Behind Closed Doors" and "The Most Beautiful Girl," and it wasn't long before several of his older recordings made during his tenures at RCA, Mercury and Sun records — "I Don't See Me ..." included — were released as singles to country radio.
Released in April — around the time his Epic single "A Very Special Love Song" was wrapping up its run in popularity — "I Don't See Me ..." quickly became Rich's fifth No. 1 song overall, and third in the first six months of 1974 alone. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
