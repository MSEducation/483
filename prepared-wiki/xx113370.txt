The Metropolitan Medical Center College of Arts, Science and Technology is a school of nursing located at Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines. It was founded in 1976, and is owned and operated by the United Doctors Association, which is an affiliate of the Metropolitan Medical Center. The Metropolitan Medical Center College of Arts, Science and Technology ranked 47th nationwide in the 2006 Nurse Board Licensure Examination. They recently added tuition fees and they are deciding on implementing the so called "battery" or they will drop the students who have grades below 80. (not sure but the college is thinking about it so that they could produce quality nurses without the influence of business and earning more money.)
