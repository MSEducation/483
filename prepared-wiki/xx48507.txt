[[Goat Tying]]

CATEGORIES: Rodeo events

Goat-tying is a rodeo event in which the participant rides to a goat tethered by a 10' rope to a stake, dismounts, catches, throws, and ties any three of its legs together. The goat must stay tied for six seconds after the contestant has backed away from the animal. If the goat becomes untied before six seconds have passed, the rider receives no score.
A participant may be disqualified for undue roughness while handling the goat, touching the goat after the tie, or after signaling completion of the tie a contestantâ€™s horse coming in contact with the goat or tether while the contestant still has control of the horse.
The event is not seen in professional rodeo, but is a common event seen at youth, High school rodeo and intercollegiate rodeo levels.  In most cases it is considered a women's event.
