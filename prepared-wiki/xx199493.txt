On 20 February 2006 it was announced that Rynning-Tønnesen had been hired as CEO of the Statkraft-owned, Kristiansand-based power company Agder Energi.[tpl]cite news|title=Rynning-Tønnesen ny konsernsjef i Agder Energi|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=20 February 2006|language=Norwegian[/tpl] He was headhunted, and did not apply for the job.[tpl]cite news|title=Kremmeren|work=Fædrelandsvennen|date=27 June 2006|first=Synnøve Skeie|last=Fosse|language=Norwegian|page=20[/tpl] Chair of Agder Energi Sigmund Kroslid, who had taken the position in December 2005,[tpl]cite news|title=Nytt styre engasjerer ekstern ryddehjelp|last=|first=|date=22 December 2005|work=Fædrelandsvennen|language=Norwegian[/tpl] praised Rynning-Tønnesen as "the clear primary candidate of the board". Stavanger Aftenblad noted that the new CEO did not want to negotiate a golden parachute.[tpl]cite news|title=Ny direktør uten fallskjerm|work=Stavanger Aftenblad|date=21 February 2006|language=Norwegian|page=8[/tpl] It was unclear when Rynning-Tønnesen would actually assume the position, but in early June he visited Agder Energi for preparations. However, the next week he declined the position to become CEO of Norske Skog.[tpl]cite news|title=Glede over at Tom Nysted blir ny Agder Energi-sjef|date=9 June 2006|first=Mari|last=Horve|work=Fædrelandsvennen|language=Norwegian[/tpl] He had been offered the position in Norske Skog behind the scenes.[tpl]cite news|title=Ny AE-direktør klar|date=12 June 2006|first=|last=|work=Teknisk Ukeblad|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
Jan Oksum, who in February 2006 "regretted" that Rynning-Tønnesen left Norske Skog,[tpl]cite news|title=Finansdirektørenslutter i Norske Skog|work=Nationen|date=21 February 2006|language=Norwegian|page=15[/tpl] was fired due to poor results.[tpl]cite news|title=Oksum har fått sparken|first=Camilla|last=Thoresen|work=Dagbladet|date=20 March 2006|language=Norwegian|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2006/03/20/461215.html|accessdate=16 June 2009[/tpl] The poor results continued under Rynning-Tønnesen, due to downward international trends and sinking demand of paper. From February to November 2007 the Oslo Stock Exchange value of Norske Skog plummeted with 20%. In 2008 the activity at Norske Skog Follum was lowered amid continued losses.[tpl]cite news|title=Papirtigeren|date=14 March 2008|first=Bjørn R.|last=Jensen|work=Ukeavisen Ledelse|page=4|language=Norwegian[/tpl] Nonetheless, in 2008 he received an award for leadership, the "European CEO of the Year for the pulp and paper industry", from the information company RISI.

Rynning-Tønnesen assumed the office as CEO of Statkraft in the summer of 2010, and kept his annual salary of [tpl]NOK|3.9 million[/tpl]. This was 0.4 million more than the person he succeeded as CEO of Statkraft, Bård Mikkelsen, earned. It was the highest salary for a leader in a state-owned company in Norway.[tpl]cite news|title=Ny rekordlønn i staten|date=13 November 2009|first=Kristian|last=Skard|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=8|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
