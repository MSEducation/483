Bowman graduated in chemical engineering in 1952 and later completed his PhD in 1961. After working several decades for Imperial Oil Limited, and also holding executive positions with the Chemical Institute of Canada and the Canadian Research Management Association, Bowman started his own consultancy.  He helped organizations use "ProGrid" to make a broad range of decisions such as selecting research projects, choosing corporate strategies, and making decisions on proposals, grant applications and awards.

==Early life==

He is was born to Emily and Clement Willis Bowman Sr. on January 7, 1930 in Toronto, Ontario. His father was an émigré from England who settled in Ingersoll, Ontario.  After high school, Bowman enrolled in the University of Toronto where he graduated as a chemical engineer in 1952.

==Career==

After working several years with DuPont Canada on the production of nylon, Bowman returned to the University of Toronto in 1957 for postgraduate work. In 1958, he attained a MASc and then a PhD in 1961.
He then joined Imperial Oil Limited, an affiliate of Exxon Corporation, at the Esso Research Centre in Sarnia, Ontario.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/11154114.html|title=C.W.

In 1964, Imperial Oil selected him as one of the staff to test the process of bitumen separation on a variety of oil sands by taking the  plant to the oil sands formation in Alberta. He worked for Syncrude Canada Limited for the next six years, conducting studies on the molecular and interfacial properties of the oils sands and the mechanism of the Clark hot water separation process., leading to a paper presented at the Seventh World Petroleum Congress in Mexico City in 1967.
In the late 1960s the government of Alberta decreased the rate of oil sands development, and Bowman returned to Imperial Oil's research department in Sarnia. He was later promoted to senior researcher at the Imperial Oil's Sarnia Research Centre.
In 1975, he was appointed the first chairperson of the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority (AOSTRA) by Alberta premier Peter Lougheed.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/wanted-vision-and-the-latest-oil-sands-extraction-methods/article10817255/ | title=Wanted: Vision and the latest oil sands extraction methods | publisher=The Globe and Mail | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Yakabuski, Konrad[/tpl] AOSTRA is a crown corporation with a fund of $100 million (worth [tpl]Inflation|US|100|1975|r=-2[/tpl] million today).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cepal.org/comercio/noticias/documentosdetrabajo/1/34371/paper__AHester_web.pdf|title=Project: Public-private for innovation and export diversification and upgrading|last=Hester |first=Annette|coauthors=Leah Lawrence|publisher=United Nations|pages=22|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] He was responsible for starting a project to obtain access to the deep oil sands deposits by sinking a shaft and drilling horizontal wells by directional drilling, now the basis of the widely adopted method of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/inductees.html | title=2013 Inductees | publisher=Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame | accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]
In 1984, he returned to Imperial Oil as Vice President—Research for Esso Petroleum Canada, a division of the company, with responsibility for the Sarnia Research Centre. In 1986, he returned to Alberta as President of the Alberta Research Council, an Alberta crown corporation. At the Council, he  led the organization into joint research ventures with the private sector, with the oil sands and their environmental issues remaining a priority.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dose.ca/news/story.html?id=26130aa7-e86d-411a-800e-d1148c9fda03|title='National will' required to make oilsands development sustainable: expert|last=Boswell|first=Randy|date=30 April 2008|publisher=Dose.ca|accessdate=2009-04-10[/tpl] In 1989, five years after leaving AOSTRA, he received the K. A. Clark Distinguished Service Award for his contributions to AOSTRA. On completing his term there, he opened his own consulting practice.http://www.ip-adress.com/whois/progrid.ca
Bowman was also a key adviser to Premier Lougheed on energy issues throughout the 1970s-1980s.[tpl]cite news | title=Oilsands could 'hit a wall,' expert warns PM | work=The Calgary Herald | date=30 April 2008 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | author=Boswell, Randy[/tpl]
