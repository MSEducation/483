Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i is a word in some Polynesian languages denoting chiefly status[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ptk9xUamLeUC&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=ali'i+Polynesian+word#v=onepage&q=ali'i&f=false|title=Linguistic anthropology|first=Alessandro|last=Duranti|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|page=234|isbn=1-4051-2632-9|accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl] in ancient Hawaii and the Samoa Islands. 
A similar word with the same concept is found in other Polynesian societies. In the Cook Islands, an ariki is a high chief and the House of Ariki is a parliamentary house (with very limited power). In New Zealand a Māori ariki held a rank of nobility and the Maori monarch held the title Te Arikinui (Great Chief) similar to Ke Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Nui in Hawaiian. In Tokelau, the term aliki denotes a chief, on Easter Island a noble was ariki, in Gambier Islands akariki, and in  Tahiti the term is ari'i.
In Samoa, ali'i is a chiefly rank in the fa'amatai system which lies at the heart of the culture's socio-political organisation and similar to the traditional system in Hawaii.

==Hawaiian ali'i==

In ancient Hawaiian society, ali'i was a hereditary chiefly or noble rank (social class or caste).[tpl]Hawaiian Dictionaries|ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i |q=alii |accessdate=19 September 2010 [/tpl] The ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i class consisted of the high and lesser chiefs of the various realms in the islands. They governed with divine power called mana.[tpl]Hawaiian Dictionaries |mana |id=D12710 |accessdate=19 September 2010 [/tpl] The ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i were the highest class, ranking above both kahuna (priests) and maka[tpl]okina[/tpl]āinana (commoners).
Most common translations are "Chief" and "High Chief", although lord and lady were sometimes considered equivalent English titles. Proposals to use prince and princess have not received broad support.

===Description===

All the ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Hawaiian dynasties of the several islands were interrelated, and apparently forbidden to intermarry with other classes.
Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i were full of mana and could place and remove kapu (curse or taboo) on objects. Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i continued to rule the Hawaiian islands until 1893 when Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani passively resisted the attempts to substitute the Constitutional Monarchy, Government, and supporting Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, in a coup arranged by filibusters.
Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Nui were ruling chiefs (in Hawaiian, nui means grand, great, or supreme.[tpl]Hawaiian Dictionaries |nui |accessdate=19 September 2010 [/tpl]) and must claim parentage at least of a mother of the highest rank.
Alii is also a term that means hello in Palauan Language.

===Titles===

Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i [tpl]okina[/tpl]Aimoku were high chiefs of an island. The four largest Hawaiian islands (Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i proper, Maui, Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, and O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu) were usually ruled each by their own ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i [tpl]okina[/tpl]aimoku. Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i also had a line of island kings, but was later subjected to the superior power of nearby Maui and O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu during the 17th and 18th centuries. Under an ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i [tpl]okina[/tpl]aimoku, subordinate district ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i controlled their petty fiefs. But these petty fiefs could sometimes encompass one-sixth of an island, since the islands were usually divided into six districts. These feudal lords were ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i nui of their district and were styled as "Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i-o-Name of District".
Mō[tpl]okina[/tpl]ī was a special title for the highest chief of the island of Maui, otherwise also known as Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i [tpl]okina[/tpl]Aimoku of Maui. Later, the title was used for all kings of the Hawaiian Islands and the Hawaiian monarchs.
Kaukauali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i was a chief of inferior rank who was a noble only on his father's side, with an inferior-ranking mother. Kaukauali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i usually gain rank through marriage with higher-ranking ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. Some bore kahili, royal standards made of feathers, and were attendants of the higher-ranking ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. During the monarchy these chiefs served as the primary political figures in the Hawaiian legislature and the king's Privy Council.
Ranks of the Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i: First were the Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Pio who were product of full blood sibling unions. Famous Pio chiefs were the royal twins, Kameeiamoku and Kamanawa. Next were the Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Naha who were product of half blood sibling unions, famous Naha chiefs include Keopuolani. After that was the Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Wohi who were product of marriage of close relatives other than siblings; one famous Wohi chief being Kamehameha I. Last came the inferior chiefs.

===Feudal social organization===

Internecine warfare between heirs of rulers was common in ancient Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. Warfare between chiefs was also common.
Commoner or lesser Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i served the higher-ranking Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, not for pay, but instead, due to their duty to allegiance to the nation.
The caste organization facilitated a feudal system that resembles other feudal societies, for example the feudal systems found in Europe circa 1000 AD, in feudal Japan, Ethiopia, and so on.
Higher ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i gave lesser ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i parcels of land, which those lesser ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i would in turn govern. The lesser ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i divided the land into plots to be farmed and cultivated by maka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ainana families. Harvests were returned to the lesser ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, each taking a portion before being sent to the supreme ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.
Both the reigning dynasties of the united Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i (1810–1893) were of ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i class. As each relative of those dynasties was entitled to the title ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, they have later, posthumously, been popularly labeled (mostly erroneously) princesses and princes, although only a limited number of royal relatives ever received the princely title from the monarch.
