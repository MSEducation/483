[[Squalane]]

CATEGORIES: Triterpenes, Alkanes

Squalane is a hydrocarbon and triterpene derived by hydrogenation of squalene.  
Due to the complete saturation of squalane, it is not subject to auto-oxidation. This fact, coupled with lower costs associated with squalane make it desirable in cosmetic applications where it is used as an emollient and moisturizer."Squalane: the natural moisturizer",  by Rosenthal, Maurice L. in Chemistry and Manufacture of Cosmetics (3rd Edition), Editor: Schlossman, Mitchell L. (2002), 3(Bk. 2),  869-875
The label of squalane as "natural moisturizer" is somewhat exaggerated. While squalane can be found in small quantities in sebaceous secretions (sebum), it is squalene that is most commonly found in nature, most notably in the livers of sharks.[tpl]cite journal|author= Allison, Anthony C.| title=Squalene and Squalane Emulsions as Adjuvants|journal=Methods|year=1999|volume=19|pages=87–93| doi=10.1006/meth.1999.0832|issue= 1[/tpl] 
Squalane has low acute toxicity and is not an irritant at the concentrations used in cosmetics.[tpl]cite journal | title = Final report on the safety assessment of squalane and squalene | journal = Journal of the American College of Toxicology | year = 1982 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 37–56 | url = http://ijt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/37 | doi = 10.3109/10915818209013146[/tpl]
