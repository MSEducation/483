Sedgemoor is a low lying area of land in Somerset, England.  It lies close to sea level south of the Polden Hills, historically largely marsh (or "moor" in its older sense).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15100 |title=Introduction |author=Robert Dunning (Editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=2004 |work=A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 8: The Poldens and the Levels |accessdate=1 August 2011 [/tpl]  The eastern part is known as King's Sedgemoor, and the western part West Sedgemoor.  Sedgemoor is part of the area now known as the Somerset Levels and Moors.  Historically the area was known as the site of the Battle of Sedgemoor.
Sedgemoor has given its name to a local government district formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the municipal borough of Bridgwater, the Burnham-on-Sea urban district, Bridgwater Rural District and part of Axbridge Rural District.  The district covers a larger area than the historical Sedgemoor, extending north of the Polden Hills across the Somerset Levels and Moors to the Mendip Hills.

Industry in Bridgwater has also seen major growth recently with the opening of "Express Park" which houses Gerber Foods who are a global fruit juice supplier, NHS Logistics depot and Eddie Stobart depot.  Also south of Bridgwater at Huntworth is a large Somerfield depot which supplies their Somerfield and former Kwik Save stores in the south west.

==Governance==

===Sedgemoor District Council===

Sedgemoor District Council has traditionally been Conservative run since its creation in 1974 when it was merged with the old Bridgwater & Burnham-On-Sea Urban District Councils. Past voting trends have placed strong cores of Labour voters in Bridgwater Town, with Conservative support coming from the Villages such as Pawlett, Wedmore and Shipham. Liberal Democrats fared well in Burnham and Highbridge areas. In 1995, the Liberal Democrats and Labour took 26 seats together, out-numbering the Conservatives 24 seats, and they formed a coalition. This continued until 1999, when the Conservatives re-took Sedgemoor, crushing the Liberal Democrats from 12 seats, to just 2. The Liberal Democrats lost even their safe seat of Highbridge to Labour.
In 2000, a Conservative Councillor died, and a By-Election was called in his seat of Huntpsill and Pawlett. Previous Liberal Democrat Councillor Marilyn Wallace fought the seat, and re-took it with 56% of the vote, bringing the Liberal Democrats back up to 3 seats.
In 2003, the Conservatives extended their majority to 35 seats of 50, leaving the Liberal Democrats on just 1 Seat, Which was held by long term veteran Liberal Democrat, Mike Mansfield, who actually took the seat from the Conservatives in Burnham South, a previously Liberal Democrat safe seat. Labour remained on 14.
In 2007, the Conservatives held a status quo of 35 seats, however the Liberal Democrats gained 3 up to 4 total, all of which were in their traditional safe seat of Highbridge. This included the election of their youngest Councillor in the South west, Councillor Joe Leach, who was aged just 19 years. Mike Mansfield was elected Leader of the Liberal Democrat group, until the untimely death of his wife. Newly elected Councillor Danny Titcombe then was elected leader of the Group. on 14 April 2008, Cllr. Danny Titcombe announced his defection to the Conservative Party, effectively boosting their majority to 36 seats. Despite calls of resignation from all sides, Cllr. Titcombe continued in his role. At 20 Years old, Cllr Joe Leach became the youngest group Leader in the Country, and still continues to lead his party on the Council at 23. The Labour Party dropped to 11 seats, losing 2 in highbridge to the Liberal Democrats, and 1 in Bridgwater Bower to the Conservatives. The Conservatives lost 1 in Highbridge to the Liberal Democrats (before defection). In 2010, Woolavington Councillor Roger Lavers, who was the Labour Group Leader, died suddenly of a brain hemorrhage, triggering a by-election in the 1 Member ward, which saw Labour drop from holding the seat, to third behind the Liberal Democrats who hadn't stood in the seat since 1991, and the Conservatives gain the seat, boosting their total number to 37 of 50 councillors. Labour dropped to 10. Councillor Kathy Pearce, Labour member for Bridgwater Hamp, was elected as the new Labour group Leader.
The Conservative Leader is Cllr. Duncan McGinty, who is also leader of council. He succeeded Cllr. John Lang in 2006.
The Labour Leader is Cllr. Kathy Pearce, who succeeded Cllr. Roger Lavers in 2010.
The Liberal Democrat Leader is Cllr. Joe Leach, who succeeded Cllr. Danny Titcombe in 2008.
