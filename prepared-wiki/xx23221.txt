From the Hodder & Stoughton 2008 edition of The Carpetbaggers about the author section:
 Robbins was the playboy of his day and a master of publicity. He was a renowned novelist but tales of his own life contain even more fiction than his books. What is known is that with reported worldwide sales of 750 million, Harold Robbins sold more books than J.K. Rowling, earned and spent $50m during his lifetime, and was as much a part of the sexual and social revolution as the pill, Playboy and pot. In March 1965, he had three novels on the British paperback bestseller list – Where Love Has Gone at No.1, The Carpetbaggers at No.3 and The Dream Merchants in the sixth spot. 
His widow, Jann Robbins, has republished 12 of his most famous titles with AuthorHouse Publishing.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
