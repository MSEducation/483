==Foley Scandal==

Alperin was later the editor in charge of ABC's website when it broke the scandal involving Congressmen Mark Foley and sexually explicit emails to underage congressional pages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ire.org/history/pr/2006IREawards.html |title=IRE History | Recent Press Releases | 2006 IRE Award |publisher=Ire.org |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2010-08-12[/tpl] 
The Foley story and its evolution are cited as important moments in the use of the internet to further investigative reporting at a major news organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ire.org/contest/06winners.html |title=IRE Awards | 2006 |publisher=Ire.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12[/tpl]
The Investigative Reporters and Editors Association said the following in recognizing the story for an award: 
 Acting on information that other mainstream news organizations downplayed or ignored, ABCNews.com broke the first stories of Rep. Mark Foley's inappropriate behavior with congressional pages and relentlessly drove the coverage as it widened into a full-blown congressional scandal. In doing so, these journalists demonstrated the power and speed of the Internet as a tool for reporting and disseminating national news. As new angles developed, ABC expanded on its website exclusives with nightly broadcast reports, a synergistic alliance that set a model for other media outlets. 
The ABC anchorman Charles Gibson was quoted as saying he initially didn't think the story was suitable for his program because of its explicit content and the low profile of the subject. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
Some debate still exists about the timing of the story only a few months before the 2004 mid-term elections, and to what degree the scandal suppressed turnout.USNews&WR
