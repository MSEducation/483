Mauveine, also known as aniline purple and Perkin's mauve, was the first synthetic organic chemical dye, discovered serendipitously in 1856.

==Chemistry==

Mauveine is a mixture of four related aromatic compounds differing in number and placement of methyl groups.  Its organic synthesis involves dissolving aniline, p-toluidine, and o-toluidine in sulfuric acid and water in a roughly 1:1:2 ratio, then adding potassium dichromate.A Microscale Synthesis of Mauve Scaccia, Rhonda L.; Coughlin, David; Ball, David W. J. Chem. Educ. 1998 75 769 Abstract
Mauveine A (C26H23N4+X−) incorporates 2 molecules of aniline, one of p-toluidine, and one of o-toluidine. Mauveine B (C27H25N4+X−) incorporates one molecule each of aniline, p-toluidine, and o-toluidine.  In 1879, Perkin showed mauveine B related to safranines by oxidative/reductive loss of the p-tolyl group.W. H. Perkin, "On mauveine and allied colouring matters", J. Chem. Soc. Trans., 1879, 717–732. [tpl]doi|10.1039/CT8793500717[/tpl].  In fact, safranine is a 2,8-dimethyl phenazinium salt, whereas the parasafranine produced by Perkin is presumedWebsite source: ch.ic.ac.uk Link to be the 1,8-(or 2,9) dimethyl isomer.
The molecular structure of mauveine proved difficult to determine, finally being identified in 1994.O. Meth-Cohn, M. Smith, "What did W. H. Perkin actually make when he oxidised aniline to obtain mauveine?", J. Chem. Soc. Perkin 1, 1994, 5–7. [tpl]doi|10.1039/P19940000005[/tpl].  In 2007, two more were isolated and identified: mauveine B2, an isomer of mauveine B with methyl on different aryl group, and mauveine C, which has one more p-methyl group than mauveine A.Revisiting Perkin's dye(s): The spectroscopy and photophysics of two new mauveine compounds (B2 and C) J.

In 2008, additional mauveines and pseudomauveines were discovered, bringing the total number of these compounds up to 12.A Study in Mauve: Unveiling Perkin!s Dye in Historic Samples, M. M. Sousa, M.

==History==

In 1856, William Henry Perkin, then age 18, was given a challenge by his professor, August Wilhelm von Hofmann, to synthesize quinine.  In one attempt, Perkin oxidized aniline using potassium dichromate, whose toluidine impurities reacted with the aniline and yielded a black solid—suggesting a "failed" organic synthesis.  Cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed purple portions of the solution.
Suitable as a dye of silk and other textiles, it was patented by Perkin, who the next year opened a dyeworks mass-producing it at Greenford on the banksGoogle Earth location: Download of the Grand Union Canal in London.  It was originally called aniline purple or Tyrian purple, the name of an ancient natural dye derived from mollusks.[ref]
