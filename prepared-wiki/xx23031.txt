==History==

The history of Włocławek can be stretched back to the times of the Iron Age: archeological excavations conducted on the site of today's city uncovered the remains of a settlement belonging to the Lausitz culture, on which around 500 years later a settlement of Pomeranian culture had been established. Traces of settlements dating from the Roman period and the early Middle Ages have also been excavated and uncovered.About Włocławek
Regarding the city itself, precise dating of its founding has proven do be difficult. Since the 16th century there is conflicting data in relation to the establishment of the town. Part of the confusion lies with varying attributions of the city's name, (which was derived from the first name Władysław, or Vladislav), to three rulers: Władysław II the Exile, his grandfather Władysław I Herman, or Vladislav II of Bohemia.
An assistant to the Archbishop of Gniezno was mentioned as residing in the town in 1123 and the Diocese of Włocławek ([tpl]lang-la|Vladislaviensis[/tpl]) in Kuyavia  in the bull issued by Pope Eugene III in 1148. The first bishop of Włocławek, whose name appears in the bull was Warner, and he was followed by an Italian named Onoldius. The diocese was also recorded as "Włocławek and Pomerania" (Vladislaviensis et Pomeraniae).
Włocławek received its town rights in year 1255. During the 14th and 15th centuries the city was destroyed and  also captured several times by the Teutonic Knights, who renamed it Leslau.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Peace treaty was signed in year 1466, Treaty of Thorn, and the city prospered from its involvement in the trade with grain. During the Swedish invasion Second Northern War the city was partially destroyed in  1657. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 Włocławek became part of Prussia. The Congress of Vienna restored it to Congress Poland, but the city was later occupied by the Russian Empire since 1831. The city was again destroyed during the battles of German offensive during the First World War.
During World War II, Włocławek was occupied by German troops, which entered the city on 14 September 1939. Under the Nazi occupation Włocławek was again renamed Leslau, annexed by decree to the German Reich on 8 October 1939 and administered from 26 October as a part of Reichsgau Posen (renamed on 29 January 1940 Reichsgau Wartheland). One third of the city was destroyed, but its factories and workshops were rebuilt by the Polish government in the following decades. The most important industries in Włocławek today are chemical industry, production of furniture, and food processing. The dam which was constructed in 1969 regulates the water level of the Vistula river, forming Włocławek Reservoir.
The Catholic priest Fr. (now Blessed), Jerzy Popiełuszko, who was associated with the workers' and trade union movement Solidarity, and who was also a  member of opposition to the Communist regime in Poland, was tortured and murdered by three Security Police officers, and was thrown into the Włocławek Reservoir, close to the city. His body was recovered from the reservoir on October 30, 1984.

==Jewish history==

From the beginning of the 19th century, Włocławek had a growing Jewish population. With the beginning of the Nazi occupation of Poland starting in year 1939, it Włocławek became the first town in Europe in which Jews were required to wear the yellow Star of David badges. Soon wearing the Star of David badges became a requirement for all Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. Many of the Włocławek's Jews died of starvation or illness, were shot or beaten to death by the Nazis after being confined in the Łódź Ghetto. Others perished in the gas chambers upon their arrival at the Chełmno extermination camp. Today there is only very little, if any trace at all, of their once rich and lively community.
