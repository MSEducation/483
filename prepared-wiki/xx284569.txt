==Acid Attack==

The two were nearing the end of their one-month volunteer teaching when the attack happened.[tpl]cite web|title=Zanzibar acid attack: father says teenagers devastated by ordeal|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/11/zanzibar-acid-attack-father-teenagers-devastated|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl] The attack happened at 7:15pm on August 7th, 2013. The two girls were walking on the street when their attackers approached and threw sulphuric acid on them.  
Both girls suffered burns to their face, hands, and chest. One girl suffered lesser injuries because she was walking on the side of the curb away from the attackers, so was doused with less liquid. http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zanzibar-acid-attack-kirstie-trup-2863518

After being treated at a local hospital, the two returned to London to be treated by specialists.
