As of 2010, there were 44.7 million people in the world with open angle glaucoma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Quigley|first=H A|coauthors=Broman, AT|title=The number of people with glaucoma worldwide in 2010 and 2020|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=March 2006|volume=90|issue=3|pages=262–267|doi=10.1136/bjo.2005.081224|pmid=16488940|pmc=1856963[/tpl]  The same year, there were 2.8 million people in the United States with open angle glaucoma.  By 2020, the prevalence is projected to increase to 58.6 million worldwide and 3.4 million the United States.
Internationally, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness, after cataracts.  Glaucoma is also the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open angle glaucoma.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Alfred|coauthors=Tielsch, James M.; Katz, Joanne; Quigley, Harry A.; Gottsch, John D.; Javitt, Jonathan C.; Martone, James F.; Royall, Richard M.; Witt, Kathe A.; Ezrine, Sandi|title=Racial Differences in the Cause-Specific Prevalence of Blindness in East Baltimore|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=Nov 14, 1991|volume=325|issue=20|pages=1412–1417|doi=10.1056/NEJM199111143252004|pmid=1922252[/tpl]  Bilateral vision loss can negatively affect mobility and interfere with driving.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ramulu|first=Pradeep|title=Glaucoma and disability: which tasks are affected, and at what stage of disease?|journal=Current opinion in ophthalmology|date=March 2009|volume=20|issue=2|pages=92–8|pmid=19240541|doi=10.1097/ICU.0b013e32832401a9|pmc=2692230[/tpl]

==Research==

A 2013 Cochrane Systematic Review compared the effect of brimonidine and timolol in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants.[tpl]cite journal |author= Sena DF, Lindsley K |title= Neuroprotection for treatment of glaucoma in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD006539 |year=2013 |pmid= 20166085 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006539.pub3[/tpl] The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression that those assigned to timolol, though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence. The mean intraocular pressure for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.
Natural compounds of research interest in glaucoma prevention or treatment include: fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids, alpha lipoic acid,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/alpha-lipoic-000285.htm |title=Alpha-lipoic acid |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) |accessdate=2011-04-09[/tpl] bilberries, vitamin E, cannabinoids, carnitine, coenzyme Q10, curcurmin, Salvia miltiorrhiza, dark chocolate, erythropoietin, folic acid, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, L-glutathione, grape seed extract, green tea, magnesium, melatonin, methylcobalamin, N-acetyl-L cysteine, pycnogenols, resveratrol, quercetin and salt. However, most of these compounds have not demonstrated effectiveness in clinical trials. Magnesium, ginkgo, salt and fludrocortisone, are already used by some physicians.  (Note: fludrocortisone is not a natural compound, but a steroid.)
Studies in the 1970s showed marijuana, when smoked or eaten, effectively lowers intraocular pressure by about 25%, as much as standard medications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=174 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |publisher=Nap.edu |accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=174 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base (1999), Institute of Medicine, National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |accessdate=2011-06-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology |url=http://one.aao.org/CE/PracticeGuidelines/Therapy_Content.aspx?cid=9871fa42-cf40-4c1f-b05c-c816d5f93126 |title=Complementary Therapy Assessment: Marijuana in the Treatment of Glaucoma |accessdate=2011-05-04 [/tpl] In an effort to determine whether marijuana, or drugs derived from it, might be effective as a glaucoma treatment, the US National Eye Institute supported research studies from 1978 to 1984. These studies demonstrated some derivatives of marijuana lowered intraocular pressure when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye.
In 2003, the American Academy of Ophthalmology released a position statement which said, "studies demonstrated that some derivatives of marijuana did result in lowering of IOP when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye. The duration of the pressure-lowering effect is reported to be in the range of 3 to 4 hours".[tpl]cite web|url=http://one.aao.org/CE/PracticeGuidelines/Therapy_Content.aspx?cid=9871fa42-cf40-4c1f-b05c-c816d5f93126 |title=Complementary Therapy Assessments : American Academy of Ophthalmology |publisher=One.aao.org |accessdate=2011-01-24[/tpl]
However, the position paper qualified that statement by stating marijuana was not more effective than prescription medications, and "no scientific evidence has been found that demonstrates increased benefits and/or diminished risks of marijuana use to treat glaucoma compared with the wide variety of pharmaceutical agents now available."
The first patient in the United States federal government's Compassionate Investigational New Drug program, Robert Randall, was afflicted with glaucoma and had successfully fought charges of marijuana cultivation because it was deemed a medical necessity (U.S. v. Randall) in 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/irvin-rosenfeld-and-the-compassionate-ind/ |title=Irvin Rosenfeld and the Compassionate IND |publisher=Drugwarrant.com |accessdate=2011-01-24[/tpl]

===Implanted sensor===

The world's smallest computer system, one millimeter square in size, has been developed by researchers at the University of Michigan, and is designed to be implanted in a person's eye as a pressure monitor to continuously track the progress of glaucoma. The processor consists of an ultra-low-power microprocessor, a pressure sensor, memory, a thin-film battery, a solar cell, and a wireless radio with an antenna that can transmit data to an external reader device.[tpl]cite web|author=pt. kompas cyber media |url=http://english.kompas.com/read/2011/02/25/14201764/The.Worlds.Smallest.Computer |title=The World's Smallest Computer |publisher=KOMPAS.com |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-06-22[/tpl]

Glaucoma has been classified into specific types:[tpl]cite journal |author=Paton D, Craig JA |title=Glaucomas. Diagnosis and management |journal=Clin Symp |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=1–47 |year=1976 |pmid=1053095 [/tpl]

===Primary glaucoma and its variants (H40.1-H40.2)===

Primary glaucoma
Variants of primary glaucoma
Primary angle closure glaucoma is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively "scars").
These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so called "acute" angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include headache and vomiting.
Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.
Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse, and prevent, contact between iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.
Primary open-angle glaucoma is when optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of the visual field.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |title=Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Glaucoma: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=2011-01-24[/tpl]  This is associated with increased pressure in the eye.  Not all people with primary open-angle glaucoma have eye pressure that is elevated beyond normal, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression even in these cases.
The increased pressure is caused by trabecular blockage. Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss.  Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.
Diagnosis is made by looking for cupping of the optic nerve. Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways.  Beta blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing formation of Aqueous humor.  Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) both decrease fluid production (via. inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.

===Developmental glaucoma (Q15.0)===

Developmental glaucoma

===Secondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6)===

Secondary glaucoma
Neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in ischemia of the retina or ciliary body. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.
Neovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. Patients with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures. A new treatment for this disease, as first reported by Kahook and colleagues, involves use of a novel group of medications known as anti-VEGF agents. These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure.
Toxic glaucoma is open angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach [tpl]convert|80|mmHg|abbr=on[/tpl]. It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular oedema that sometimes extends to Schlemm's canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.
Associated factors include inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, including cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures. Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four patients who had toxic glaucoma. One of them underwent phaecoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops. Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy. Valving procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.Pardianto G, Difficulties on glaucoma in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2006;3: 48–9.[tpl]vs|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Absolute glaucoma (H44.5)===

Absolute glaucoma is the end stage of all types of glaucoma. The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.

==Prognosis==

In open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, depending on the method of estimation used.[tpl]cite journal|last=Heijl|first=Anders|coauthors=Bengtsson, Boel; Hyman, Leslie; Leske, M.
