==Controversy==

Mitchell has alienated many of his potential readers by admitting that he executed several of his "translations" without knowledge of the language from which he was translating. While Mitchell claims to know 8 languages, he admits that he has no substantial knowledge of Sanskrit or Chinese.  His "translations" of the Tao Te Ching and the Bhagavad Gita were not that, but rather rewritings of these works based on previous English language editions.[tpl]cite web|title=Daring New 'Iliad' Translation by Stephen Mitchell|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204422404576597201215250720[/tpl]
