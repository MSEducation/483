[[New Hampshire Outing Club]]

CATEGORIES: University of New Hampshire

The New Hampshire Outing Club (NHOC) is the oldest and largest student organization at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. Founded in 1911, it currently has around 250 members. The NHOC typically offers 2 to 3 trips each weekend to go hiking, canoeing, rock climbing, caving, skydiving, snowshoeing, downhill and cross-country skiing, and mountaineering. The club has also led sailing trips in the  summer. The club is entirely student run and decisions for the club are made at weekly business meetings that are open to anyone in the club.

==Cabins==

The New Hampshire Outing Club owns two cabins in New Hampshire's White Mountains. Franconia Notch Cabin, or "Franky" as it is colloquially known, was built in the early 1900s. It suffered a propane explosion in 1957, causing the club to rebuild the cabin where it stands today in Franconia Notch State Park. The cabin operates on a special-use permit from the state of New Hampshire.
Jackson Cabin is located in the northern fringes of Jackson, New Hampshire, a small resort town on the southern border of the White Mountain National Forest. It is only a few minutes' drive from the Presidential Range, which includes Mt. Washington, the highest mountain in the Northeast. The club is currently building a newer Jackson cabin that will match Franky in size and is slated to be finished in September 2008.[tpl]update after|2008|09|30[/tpl]
