On November 5, 2001, while riding his motorcycle in Los Angeles, Muller sideswiped a center concrete construction divider. He was thrown from the bike and landed on his head and chest. Although he was wearing a helmet, he suffered severe head trauma and was later diagnosed with diffuse axonal injury.
Muller was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, California, where he went into cardiac arrest three times and later had seven surgeries. He was in a coma for over a month and died on Wednesday, June 4, 2008 at Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC.
In 2002, Stephen King, who had also experienced a life-threatening auto accident, organized a benefit for Muller with Pat Conroy, John Grisham, and Peter Straub.
