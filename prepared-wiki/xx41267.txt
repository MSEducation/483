Falafel ([tpl]IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|f|əl[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|فلافل[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ar|fæˈlæːfɪl||ArFalafel.ogg[/tpl]) is a deep-fried ball or patty made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or both. Falafel is a traditional Middle Eastern food, usually served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as lafa; "falafel" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze (appetizers).
Falafel is a common dish eaten throughout the Middle East. The fritters are now found around the world as a replacement for meat and as a form of street food.

==Etymology==

The word falafel can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them.
Some sources trace the name to the Arabic word [tpl]transl|ar|ALA-LC|falāfil[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ar|فلافل[/tpl]), the plural of [tpl]transl|ar|ALA-LC|filfil[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ar|فلفل[/tpl]), meaning "pepper", and that the Arabic word is preceded by:American Heritage Dictionary, 5th edition (2011), s.v. falafel http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=falafel&submit.x=38&submit.y=12
and/or
A Coptic origin has recently been proposed via the unattested phrase*pha la phel ([tpl]lang|cop|Φα Λα Φελ[/tpl]), meaning "of many beans".[tpl]cite book|last=Makar|first=Adeeb B.|title=The Abbreviated Coptic-English Dictionary|year=2001|publisher=St. Mina Monastery Press|location=Hayward, Calif.|oclc=609610948|page=185|quote=Φαλαφελ (fåˈlåfālˈ) m.

The Arabic word falāfil has been borrowed into many other languages and spread around the rest of the world as the general name for this food. In English, it is first attested in 1941.Joseph Williams McPherson, The moulids of Egypt, 1941 Google BooksOxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition s.v. 'felafel' has a 1951 quote
Falafel is known as taʿamiya ([tpl]lang-arz|طعمية[/tpl] [tpl]transl|arz|ṭaʿmiyya[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ar|tˤɑʕˈmejjɑ|IPA[/tpl]) in Egypt, with the exception of Alexandria. The word is derived from a diminutive form of the Arabic word [tpl]transl|ar|ALA-LC|ṭaʿām[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ar|طعام[/tpl], "food"); the particular form indicates "a unit" of the given root in this case [tpl]transl|sem|Ṭ-ʕ-M[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|ar|ط ع م[/tpl], having to do with taste and food), thus meaning "a little piece of food" or "small tasty thing".[tpl]cite book|last=Davidson|first=Alan|author2=Jaine, Tom|title=The Oxford companion to food|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|edition=2|page=287|isbn=978-0-19-280681-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC&pg=PA287&dq=falafel&cd=8#v=onepage&q=falafel|accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30704219_ITM|title=Falafel: healthy Middle Eastern hamburgers capture the West.|last=Habeeb|first=Salloum|date=April 1, 2007|work=Vegetarian Journal|accessdate=February 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Africa|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Victoria|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n-jEEqvIqi4C&pg=PA199|page=199|isbn=978-1-74104-988-6|accessdate=July 19, 2011|display-authors=1[/tpl]

===Middle East===

Falafel grew to become a common form of street food or fast food in the Middle East.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20100128/NEWS/1281035/1042?Title=Dining-with-a-Middle-Eastern-flair-&tc=ar|title=Dining with a Middle Eastern flair|last=Kelley|first=Leigh|date=January 28, 2010|work=Times-News|accessdate=February 10, 2010[/tpl] The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the iftar, the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset. Falafel became so popular that McDonald's for a time served a "McFalafel" in some countries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wnewsj.com/main.asp?SectionID=43&SubSectionID=200&ArticleID=172473|first=Jerry|last=Allison|title=Fast food – Middle Eastern style|date=January 6, 2009|work=The News Journal|accessdate=February 6, 2011[/tpl] Falafel is still popular with the Copts, who cook large volumes during religious holidays.
Debates over the origin of falafel have sometimes devolved into political discussions about the relationship between Arabs and Israelis.

Falafel plays an iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely considered to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered parve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals.

===North America===

In North America, prior to the 1970s, falafel was found only in Middle Eastern and Jewish neighborhoods and restaurants.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ze3F_n37NVoC&pg=PA181&dq=falafel+american#v=onepage&q=falafel%20american&f=false|title=Mouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetite|author=Thorne, Matt; Thorne, John|pages=181–187|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-0-86547-628-8| accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]Charles Perry, "Middle Eastern Influences on American Food" in Andrew F.

Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas, or a combination of the two.

The Egyptian variety uses fava beans.
When chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with baking soda) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, scallions, and garlic. Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E7D81F30F937A35757C0A9619C8B63|title=For the Best Falafel, Do It All Yourself|last=Bittman|first=Mark|date=2007-04-04|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl] Fava beans must be cooked, for medical reasons.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scienzavegetariana.it/nutrizione/favabeans.html | title=Fava Beans, Levodopa, and Parkinson's Disease | author=Kathrynne Holden[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/05-96/05-29-96/c01li096.htm | author=Russ Parsons | title=The Long History of the Mysterious Fava Bean[/tpl] The mixture is shaped into balls or patties.

Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini.
Falafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes, particularly donut-shaped. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan.

==Nutrition==

When made with chickpeas, falafel is high in protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber.[tpl]cite book|last=Webb|first=Robyn|title=Eat to Beat High Blood Pressure|publisher=Readers Digest|year=2004|page=140|accessdate=February 6, 2011|isbn=978-0-7621-0508-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xl6TEe_KbNgC&pg=PA140&dq=falafel&cd=1#v=onepage&q[/tpl] Chickpeas are also low in fat and salt and contain no cholesterol.
