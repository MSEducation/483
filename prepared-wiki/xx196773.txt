The residential building is planned to rise [tpl]Convert|504|ft|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] with 44 floors. The building was under construction when on March 15, 2008, the luffing-jib tower crane, owned by New York Crane & Equipment, used to construct the skyscraper snapped off and fell, killing seven people in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the worst construction accident in New York City in recent history.[tpl]Cite web|title=Ch 07 News Crane Collapse In Midtown Manhattan New York City|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=YtgRMdDPn5Y&feature=related|work=ABC 7 News|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-03-15|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]

==History==

The original design for the skyscraper was a 40-story building that stood 470 feet (143.3 m) tall. On December 19, 2007, during the building's construction, the developer decided to scale up the building slightly to 44 stories for 117 residential units and [tpl]Convert|504|ft|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] tall. The exterior of the skyscraper will be clad in silverly glass and there will be many angled balconies extending out from the building.[tpl]Cite web|title=Design of condo tower planned at 303 East 51st Street changing|url=http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showpost.php?p=3239748&postcount=1|publisher=CityRealty .com|accessdate=2008-05-20|date=2007-12-19[/tpl]
Even before the crane accident in March, the New York Department of Buildings issued 13 safety violations for construction site and contractor, with two of those citations being serious. The Department and Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the infractions were normal for a project of this scale, much to the ire of local residents.[tpl]Cite web|title=BEHIND SITE'S UNLUCKY 13 VIOLATIONS|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03172008/news/regionalnews/behind_sites_unlucky_13_violations_102324.htm|first=Brian|last=Hamacher|author2= Austin Fenner, Leonard Greene|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-05-20|work=New York Post[/tpl] There was a report on March 4 that said the crane was structurally detached from the building, although that claim was discredited later in an arrest.[tpl]Cite web|title=Crane Collapse Arrest|url=http://curbed.com/archives/2008/03/20/crane_collapse_arrest.php|publisher=Curbed.com|accessdate=2008-05-21|author=Joey|date=2008-03-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Crane collapse==

On March 15, 2008, a crane owned by New York Crane & Equipment collapsed during construction of this building. Seven people were killed and 24 others were injured.The New York Times, March 16, 2008: "Crane Collapse in Manhattan Kills at Least 4" It was a luffing-jib tower crane manufactured by Favco that was 200 feet tall at the time of the collapse. The accident occurred when workers were attaching a new steel collar to anchor it to the building at the 18th floor, as part of an operation to extend the crane upwards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gostructural.com/article.asp?id=2788|title=Crane collapse in New York City|date=2008-03-25[/tpl] Investigators say the prime suspect is a $50 piece of nylon that broke while lifting a six ton piece of steel.Seven dead, 24 injured in NYC crane collapse
The owner of Crave Ceviche Bar sued the owner of his building on 2nd Avenue because of their plans to demolish the building due to damage from the crane. The building owner claimed that the damage was irreparable and must be demolished in order to rebuild. There was a legal settlement of over $1 million, allowing the owner to continue business by giving him the chance to open in a different location.Timeout New York, February 26, 2009: "Crave Ceviche Bar Still On the Ropes"
