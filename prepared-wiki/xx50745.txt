The Memphis Maniax was an American football team based in Memphis, Tennessee. The team was part of the XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. Home games were played in Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.

==History==

The team's name and logo were designed to lead the team's fans into calling the team "The Ax", a shortened form of the word "maniacs". Regardless, the name and logo were roundly criticized by advocates for the rights of the mentally ill, [tpl]Who|date=March 2009[/tpl] believing that they were derived from a derisive term for a person suffering from mental illness, "maniac", and/or a depiction of a deranged axe-wielding murderer, despite that there was no picture of an axe in the logo. Still many of the fans formed their own cheering section at the Liberty Bowl unofficially known as "The Asylum"
The Maniax Director of Player Personnel was Steve Ortmayer, who had become respected in the pro football world for helping to build the Super Bowl XVIII champion Los Angeles Raiders. Steve Ehrhart, who had managed both the Memphis Showboats and Memphis Mad Dogs, returned as general manager for the Maniax.  The head coach was Kippy Brown.
They were in the Western Division with the Los Angeles Xtreme, San Francisco Demons and Las Vegas Outlaws. They finished tied for 2nd place at 5-5 with the Demons but did not make the playoffs as the Demons had the better division record during the season.  The Maniax were one of two teams to beat the eventual league champion Xtreme, and the only team to beat them twice, going 2-0 vs. their divisional rivals in the regular season.
NBC officials wanted to move the XFL games to afternoons after the first season (2001) due to dismal ratings, and when, somewhat to McMahon's surprise and disappointment the United Paramount Network (UPN) wanted to follow suit, the league was then folded and the team disbanded.
