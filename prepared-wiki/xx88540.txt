Londrina ([tpl]IPA-pt|lõˈdɾĩnɐ[/tpl], literally Londonese) is a city located in the north of the state of Paraná, South Region, Brazil, and is 369 km away from the capital, Curitiba.

==Demography==

The city was named after British entrepreneurs who launched railroad stations in the region to ease the transportation of coffee grains from northern Paraná and southern São Paulo states to the port of Santos. The word Londrina, literally meaning "Londoner" or perhaps "Little London", pays homage to the British capital (Londres in Portuguese), since a Londoner cotton company, Paraná Plantations Limited, made the original investment to settle in this area.  The city's population consists of descendants of those settlers, mainly from England and Scotland, plus Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, German, Polish, African, Spanish, Native, Lebanese, Ukrainian and Bulgarian Brazilians, as well as some Brazilians from other cities or states.

==Economy==

Agriculture continues to be Londrina's major economic activity, although its importance has diminished in recent years. Agricultural activity was diversified beyond coffee, and today corn, wheat, cotton, horticulture, beans, peanuts, rice, sugar cane, soy bean, and fruit plantations thrive due to the rich Northern Paraná/South Western São Paulo State "terra roxa" crimson soil. Although the city has increased its industrial park by adding weaving, textiles and agricultural factories, Londrina's main wealth continues to be agricultural production. Today, Londrina is also known for its commerce and service sectors. Moreover, real estate is another growing sector that has generated jobs and boosted even more the size of this city in Paraná.
It possesses one of the largest universities in the country, the State University of Londrina, as well as several private colleges.
The city is served by Londrina – Governador José Richa Airport.
Once a year, the city hosts the largest agricultural fair in Latin America, the Expo Londrina.

===Soil===

The fertile land of the region, "terra roxa" ("purple soil"), has this name due to a corruption and attempt to translate into Portuguese the term "terra rossa" ("red soil", in Italian), which Italian immigrants used to call it. The inhabitants of Northern Paraná state are often called "pé vermelho" ("red foot") because of their dust bowl-like region. The fertility of the soil is said to have originated in the biggest volcanic lava spill of the planet, known as The Spill of Trapp, that to a large extent occurred in the Center-South region of Brazil.  During its golden era, (1920 to 1970), Londrina region accounted for 60% of all the coffee produced in the world, together with the west bank of the Paraná River,
