===Mergers and acquisitions===

In 1989, Collins was bought by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and the publisher was combined with Harper & Row, which NewsCorp had acquired two years earlier. In addition to the simplified and merged name, the logo for HarperCollins was derived from the torch logo for Harper and Row, and the fountain logo for Collins, which were combined into a stylized set of flames atop waves.
In 1999, News Corporation purchased the Hearst Book Group, consisting of William Morrow & Company and Avon Books. These imprints are now published under the rubric of HarperCollins.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_077.html|title=News Corporation Announces Plans To Acquire William Morrow & Company And Avon Books From The Hearst Corporation|date=June 17, 1999|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=August 6, 2012|location=New York|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209220010/http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_077.html|archivedate=Dec 9, 2006[/tpl]

===Web approach===

In order to both boost book sales and reach the online market, HarperCollins has created a browsing feature on its website, whereby customers can read selected excerpts from books before purchasing.HarperCollins (Finally) Offers Free Books Online.Pace, Andrew K. “Technically Speaking.” American Libraries 2006 April: 80. There are some concerns among publishers with this approach because they feel that the online books could be exploited by file-sharing.Lowry, Tom. “Getting Out Of a Bind.” Business Week2006 April 10; 79. In addition, excerpts of books are also available to mobile phone users.HarperCollins Offers Books on the iPhone.

===HarperStudio===

HarperCollins announced HarperStudio in 2008 as a "new, experimental unit... that will eliminate the traditional profit distributions to authors. The long-established author advances and bookseller returns has not proved to be very profitable to either the author or the publisher. The approach HarperStudio is now taking is to offer little or no advance, but instead to split the profit 50% (rather than the industry standard 15%), with the author." The division was headed by Bob Miller, previously the founding publisher of Hyperion, the adult books division of the Walt Disney Company.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/business/04harper.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=New HarperCollins Unit to Try to Cut Writer Advances|author=Rich, Motoko|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch|title=Hyperion publisher goes to HarperCollins|author=Italie, Hillel|publisher=Associated Press|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064317/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch  |archivedate = 2008-04-08[/tpl] HarperStudio folded in March 2010 after Miller left for Workman Publishing.[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/04/that-was-fast-say-goodbye-to-harper-studio.html|title=That was fast: say goodbye to Harper Studio|author=Kellogg, Carolyn|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-04-02[/tpl]
