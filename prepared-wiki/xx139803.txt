Betty Boop with Henry, the Funniest Living American is a 1935 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop, and featuring Carl Anderson's Henry.  The short was also released as Betty Boop with Henry.

==Plot==

Betty runs the local pet store.  Silent Henry wants to buy a puppy, but only has two cents.  Soft-hearted Betty offers to let Henry work off the difference at her store.  She soon regrets this decision after Henry causes a ruckus trying to manage the pets.  In the end, Henry recaptures some escaped birds (by letting them eat seeds off his head), and Betty rewards him with a puppy.

==Notes and comments==

The Henry comic strip debuted in 1932, and still runs in some papers.  This short was Henry's sole animated appearance.
Betty sings "Everybody Ought to Have a Pet."
