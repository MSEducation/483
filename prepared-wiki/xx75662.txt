"Our military leaders have made a compelling case that they can successfully implement a repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell'," she said. "It is infinitely preferable for Congress to repeal the law, and allow the service chiefs to develop and execute a new policy, than to invite a court-ordered reversal of the law with no allowance for a military-directed implementation. I've heard from Alaskans across the state who believe it's time to end this discriminatory policy, and I agree with them."[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]  On December 18, 2010, Murkowski was one of eight Senate Republicans to vote in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, and one of only four who had voted for cloture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/smit9187/dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal_5_n_798636_71215004.html |title=smit9187: Collins, Snowe, Kirk, Voinovich, Burr, Ensign, Brown, Murkowski joined the |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/usa-today-news/2010/12/18/senate-passes-dont-ask-sends-repeal-to-obama/ |title=Senate passes ‘don’t ask,’ sends repeal to Obama - Arizona News from USA Today |publisher=Tucsoncitizen.com |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kjonline.com/Snowe-Collins-support-repeal-of-Dont-Ask-Dont-Tell.html |title=Snowe, Collins join majority in repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' | The Kennebec Journal, Augusta, ME |publisher=Kjonline.com |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46578.html |title=Eight Republicans back ‘don’t ask’ repeal - Shira Toeplitz |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00281 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/senate/2/281?ref=politics | work=The New York Times | title=Senate Vote 281 - Repeals ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell'[/tpl]
