==Non-terrestrial impacts==

===Evidence of massive past impact events===

Impact craters provide evidence of past impacts on other planets in the Solar System, including possible interplanetary terrestrial impacts. Without carbon dating, other points of reference are used to estimate the timing of these impact events. Mars provides some significant evidence of possible interplanetary collisions. The North Polar Basin on Mars is speculated by some to be evidence for a planet sized impact on the surface of Mars between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago, while Utopia Planitia is the largest confirmed impact and Hellas Planitia is the largest visible crater in the Solar System. The Moon provides similar evidence of massive impacts, with the South Pole–Aitken basin being the biggest. Mercury's Caloris Basin is another example of a crater formed by a massive impact event. Rheasilvia on Vesta is an example of a crater formed by an impact capable of, based on ratio of impact to size, severely deforming a planetary-mass object. Impact craters on the moons of Saturn such as Engelier and Gerin on Iapetus, Mamaldi on Rhea and Odysseus on Tethys and Herschel on Mimas form significant surface features.

===Observed events===

The 1994 impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter served as a "wake-up call", and astronomers responded by starting programs such as Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR), Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT), Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search (LONEOS) and several others which have drastically increased the rate of asteroid discovery.
In 1998, two comets were observed plunging toward the Sun in close succession. The first of these was on June 1 and the second the next day. A video of this, followed by a dramatic ejection of solar gas (unrelated to the impacts), can be found at the NASASOHO Comet 100 website. Both of these comets evaporated before coming into contact with the surface of the Sun. According to a theory by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Zdeněk Sekanina, the latest impactor to actually make contact with the Sun was the "supercomet" Howard-Koomen-Michels on August 30, 1979.A SOHO and Sungrazing Comet FAQ (See also sungrazer.)
On July 19, 2009, a new black spot about the size of Earth was discovered in Jupiter's southern hemisphere by an amateur astronomer. Thermal infrared analysis showed it was warm and spectroscopic methods detected ammonia. JPL scientists confirmed that another impact event on Jupiter had occurred, probably a small undiscovered comet or other icy body.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/21/jupiter.nasa.meteor.scar/index.html|title=Mystery impact leaves Earth-sized mark on Jupiter|publisher=CNN | date=July 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=All Eyepieces on Jupiter After a Big Impact|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/science/space/22jupiter.html?hpw|publisher=New York Times|date=July 22, 2009[/tpl]Amateur astronomer spots Earth-size scar on Jupiter, Guardian, July 21, 2009

==Popular culture==

===Science fiction novels===

Numerous science fiction stories and novels center around an impact event; one of the first and more popular being Off on a Comet ([tpl]lang-fr|Hector Servadac[/tpl]) by Jules Verne, published in 1877. In more modern times possibly the best-selling was the novel Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Arthur C. Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama opens with a significant asteroid impact in northern Italy in the year 2077 which gives rise to the Spaceguard Project, which later discovers the Rama spacecraft. In 1992 a Congressional study in the U.S. led to NASA being directed to undertake a Spaceguard Survey, with the novel being named as the inspiration for the name to search for Earth-impacting asteroids.space-frontier.org This in turn inspired Clarke's 1993 novel The Hammer of God.
A variation on the traditional impact story was provided by Jack McDevitt's 1999 novel Moonfall, in which a very large comet traveling at interstellar velocities collides with and partially destroys the Moon, fragments of which then collide with the Earth. The 1985 Niven and Pournelle novel Footfall features the examination of the effects of planetary warfare conducted by an alien species that culminates in the use of asteroids to bombard the planet, creating very large craters and the human species' near extinction. Robert A. Heinlein used the concept of guided meteors in his novel The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,  in which the moon rebels use rock-filled shipping containers as a weapon against their Earth oppressors.
Some science fiction has concerned itself not with the specifics of the impact event and/or its prevention or avoidance but its secondary effects on human society. Ben H. Winters' 2012 novel The Last Policeman is set six months prior to an asteroid collision, following a murder investigation that is complicated by the political and cultural responses to the impending event.

===Cinema and television===

Several disaster films have also been made: released during the turbulence of World War I, the Danish feature film The End of the World revolves around the near-miss of a comet which causes fire showers and social unrest in Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/nationalfilmografien/nffilm.aspx?id=15934|title=Verdens undergang|language=Danish|work=dfi.dk|publisher=Danish Film Institute| accessdate=2011-08-16[/tpl] When Worlds Collide (1951) based on a 1933 novel by Philip Wylie, deals with two planets on a collision course with Earth – the smaller planet a "near miss," causing extensive damage and destruction, followed by a direct hit from the larger planet.[tpl]Citation | last = Wylie | first = Philip and Balmer, Edwin | authorlink = Philip Wylie | title = When Worlds Collide | publisher = Frederick A.

Orbiting U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons platforms are turned away from their respective earthbound targets, and toward the incoming threat.
In 1998, two films were released in the United States on the subject of attempting to stop impact events: Touchstone Pictures' Armageddon, about an asteroid; and Paramount/DreamWorks' Deep Impact, about a comet. Both involved using Space Shuttle-derived craft to deliver large amounts of nuclear weapons to destroy their targets. The 2008 American Broadcasting Company's miniseries Impact deals about a splinter of a brown dwarf hidden in a meteor shower which strikes the Moon and sends it on a collision course with Earth. The 2011 film Melancholia uses the motif of an impact event incorporated in the aesthetics of romanticism.[tpl]Citation|last=Juul Carlsen|first=Per|date=May 2011|url=http://www.dfi.dk/Service/English/News-and-publications/FILM-Magazine/Artikler-fra-tidsskriftet-FILM/72/The-Only-Redeeming-Factor-is-the-World-Ending.aspx|title=The Only Redeeming Factor is the World Ending|journal=FILM|issue=72|pages=5–8|editor=Neimann, Susanna|publisher=Danish Film Institute|issn=1399-2813|accessdate=2011-05-18|postscript=.[/tpl]
In the science fiction television series Babylon 5, war between the Narn and Centauri is brought to an end when the Centauri use mass drivers to propel asteroids at the surface of the Narn home world causing severe ecological damage. The novelization, as well as the actual game Rage, is based on an alternate future, where the end of the world is caused by impact with 99942 Apophis.
