Henrik Jørgensen is a Danish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is currently goalkeepeing coach at Vejle Boldklub.
Jørgensen spent the first few years of his career in his native Denmark, playing for sides such as Boldklubben 1909, AGF and Viborg FF. Jørgensen moved to Scottish side Dundee United at the start of the 1994-95 season, joining the Scottish Cup winners as replacement for Guido van de Kamp. In his first game, Jorgensen conceded five goals and although he featured in the following Scottish League Cup match, keeping a clean sheet, his only other first-team appearance was as a substitute. His transfer to United from Viborg was brought into question some months later when it was reported that the transfer was the centre of 'bung' allegations, with United denying the earlier sacking of manager Ivan Golac was related to the incident.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n13974464|title=Bruce will sit out United's Cup semi-final|last=Riley|first=Catherine|date=1995-03-31|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Several months later, the Scottish FA announced it would ask the Danish FA for information regarding the transfer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n13975805|title=Bjrnebye's despair|date=1995-04-07|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Jorgensen moved on to South Korean side Suwon Samsung Bluewings and stayed in Asia for a spell with Thai side Raj Pracha FC.
