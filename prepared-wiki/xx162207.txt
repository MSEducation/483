==Minor league career==

Paul Casanova began his professional baseball career on January 1, [tpl]By|1960[/tpl] when he was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thebaseballcube.com/players/C/Paul-Casanova.shtml|title=Paul Casanova Statistics - The Baseball Cube|accessdate=2007-12-15[/tpl] After playing ten minor league games, he was released by the Indians. Casanova was picked back up by the Indians in December, only to be released again in April 1961. During 1961, he played for the Indianapolis Clowns, a former Negro League team which was now competing as an independent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballinlivingcolor.com/player.php?card=110|title=Baseball in Living Color :: NLB History :: Meet the Players :: Paul Casanova|accessdate=2010-11-28[/tpl] His third short minor league stint was with the Chicago Cubs, who signed him on September 21, [tpl]By|1961[/tpl] and released him on April 26, [tpl]By|1962[/tpl] after he had played two minor league games. On October 5 of that year, Casanova was signed by the Washington Senators, and his professional baseball career would truly begin the following season. He played 94 games in the minors during the 1963 season. He continued to play in the New York - Penn League during the 1964 season and played 120 games, finishing with 19 home runs and a .325 batting average. He spent the 1965 season playing for the Burlington Senators, and was called up to the major league roster in September, starting his major league career.

==Major league career==

Casanova began his major league career on September 18, [tpl]By|1965[/tpl], stepping up to bat twice in a losing effort to the Minnesota Twins[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/gl.cgi?n1=casanpa01&t=b&year=1965|title=Paul Casanova 1965 Batting Gamelogs|accessdate=2007-12-15[/tpl] - the team which had relocated from Washington less than five years earlier, paving the way for the expansion Senators. He played four more games that season. Casanova's first full season came in 1966, when he had career highs of 13 home runs and 5 triples.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/casanpa01.shtml|title=Paul Casanova Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2007-12-15[/tpl] The 1967 season was Casanova's best, as he earned his only All-Star bid, though he did not play in the game. He played 141 games, had a fielding percentage of .984, and was tied for 21st in the American League's MVP voting. Casanova was also the starting catcher for a night game against the Chicago White Sox on June 12, [tpl]By|1967[/tpl]. He caught the whole night, and although he only got one hit in nine at bats, it came in the bottom of the 22nd inning, driving in the winning run.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WS2/WS2196706120.shtml|title=June 12, 1967 Chicago White Sox at Washington Senators Box Score and Play by Play|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] The game, which went 6 hours and 38 minutes, remains the longest night game in MLB history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Paul_Casanova_1941&page=chronology|title=The Ballplayers - Paul Casanova - BaseballLibrary.com|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] The following season was a disappointment, as Casanova played in only 96 games and had a batting average of only .196.
Casanova continued to earn fielding percentages of over .985, but after three more seasons of struggling at the plate, he was traded at the end of the 1971 season, as the Senators were becoming the Texas Rangers. Casanova was traded on December 2, [tpl]By|1971[/tpl] to the Atlanta Braves for Hal King. He played for three seasons on the Braves, serving primarily as a backup. He played behind Earl Williams for the 1972 season, then split time with Johnny Oates in 1973. After playing in only 42 games during the 1974 season, Casanova was released on March 28, [tpl]By|1975[/tpl].
As a Brave, Casanova caught Phil Niekro's no-hitter on August 5, 1973. http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1973/B08050ATL1973.htm
