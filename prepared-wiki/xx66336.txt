==History==

The term "skort" (a portmanteau of skirt and shorts) is used idiomatically in some regions. While some garments sold as culottes resemble short trousers, to be a skort they need to look like skirts. They are distinguished from trousers or shorts by a fuller cut at the bottom (hem) than at the waist. 
Skorts were developed to provide more freedom to do activities such as sports, gardening, cleaning, or bike riding, and give the appearance of a skirt.

==Women's sports==

Skorts are popular in sports such as field hockey, tennis, golf, ten-pin bowling and camogie, and are often part of girls' athletic uniforms. 
Women began to play golf in large numbers in the 1960s which led to the development of the famous Leon Levin "Q" skirt or "skort" which offered the freedom of shorts and soft lines of a skirt. The article became an immediate favorite on the Ladies Professional Golf Tour. Professional golfers famously known for wearing skorts are Natalie Gulbis & Paula Creamer.
