[[Beyla]]

CATEGORIES: Servants in Norse mythology

Beyla is one of Freyr's servants along with her husband, Byggvir, in Norse mythology. Beyla is mentioned in stanzas 55, 66, and the prose introduction to the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna. Since this is the only mention of Beyla, scholars have turned to the etymology of Beyla's name for additional information about her. However, the meaning of her name is unclear and her name has been proposed as related to "cow," "bean," or "bee."

==Lokasenna==

In the prose introduction to Lokasenna,  Beyla and Byggvir are cited as attending In stanza 55 of Lokasenna, after his verses with Sif,  Loki accuses Beyla of being filthy but the reason for this is unclear.Lindow (2001:78). 
Stanza 55:
Stanza 56:
In relation to Loki's comments in Lokasenna, proposals have been made that Beyla and her husband are personifications of agriculture associated with Freyr: Beyla as the manure that softens the earth and develops the seed, Byggvir as the refuse of the mill, chaff.Thorpe (1851:198-199.)
