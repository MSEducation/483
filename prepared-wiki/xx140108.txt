[[Deneb in fiction]]

CATEGORIES: Stars in fiction

The planetary systems of stars other than the Sun and the Solar System are a staple element in much science fiction.

==The Star Deneb==

Deneb is the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus and the nineteenth brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of 1.25. It is a vertex of the Summer Triangle, the other  two vertices being the bright stars Altair and Vega (see High Sierra, below).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Summer_Triangle.html|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science |title=Summer Triangle |accessdate=2012-01-19 [/tpl]
The name Deneb is from the Arabic (ذنب الدجاجة dhanab ad-dajājah), which translates literally as tail of the hen.[tpl]cite book |title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning |last=Allen |first=Richard Hinckley |authorlink=Richard Hinckley Allen |year=1963 |publisher=Dover Books |location=Mineola, NY |page=195 |isbn=0-486-21079-0 [/tpl][tpl]refn |group=note |Arab astronomers gave parallel names to at least seven different stars, most notably Deneb Kaitos, the brightest star in the constellation Cetus, the whale; Deneb Algedi, the brightest star in Capricornus, the goat; and Denebola, the second brightest star in Leo, the lion. All these stars are referring to the tail of the animals that their respective constellations represent.

==Literature==

In the listing below, the majority of literary references to Deneb occurred in the score of years after 1943, the star's banner year as a cynosure when its spectrum was selected as one of the stable anchor points by which all other stars' spectra would be classified.[tpl]citation |last1=Garrison |first1=R F |title=Anchor Points for the MK System of Spectral Classification |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |volume=25 |page=1319 |date=December 1993 |bibcode=1993AAS...183.1710G |url=http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~garrison/mkstds.html |accessdate=2012-02-14 [/tpl] There followed a hiatus of 30 years, until a cluster of works representing renewed interest in the star appeared around the year 1990.
