CATEGORIES: Sikh kirtan, Hindustani ragas

Gauri is an India musical raga that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS.) Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune. 
In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the third raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of 196 pages from page numbers 151 to 347.
Gauri is one of several ragas that appears in the Ragmala as a ragini (subset) of Sri Raga. This is an evening raga assigned to autumn and its mood is contemplative.  The composition in Gauri is very voluminous. Gauri was used by Guru Nanak, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur.  Several forms of Gauri Raga exist historically and this probably accounts for the large number of variants: Gauri Cheti, Gauri Bairagan, Gauri Dipaki, Gauri Purbi-Dipaki, Gauri Guareri, Gauri-Majh, Gauri Malava, Gauri Mala, Gauri Sorath, Gauri Dakhani.
Occasionally Re is performed with a vibrate as in Siri Raga which has the same vadis.  Ni is given prominence through either stopping or lingering on this note.
