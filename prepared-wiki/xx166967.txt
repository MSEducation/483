[[Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear power stations in France

The Cattenom Nuclear Power Station is a nuclear power plant located in Lorraine in the Cattenom commune, France on the Moselle River between Thionville (10 km upstream) and Trier (80 km downstream).  It is close to the city of Luxembourg (35 km) and Metz (40 km).

==Description==

The site consists of 4 Pressurized Water Reactors that were all built between 1979 and 1991 and have an electric output of 1300 MW each.  The plant is a relatively modern and large nuclear power station.  In 2006 it produced the third most electricity (34 TWh) of the nuclear plants in France behind Gravelines (38.5 TWh) and Paluel (34.9 TWh).
The plant employs about 1200 regular employees and about 1000 more during outage times.
The station received its ISO 14001 certification in 2005, and should have its ISO 9001 and OHSAS 18001 in 2007.

===Cooling===

The site uses 4 separate cooling towers which use [tpl]convert|890000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on[/tpl] of water from the Moselle annually.Eléments de diagnostic de la partie française Agence de l'Eau Rhin Meuse, published April 2005, accessed 2011-03-30 Additionally, a water reserve on site, Lake Mirgenbach, was created.  In 1985 an artificial lake was also created in the Pierre-Percée valley in the Vosges Mountains.  The creation of this lake has led to the flooding of the subterranean portions of Ouvrage Kobenbusch, part of the Maginot Line.
During the 2003 European heat wave it was permitted to pipe the waste heat water used for cooling directly into the Moselle river.  The heating of the water in these cases is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius by prefectoral decree.  Heating to 2.2 degrees was accidentally caused once.
