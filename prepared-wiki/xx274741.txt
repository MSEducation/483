Rege's work within the academia, to fight for the right of the Dalit student's rights, has been a testimony of her commitment to critical educational reform in India[tpl]cite web|url=http://kafila.org/2012/06/05/cartoon-controversy-in-conversation-with-satyanarayana-sharmila-rege/ |title=Cartoon controversy – In conversation with Satyanarayana: Sharmila Rege |publisher=Kafila |date= |accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl] Her concerns around the woman's question in India, contributed greatly to new and alternative methods of historiography, exposing the blind-spots of a Hindu Nation towards the Dalit voices and perspectives that have often been neglected in the political milieu of India's history. Her emphasis on relocating B.R. Ambedkar's central role in the shaping of the modern nation state has ensured that the voice from the margins does not remain invisible opens up space for political contestation and dialogue in a public debate that is quickly being gentrified by the rhetoric of economic development and globalisation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kractivist.org/tag/sharmila-rege/ |title=Kractivism " Sharmila Rege |publisher=Kractivist.org |date= |accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl] In her last published work, "Against the Madness of Manu",[tpl]cite web|url=http://navayana.org/against-the-madness-of-manu/ |title=Against the Madness of Manu |publisher= Navayana.org |date= |accessdate=16 July 2013[/tpl] she sought to centralise Ambedkar's role in the women's movement by invoking his ideological fight against Brahminical patriarchy, and how the caste system engenders graded violence against women. Her particular focus on alternative history writing has given new life to the local and oral traditions of knowledge and cultural practice, by bringing them into public attention through translation projects that build archives of national memory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281948 |title=Songsters From The Mudhouse | Sharmila Rege |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date= |accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl]
