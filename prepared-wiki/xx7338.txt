Mormons ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr|m|ən|z[/tpl]) are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity, which began with the visions of Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844, the Mormons followed Brigham Young to what would become the Utah Territory. Today, most Mormons are understood to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Some Mormons are also either independent or non-practicing. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, though the majority of Mormons live outside the United States.
Mormons have developed a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history. During the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, and between 1852 and 1890 a minority of Mormons openly practiced plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. Mormons dedicate large amounts of time and resources to serving in their church, and many young Mormons choose to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, coffee, tea, and other addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented, and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death and throughout eternity. Mormons also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside of opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage.
Mormons self-identify as Christian, though some of their beliefs differ from mainstream Christianity. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology, and believe that all people are spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through ordinances such as baptism. They believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith, and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Central to Mormon faith is the belief that God speaks to his children and answers their prayers.

==Terminology==

The word "Mormons" most often refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) because of their belief in the Book of Mormon, though members often refer to themselves as Latter-day Saints or sometimes just Saints.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/touchstone-of-truth?lang=eng |title=Touchstone of Truth |work=Ensign |date=May 1974 |author=John H.

The term "Mormons" has been embraced by most adherents of Mormonism, most notably Mormon fundamentalists, while other Latter Day Saint denominations, such as the Community of Christ, have rejected it.The LDS Church has taken the position that the term Mormon should only apply to the LDS Church and its members, and not other adherents who have adopted the term. (See: [tpl]cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide – The Name of the Church |author= |date= |work= |publisher=LDS Newsroom |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]) The church cites the AP Stylebook, which states, "The term Mormon is not properly applied to the other Latter Day Saints churches that resulted from the split after Joseph Smith's death." ("Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The", Associated Press, The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, 2002, ISBN 0-7382-0740-3, p.48) Despite the LDS Church's position, the term Mormon is widely used by journalists and non-journalists to refer to adherents of Mormon fundamentalism. Both LDS Church members (or "Latter-day Saints") and members of fundamentalist groups commonly use the word "Mormon" in reference to themselves.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/11/mormon-should-mean-more-good |title=Mormon Should Mean 'More Good,' |author=Gordon B.

==History==

The history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and communality.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=75,119[/tpl]. From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call "Zion", a utopian society of the righteous.A Mormon scripture describing the ancient city of Enoch became a model for the Saints. Enoch's city was a Zion "because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there were no poor among them" [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=36–38[/tpl]; ([tpl]nowrap|Book of Moses 7:18[/tpl]).
Mormon history can be divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, (2) a "pioneer era" under the leadership of Brigham Young and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith had tried literally to build a city called Zion, in which converts could gather. During the pioneer era, Zion became a "landscape of villages" in Utah. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location."In Missouri and Illinois, Zion had been a city; in Utah, it was a landscape of villages; in the urban diaspora, it was the ward with its extensive programs." [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=107[/tpl].

===Beginnings===

Mormons trace their origins to the visions that Joseph Smith reported having in the early 1820s while living in upstate New York.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=1, 9[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=9[/tpl]; [tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5Zx9qOay304C&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Joseph Smith and the origins of the Book of Mormon  |first= David |last= Persuitte|page=30 |publisher=McFarland |date= October 2000|accessdate=25 January 2012[/tpl]. In 1823, Smith said an angel directed him to a buried book written on golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient people.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=19[/tpl]. Smith published what he said was a translation of these plates in March 1830 as the Book of Mormon, named after Mormon, the ancient prophet–historian who compiled the book. On April 6, 1830, Smith founded the Church of Christ.Scholars and eye-witnesses disagree as to whether the church was organized in Manchester, New York at the Smith log home, or in Fayette at the home of Peter Whitmer. [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=109[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23[/tpl] (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements). The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to preach the restored gospel.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41[/tpl] (by the next spring the church had 1,000 members). In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio where missionaries had made a large number of converts[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=97[/tpl] (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in [tpl]Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=111[/tpl]);  [tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41[/tpl]. and Smith began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri,[tpl]Harvtxt|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=162[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=109[/tpl]. where he planned to eventually build the city of Zion (or the New Jerusalem).Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to "retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years." (Doctrine and Covenants 64:21); [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=122[/tpl]. In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby Clay County, where local residents took them in.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=137[/tpl] (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media); [tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=43–45[/tpl] (The Mormons were forced out in a November gale, and were taken in by Clay County residents, who earned from non-Mormons the derogative title of "Jack Mormons").
After Smith led a mission, known as Zion's Camp, to recover the land,[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=322[/tpl]. he began building Kirtland Temple in Lake County, Ohio, where the church flourished.[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=101[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Arrington|1992|p=21[/tpl] (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); Desert Morning News 2008 Church Almanac p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881); [tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19[/tpl] (The Kirtland Temple was viewed as the site of a new Pentecost); [tpl]Harv|Brodie|1971|p=178[/tpl]. Smith also published several new revelations during the Kirtland era. When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836, they secured land in what would become Caldwell County.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=45[/tpl] (In December, 1836, the Missouri legislature granted the Mormons the right to organize Caldwell County).
The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after the failure of a church-sponsored bank caused widespread defections,[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=328–38[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=221[/tpl] ("Ultimately, the rituals and visions dedicating the Kirtland temple were not sufficient to hold the church together in the face of a mounting series of internal disputes.") and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri.[tpl]Harvtxt|Roberts|1905|p=24[/tpl] (referring to the Far West church as the "church in Zion"); [tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=345[/tpl] (The revelation calling Far West "Zion" had the effect of "implying that Far West was to take the place of Independence.") During the fall of 1838, tensions escalated into the Mormon War with the old Missouri settlers.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=357–64[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=227–30[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Remini|2002|p=134[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=97–98[/tpl]. On October 27, the governor of Missouri ordered that the Mormons "must be treated as enemies" and be exterminated or driven from the state.[tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=367[/tpl] (Boggs' executive order stated that the Mormon community had "made war upon the people of this State" and that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace").  [tpl]Harv|Bushman|2005|p=398[/tpl] (In 1976, Missouri issued a formal apology for this order) [tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=47[/tpl]. Between November and April, some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into Illinois.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=47[/tpl] ("the Saints, after being ravaged by troops, robbed by neighbors, and insulted by public officials from February to April, crossed over into Illinois").
In 1839, the Mormons converted a swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River into Nauvoo, Illinois[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=383–84[/tpl]. and began construction of the Nauvoo Temple. The city became the church's new headquarters and gathering place, and it grew rapidly, fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=409[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=258, 264–65[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=51[/tpl] (noting the city growth and missionary success in England). Meanwhile, Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to seal families together for eternity, as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or exaltation,[tpl]Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119[/tpl] (Smith taught that faithful Mormons may progress until they become co-equal with God); [tpl]Harvtxt|Roberts|1909|pp=502–03[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98[/tpl] (the second anointing provided a guarantee that participants would be exalted even if they sinned). and plural marriage.Initially, Smith introduced plural marriage only to his closest associates.[tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=334–36[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=437, 644[/tpl] The practice was acknowledged publicly in 1852 by Brigham Young.
Smith created a service organization for women called the Relief Society, as well as an organization called the Council of Fifty, representing a future theodemocratic "Kingdom of God" on the earth.[tpl]Harvnb|Quinn|1980|pp=120–122, 165[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=519–21[/tpl] (describing the Council of Fifty).
Smith also published the story of his First Vision, in which the Father and the Son appeared to him while he was about 14 years old.[tpl]Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=30[/tpl] The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, "Manuscript History of the Church" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in Times and Seasons, 3 (March 1842), 706–08. (These accounts are available in [tpl]Cite book | editor-last=Vogel | editor-first=Dan | editor-link=Dan Vogel | title=Early Mormon Documents | volume=1 | place=Salt Lake City | publisher=Signature Books | year=1996 | isbn=1-56085-072-8 | ref=harv | postscript= [/tpl].) As the LDS historian Richard Bushman wrote in his biography of Smith, "At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision." [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39[/tpl].
This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.[ref][tpl]cite web|author=LDS Church|title=Joseph Smith Home Page/Mission of the Prophet/First Vision: This Is My Beloved Son.

 ("Nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration.").[/ref]
In 1844, local prejudices and political tensions, fueled by Mormon peculiarity and internal dissent, escalated into conflicts between Mormons and "anti-Mormons".[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1857|pp=64–67[/tpl] On June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois.Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History, p. 824; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=393–94[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=539–50[/tpl]; Many local Illinoisans were uneasy with Mormon power, and their unease was fanned by the local media after Smith suppressed a newspaper containing an exposé regarding plural marriage, theocracy, and other sensitive and oft misinterpreted issues. The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for "inciting a riot".  On June 25, Smith let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason.

Because Hyrum was Smith's logical successor,Brigham Young later said of Hyrum, "Did Joseph Smith ordain any man to take his place. He did. Who was it? It was Hyrum, but Hyrum fell a martyr before Joseph did. If Hyrum had lived he would have acted for Joseph." Times and Seasons, 5 15, 1844: 683. their deaths caused a succession crisis,[tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|p=143[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=398[/tpl]. and Brigham Young assumed leadership over the majority of Latter Day Saints.[tpl]Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=556–57[/tpl]. Young had been a close associate of Smith's and was senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve.Smith's position as President of the Church was originally left vacant, based on the sentiment that nobody could succeed Smith's office. Years later, the church established the principle that Young, and any other senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve, would be ordained President of the Church as a matter of course upon the death of the former President, subject to unanimous agreement of the Quorum of the Twelve. Smaller groups of Latter Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.[tpl]Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|pp=198–211[/tpl].

===Pioneer era===

For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war, Brigham Young led the Mormon pioneers (constituting most of the Latter Day Saints) to a temporary winter quarters in Nebraska and then eventually (beginning in 1847) to what became the Utah Territory.In 2004, the State of Illinois recognized the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints as the "largest forced migration in American history" and stated in the adopted resolution that, "WHEREAS, The biases and prejudices of a less enlightened age in the history of the State of Illinois caused unmeasurable hardship and trauma for the community of Latter-day Saints by the distrust, violence, and inhospitable actions of a dark time in our past; therefore, be it RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NINETY-THIRD GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that we acknowledge the disparity of those past actions and suspicions, regretting the expulsion of the community of Latter-day Saints, a people of faith and hard work."

Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation, based on their beliefs and values.[tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=86[/tpl] ("Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Latter-day Saints found in the Great Basin the isolation that would enable them to establish a distinctive community based upon their own beliefs and values"). The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the Mormon Corridor.[ref][tpl]Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=84[/tpl] (From 1847 to 1857 ninety-five mormon communities were established, most of them clustering around Salt Lake City);
