==Life and music career==

===Childhood and early endeavors===

Born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki was raised as an only child by her mother and grandmother. Her father had left the family when she was three and never again came into contact with her.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | first=Atsushi | last=Shikano | title=Interview with Ayumi Hamasaki| journal=Rockin'on japan| date=February 20, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last=Takeuchi Cullen| first=Lisa| url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html |title=Empress of Pop|work=Time| accessdate=November 28, 2011 | page=3 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020403135213/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html | archivedate=April 3, 2002 [/tpl] Hamasaki's mother worked to support the family, so Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother.
At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, in order to supplement the family's income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency. Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians' agency. Under the name of "Ayumi", Hamasaki released a rap EP, Nothing from Nothing, on the Nippon Columbia label in 1995. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart on the Oricon. After this failure, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in B-movies such as Ladys Ladys!! Sōcho Saigo no Hi and television dramas such as Miseinen, which were poorly received by the public. From August 1995 to March 1996, Hamasaki also co-hosted the SoundLink "magazine" [tpl]nihongo|Hōkago no Ōsama|放課後の王様||After-school King[/tpl] for the Nintendo Satellaview once a week with Shigeru Izumiya.[tpl]cite journal |title=スーパーファミコンアワー番組表8/1～8/31 ～スーパーファミコンアワー番組ガイド～ |journal=サテラビュー通信 |date=September 1995 |volume=2 |pages=33–66 |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=スーパーファミコンアワー音声連動番組ガイド3/1→3/30 |journal=サテラビュー通信 |date=April 1996 |volume=10 |pages=40–73 |language=Japanese[/tpl] Growing dissatisfied with her job, Hamasaki quit acting and moved in with her mother, who had recently moved to Tokyo.
Hamasaki was initially a good student, earning good grades in junior high school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped out in the first year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.
At Velfarre, she was introduced to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year.[tpl]cite web | last = Belfiore | first = Michael | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003868/Ayumi-Hamasaki.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki Biography | accessdate=June 5, 2008| publisher=Musicianguide.com[/tpl] Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.

===1998–1999: Rising popularity===

Hamasaki made her debut under Avex at 19 on April 8, 1998 with the single "Poker Face". It—and the following four singles—were not major hits, however each release was better than the last, thus gradually increasing her exposure and presence on the market. Hamasaki's debut album, A Song for ×× (1999), was likewise "unassuming": the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of Da Pump), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of Every Little Thing), were "cautious" pop-rock songs. However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=A Song for XX | journal=Beatfreak |date=January 1999 | volume=132[/tpl] The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.[tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p430329/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title=Ayumi Hamasaki |publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | first=Chris | last=True[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Siege Mentality | page =1 |work=South China Morning Post | publisher = SCMP Group | location = Hong Kong, China | date=May 13, 2002[/tpl] For her achievements, she earned a Japan Gold Disc Award for "Best New Artist of the Year".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/1999.html | title=The 14th Japan Gold Disc Award 1999 | accessdate=April 17, 2008 | publisher=RIAJ[/tpl]
With Ayu-mi-x (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of A Song for ×× and began to incorporate different styles including trance, dance, and orchestra.[tpl]cite news | last= Walters| first =Barry | title =Turning (Japanese) Point | publisher =The Village Voice | date =March 5, 2002 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0209,168697,32804,22.html| accessdate=April 19, 2008[/tpl] Hamasaki began to experiment with different musical styles in her singles as well, releasing dance tunes and ballads as well as remixes on the singles which spanned reggae and house. The singles were milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single ("Love: Destiny") and first million-selling single ("A").[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 1999 | publisher=RIAJ | accessdate=April 19, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080417233128/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html| archivedate= April 17, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Her second studio album, Loveppears (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3 million copies.[tpl]Cite news| title =You Can't Top This |work = Straits Times | publisher = Singapore Press Holdings |location=Singapore | date =November 25, 1999|agency=Reuters[/tpl] The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics. Though the lyrics of Loveppears still dealt with loneliness, many of them were written from a third-person perspective.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=Loveppears | journal=Beatfreak |date=November 1999 | volume=142[/tpl] In support of Loveppears, she held her first tour, Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A.
A Film for XX is the first video clip collection by Ayumi Hamasaki, it was released on September 15, 1999.

===2000–2002: Commercial peak===

From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the "Trilogy", a series of singles consisting of "Vogue", "Far Away", and "Seasons". The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=Review of Ayu's Year 2000 & M| journal=J-Point|date= December 22, 2000| volume=75[/tpl] Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, Duty (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities. She described her feelings after the writing as "unnatural" and "nervous".[tpl]ja icon[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title=Ayu 10th Year Career Anniversary | journal=Cawaii|date=May 2008|pages=15, 18 |author=Tsuriya, Takako[/tpl] The musical style was darker as well; in contrast with Loveppears, Duty was a rock-influenced album with only one dance song, "Audience".[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=Side Face Story | journal=Cawaii |date=November 2007|author=Tsuriya, Takako[/tpl] Duty resonated with fans: the "Trilogy" were "hit singles" ("Seasons" was a million-seller), and the album became Hamasaki's best-selling studio album.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/246497/ranking/cd_album/|title=Ranking of Ayumi Hamasaki's Albums by Sales|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=July 24, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100813023311/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/246497/ranking/cd_album/| archivedate= August 13, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2000.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 2000 | accessdate=April 19, 2008 | publisher=RIAJ| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080418094213/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2000.html| archivedate= April 18, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] At the end of 2000, Hamasaki held her first New Year countdown concert at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium.
In 2001, Avex forced Hamasaki to release her first compilation album, A Best, on March 28, putting the album in "competition" with Hikaru Utada's second studio album, Distance. The "competition" between the two singers (which both claimed was merely a creation of their record companies and the media) was supposedly the reason for the success of the albums; both sold over 5 million copies.[tpl]Cite news| title =J-pop Divas Fight It Out |work = Straits Times | publisher = Singapore Press Holdings| location=Singapore | date =April 20, 2001|agency=Reuters[/tpl] In support of Duty and A Best, Hamasaki held a tour of Japan's domes, making her one of few "top-drawer" Japanese artists to hold a concert at the Tokyo Dome.[tpl]cite news | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/04/19/2007041961012.html|title=Rain to Perform at Prestigious Tokyo Dome | date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2010|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Co|work=Chosun Ilbo[/tpl]
I Am... (January 2002) marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym "Crea", of which the 2000 single "M" was the first. "Connected" (November 2002) and "A Song Is Born" (December 2001) were the exceptions.[tpl]cite news | first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html | title=I have very clear ideas of what I want|work=Time| accessdate=January 2, 2008 | page=2 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212005108/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html  | archivedate=December 12, 2007[/tpl] I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of "loneliness and confusion" of some of her earlier songs.[tpl]cite news | first=Lisa|last=Takeuchi Cullen|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html| title=Empress of Pop|work=Time| accessdate=February 2, 2008|page=5 | date=March 25, 2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071228123046/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007[/tpl] Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing on issues such as faith and world peace.

Realizing that English was a "common global language", she included English lyrics in three songs.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=Honey Trap| journal=Cawaii|date=March 1, 2007| volume=8|author=Tsuriya, Takako|pages=19, 21|issue=75[/tpl]Original text from Cawaii: "英語を解禁にしようと思ったのは、アルバムの「Rainbow」からなんだけど、あのころMTVなどで賞をいただいてアジアでパフォーマンスするっていうようをことか何回か続いたの。そのときに、日本語だとやっぱけ傳れってをいかもっていう気がしちゃって、単純な少女はやっぱけ世界共通語だよな~っで思ったんだよね。" The album was stylistically diverse; Hamasaki included rock- and trip-hop-influenced tracks as well as "summery", "up-tempo" and "grand gothic" songs and experimented with new techniques such as gospel choruses and the yells of an audience. The lyrics were also varied: themes in the album included freedom, the struggles of women, and "a summer that ends in sadness".[tpl]cite web | url=http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/rainbow/index2.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki's director's notes on Rainbow | publisher= Avex Marketing Inc.| accessdate=April 9, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080327060445/http://avexnet.or.jp/ayu/en/special/rainbow/index2.html| archivedate= March 27, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===2003–2006: Decline and rise in sales===

In 2003, Hamasaki released three singles, "&", "Forgiveness", and "No Way to Say".

By the end of her Arena Tour 2003–2004, Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex: she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=The First-Time Stench of Being a Human|journal=Oricon Style|date=December 27, 2004|issue= 49–1275|pages=17–19[/tpl] Along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums (which she thought had been rushed), this led her to begin work on My Story (December 2004) early. In contrast with her previous albums, My Story had no set theme, nor did Hamasaki attempt to write "something good" or even "something that would give people hope"; rather, she simply wrote freely and honestly.Original text from Oricon Style: "今回、正直にとか自由にっていうことはずっと頭の中にありましたね。だから、いいことを書 こうとか感動してもらおうとか、希望を持ってもらおうっていうようをことは一切意誠していなくて。単純に、ただ正直に書いていこうというだけでした。" As a result, the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career. She approached the composition of the music with the same freedom as the lyrics, with the album's notable rock overtones expressing her liking for rock music.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | title=Ayumi Hamasaki: Always our Princess| journal=Cawaii|date=January 1, 2005|pages=10–15|author=Tsuriya, Takako[/tpl] She was so pleased with the result that she declared My Story the first album she felt satisfied with. My Story and its singles, "Moments", "Inspire", and "Carols", all topped the weekly Oricon charts; moreover, with sales of over 1,100,000 units, My Story became Hamasaki's last million-selling studio album according to Oricon.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2004.html|title=Million-Selling Albums of 2004|publisher=RIAJ| accessdate=April 9, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080418094110/http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/2004.html| archivedate= April 18, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/051219_01_2.html|title=Yearly Album Rankings for 2005|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=December 1, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081215165044/http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/051219_01_2.html| archivedate= December 15, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] From January to April 2005, Hamasaki held the nationwide My Story arena tour, her first album-based tour. Also in January, she began working with Lamoureux Orchestra to create My Story Classical, a classical version of My Story; the album served as an "alter-ego" of the mostly aggressive My Story. The orchestra also created a classical version of "A Song Is Born", which was included on My Story Classical and which Hamasaki performed at the opening of the Expo 2005.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/050323_01.html|title=A Classical Version of Hamasaki Ayumi's My Story Is Released!|last=Igeta|first=Satoru|date=March 23, 2005|work=Oricon Style|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=November 3, 2009[/tpl]
(Miss)understood (January 2006), Hamasaki's seventh studio album, showed new musical directions. Wanting to sing a tune like those of the group Sweetbox, Hamasaki obtained the permission of Sweetbox composer Roberto "Geo" Rosan to use demo songs he had intended to use in Sweetbox's upcoming album.

In February 2011, it was announced that her arena tour of the year, Hotel Love Songs, would start in April.

On August 31, Hamasaki released her second mini album Five, her first since Memorial Address in 2003. This is her first album to have no singles released. Five topped the Oricon Charts for 2 consecutive weeks, her first to do so since (Miss)understood.

On March 21, Hamasaki released her thirteenth studio album, Party Queen. The album peaked at number two on the Oricon charts, becoming her second studio album to do so after 2007's Guilty.
Hamasaki released her sixth compilation album A Summer Best on August 6, 2012. It included two new songs which were digitally released for the promotion of the album: the TRF cover, Happening Here, and You & Me. It was later announced that Hamasaki would release five releases beginning on the eighth day of each month from November 2012 through to March 2013 to celebrate her 15th anniversary. The first release was her third mini-album, Love, the second was her fourth mini-album, again. The third release will a be an orchestral remix album titled A Classical while the fourth will be her 14th studio album Love Again. The fifth release was a DVD for the Arena Tour 2012: Hotel Love Songs. In December 2012, Hamasaki also performed three dates at the National Yoyogi First Gymnasium for her Countdown Live 2012-2013 A (Wake Up) tour.
On December 25, 2013, Hamasaki released "Feel the Love/Merry-go-round", her first physical single in three years. "Feel the Love" was composed by Tetsuya Komuro and produced by Dj Hello Kitty, while "Merry-go-round" was produced by M-Flo's Taku Takahashi and features rapper Verbal.[tpl]cite web|title=DJ Hello Kitty and Ayumi Hamasaki United at Last!|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2013-10-25/dj-hello-kitty-and-ayumi-hamasaki-united-at-last|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=25 December 2013[/tpl] Both songs are heavily influenced by Western dance-pop music. In early 2014, it was announced that new song "Hello New Me" would be used as theme song for a new season of Fuji TV drama Saigo Kara Nibanme no Koi, and another song entitled "Pray" would be used as theme song of the anime film Budda 2, Tezuka Osamu no Buddha: Owarinaki Tabi. Hamasaki's fifteenth studio album, still untitled, will be released on July 2, 2014. The album will feature internationally renowned producers, such as RedOne, Rodney Jerkins, Armin van Buuren and Fedde le Grand, making the first time in Hamasaki's career in which primarily Western producers were appointed to produce one of her studio albums.[tpl]cite web|title=Ayumi Hamasaki's New Challenge, the “Premium Showcase”|url=http://www.en.barks.jp/news/?id=1000004597|publisher=Barks|accessdate=23 April 2014|date=17 April 2014[/tpl]

==Image and artistry==

Time magazine has noted that Hamasaki lacked talents such as the dance moves of Namie Amuro, the "supermodel allure" of Hitomi, and the "vocal pyrotechnics" of Hikaru Utada. Her own fans even considered her high-pitched voice screechy. However, her music is sometimes considered one of the major forces in shaping Japan's current music trends; this has been attributed to her constantly changing image as well as her self-penned lyrics, though critics credit clever marketing strategies. Hamasaki is also noted for the visual aspects of her artistry: she is considered a fashion trendsetter, with her influence extending beyond Japan.[tpl]cite news| first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/2.html | title=The Many Faces of Ayu|work=Time| accessdate=May 3, 2008 | page=2 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080415191511/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/2.html  | archivedate=April 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/3.html | title=The Many Faces of Ayu|work=Time| accessdate=May 3, 2008 | page=3 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080415191516/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/photoessay/3.html  | archivedate=April 15, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last = Pan| first = Philip P.|work=Washington Post| title=Taiwan's Teens Take Style Cues From Tokyo| date=November 27, 2000[/tpl] The Guardian says that Hamasaki has "married accessible, mainstream hits with over-the-top costumes and high-concept videos".[tpl]cite news|last=Nieman|first=Teresa|title=Why Japanese Pop Matters|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/25/japanese-pop-women|accessdate=August 31, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 25, 2010[/tpl] The widespread influence of her music and her constantly changing image has meant that Hamasaki has often been compared to Madonna.[tpl]cite news| last=Hickey | first= David| url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20060622a1.html | title= The D.I.Y.

In 2002, however, Hamasaki's domestic sales began declining due to a sluggish Japanese market and increasing piracy in Japan. As a result, she began moving toward the Asian market in 2002, performing at the 2002 MTV Asia awards in Singapore, at South Korea's "Asia Song Festival", and at a concert in Beijing to celebrate Sino-Japanese relations.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5231327_ITM | title=Asian Stars to Shine in Seoul. | date=November 26, 2004 | publisher=Yonhap | accessdate=August 5, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] (Registration needed to view article)[tpl]cite news | archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/5ZrKnkRHv|archivedate=August 5, 2008|url=http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/233912 | title=Japan, China celebrate 30 years with gala concert | first=Sachie | last=Kanda | date=October 10, 2002 | publisher=Japan Today | accessdate=August 5, 2008[/tpl] With her popularity declining (due in part to the rising popularity of other singers like Kumi Koda), she made a foray into the Asian market, starting with her first tour of Asia in 2007.[tpl]cite news|title=She goes all out to charm Hong Kong|url=http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/show/story/0,4136,132975,00.html|work=The New Paper|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=June 12, 2007|accessdate=February 4, 2009|first=James|last=Kang|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070616060521/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/show/story/0,4136,132975,00.html|archivedate=June 16, 2007[/tpl]

===Musical style===

 In the beginning, I was searching for myself in my music. My music was for me. I didn't have the mental room to be conscious of the listener; I wrote to save myself. I didn't understand what it was to write songs. But over time I began to see many things, my influence, the responsibilities that gave me.   — Hamasaki on the new lyrical directions in I Am....  
Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own,
 have resonated among her fans, who praise them as being honest and heartfelt and "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/070228_01.html|title=A Thorough Analysis!

She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/english/ayu/#profile | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051217103237/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/english/ayu/#profile | archivedate=December 17, 2005 | title=Ayumi Hamasaki's Profile (Avex)| publisher=Avex Network| accessdate=March 23, 2008[/tpl] This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album Rainbow, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album A Song for ×× dealt mostly with themes of "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album Loveppears. Duty likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums I Am... and Rainbow, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women.[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal| title=Ayumi Hamasaki | journal=Sweet |date=January 2006|pages=18–20|author=Hayakawa, Kanako[/tpl] With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as "Talkin' 2 Myself" and "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" to encourage listeners; in "Rollin'" (from Next Level), Hamasaki writes, "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other".[tpl]cite news|last=Fuji|first=Miho|title=Ayumi Hamasaki 『NEXT LEVEL』|url=http://www.tokyoheadline.com/vol402/show01.html|accessdate=September 2, 2010|newspaper=Tokyo Headline[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for "Free & Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired "A Song Is Born".J-Point.

In addition to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in other aspects of production such as artistic direction. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really we should say 'Produced by Ayumi Hamasaki'."[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040820032901/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|archivedate=August 20, 2004|url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/beatfreak/142/artists/ayumi.html|title=Loveppears|last=Kazuki|first=Okabe|work=Beat Freak Online|publisher=Avex|accessdate=November 6, 2009[/tpl] Until her single "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for "M" that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbow's fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved in the composition of subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself.[tpl]cite video| people=Shubert, Atika (Interviewer) | medium=TV-series | publisher=CNN | location=Japan | title=TalkAsia |year=2006[/tpl] Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France,For a comprehensive list of Hamasaki's Avex-sanctioned remixes released in Japan, see Hamasaki's discography at mu-mo.net[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]. and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.avex.com.tw/4th/artist/artist.asp?aid=306871&aname=pcmo&main=1&cateid=2 | title=Artist profile of Princess China Music Orchestra | accessdate=May 2, 2008 | publisher=Avex Taiwan[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R&B, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.
Hamasaki is often involved in the artistic direction of her music videos. They are often artistic productions through which Hamasaki tries to convey the meaning or feeling of their respective songs. The themes of the videos are varied; she has made "sad and fragile" or "emotional" videos ("Momentum", "Endless Sorrow"), "refreshing" summer videos ("Blue Bird", "Fairyland"), surreal or "scary" videos ("1 Love", "Marionette"), and humorous videos ("Evolution", "Angel's Song", "Beautiful Fighters").[tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/080910_04.html| title=Ayumi Hamasaki 10th Anniversary Commemoration: Different Aspects of Her Charm!|publisher=Oricon|date=September 10, 2008|accessdate=October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081004174956/http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/special/080910_04.html| archivedate= October 4, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]ja icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal|title=Honey Trap|journal=S Cawaii|date=March 1, 2007|volume=8|pages=19–21|author=Takako Tsuriya|issue=32[/tpl] Additionally, many of the videos contain short storylines, some of which use symbolism to convey their respective messages. The video of "Voyage" depicts Hamasaki as a woman in a mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal Japan who was sacrificed to the moon; the video of "Endless Sorrow" features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law. In the video for "Free & Easy", Hamasaki portrayed a "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" to convey her message "freedom cannot be easily obtained; there is a price to pay for it" and to express her opposition to her marrying at the time;[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | url=http://et.21cn.com/star/fengbao/2002-06-04/687367.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111191103/http://et.21cn.com/star/fengbao/2002-06-04/687367.html |archivedate=November 11, 2007 |title=Hamasaki Ayumi's New MV Expresses Her Opposition to Marriage|date=June 4, 2002|work=21cn.com|publisher=China Telecom|accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl] the video for "Ourselves" featured masked people destroying "effigies of Hamasaki's past" such as photographs and album covers to symbolize destruction and rebirth.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/audio/2003-07/09/content_963295.htm|title=Hamasaki Ayumi's New Album, With a Grueling Performance and a Crocodile|date=July 9, 2003|work=XinhuaNet|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl][tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20031226/000005.htm|title=J-pop Guru Hamasaki Ayumi's Subversive, Avant-Garde Sense of Variety|publisher=Tencent|work=QQ.com|date=December 26, 2003|accessdate=August 25, 2009[/tpl] Additionally, the videos of "Fairyland", "My Name's Women", "Jewel", "Green", and "Virgin Road" are among the top twenty or so most expensive music videos, making Hamasaki the only non-American artist to hold such a distinction.[tpl]de icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | url=http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article836335/Die_teuersten_Musikvideos_aller_Zeiten.html | title=The Most Expensive Music Videos of All Time| publisher=Axel Springer AG| accessdate=November 6, 2009 | work=Die Welt| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091126054209/http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article836335/Die_teuersten_Musikvideos_aller_Zeiten.html| archivedate= November 26, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last=Hurley | first= James| url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=3917826&imageindex=7 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080524060616/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=3917826&imageindex=7 |archivedate=March 24, 2008 | title=Ayumi Hamasaki – "fairyland"| publisher= MSN | accessdate=January 24, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last=Hurley | first= James | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822082000/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=3917826 |archivedate=August 22, 2008 | title= The Most Expensive Music Videos Ever Made|publisher=MSN|url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=3917826[/tpl] Hamasaki is also involved in the production and artistic direction of her live performances; they, like her videos, are often lavish productions and use a variety of props, extravagant costumes, and choreographed dances.
