The Musée national Gustave Moreau is an art museum dedicated to the works of Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826-1898). It is located in the IXe arrondissement at 14, rue de la Rochefoucauld, Paris, France. 
The museum was originally Moreau's dwelling, transformed by his 1895 decision into a studio and museum of his work with his apartment remaining on the first floor. Today the museum contains Moreau's drawings, paintings, watercolors, and sculptures.
