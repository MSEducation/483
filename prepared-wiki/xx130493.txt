Thomas Hine & Co. is a leading manufacturer of cognac, owned by the French company EDV SAS.

==Origins==

The Hine company is named for its proprietor Thomas Hine (sometimes recorded as Thomas Hone), an Englishman from Dorset, England. Following his arrest during the French Revolution, Thomas Hine married a young maiden, Françoise Elisabeth, whose father owned a cognac house in Jarnac. Hine took the company to new heights, and eventually renamed it Thomas Hine & C°. in 1817.

==The House==

The Hine House has stood on the banks of the Charente River in Jarnac, France for over 250 years. It is one of the oldest houses in Jarnac and serves as the company's headquarters.
In 1962, the house was granted a royal warrant from HRH Queen Elizabeth II, as suppliers of cognac. Today it is still the only cognac house to hold this honour.

==Hine cognacs==

HINE has a reputation as specialist in vintage cognacs. Over the centuries, HINE has built up significant stocks of Grande Champagne cognacs from the finest years. These reserves, and the traditional skills passed on from generation to generation, enable the HINE Cellar Master to create rich, complex blends.
HINE selects its cognacs exclusively from the Grande and Petite Champagne crus. Family tradition decrees that these special cognacs are aged far longer than the legal requirement.
