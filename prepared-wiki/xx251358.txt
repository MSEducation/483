==University of Michigan==

In 1904, Magoffin transferred to the University of Michigan, began playing on the freshman team, but played in several games for the varsity team, though he was not awarded a varsity letter for the 1904 season.  He became a starter at left halfback for the 1905 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 12–1 record and outscored its opponents by a combined total of 495 to 2.[tpl]cite web|title=1905 Football Team|publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1905fbt.htm[/tpl]  He continued as a starter at left halfback on the 1906[tpl]cite web|title=1906 Football Team|publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1906fbt.htm[/tpl] and 1907 Michigan teams.[tpl]cite web|title=1907 Football Team|publisher=Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1907fbt.htm[/tpl]   The Michigan Alumnus in January 1907 described Magoffin's contributions as follows: "Magoffin has shown himself to be a remarkably fast and untiring player on both offense and defense, although slow in rounding into physical shape, owing to his later return to the University.  He did his greatest work in the Pennsylvania contest, fighting gamely and stubbornly to the end.  His repeated fierce tackling of Hollenbeck for losses was one of the redeeming features of that game for the Michigan spectators." 
On November 3, 1907, Magoffin became the first player to catch a forward pass for a touchdown in a Michigan – Ohio State game, a 25-yard pass from quarterback Billy Wasmund.[tpl]cite book|author=Jack Park|title=The Official Ohio State Football Encyclopedia|page=40|year=2003|publisher=Sports Publishing|isbn=1-58261-702-3[/tpl]  Magoffin scored five times during Michigan's 46–0 victory over Ohio State in 1907.[tpl]cite book|author=Todd Mishler|title=Blood, Sweat, and Cheers: Great Football Rivalries of The Big Ten|page=111|publisher=Trails Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-931599-95-5[/tpl]  The 1907 team captained by Magoffin won its first five games without allowing a point to be scored.  The Wolverines lost the final game of the season to Penn by a score of 6–0, though Coach Yost complained loudly that Michigan had been robbed of touchdown in the game.  They disputed play was a 35-yard touchdown pass to Magoffin that was disallowed by the referee.  Yost said of the play, "In order to reach Magoffin,  thirty-five yards ahead, the ball must have gone from Allerdice over the line of scrimmage at least fifteen yards to the left of where it was put in play. I know that, after having worked with that play for two years, and I was not taking any chances with it. Magoffin's touchdown was as legal as any play I ever saw on a football field."[tpl]cite news|title=YOST CLAIMS HIS TEAM WAS ROBBED|newspaper=The La Crosse Tribune|date=1907-11-20[/tpl]
