Thomas McGauley is an Irish footballer currently playing for Athlone Town A.F.C. in the first division. Thomas is a defender who has spent the most part of his career at Home Farm, a club which later became Dublin City. Thomas was at Whitehall from the age of 18 until he was almost 27. During that time, he made almost 200 appearances and scored 20 goals for the club, and helped them to the First Division crown in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/irish/4602838.stm|title=Defender McGauley moves to Armagh|date=11 January 2006|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl] His first season with Home Farm was spent in the Premier League back in 96/97 where he made six appearances before the club were relegated. They spent the next seven seasons in the second tier and Thomas helped them to as high as third in
2002 before they eventually claimed the title and promotion under John Gill a year later. Armagh City came calling and Thomas spent a year at the Irish League club but only lined out 11 times before joining Monaghan United in July 2006. That was a spell that included a ‘Man of the Match’ performance against Dundalk in November, when he helped to inflict a 1-0 defeat on the Lilywhites that would eventually see them lose out on the First Division crown.
He joined Dundalk F.C. from Monaghan United F.C. in January 2007 signed by John Gill. He was released at the end of the season by Dundalk.
