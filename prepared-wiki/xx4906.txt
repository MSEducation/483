The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), on lowercase letters: iupac, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|juː|p|æ|k[/tpl] [tpl]respell|EYE|ew-pak[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|p|æ|k[/tpl] [tpl]respell|EW|pak[/tpl]) is an international federation of National Adhering Organizations that represents chemists in individual countries. It is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/nao |title=IUPAC National Adhering Organizations |publisher=Iupac.org |date=2 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl] The international headquarters of IUPAC is located in Zürich, Switzerland.

IUPAC was established in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities.IUPAC Committees list retrieved 15 April 2010 These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature,Interdivisional Committee on Terminology web page retrieved 15 April 2010 finding ways to bring chemistry to the world,Chemdrawn retrieved 15 April 2010 and publishing works.Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board web page retrieved 15 April 2010[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/web/ins/013 |title=Project Committee web page |publisher=Iupac.org |date=2 June 2011 |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl]Evaluation Committee page retrieved 15 April 2010

==Creation and history==

thumb|upright|alt=A black and white image of a bald man in a dark outfit, with a bushy white beard and moustache|Friedrich August Kekulé von StradonitzThe need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. The IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, making it one of the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature.[tpl]Cite book|last= Brown |first= Theodore L. |coauthors= H. Eugene LeMay Jr, Bruce E Bursten |title= Chemistry The Central Science Tenth Edition |publisher= Pearson Books |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-13-109686-9[/tpl] IUPAC as such was established in 1919.International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry: About. IUPAC. Retrieved on 2013-07-29. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC was Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the allied powers after World War I.[tpl]Cite book|last= Kaderas |first= Brigitte |title= Wissenschaften und Wissenschaftspolitik: Bestandsaufnahmen zu Formationen, Brüchen und Kontinuitäten im Deutschland des 20. Jahrhunderts|language=German |publisher= Franz Steiner Verlag |year= 2002 |isbn= 3-515-08111-9[/tpl] Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.
During World War II, IUPAC was affiliated with the Allied powers, but had little involvement during the war effort itself. After the war, West Germany was allowed back into IUPAC. Since World War II, IUPAC has been focused on standardizing nomenclature and methods in science without interruption.

==Committees and governance==

IUPAC is governed by several committees that all have different responsibilities. The committees are as follows: Bureau, CHEMRAWN (Chem Research Applied to World Needs) Committee, Committee on Chemistry Education, Committee on Chemistry and Industry, Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications, Evaluation Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols, Project Committee, Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board. Each committee is made from members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries.IUPAC National Adhering Organizations retrieved 15 April 2010

==Nomenclature==

The IUPAC committee has a long history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds as mentioned in the Creation and History section. IUPAC nomenclature is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standard rules to avoid repeat names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry,IUPAC Publications List retrieved 15 April 2010 is on IUPAC nomenclature of organic compounds can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (1900).

===Organic nomenclature===

IUPAC organic nomenclature has three basic parts: the substituents, carbon chain length and chemical ending. The substituents are any functional groups attached to the main carbon chain. The main carbon chain is the longest possible continuous chain. The chemical ending denotes what type of molecule it is. For example, the ending "ane" denotes a single bonded carbon chain, as in "hexane" ([tpl]chem|C|6|H|14[/tpl]).[tpl]Cite book|last= Klein |first= David R. |title= Organic Chemistry I As a Second Language: Translating the Basic Concepts Second Edition |publisher= John Wiley & Sons Inc. |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0-470-12929-6[/tpl]
Another example of IUPAC organic nomenclature is cyclohexanol:

===Inorganic nomenclature===

Basic IUPAC inorganic nomenclature has two main parts: the cation and the anion. The cation is the name for the positively charged ion and the anion is the name for the negatively charged ion.
An example of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is potassium chlorate (KClO3):

==Amino acid and nucleotide base codes==

IUPAC also has a system for giving codes to identify amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find homologies.Amino Acid Codes retrieved 15 April 2010 These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code. For example:
These codes make it easier and shorter to write down the amino acid sequences that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases are made up of purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.Amino Acid and Nucleotide Base Codes retrieved 15 April 2010

==Publications==

===Non-series books===

===Experimental Thermodynamics book series===

The Experimental Thermodynamics books series covers many topics in the fields of thermodynamics.

===Series of books on analytical and physical chemistry of environmental systems===

===Colored cover book and website series (nomenclature)===

IUPAC color codes their books in order to make each publication distinguishable.

==International Year of Chemistry==

IUPAC and UNESCO are the lead organizations coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, which took place in 2011.United Nations Resolution 63/209: International Year of Chemistry. 3 February 2009. Retrieved on 24 April 2010.About IYC: Introduction. 9 July 2009. Retrieved on 24 April 2010. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the General Assembly in Turin, Italy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/membership/acs/getinvolved/CNBP_021696 |title=International Year of Chemistry Prospectus |publisher=Portal.acs.org |accessdate=8 June 2011[/tpl] This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008.International Year of Chemistry Prospectus retrieved 15 April 2010 The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry is to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.
