Cello was an early  graphical web browser for Windows 3.1, developed by Thomas R. Bruce of the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School, and released as shareware in 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Clients.html|title=World Wide Web Clients |last=Sendall |first=Mike |date=29 March 1995|publisher=W3C|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Cello Internet Browser|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/cello/|date=9 April 1994|accessdate=28 March 2010|publisher=Cornell Law School|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204115016/http://www.law.cornell.edu/cello/|archivedate=4 February 2005[/tpl] While other browsers ran on various Unix machines, Cello  was the first web browser for Microsoft Windows, using the winsock system to access the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/web_browsers|title=Surfing Since 1991: The Evolution of Web Browsers|last= Lilly |first=Paul|date=08/19/09|publisher=MaximumPC|page=2|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/mmedia/handbook/hndbk3.htm|title=3 World-Wide Web Browsers|last=Kelly|first=Brian |work=Running a WWW service|publisher=Computing Service, University of Leeds|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/lii.html|title=The Legal Information Institute - A Quick Overview |publisher=Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Ron|first=Gustavson|date=August 1996|title=Browsing at large|journal=CD-ROM Professional|volume= 9 |issue= 8|pages=p38, 3p|issn=10490833[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Notess|first= Greg R.|date=Mar/Apr95|title=COMPARING WEB BROWSERS: MOSAIC, CELLO, NETSCAPE, WINWEB AND INTERNETWORKS LITE |journal=Online|publisher=Academic Search Premier|volume= 19|issue= 2|pages=p36, 4p|issn=01465422[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/geekend/?p=1248|title=Geek Trivia: Clear browser history|last=Garmon |first=Jay|date=15 April 2008|work=Geekend|publisher=TechRepublic|page=2|accessdate=28 March 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/7ZYYo|archivedate=3 January 2013[/tpl] In addition to the basic Windows, Cello worked on Windows NT 3.5[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wi-inf.uni-essen.de/~schwarze/nt/pppengl.htm|title=NT and NTAS INTERNET SLIP/PPP CONNECTIVITY FAQ|publisher=University Duisburg-Essen|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antionline.com/showthread.php?t=250711|title=Newbie Security Questions|last=Christopher|first=Klaus|date=8/4/97, reposted at 28 December 2003|publisher=Antionline Forums|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] and with small modifications on OS/2.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.os2bbs.com/Download/dos.html|title=Norloffs OS/2BBS.com|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Norloff Computer Corp.|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl]
Cello was created because of a demand for Web access by lawyers, who were more likely to use Microsoft Windows than the Unix operating systems supporting earlier Web browsers, including the first release of  Mosaic. The lack of a Windows browser meant many legal experts were unable to access legal information made available in hypertext on the World Wide Web.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_browse.htm|title=Web Browser History|publisher=Living Internet|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] Cello was popular during 1993/1994, but fell out of favor following the release of Mosaic for Windows and Netscape, after which Cello development was abandoned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webtips.dan.info/brand-x/a-g.html|title="Brand-X" Browsers -- Alphabetical List: A-G|last=Tobias|first=Daniel R. |date= 23 December 2009|work=Dan's Web Tips|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://faeriekeeper.net/criteria11.htm|title=A Future of Browsers|year=2010|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author1=Laurence A.

==Development and history==

The development of Cello started in 1992, with beta versions planned for June 1993 and a release for July 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/News/9305.html|title=May World-Wide Web News|work=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|author=Steve Sheppard|title=The history of legal education in the United States: commentaries and primary sources|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XQgrjw9qiqcC&pg=PA1186|accessdate=28 March 2010|date=April 2007|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-690-1|page=1186[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://1997.webhistory.org/historyday/abstracts.html|title=WEB HISTORY DAY:  PIONEERING SOFTWARE AND SITES|publisher=The World Wide Web History Project|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] It was publicly announced on 12 April 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0048.html|title=Plans for cello MS-Windows client|last=Bruce|first=Thomas R.|date=12 April 1993|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl]
The Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School created the first law site on the
Internet in 1992 and the first legal website in 1993. However, at the time, there were no web browsers for the Microsoft Windows operating system, which was used by most lawyers. Thus, to allow lawyers to use their website, the Legal Information Institute developed the first Windows-based Web browser.[tpl]Cite book|author=Robert J.

It is also stated in the "Notices, Acknowledgments, Disclaimers" section of the included .hlp file in Cello.
Although other browsers at the time were based on CERN's WWW libraries called libwww, PCs of the time were not powerful enough to run the UNIX-oriented code. As a result, Thomas Bruce had to rewrite most of the WWW libraries to work on Microsoft Windows. It should also be noted that unlike most commercial browsers at that time, Cello didn't utilize any of Mosaic's source code and thus had a different look and feel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/40608/36143348.pdf|title=Scheme for Identifying and Describing Behavioral Innovation Embodied in Computer Programs|last=Shang-Chul Pak|first=Sean|date=17 May 1996|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|pages=146–147|accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Vaughan-Nichols|first=Steven J.|title=Inside the World Wide Web|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3IMV7TgH-igC|accessdate=4 June 2010|date=September 1995|publisher=New Riders Pub.|isbn=978-1-56205-412-0|pages=186-187[/tpl]

On 15 August 1995, Microsoft debuted its own web browser Internet Explorer 1 for Windows 95. While it did not ship with the original release of Windows 95, it shipped with Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95.

==Usage==

When released in 1993, Cello was the only browser for the Microsoft Windows platform. Shortly after launch, Cello was being downloaded at a rate of 500 copies per day.[tpl]Cite book|author1=James Gillies|author2=R.

In 1994, most websites were visited using either the Cello browser or the Mosaic browser.[tpl]Cite book| last = Kasser | first = Barbara | title = Practical Internet | publisher = Knopf Books for Young Readers | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7897-2226-3 |page=19[/tpl] Despite having fewer features than Mosaic, Cello continued to be used due to its simpler interface and lower system requirements.Winsock Client Software Reviews.

==Criticism==

Cello was not very stable and its development halted early.
Cello did not render graphics well and required that the user reload the webpage when resizing the window. Like most browsers at the time, Cello also did not support any web security protocols. It was also said that Cello rendered html "crudely" and pages would appear jaggedly.[tpl]cite web|title=Reviews - Cello|last=Reichard|first=Kevin|url=http://www.cnet.com/Content/Reviews/Compare/Browsers/cello.html|publisher=CNET|accessdate=15 June 2010|date=20 December 1995|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970212040520/http://www.cnet.com/Content/Reviews/Compare/Browsers/cello.html|archivedate=12 February 1997[/tpl]
