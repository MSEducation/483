[[Staffordiidae]]

CATEGORIES: Staffordiidae

Staffordiidae is a family of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Staffordioidea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Staffordiidae is the only family in the superamily Staffordioidea. This family has no subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
Staffordiidae is a poorly known family, because it occurs only in the Dafla Hills area of India. The fauna and flora of that area is very insufficiently known in general.
Various sources consider the family Staffordiidae as part of DyakiidaeBarker G. M. (2001) Gastropods on Land: Phylogeny, Diversity and Adaptive Morphology. 1-146. In: Barker G. M. (ed.) (2001) The biology of terrestrial molluscs. CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, cited pages: 139-144. ISBN 0-85199-318-4. or Ariophantidae/Dyakiinae.

==Distribution==

The distribution of the Staffordiidae includes only India in the Dafla Hills.
This area is close to northern margin of the Indian plate. The historical area of origin of the Staffordiidae is not surely known, because the possible coastal area in southern Asia is considered to have become uninhabitable after the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate collided 50 and 55 million years ago. The original ancestral area of limacoid families is thought to be the Palaearctic region and south-eastern Asia. Thus it has been hypothetized that the Staffordiidae colonized its current area from the southern margin of the Asian part of the Eurasian Plate during the Oligocene.

==Genera==

Genera within the family Staffordiidae include:
The generic name Staffordia is in honor of Brigadier-General Stafford,[tpl]Who|date=September 2010[/tpl] who was in command of the punitive force which entered the Dafla Hills for the first time in the winter of 1874-1875.
The foot of Staffordia is pointed. The peripodial margin is simple with a narrow pale margin.  There are small right and left shell-lobes.
Reproductive system of Staffordia: the dart-sac is small, globose, with a long cord-like attachment to a coronal gland. The penis is simple. The spermatheca is long.
The radula of Staffordia has aculeate lateral teeth.

Staffordiidae is considered as sister group of all other families in the limacoid clade.
