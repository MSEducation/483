Ireland (locally: [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|r|l|ə|n|d[/tpl]; RP: [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ə|l|ə|n|d[/tpl]; GA: [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Ireland.ogg|ˈ|aɪər|l|ə|n|d[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ga|Éire[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ga|ˈeːɾʲə||Eire_pronunciation.ogg[/tpl]; Ulster-Scots: [tpl]lang|sco|Airlann[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|sco|Airlan[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-sco|ˈɑːrlən|[/tpl]) is an island in the North Atlantic to the west of Great Britain, from which it is separated by the North Channel, the Irish Sea and St Georges Channel, and after which it is the largest island of the British Isles archipelago. It is the third-largest island in Europe and the twentieth-largest island on Earth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://islands.unep.ch/Tiarea.htm|title=Islands by Area|date=18 February 1998|work=UN System-Wide Earthwatch|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=2008-08-30[/tpl]
Politically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland, which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, which covers the remaining area and is located in the north-east of the island. The population of Ireland is about 6.4 million. Just under 4.6 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.[ref]The 2011 population of the Republic of Ireland was 4,588,252 and that of Northern Ireland in 2011 was 1,810,863. These are Census data from the official governmental statistics agencies in the respective jurisdictions:
The island's geography comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate, which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of 2013, the amount of land that is wooded in Ireland is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/total-forest-area-by-country |title=Total forest coverage by country |author=Brown, Felicity |publisher=The Guardian |date=2 September 2009 |work=Environment Data |accessdate=24 October 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/media/00061_EPA_SoE12_Chp07.pdf |title=EPA, Land Use Cover |publisher=Epa.ie |accessdate=2013-05-07[/tpl] There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland.
Prehistoric Ireland saw the arrival of humans after 8000 BC. Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century and lasted until the early 17th century. The island was converted to Christianity from the 5th century onward. Following the Norman invasion in the 12th century, England claimed sovereignty over Ireland. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest. This led to colonization of Ireland by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. In 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement in 1998. In 1973, both parts of Ireland joined the European Economic Community.
Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the fields of literature and, to a lesser degree, science and education. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed for example through Gaelic games, Irish music, and the Irish language. The culture of the island has also many features shared with Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing and  golf.

==History==

===Prehistoric Ireland===

During the last glacial period, and up until about 9000 years ago, most of Ireland was covered with ice. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 12,000 BC, rising sea levels due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain. Later, around 5600 BC, Great Britain itself became separated from continental Europe.Edwards, Robin & al. "The Island of Ireland: Drowning the Myth of an Irish Land-bridge?" Accessed 15 February 2013. There is no evidence of any humans being in Ireland before Mesolithic people arrived by boat from Britain between 8000 BC and 7000 BC.[tpl]citation|title=Tort Law in Ireland|last1=Ward|first1=Paul Ward|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2010|quote=Historically, 7000 BC can be identified as the earliest date when settlers from Britain arrived in Ireland. By 3000 BC, Stone Age or Neolithic people arrived and their stone monuments are evident today across the landscape. In 2000 BC, Bronze-Age metalworkers arrived in Ireland|page=12[/tpl]
From about 4500 BC Neolithic settlers arrived introducing cereal cultivars, a housing culture (similar to those of the same period in Scotland) and stone monuments. A more advanced agriculture was to develop. At the Céide Fields, preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day County Mayo, is an extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/West/CeideFields/ |title=Céide Fields |author=Heritage Ireland |publisher=Office of Public Works|accessdate=2008-10-23[/tpl] dating from not long after this period. Consisting of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls, the fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops imported from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and part of France).
The Bronze Age – defined by the use of metal – began around 2500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing oxen, weaving textiles, brewing alcohol, and skillful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf|title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last = Koch|first = John|title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher = Palaeohispanica|year = 2009|pages = 339–351|url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf|issn = 1578-5386|accessdate = 2010-05-17[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Rethinking the Bronze Age and the Arrival of Indo-European in Atlantic Europe|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/pdfs/books/Celtic%20West%20conf.pdf|publisher=University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford|accessdate=24 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009, pp. 55–64|year=2008| publisher=The Prehistoric Society|page=61[/tpl] This constrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.

====Emergence of Celtic Ireland====

During the Iron Age, a Celtic language and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland.
The long standing traditional view, once widely accepted, is that Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the Lebor Gabála Érenn, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni were said to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.The Celts: A History By Dáithí Ó hÓgáin It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.Early Peoples of Britain and Ireland: A-G Christopher Allen Snyder"A History of Ireland: From the Earliest Times to 1922" By Edmund Curtis
Another more recent theory put forth that has gained archaeological historian credence is that of cultural diffusion of the Celtic culture and language into Ireland. It is proposed that Celticisation of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland and Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.
The theory was put forth partly due to a current lack of archeological evidence for the large-scale Celtic immigration element in this period although it is accepted that these type of movements are notoriously difficult to identify. However many archeological proponents of this alternate theory hold that migration of smaller groups of Celts to Ireland was most likely and that the degree of traffic may have been sufficiently regular to constitute a "migration stream" but that invasion is not at the heart of the proposed social process of Insular Celticisation.  Historical linguists are sceptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of the Celtic language and a number state that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdfhttp://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf Genetic linage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no large significant differences in mtDNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European “Atlantic Celts” showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182057/

===Late antiquity and early medieval times===

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (Little Britain), in contrast to the larger island, which he called Megale Brettania (Great Britain).[tpl]Cite book|last=Freeman |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&pg=PA65 |isbn=0-292-72518-3[/tpl] In his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iouernia and to Great Britain as Albion. These "new" names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.[tpl]Cite book|first=Philip|last=Freeman|title=Ireland and the Classical World|publisher=University of TexasPress|location=Austin|year=2001[/tpl]
The Romans would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, Hibernia,[tpl]cite web|title = Hibernia|work = Roman Empire|publisher = United Nations of Roma Victrix|url = http://www.unrv.com/provinces/hibernia.php|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl] or Scotia.[tpl]Cite book|last=O'Hart |first=John |title=Irish Pedigrees: or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation |publisher=J.

However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.Carson, R.A.G. and O'Kelly, Claire: A catalogue of the Roman coins from Newgrange, Co. Meath and notes on the coins and related finds, pages 35–55. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, volume 77, section C
Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century AD, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.Dáibhí Ó Cróinín, "Ireland, 400–800", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín (ed.), A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.
The High King was said to preside over the provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland. All of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King. The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept only became a political reality in the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Jaski |first=Bart |year=2005 |title=Kings and kingship |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on Continental Europe after the fall of Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.
From the 9th century, waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns.[tpl]cite web|last=Ó Corráin |first=Donnchadh |authorlink=Donnchadh Ó Corráin |title=Vikings & Ireland |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/General%20Vikings%20in%20Ireland.pdf |accessdate=2010-03-19 |postscript=[/tpl] These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep-seated in Ireland. The Vikings also were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, and also Carlingford, Strangford, Annagassan, Arklow, Youghal, Lough Foyle and Lough Ree.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/ire800.htm |title=Ireland's History in Maps (800 AD) |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=6 December 1998 |accessdate=2011-08-15[/tpl]

===Norman and English invasions===

On 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights with an army of about six hundred landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. It was led by Richard de Clare, called Strongbow due to his prowess as an archer.[tpl]Cite news|last = Chrisafis|first = Angelique|title = Scion of traitors and warlords: why Bush is coy about his Irish links|work = World News|publisher = The Guardian|date = 25 January 2005|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis|accessdate = 2008-11-08|location=London[/tpl] The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, the king of Leinster.[tpl]cite book | first = Charles| last = Previté-Orton | title = The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1975| page = 810 | isbn=978-0-521-09977-6[/tpl]
In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France, following a war involving Tighearnán Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin king, Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.
The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the Papal Bull Laudabiliter, issued by Adrian IV in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system.[tpl]Cite book|last=Curtis|first=Edmund|title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2002|page=49|isbn=0-415-27949-6[/tpl] Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152.[tpl]cite book | first = Ruth et al| last = Edwards| title = An Atlas of Irish History| publisher = Routledge| year = 2005| page = 106 | isbn=978-0-415-33952-0[/tpl] There has been significant controversy regarding authenticity of Laudabiliter,[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Ó Clabaigh|first=Colmán N. |year=2005 |title=Papacy |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called Peter's Pence, is still extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.
Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.
From the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |year=1998 |work=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-09 [/tpl]
By the end of the 15th century central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.

===The Kingdom of Ireland===

The title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule of law was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years' War and the Flight of the Earls.
This control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of the Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging penal laws Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.[tpl]cite web|title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url=http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |accessdate=2009-01-23[/tpl] The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.
An extraordinary climatic shock known as the "Great Frost" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.[tpl]Cite book|first=David|last=Dickson|title=Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41|publisher=White Row Press Ltd |location=Belfast |year=1997|isbn=978-1-870132-85-5[/tpl] This resulted in the famine of 1740.

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.
In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |year=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=0-8132-0784-3[/tpl]

===Union with Great Britain===

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, Ireland became part of an extended United Kingdom, ruled directly by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet's failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.
Aside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |title=Ireland AD 1750–1900 The Industrial Age |publisher=worldtimelines.org.uk |accessdate=2010-03-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226180112/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |archivedate=9 September 2011 [/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&pg=PA314&dq=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&cd=1#v=onepage&q=ireland%20failed%20to%20industrialize%20due%20to%20lack%20of%20coal%20and%20iron|first=Cormac|last=O'Grada|title=Ireland: A New Economic History, 1780–1939|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|pages=314–330|isbn=978-0-19-820598-2[/tpl] and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,[tpl]Cite book|title=Culture and Capitalism in Contemporary Ireland|first1=Paul|last1=Keating|first2=Derry|last2=Desmond|publisher=Avebury|place=Hants, UK|year=1993|isbn=1-85628-362-3|page=119[/tpl] which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.[tpl]Cite journal|first=John|last=Jacobsen|title=Chasing Progress in the Irish Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1994|page=47[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|first=Joel|last=Mokyr|title=Why Ireland Starved: A Quantitative and Analytical History of the Irish Economy, 1800–1850|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Oxon|year=1983|page=152[/tpl]
The Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million Irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it.[tpl]cite web|title = The Irish Potato Famine|publisher = Digital History|date = 7 November 2008|url = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/irish_potato_famine.cfm|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl] By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland.  The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/1841-a-window-on-victorian-britain-475516.html |title=1841: A window on Victorian Britain—This Britain |publisher=The Independent |date=25 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-16 |last=Vallely |first=Paul|location=London[/tpl] The population has never returned to this level since.[tpl]Cite news|last = Quinn| first = Eamon|title = Ireland Learns to Adapt to a Population Growth Spurt|work = Europe|publisher = New York Times|date = 19 August 2007|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/world/europe/19ireland.html?ex=1345176000&en=ab2b49203b6fb511&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl] The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.
The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism, primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O'Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George's father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701.
Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "Home Rule". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.[tpl]Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 376–400|isbn = 0-297-17987-X[/tpl] After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Edward Carson.[tpl]Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 478–530| isbn = 0-297-17987-X[/tpl]
Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers, whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the First World War. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under John Redmond, took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name, and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.
The failed Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group in alliance with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Morough|first=Michael|title=History Review |date=December 2000 |pages=34–36[/tpl]
The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).
In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British Government and representatives of the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken.[tpl]Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 719–748 |isbn = 0-297-17987-X[/tpl] Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent civil war between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=Stephen|title=Ireland Since the Treaty|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=12|issue=2|date=January 1934|page=322[/tpl]

===Partition===

====Independent Ireland====

During its first decade the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.
The state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite being neutral, approximately 50,000[tpl]Cite news|last = Connolly|first = Kevin|title = Irish who fought on the beaches|work = Northern Ireland News|publisher = BBC|date = 1 June 2004|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3749629.stm|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl] volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses.
German Intelligence was also active in Ireland.Hull, Mark: "The Irish Interlude: German Intelligence in Ireland, 1939–1943", Journal of Military History, Vol. 66, No. 3 (July 2002), pp695–717 German intelligence operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests on the basis of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Ireland, including that of the United States. To the authorities counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side of the conflict.[tpl]Cite book|last=Carroll |first=Joseph T. |title=Ireland in the War Years 1939–1945 |publisher=International Scholars Publishers |year=2002 |location=San Francisco |page=190 |isbn=978-1-57309-185-5[/tpl]
Large-scale emigration marked the 1950s and 1980s, but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger.[tpl]Cite book|last =Clancy|first =Patrick|coauthors= Sheelagh Drudy, Kathleen Lynch, Liam O'Dowd| title =Irish Society: Sociological Perspectives |pages= 68–70| publisher =Institute of Public Administration|year =1997|isbn=1-872002-87-0[/tpl] The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999,[tpl]Cite book|first=Doris|last=Schmied|title=Winning and Losing: the Changing Geography of Europe's Rural Areas|publisher=Ashgate|location=Chippenham, UK|year=2005|page=234|isbn=0-7546-4101-5[/tpl] in which year the Republic joined the euro.

Social changes followed quickly on the heels of economic prosperity, ranging from the 'modernisation' of the annual parade in Dublin to mark the principal national holiday of Saint Patrick's Day (17 March), to the decline in authority of the Catholic Church. The financial crisis that began in 2008, dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).[tpl]Cite journal|first=Shawn|last=Pogatchnik|title=Ireland's Economy Suffered Record Slump in 2009|publisher=Business Week|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=2010-04-06|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm[/tpl] The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.Central Statistical Office bulletin, April 2012

====Northern Ireland====

Northern Ireland was created as a division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and until 1972 it was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south. One, James Joseph Magennis, received the Victoria Cross for valour.
Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland (elected by "first-past-the-post" from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fueled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.[tpl]cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm|title = 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968?' by John Whyte|accessdate = 2008-10-23|last = Whyte|first = John|work = Contemporary Irish Studies|publisher = Conflict Archive on the Internet[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm|title = Fair Employment in Northern Ireland|accessdate = 2008-10-23|publisher = Northern Ireland Office[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm|title = "We Shall Overcome" ...

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter-protests.[tpl]Cite book|last=Taylor|first= Peter |year=1997|title=Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin|pages=33–56|location=London|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|isbn= 0-7475-3392-X[/tpl] The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists.

In 1969, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".
Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2010-01-04 |date=8 October 1999[/tpl] Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.
The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Brigadier Tauno |last=Nieminen |coauthors=General John de Chastelain, Andrew D. Sens|title=Independent International Commission on Decommissioning |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-15[/tpl]
The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and began withdrawing troops.
On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolizing reconciliation between the two sides.

==Politics==

Politically, the island is divided between Ireland (a sovereign state also called the Republic of Ireland) and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the United Kingdom). They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area.
Both Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union, and as a consequence there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border.

===Republic of Ireland===

The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminister model with a written constitution and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The  Government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the President on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the Dáil. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the Seanad. Its capital is Dublin.
Ireland today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita[tpl]cite web |title=Country Comparison: GDP – per capita (PPP) |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Ireland&countryCode=ei&regionCode=eur&rank=27#ei |work=World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=29 August 2011[/tpl] and in 2011 was ranked the seventh most developed nation in the world by the United Nations' Human Development Index.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf |title=Table 1 |author=United Nations |year=2011 |work=Human Development Index and its components |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |accessdate=26 November 2011[/tpl] A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the Celtic Tiger period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented financial crisis and and economic depression in 2009.

===Northern Ireland===

Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy-first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is Belfast.
Ultimately political power is held by the UK government, from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK House of Commons' 650 MPs. The Northern Ireland Secretary is a cabinet level post in the British government. 
Along with England and Wales and Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as their court of final appeal.

===All-island institutions===

As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish government agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation.
The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island "implementation bodies" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.
The British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matter of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of Ireland's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, "regular and frequent" meetings co-chaired by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved all-Ireland issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.
The North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.

==Economy==

Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-island basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an "all-island economy" to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf| archivedate=9 November 2008|url=http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf| year= 2006|title=National Competitiveness Council Submission on the National Development Plan 2007–2013|publisher= National Competitiveness Council|accessdate=2008-11-07[/tpl]

===Energy===

Ireland has an ancient industry based on peat (known locally as "sod" or "turf") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of biomass energy, this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas. In cities, heat is generally supplied by heating oil, although some urban suppliers distribute "sods of turf" as "smokeless fuel."
An area in which the island operates as a single market is electricity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |title=About SEMO: The Single Electricity Market |publisher=SEMO, Single Electricity Market Operator |accessdate=2011-01-13 [/tpl] For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |title=Interconnection |publisher=Commission for Energy regulation |accessdate=2010-03-30[/tpl] and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.[tpl]cite web|work=East-West Interconnector |url=http://www.eirgridprojects.com/projects/east-westinterconnector/projectactivity/ |title=Project Activity |date=16 September 2009 |publisher=EirGrid |accessdate=2009-09-29[/tpl]

The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.
Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.[tpl]cite web|title =Options For Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets And Programmes issued by Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|publisher =Hibernian Wind Power Ltd|date =27 February 2004|url =http://www.hibernianwindpower.ie/hiberwindresponse_dcmnr.pdf|accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl]

==Geography==

The island of Ireland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. It is separated from the neighbouring island of Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of [tpl]convert|23|km[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title=Across the waters |last1=Ritchie |first1=Heather |last2=Ellis |first2=Geraint |year=2009 |url=http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/atw_north_channel.pdf[/tpl] at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of [tpl]convert|84421|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.osi.ie/Education/Secondary-Schools/Teacher-Resources/Area-and-Land-Mass.aspx|title=Area and Land Mass|work=Ordnance Survey of Ireland|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term British Isles is controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is often used as a neutral term for the islands.
A ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil ([tpl]lang-ga|Corrán Tuathail[/tpl]) in County Kerry, which rises to [tpl]convert|1038|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web|title =Frequently Asked Questions |work=osi.ie|publisher=Ordnance Survey of Ireland |url=http://www.osi.ie/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx |accessdate=2012-04-04[/tpl] The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster.[tpl]Cite book|first=Victor|last=Meally|title=Encyclopaedia of Ireland|publisher=A.

The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.[tpl]cite web|title =Climate of Ireland|work = Climate|publisher = Met Éireann|url =http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp|accessdate =2008-11-11[/tpl] This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.
Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.[tpl]cite web|title = Rainfall|work= Climate|publisher = Met Éireann|url = http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp|accessdate = 2008-11-05[/tpl] Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.
Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing [tpl]nowrap|0 °C[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|(32 °F)[/tpl] at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003, 2006 and 2013. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2009/10. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2 °C (1 °F) in County Mayo on 20 December[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/subzero-temperatures-make-2010-a-recordbreaking-year-2475709.html |title=Sub-zero temperatures make 2010 a record-breaking year |first=Kevin |last=Keane |publisher=Irish Independent |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-21[/tpl] and up to a metre (3 ft) of snow in mountainous areas.
The island consists of varied geological provinces. In the far west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.[tpl]cite web|title = Geology of Ireland|work = Geology for Everyone|publisher = Geological Survey of Ireland|url = http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology+for+Everyone/Geology+of+Ireland.htm|accessdate = 2008-11-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title = Bedrock Geology of Ireland|work = Geology for Everyone|publisher = Geological Survey of Ireland|url = http://www.gsi.ie/NR/rdonlyres/0302F251-C4ED-4938-BCF0-CF228A3E8F6A/0/GSI_GeolIreland_A4.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-05[/tpl]

Dublin is the most heavily touristed region and home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells. The west and south west, which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway, are also popular tourist destinations.
Achill Island lies off the coast of County Mayo and is Ireland's largest island. It is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains 5 Blue Flag beaches and Croaghaun one of the worlds highest sea cliffs. Stately homes, built during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in Palladian, Neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles, such as, Castle Ward, Castletown House, Bantry House, Glenveagh Castle are also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle, Castle Leslie and Dromoland Castle.

==Flora and fauna==

As Ireland was isolated from mainland Europe by rising sea levels after the ice age, it has less diverse animal and plant species than either Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland.Costello, M.J. and Kelly, K.S., 1993 Biogeography of Ireland: past, present and future Irish Biogeographic Society Occasional Publications Number 2 Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the Barn Swallow. Most of Ireland's bird species come from Iceland, Greenland and Africa.
Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,[tpl]cite web|title = Land cover and land use|work = Environmental Assessment|publisher = Environmental Protection Agency|year = 2011|url = http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/|accessdate = 2011-08-15[/tpl] particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no top predator in Ireland, populations of animals, such as semi-wild deer, that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.
There are no snakes in Ireland and only one reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk and the wolf. Some previously extinct birds, such as the Golden Eagle, been reintroduced in about the year 2000 after decades of extirpation.

Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland, of which 4,450 km² or one million acres is owned by Coillte, the Republic's forestry service.[tpl]cite web|title = National|work = Forest Facts|publisher = Coillte Teoranta|url =http://www.coillte.ie/coillteforest/forest_facts/forest_facts_by_county/national/|date = 5 November 2008|accessdate=2010-01-01[/tpl]
The Republic lies in 42nd place (out of 55) in a list of the most forested countries in Europe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/europe/most_forested_countries.html |title =Most Forested Countries In Europe |author=FAO |publisher=BlatantWorld.com |date=August 2009 |work=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations |accessdate=24 October 2011 [/tpl] Much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (Ulex europaeus), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been "invaded" by some grasses, such as Spartina anglica.[tpl]cite web|last=Hackney|first=Paul|url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |title=Spartina Anglica|work= Invasive Alien Species in Northern Ireland|accessdate=2009-01-01 |publisher=National Museums Northern Ireland[/tpl]

Codium fragile ssp. atlanticum has been established to be native, although for many years it was regarded as an alien species.
Because of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===

The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clarecoco.ie/water-waste-environment/biodiversity/ |title=Biodiversity|publisher=Clare County Council |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf|title=Otter Lutra Lutra|work=Northern Ireland Species Action Plan|publisher=Environment and Heritage Service|format= PDF|year = 2007|accessdate=2010-01-01[/tpl]
A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.[tpl]cite web |title=CAP Reform—A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |work=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-30[/tpl]
Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, most of it designated for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.[tpl]Cite book|first = Dick|last = Roche|authorlink = Dick Roche|title = National Parks|publisher = Seanad Éireann|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html|volume = 185|date = 8 November 2006|accessdate = 2007-07-30[/tpl] Seanad Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government

==Demography==

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. The different eras are termed palaeolithic, neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. 
Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the Cruthin, Corcu Loígde, Dál Riata, Dáirine, Deirgtine, Delbhna, Érainn, Laigin, Ulaid. Slightly later major groups included the Connachta, Ciannachta, Eóganachta. 
Smaller groups included the aithechthúatha (see Attacotti), Cálraighe, Cíarraige, Conmaicne, Dartraighe, Déisi, Éile, Fir Bolg, Fortuatha, Gailenga, Gamanraige, Mairtine, Múscraige, Partraige, Soghain, Uaithni, Uí Maine, Uí Liatháin. Whle many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. 
Over the past 1200 years, Vikings, Normans, Welsh, Flemings, Scots, English, Africans, Eastern Europeans and South Americans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.
Ireland's largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).[tpl]Cite news|last = McKittrick|first = David|title = Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low|publisher = Independent|date = 19 December 2002| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html|accessdate = 2009-12-30|location=London[/tpl] The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week.
The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, but a devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

===Divisions and settlements===

Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,[tpl]Cite book|last =Crawford|first =John|title =Anglicizing the Government of Ireland: The Irish Privy Council and the Expansion of Tudor Rule 1556–1578|publisher =Irish Academic Press|year =1993|isbn=0-7165-2498-8[/tpl] Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.
In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gazetteer.co.uk/section1.htm |title=The Gazetteer of British Place Names: Main features of the Gazetteer |publisher=www.gazetteer.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-23[/tpl] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/destinationNI/ |title= NI by County |work=Discover Northern Ireland |publisher= Northern Ireland Tourist Board |accessdate=2010-10-15 [/tpl]
City status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.
Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia where today a large Irish diaspora lives. Today 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent."Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories—20% sample data". Statistics Canada. A total of 36 million Americans claim Irish ancestry – more than 12% of the total population and 20% of the white population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_3YR_S0201&prodType=table |title=Selected Population Profile in the United States 2009–2011 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2013-04-04[/tpl]
Massachusetts is the most Irish of US states with 23.8% of the population claiming Irish ancestry. The pattern of immigration over this period particularly devastated the western and southern seaboards. Prior to the Great Famine, the provinces of Connacht, Munster and Leinster were more or less evenly populated whereas Ulster was far less densely populated than the other three. Today, Ulster and Leinster, and in particular Dublin, have a far greater population density than Munster and Connacht.
With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000)[tpl]Cite news|last = Sullivan| first =Kevin|authorlink =Kevin Sullivan (journalist)|title = Hustling to Find Classrooms For All in a Diverse Ireland|publisher = Washington Post|date = 24 October 2007| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/23/AR2007102302162_pf.html|accessdate = 2008-11-09[/tpl] from Central Europe.

===Languages===

Two main languages are spoken in Ireland: Irish and English. Both languages have widely contributed to literature. Irish, now a minority but official language of the Republic of Ireland, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was probably introduced by some sort of proto-Gaelic migration during the Iron age, possibly earlier. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.
The Irish language has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language, although revival efforts are continuing in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Gaeltacht or Irish-speaking areas are still seeing a decline in the language. The main Gaeltacht areas are down the west of the country, in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. Irish language is a compulsory subject in the state education system in the Republic, and the Gaelscoil movement has seen many Irish medium schools established in both jurisdictions.
English was first introduced to Ireland in the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor Conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.[tpl]Cite book|last = Spolsky|first = Bernard|title = Language policy| publisher = Cambridge University|year = 2004|location = Cambridge|page = 191|isbn = 9780521011754[/tpl]
Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system[tpl]cite web|title =Table 15: Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each Province, County and City, classified by frequency of speaking Irish, 2006|work =Census 2006—Volume 9—Irish Language|publisher =CSO|url = http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639|accessdate =2008-11-09[/tpl] and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as "Irish speakers." In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to Ulster Scots dialects, which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 1999 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2013-10-20[/tpl] Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.

==Culture==

Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic 'nations' of Europe with Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork. These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,[tpl]cite web|title=Tionchar na gCeilteach|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/720/english/|accessdate=2010-01-23|publisher=BBC|date=23 May 2009|work=BBC Northern Ireland website[/tpl] as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern "Celtic" culture in general.
Religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the 5th century. The Hiberno-Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, "the island of saints and scholars". Since the 20th century the Irish pubs worldwide have become, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings, outposts of Irish culture.

Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, particularly in the English language. Poetry in Irish is the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century. In English, Jonathan Swift, still often called the foremost satirist in the English language, was wildly popular in his day for works such as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal and Oscar Wilde is known most for his often quoted witticisms.
In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Although not a Nobel Prize winner, James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel Ulysses is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as "Bloomsday".[tpl]cite web|title = Bloomsday 2007 Community Wide Events|work = Past Events|publisher = The James Joyce Centre|url = http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=86|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl] Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage[tpl]Cite book|first= Andrew|last=Higgins Wyndham|title=Re-imagining Ireland|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|year=2006[/tpl] through writers such as John McGahern and poets such as Seamus Heaney.
Irish traditional music and dance has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage, including through the phenomenon of Riverdance, a theatrical performance of Irish traditional dancing.[tpl]Cite book|last = Butler|first = Jean|coauthor = Edited by Andrew Higgins Wyndham|title = Re-imagining Ireland: Re-imageing Irish Dance|publisher = University of Virginia Press|year = 2006|location = Virginia|page = 141|url = http://books.google.com/?id=Oo-u0p31yjQC|isbn = 0-8139-2544-4[/tpl] In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music fell out of favour, especially in urban areas.[tpl]Cite book|last =Geraghty|first =Des|title =Luke Kelly: A Memoir|publisher =Basement Press|year =1994|pages = 26–30|isbn= 1-85594-090-6[/tpl] However during the 1960s, inspired by the American folk music movement, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as The Dubliners, The Chieftains, Emmet Spiceland, The Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney's Men and individuals like Seán Ó Riada and Christy Moore.[tpl]Cite book|last =Moore|first =Christy|title =One Voice: My Life in Song|publisher =Hodder and Stoughton/Lir|year =2000|isbn= 0-340-76839-8[/tpl]
Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, The Saw Doctors, The Corrs, Sinéad O'Connor, Clannad, The Cranberries, Black 47 and The Pogues among others.
During the 1990s a sub-genre of folk metal emerged in Ireland that fused heavy metal music with Irish and Celtic music. The pioneers of this sub-genre were Cruachan, Primordial, and Waylander. Some contemporary music groups stick closer to a "traditional" sound, including Altan, Téada, Danú, Dervish, Lúnasa, and Solas. Others incorporate multiple cultures in a fusion of styles, such as Afro Celt Sound System and Kíla.
The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange[tpl]Cite book|last = O'Kelly|first = Michael J.|coauthors = O'Kelly, Claire|title = Newgrange.

During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.

===Science===

The Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law.[tpl]cite web|last = Reville|first = William|title = Ireland's Scientific Heritage|work = Understanding Science" series: Famous Irish Scientists|publisher = University College Cork; Faculty of Science|date = 14 December 2000|url = http://understandingscience.ucc.ie/pages/irishscientists.htm|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl]
19th century physicist, John Tyndall, discovered the Tyndall effect, which explains why the sky is blue. Father Nicholas Joseph Callan, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College, is best known for his invention of the induction coil, transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century.
Other notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton, winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/press.html?print=1 |title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1951 – Presentation Speech |first=Professor I. |last=Waller |publisher=Nobel Prize |year=1951 |accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl] William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the Kelvin, is named after.

George Johnstone Stoney introduced the term electron in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell's Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth's contribution of the Edgeworth Box remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith, among others. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students.
Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including Trinity College, Dublin and the University College Dublin, as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the Open University in Ireland.

===Sports===

The island of Ireland fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is Association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name "Ireland" until the 1950s. An all-Ireland club competition for soccer, the Setanta Cup, was created in 2005.
Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf|publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |format=PDF |title=The Social Significance of Sport|accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10004396.shtml |title=Initiative’s latest ViewerTrack study shows that in Ireland GAA and soccer still dominate the sporting arena, while globally the Superbowl (sic) was the most watched sporting event of 2005 |publisher=Finfacts.com |date=4 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-01-24[/tpl] Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island, and the most popular in Northern Ireland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/709/soccer-in-northern-ireland|title=Soccer in Northern Ireland|publisher=Culture Northern Ireland|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=2011-06-08[/tpl] Swimming, golf, aerobics, soccer, cycling, Gaelic football and billiards/snooker are the sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esri.ie/UserFiles/publications/20070223162340/BKMNINT178_Main%20Text%20Chapters%201-4.pdf |title=Sports Participation and Health Among Adults in Ireland |publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |accessdate=2008-10-15[/tpl] The sport is also the most notable exception where the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland field separate international teams.
Since the 1990s ice hockey has seen an increase in popularity, notably with the Belfast Giants ice hockey team in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland have also produced two World Snooker Champions. Many other sports are also played and followed, including basketball, boxing, cricket, fishing, greyhound racing, handball, hockey, horse racing, motor sport, show jumping and tennis.

====Field sports====

Gaelic football, hurling and handball are the best-known of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crokepark.ie/ |title=Croke Park. Not just a venue. A destination.|publisher=Croke Park Stadium|accessdate=2007-10-03[/tpl] capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501459.html|title=For First Time, Croke Park Is Ireland's Common Ground |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=The Washington Post|first=Michael|last=Moynihan[/tpl] All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.
The Irish Football Association (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast[tpl]cite web|title = FAI History: 1921–1930|publisher = Football Association of Ireland|date = 5 June 2009|url = http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226|accessdate = 2009-12-30[/tpl]
Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations' associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland.
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as "Republic of Ireland" and that the IFA's team be known as "Northern Ireland" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1982 and 1986. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1994, 2002 and the European Championships in 1988 and 2012. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues.
Unlike soccer, Ireland continues to field a single national rugby team and a single association, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every Rugby World Cup, making the quarter-finals in four of them. Ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 Rugby World Cups (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the Magners League (now called the RaboDirect Pro12) and at least three compete for the Heineken Cup. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, Ulster (1999[tpl]cite web|title = The Fourth Heineken Cup Final|work = Match report| publisher = European Rugby Cup|date = 30 January 1999|url = http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/82_629.php|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195030/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/82_629.php|archivedate = 30 September 2007|accessdate = 2008-11-08[/tpl]), Munster (2006[ref]
