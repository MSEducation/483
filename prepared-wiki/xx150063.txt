The Italian Reform Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Riformista Italiano, PSRI) was a social-democratic political party in Italy.
It was formed in 1912 by those leading reformists who had been expelled from the Italian Socialist Party because of their desire of entering in the majority supporting Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti. Leading members of the PSRI were Leonida Bissolati, Giacomo Matteotti, Ivanoe Bonomi and Meuccio Ruini.Massimo L.

After World War II Bonomi and Ruini launched the Labour Democratic Party as the continuation of the PSRI and positioned it within the National Democratic Union, that comprised the Liberals and some former Radicals.
