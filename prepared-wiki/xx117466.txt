Founded in 1998 by Axel Dreyfus and Pierre Sivel under the name C Sport, and bought in 1999 by 365 Corp, then in 2001 by the Groupe Sporever group, Football365.fr is a site entirely dedicated to football news. Live news, match reports, interviews, live footage: the site has both a large number of videos, a blog service, and the option for readers to provide feedback.

===South Africa===

Founded in 2005 by Barrie Jarrett, Football365.co.za is a football website owned by TEAMtalk Media (a subsidiary of Sky SportsDigital TV Group) based in Cape Town, South Africa. The website is loosely based on Football365 but differs in that it focuses on African football.
It primarily covers the South African Premier Soccer League and is well known for its in-depth coverage of the South African national team, Bafana Bafana. Other major African nations including Egypt, Ghana and Nigeria are also covered.
The site is known for its exclusive interviews with South African players and African stars in Europe, and its insightful and sometimes off-beat content. It also offers live coverage of most Bafana Bafana and PSL matches.
Football365.co.za is growing rapidly and is widely regarded as one of the best news sources for South African football. According to the Online Publishers Association of South Africa, the website ranks fourth overall in local traffic.
