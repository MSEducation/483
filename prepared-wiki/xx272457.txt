Joking about being unsuccessful in obtaining Olympic 2012 tickets, Stryder told The Sun: "I didn't get any tickets in the end, like loads of other people. I tried but had no luck. I'm hoping that this song will get us a few, though." He went on to say, "I must be in with a chance, surely. I'm desperate to see some of the events. It will be massive. I'd love to watch the men's 100m final."Tinchy Stryder, Dionne Bromfield record London Olympic 2012 torch song Digital Spy[tpl]clear|left[/tpl]

Bromfield is first dressed in a union jack decorated sleeveless shirt, before later having a change of clothing, she then proceeds to sing, with Stryder following up with pop rap rhymes over post-dubstep beats about success, he leaves out multisyllabic rhymes in this song in order to accommodate the purpose of the song.  The last scene in the video sees Bromfield in two different outfits singing in front of dancers in front of a wall, then Stryder reappears in the scene and him and Bromfield strike a pose, before  dap greeting, then proceeding back to the black colored Mini Convertible and driving away.
