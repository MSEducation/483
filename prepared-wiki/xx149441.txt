TANPAKU was a distributed computing project aimed at attacking the protein structure prediction problem.  The project used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing platform, and was developed in collaboration with Yamato lab (Department of Biological Science and Technology) and Takeda lab (Department of Information Sciences) groups at the Tokyo University of Science.
The project was suspended on August 8, 2008 due to server problems. Currently, research scientists are releasing its results, and the project is not expected to become active again.
