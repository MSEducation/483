Yakutia, thou art the light of the dawn!

To goodness and happiness thou callest us.

Thou shinest bright as a  rainbow of diamond 

And lead us on to future victory
Chorus:
Freely our Lena flows

with livng water to thy wide borders.
 
It carries harmony and strength.

It grants all peoples peace.
Chorus
Land of Sakha, thy sacred places

From peaks of ages direct us.

We continue the journey of our ancestors

and with honour fulfil their mandate.
Chorus
