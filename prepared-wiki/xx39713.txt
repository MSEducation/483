==Overview==

Originally developed by Tim Mann, these programs are compatible with various chess engines[tpl]cite book|last=Hagen|first=William von|title=Ubuntu Linux Bible: Featuring Ubuntu 10.04 LTS|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rsSlrQLB8-gC&pg=SA15-PA93|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=13 May 2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-88180-4|pages=15–16[/tpl] that support the Chess Engine Communication Protocol such as GNU Chess. It also supports Internet Chess Servers,[tpl]cite book|last=Negus|first=Chris|title=Red Hat Linux 9 bible|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NliYH-zrQXQC|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=9 May 2003|publisher=Wiley Pub.|isbn=978-0-7645-3938-1|page=242[/tpl] e-mail chess,[tpl]cite book|last1=Mui|first1=Linda|last2=Quercia|first2=Valérie|title=X user tools|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dw8SAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 November 2011|year=1994|publisher=O'Reilly & Associates|isbn=978-1-56592-019-4|page=186[/tpl] and the playing of saved games.[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Chris F.

It has been recently enhanced a great deal, and the Chess Engine Communication Protocol was extended to meet the needs of modern engines (which have features such as hash tables, multi-processing and end-game tables, which could not be controlled through the old protocol).
XBoard has always been supportive of Chess variants, such as Suicide Chess or Crazyhouse, acting as a client for Internet Chess Servers that offered such variants. This support has now been extended to all of the World's major Chess variants: xiangqi (Chinese Chess), shogi (Japanese Chess), makruk (Thai Chess) and many Western variants on boards of deviating sizes (e.g. Capablanca Chess). It offers a Westernized representation for these games, but the almost limitless configurability of WinBoard does allow a high-quality traditional oriental representation of these games.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/|publisher=gnu.org|title=XBoard|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]
Another computer chess protocol is the Universal Chess Interface (UCI). XBoard/WinBoard supports this protocol (and its dialects USI and UCCI, which are in common use for Shogi and Chinese Chess) through adapter programs such as Polyglot and UCI2WB.
