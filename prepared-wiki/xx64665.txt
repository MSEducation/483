CATEGORIES: Former counties of Sweden, Lists of county governors of Sweden

The Over-Governor, or Överståthållaren of Stockholm was the highest official for the City between 1634 and 1967. The Office was instituted by the Instrument of Government of 1634, which divided Sweden into Counties and the Over-Governorship of Stockholm. The Stockholm County was established in 1714 but the actual City was not integrated until 1967 when the Over-Governor's Office was abolished.
