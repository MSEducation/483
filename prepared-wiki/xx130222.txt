==History==

O.C. Jensen and Henry Brooke founded Jensen, Brooke & Company, a hardware business, in 1883. Brooke later sold his interest in the company to Charles King and the business was renamed Jensen King & Co. in 1895. The company merged with Wolverton and Byrd and moved to Spokane where it incorporated under the name Jensen-King-Byrd. Jensen's sons, Alvin L. and J. Scott Jensen bought out King's interest in the company in 1925 and changed the name of the business to Jensen-Byrd Co.
Jensen-Byrd Co. acquired the Spokane branch of Marshall Wells in 1958 and Pacific Marine Schwabacher in 1981. In 1995, Jensen-Byrd Co. changed its name to Jensen Distribution Services.[tpl]cite news|title=Jensen-Byrd name changes with times|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7royAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p_EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4408,3406380&dq=jensen-distribution-services&hl=en|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=April 25, 1995[/tpl]
