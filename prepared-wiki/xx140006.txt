==Politics==

The political success of the Republican party in the region is tied to the state's settlement patterns. Northwest Oklahoma was settled out of Kansas while southeast was settled by southerners that brought with them Democratic traditions.Gaddie, Ronald Keith. Republican Party, Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed February 11, 2010).
The Great Depression hurt the Republican party, but it has since regained its place in the state and even overtaken the Democratic party.
George W. Bush received 72 percent of the district's vote in 2004.
