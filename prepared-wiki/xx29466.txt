</ref> This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]. At some time in the 19th century or earlier, the Arabs began referring to the wall as al-Buraq. This was based on the tradition that inside the wall was the place where [[Muhammad]] tethered his miraculous winged steed, [[Buraq]].

==Location and dimensions==

The Western Wall commonly refers to a 187 foot (57 m) exposed section of ancient wall situated on the western flank of the Temple Mount. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer. In its entirety, however, the above ground portion of the Western Wall stretches for [tpl]Convert|1600|ft|m|0[/tpl], most of which is hidden behind residential structures built along its length. Other revealed sections include the southern part of the Wall which measures approximately [tpl]convert|80|m|ft|0[/tpl] and another much shorter section known as the Little Western Wall which is located close to the Iron Gate. The wall functions as a retaining wall, built to support the extensive renovations that Herod the Great carried out around 19 BCE. Herod expanded the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First and Second Temples stood into the wide expanse of the Temple Mount visible today.
At the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at [tpl]Convert|105|ft|m|0[/tpl], with the exposed section standing approximately [tpl]Convert|62|ft|m|0[/tpl] high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground. The first seven visible layers are from the Herodian period. This section of wall is built from enormous meleke limestone stones, possibly quarried at either Zedekiah's Cave[tpl]cite web|title=Quarrying History in Jerusalem|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E2D81E38F932A35751C1A963948260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=3|work=New York Times|author=Friedman, Thomas L.|accessdate=October 18, 2008|date = December 1, 1985|quote=Herod the Great certainly used it as the main quarry for building blocks needed to renovate the Temple and its retaining walls, including what is known today as the Wailing Wall.|authorlink= Thomas Friedman[/tpl] situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City or at Ramat Shlomo [tpl]convert|4|km[/tpl] northwest of the Old City.

==History==

===Construction 19 BCE===

According to the Tanakh, Solomon's Temple was built atop what is now the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE.  Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to renovating and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, resulting in an enlarged enclosure. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death found under the massive Meleke foundation stones in the southern section of the wall inside a ritual bath which predates the construction of the renovated Temple Mount complex and was filled in to support the new walls.Coin discovery sheds new light on sacred Jerusalem site (AP) This indicates that Herod did not build the entire wall and that construction was not close to being complete when he died. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/about_eng.asp?Modul_id=14|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn’t Finish it|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=November 23, 2011[/tpl]

===Roman Empire and rise of Christianity 100–500 CE===

In the early centuries of the Common Era, after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself. When the empire became Christian under Constantine I, they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the ninth day of the month of Av, to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall.[ref]
