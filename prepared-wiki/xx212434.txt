"Walking Off A Cliff Again" is the fourth of six singles released from The Mint Chicks' 2006 album Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No!. Released in October 2007, it failed to chart on the New Zealand Top 40, although it was popular on alternative radio stations such as bfm.
Its B-Sides "2010" and "I Can't Stop Being Foolish" were rough demos of tracks appearing on the Chicks' third album, Screens.

The music video was popular on channels such as C4 and Oliver Driver's ALT TV. It has an appearance from the band at the beginning as lego men, spurring a teenager into running until he jumps off a high-rise building, landing in a bathtub.
