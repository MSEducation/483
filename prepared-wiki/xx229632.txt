==Military career==

===World War II===

Sismore started his service as an airman in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR).  However, on 29 August 1942 Flight Sergeant Sismore was given an emergency commission as a General Duties Branch Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=35741 |date=13 October 1942 |startpage=4439 |supp=x |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl]  Towards the end of the war, on 1 February 1945, he was awarded a permanent commission as a Flying Officer.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=37518 |date=2 April 1946 |startpage=1626 |supp=x |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl]
In February 1944 Sismore was involved in the planning of Operation Jericho but was prevented from flying with Air Chief Marshal Basil Embry because of their knowledge of the plans. Operation Jericho was a low-level bombing raid on Amiens Prison in German-occupied France. The object of the raid was to free French Resistance and political prisoners who were facing imminent execution.http://www.sporting-memories.com/aai/gc002.htm He also participated in the successful raid in late October 1944 against the Gestapo HQ in Århus, Denmark as navigator to Reynolds.
Notably in March 1945, whilst serving on No. 140 Wing, Sismore, by then an acting Squadron Leader took part in Operation Carthage, a precision raid on the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen Denmark. Sismore was the lead navigator in the Mosquito Mk.VI flown by the raid leader (Group Captain Robert Bateson).http://www.raf.mod.uk/history_old/shell.html The raid, while not being completely successful with a large number of civilian casualties, succeeded in destroying the Gestapo HQ allowing some prisoners to escape. Sismore was awarded a bar to his DFC and was also honoured with the Danish Order of Dannebrog, Degree of Knight.

===Post-war===

Sismore remained in the RAF after the war, qualifying as a fighter pilot and occupying several senior officer posts.

==Honours and awards==

''On 30 January 1943, two forces of bombers were detailed to attack Berlin,to prevent a radio broadcast by Goering. To reach the German capital necessitated a flight of more than 500 miles, mostly over heavily defended territory.
  This was following the attack on the Zeiss works at Jena which was his deepest low level daylight penetration of the war with Wing Commander Reynolds.
As pilot and navigator respectively these officers have taken part in numerous sorties against a wide variety of targets. In October, 1944, they took part in a most successful attack on a vital German target. In this well executed operation, these officers displayed skill and resolution of the highest standard.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=36839 |date=12 December 1944 |startpage=5737 |supp=x |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl]
"Acting Squadron Leader Edward Barnes SISMORE, D.S.O., D.F.C., (130208), R.A.F.V.R. In March, 1945, Squadron Leader Sismore was the navigator in the leading aircraft of a large formation detailed to attack the Gestapo headquarters at Copenhagen. The operation, necessitating a flight of more than 1,000 miles demanded the highest standard of navigational ability. In this direction, Squadron Leader Sismore's work was outstanding and contributed materially to the success obtained. Again, in April, 1945, this officer flew with great distinction in an attack against a similar target at Odense. This officer, who completed much operational flying, has rendered very valuable service".[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=37142 |date= 22 June 1945|startpage=3271 |supp=x |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl]

==Death==

Sismore died on 22 March 2012 and was survived by his son and daughter.
