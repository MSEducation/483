CATEGORIES: Agencies of the United States government

Learn and Serve America (LSA) is a United States government program under the authority of the Corporation For National and Community Service. Its mission is to provide opportunities for students nation-wide to participate in service learning projects, and to gain valuable experience while helping communities.  It sponsors the Presidentâ€™s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.

==Programs==

Learn and Serve America's budget is primarily distributed to K-12 and higher education institutions, as well as community organizations, upon request, in the form of grants. Of the money earmarked for grants, approximately half is distributed on an as-needed basis, while the other half is divided among organizations that requested funding. The rest of the LSA budget goes towards programs run directly by Learn and Serve America, which include the Presidential Freedom Scholarships.

==History==

Learn and Serve America grew from Serve America, a program created under the National and Community Service Act of 1990. When the Corporation for National and Community Service was created in 1993, Serve America was reformed as Learn and Serve America.
