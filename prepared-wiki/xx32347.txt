Heiðrún is a goat in Norse mythology, which consumes the foliage of the tree Læraðr and produces mead for the einherjar. She is described in the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda.

==Prose Edda==

==Poetic Edda==

In the Poetic Edda Heiðrún is mentioned twice. She is described in the Grímnismál in a way similar to Snorri's description.
Since Snorri quotes other strophes of Grímnismál it seems reasonable to assume that he knew this strophe too and used it as his source for his description of Heiðrún.
In the Hyndluljóð the giantess Hyndla (lit. bitch/she-dog) used the term "Heiðrún" to insult the goddess Freyja. Thorpe and some other translators translated the name straight to "she-goat".
Heiðrún's name is sometimes anglicized Heidrun, Heidhrun, Heithrun, Heidrún, Heithrún or Heidhrún.
"Heidrun" is also the name of a Vikingarock band from Värmland, Sweden who originally formed in 2009 as a cover band. Since then their popularity has grown, and they released their first full-length studio album with original music, "Framåt Gå," in August 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heidrun.nu/ |title=Heidrun - Vikingarock från Värmland |publisher=Heidrun.nu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]
