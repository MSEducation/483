==Playing career==

===Provincial Rugby===

Born in Tonga but trained in New Zealand, Fia had a stellar year in 2009 as he broke into the Manawatu provincial squad for the Air New Zealand Cup competition and helped New Zealand to the IRB World Under-20 title. As a result, he was named Manawatu's Outstanding Junior Sportsperson for 2009.[tpl]cite web|author=Manawatu Turbos |url=http://www.manawaturugby.co.nz/article/1847.html |title=Manawatu Turbos | 2011 ITM Cup |publisher=Manawaturugby.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2011-10-13[/tpl]
In the 2010 ITM Cup, Fia established himself as a starter at prop for Manawatu, and scored his first provincial try. In the 2011 ITM Cup, he was a key part of a vastly improved Turbos squad, and his consistently strong performances earned him a Super Rugby contract for 2012.

===Super Rugby===

Fia signed with the Highlanders for the 2012 Super Rugby season.
