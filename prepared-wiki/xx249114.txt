The Junkers EF 126 was an experimental fighter proposed by the German Miniaturjägerprogramm of 1944-1945, for a cheap and simple fighter powered by a pulse jet engine. No examples were built during the war, but a single unpowered prototype was completed by the Soviet Union, which crashed during testing.
The design of the Ju EF 126 was developed into the Junkers EF 127, a rocket-powered version.

==Design and development==

During 1944, the Jägernot programme was launched by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) or German Air Ministry to work on designs for the simplest, cheapest fighter possible. In order to minimise cost and complexity, it was to be powered by a pulse jet, as used by the V-1 flying bomb and its manned version, the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg) 'buzz bomb' (V1). Designs were produced by Heinkel, with a pulse jet–powered version of their Heinkel He 162, Blohm & Voss, the BV P.213, and Junkers.Smith and Kay 1972, p.616.
The project cost was about 30,000 Reichsmarks. The design started with two prototypes. The first prototype was the upper-fuselage mounted wings version, which was not completed until the end of the war, when it was captured and further tested by the Soviet military. The development of the project reached a dead end when the Soviet authorities lost interest in a cheaply produced fighter and concentrated instead on more advanced projects.Junkers EF 126 - Luft'46
