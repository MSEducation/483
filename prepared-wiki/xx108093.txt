</ref> Chris Connelly is another former editor who went on to work as a correspondent for [[ESPN]] and contributing correspondent for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' and a commentator backstage at the [[Academy Awards]].
News Corporation sold the magazine to K-III (later Primedia) in 1991, and Hachette reacquired the magazine in 1995.
After Lyne left the magazine, Connelly became editor-in-chief in early 1996 with Nancy Griffin as deputy editor. Both editors resigned suddenly in May of the same year after publisher Hachette Filipacchi's then president and chief executive, David Pecker told Connelly to not publish a column about Planet Hollywood because of its ties to billionaire Revlon owner Ronald Perelman, who was also half owner of Premiere.

==Cancellation==

On March 5, 2007, publisher Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. announced that it was shutting down the U.S. print edition of Premiere, and that the magazine will survive as an online-only publication. The print editions in other countries—the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain—were unaffected by this announcement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/06/industry-hachette-premiere-dc-idUSN0532587620070306|title=Hachette shuts print edition of Premiere magazine|publisher=Reuters.com|accessdate=2012-02-18|date=2007-03-05[/tpl] The Portuguese edition was canceled in October 2007. The Czech Republic edition last issue was June 2009.
The last published issue was the April 2007 (featuring Will Ferrell promoting Blades of Glory on the cover). The final issue gave readers no warning that it would be the last. In late April subscribers were mailed postcards advising them of the magazine's demise and telling them the balance of their subscriptions would be fulfilled with issues of the tabloid gossip magazine Us Weekly. Negative response to the offer immediately was posted to the magazine website's forum pages by unhappy subscribers, and it was announced a cash refund would be available for those who preferred one.
