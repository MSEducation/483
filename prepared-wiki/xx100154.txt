[[Capriate San Gervasio]]

Capriate San Gervasio is a comune in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy.
It is situated on the southern tip of the so-called Bergamasca Island, a territory delimited by the rivers Adda and Brembo. It includes three frazioni (subdivisions) at slightly different altitudes, San Gervasio d'Adda (north), Capriate d'Adda (center) and Crespi d'Adda. The latter, a perfectly preserved example of a 19th-century "workers' village", is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on July 11, 2006.
