The jackfruit tree is a widely cultivated and popular food item in tropical regions of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Jackfruit is also found across Africa (e.g., in Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Mauritius), as well as throughout Brazil and in Caribbean nations such as Jamaica. Jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh.

==Etymology==

The word "jackfruit" comes from Portuguese jaca, which in turn, is derived from the Malayalam language term, chakka (Malayalam Chakka pazham : ചക്ക).[tpl] cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UuCWMJjOvYUC&pg=PA81&dq=jackfruit+Chakka#v=onepage&q=jackfruit%20Chakka&f=false |title=Management of Horticultural Crops, Vol.11 |work=Horticulteral Science Series |author=T.

Henry Yule translated the book in Jordanus Catalani's (f. 1321–1330) Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East.[tpl] cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/mirabiliadescrip00jord#page/13/mode/1up |title=Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East |author=Friar Jordanus, 14th century, as translated from the Latin by Henry Yule |year=1863 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |pages=13 |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl]
The common English name "jackfruit" was used by the physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta in his 1563 book Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India.Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, 1989, online editionAnon. (2000) The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. Centuries later, botanist Ralph Randles Stewart suggested it was named after William Jack (1795–1822), a Scottish botanist who worked for the East India Company in Bengal, Sumatra, and Malaysia.[tpl]cite journal|title=How Did They Die?|authorlink=Ralph Randles Stewart|author=Ralph R Stewart|journal=Taxon|volume= 33|issue=1|pages=48–52|year=1984|doi=10.2307/1222028[/tpl] This could not be true, as the fruit was called a "jack" in English before William Jack was born: for instance, in Dampier's 1699 book, A New Voyage Round the World.[tpl]cite book|author=William Dampier|title=A new voyage round the world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=adsNAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA2-PA320|accessdate=17 October 2011|year=1699|publisher=J.

==Synonym discussion==

Artocarpus integer (Thunb.) Merr. http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2653995 is currently accepted name, whereas Artocarpus integrifolius L.f. is synonym. However in Flora of British India, Volume 5 (Page 541), J.D. Hooker mentions it as Artocarpus integrifolia L.f. Moreover, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. is a different species.http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2653982

==Cultivation and ecology==

The jackfruit has played a significant role in Indian agriculture for centuries. Archeological findings in India have revealed that jackfruit was cultivated in India 3000 to 6000 years[tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl] ago. It is also widely cultivated in southeast Asia.
Thailand and Vietnam are major producers of jackfruit, a lot of which are cut, prepared and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags/boxes without syrup), and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe.
In other areas, the jackfruit is considered an invasive species as in Brazil's Tijuca Forest National Park in Rio de Janeiro. The Tijuca is mostly an artificial secondary forest, whose planting began during the mid-19th century, and jackfruit trees have been a part of the park's flora since its founding. Recently, the species has expanded excessively; its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals such as the common marmoset and coati. The seeds are dispersed by these animals, which allows the jackfruit to compete for space with native tree species. Additionally, as the marmoset and coati also prey opportunistically on bird's eggs and nestlings, the supply of jackfruit as a ready source of food has allowed them to expand their populations, to the detriment of the local bird populations. Between 2002 and 2007, 55,662 jackfruit saplings were destroyed in the Tijuca Forest area in a deliberate culling effort by the park's management.Livia de Almeida, "Guerra contra as jaqueiras" ("War on Jackfruit"), Revista Veja Rio, May the 5th.2007; see also http:/,/www.jbrj.gov.br/enbt/posgraduacao/resumos/2008/rodolfo_de_abreu.htm

==Aroma==

Jackfruit are known for having a distinct aroma. In a study using five jackfruit cultivars, the main jackfruit volatile compounds that were detected are: ethyl isovalerate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 1-butanol, propyl isovalerate, isobutyl isovalerate, 2-methylbutanol, and butyl isovalerate. These compounds were consistently present in all the five cultivars studied, suggesting that these esters and alcohols contributed to the sweet and fruity aroma of jackfruit.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ong|first=B.T.|coauthors=S.A.H. Nazimah, C.P. Tan, H. Mirhosseini, A. Osman, D. Mat Hashim, G. Rusul|title=Analysis of volatile compounds in five jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus L.) cultivars using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS)|journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis|date=August 2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=416–422|doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2008.03.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915750800029X|accessdate=2 February 2013[/tpl]

==Fruit==

The flesh of the jackfruit is starchy and fibrous and is a source of dietary fiber. The flavor is comparable to a combination of apple, pineapple, mango and banana.The encyclopedia of fruit & nuts, By Jules Janick, Robert E. Paull, p. 155 Varieties are distinguished according to characteristics of the fruit's flesh. In Brazil, three varieties are recognized: jaca-dura, or the "hard" variety, which has a firm flesh and the largest fruits that can weigh between 15 and 40 kilograms each, jaca-mole, or the "soft" variety, which bears smaller fruits with a softer and sweeter flesh, and jaca-manteiga, or the "butter" variety, which bears sweet fruits whose flesh has a consistency intermediate between the "hard" and "soft" varieties.General information, Department of Agriculture, State of Bahia. seagri.ba.gov.br (in Portuguese) In Indochina, there are 2 varieties, being the "hard" version (more crunchy, drier and less sweet but fleshier), and the "soft" version (more soft, moister, much sweeter with a darker gold-color flesh than the hard variety).
In Kerala, two varieties of jackfruit predominate: varikka (വരിക്ക) and koozha (കൂഴ). Varikka has a slightly hard inner flesh when ripe, while the inner flesh of the ripe koozha fruit is very soft and almost dissolving. A sweet preparation called chakka varattiyathu (jackfruit jam) is made by seasoning pieces of varikka fruit flesh in jaggery, which can be preserved and used for many months. Huge jackfruits up to four feet in length with a corresponding girth are sometimes seen in Kerala.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
In West Bengal the two varieties are called khaja kathal and  moja kathal. The fruits are either eaten alone or as a side to rice / roti / chira / muri. Sometimes the juice is extracted and either drunk straight or as a side with muri. The extract is sometimes condensed into rubbery  delectables and eaten as candies. The seeds are either boiled or roasted and eaten with salt and hot chillies. They are also used to make spicy side-dishes with rice or roti.
In Mangalore, Karnataka, the varieties are called bakke and imba. The pulp of the imba jackfruit is ground and made into a paste, then spread over a mat and allowed to dry in the sun to create a natural chewy candy.
The young fruit is called polos in Sri Lanka and idichakka or idianchakka in Kerala.
In Indochina, jackfruit is a frequent ingredient in sweets and desserts. In Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit Chè (chè is a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative, bubur chacha). The Vietnamese also use jackfruit puree as part of pastry fillings, or as a topping on Xôi ngọt (sweet version of sticky rice portions).

==Culinary uses==

Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines.The encyclopedia of fruit & nuts, By Jules Janick, Robert E. Paull, pp.481–485

Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet with subtle flavoring. It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, halo-halo and more.  In India, when the Jackfruit is in season, an ice cream chain store called "Naturals" carries Jackfruit flavored ice cream.
Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried or freeze-dried and sold as jackfruit chips.
The seeds from ripe fruits are edible, are said to have a milky, sweet taste,  and may be boiled, baked or roasted. When roasted the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks either by boiling or fire roasted, also used to make desserts. For making the traditional breakfast dish in southern India: idlis, the fruit is used along with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit dosas can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter.

===Culinary uses for unripe fruit===

The cuisines of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam use cooked young jackfruit. In Indonesia, young jackfruit is cooked with coconut milk as gudeg. In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food. In northern Thailand, the boiled young jackfruit is used in the Thai salad called tam kanun. In West Bengal the unripe green jackfruit called "aechor/ichor" is used as a vegetable to make various spicy curries, side-dishes and as fillings for cutlets & chops. It is especially sought after by vegetarians who substitute this for meat and hence is nicknamed as gacch-patha (tree-mutton). In the Philippines, it is cooked with coconut milk (ginataang langka). In Réunion Island, it is cooked either alone or with animal flesh, such as shrimp or smoked pork. In southern India unriped Jackfruit slices are deep fried to make chips.In Udipi cuisine Jack fruit is used make appa and Addae.
Because unripe jackfruit has a meat-like taste, it is used in curry dishes with spices, in Bihar,Jharkhand, Sri Lankan, Andhran, eastern-Indian (Bengali) and (Odisha) and Keralan cuisine. The skin of unripe jackfruit must be peeled first, then the remaining whole jackfruit can be chopped into edible portions and cooked before serving. Young jackfruit has a mild flavor and distinctive meat-like texture and is compared to poultry.  Meatless sandwiches have been suggested and are popular with both vegetarian and nonvegetarian populations. Unripe jackfruit is widely known as Panasa Katha in Odisha.

==Nutrition==

The edible jackfruit is made of soft, easily-digestible flesh (bulbs); A portion of 100 g of edible raw jackfruit provides about 95 calories and is a good source of the antioxidant vitamin C, providing about 13.7 mg.http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11702&format=Full Jackfruit seeds are rich in protein. The fruit is also rich in potassium, calcium, and iron.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/23/jackfruit-miracle-crop-climate-change-food-security |title=Jackfruit heralded as 'miracle' food crop |author=Suzanne Goldenberg |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2014[/tpl]

==Seeds==

In general, the seeds are gathered from the ripe fruit, sun-dried, then stored for use in rainy season in many parts of South Indian states.  They are extracted from fully matured fruits and washed in water to remove the slimy part. Seeds should be stored immediately in closed polythene bags for one or two days to prevent them from drying out. Germination is improved by soaking seeds in clean water for 24 hours. During transplanting, sow seeds in line, 30 cm apart, in a nursery bed filled with 70% soil mixed with 30% organic matter.[tpl]cite book|title=Jackfruit Artocarpus heterophyllus.

Boiled Jackfruit seed is also edible. Seasoned with nothing more than salt, this snack is very popular in Java.

==Wood==

The wood of the tree is used for the production of musical instruments. In Indonesia, hardwood from the trunk is carved out to form the barrels of drums used in the gamelan, and in the Philippines its soft wood is made into the body of the kutiyapi, a type of boat lute. It is also used to make the body of the Indian string instrument veena and the drums mridangam and kanjira; the golden, yellow timber with good grains is used for building furniture and house construction in India. The ornate wooden plank called avani palaka made of the wood of jackfruit tree is used as the priest's seat during Hindu ceremonies in Kerala. In Vietnam, jackfruit wood is prized for the making of Buddhist statuaries in temples.http://nhagoviethung.com/viewproduct/1817_gomitnai.htm
Jackfruit wood is widely used in the manufacture of furniture, doors and windows, and in roof construction. The heartwood is used by Buddhist forest monastics in Southeast Asia as a dye, giving the robes of the monks in those traditions their distinctive light-brown color.Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study in Northeast Thailand J.L. Taylor 1993 p. 218

==Commercial availability==

Outside of its countries of origin, fresh jackfruit can be found at Asian food markets, especially in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia Cambodia and Bangladesh. It is also extensively cultivated in the Brazilian coastal region, where it is sold in local markets. It is available canned in sugary syrup, or frozen, already prepared and cut. Dried jackfruit chips are produced by various manufacturers. In northern Australia, particularly in Darwin, jackfruit can be found at outdoor produce markets during the dry season. Outside of countries where it is grown, jackfruit can be obtained year-round both canned or dried. It has a ripening season in Asia of late spring to late summer.Jackfruit. Hort.purdue.edu. Retrieved on 2011-10-17.
There are established jackfruit industries in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into products such as flour, noodles, papad and ice cream.  It is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export.

==Production and marketing==

The marketing of jackfruit involved three groups: producers, traders (middlemen) including wholesalers, and retailers.[tpl]cite book|last=Haq|first=Nazmul|title=Jackfruit: Artocarpus heterophyllus|year=2006|publisher=Southampton Centre for Underutilised Crops|location=Southampton, UK|isbn=0854327851|pages=129|url=http://www.cropsforthefuture.org/publication/Monographs/Jackfruit%20monograph.pdf[/tpl] The marketing channels are rather complex. Large farms sell immature fruits to wholesalers of which could help cash flow and reduces risk, whereas medium sized farms sell fruits directly to local markets or retailers.

==Cultural significance==

The jackfruit is one of the three auspicious fruits of Tamil Nadu, along with the mango and banana, known as the mukkani (முக்கனி). These are referred to as ma-pala-vaazhai (mango-jack-banana). The three fruits (mukkani) are also related to the three arts of Tamil (mu-Tamizh).[tpl]cite book|last=Subrahmanian N, Hikosaka S, Samuel GJ|title=Tamil social history|year=1997|page=88|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=PXXsAAAAIAAJ&q=triad+of+famous+auspicious+fruits&dq=triad+of+famous+auspicious+fruits|accessdate=March 23, 2010[/tpl] Jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh. It is also the state fruit of the Indian state of Kerala.
