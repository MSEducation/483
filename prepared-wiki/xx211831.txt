Diamondback is a steel roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio, United States. The ride is located in Rivertown just behind International Street and the Eiffel Tower. When built in 2009, it was the first hyper coaster to feature a splashdown and the first Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster at Kings Island.[tpl]cite news |title=Diamondback to tower over Kings Island in 2009|url=http://www.thecoastercritic.com/2008/08/diamondback-to-tower-over-kings-island.html |publisher=The Coaster Critic|accessdate=August 2, 2012[/tpl] Diamondback was the biggest investment in Kings Island’s history at $22 million (ahead of The Crypt and Son of Beast, each of which cost $20 million).

==Ride experience==

===Layout===

After the train leaves the station, it begins its ascent up the [tpl]convert|230|ft|m[/tpl] chain lift hill. Once reaching the top of the hill, the coaster drops [tpl]convert|215|ft|m[/tpl] at 74° over the Rivertown midway. It then curves to the right up a [tpl]convert|193|ft|m[/tpl] hill and down the drop into the ravine, curving again to the left. The ride then ascends a [tpl]convert|131|ft|m[/tpl] camelback hill and drops, curiving left into the hammerhead turn. After dropping out of the hammerhead, the train travels up a [tpl]convert|129|ft|m[/tpl] hill (which has a trim brake). After the fourth hill, the train turns into down into a 287° counter-clockwise helix (on-ride photo camera is here) and into the mid-course brake run. After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323°. After the final helix, the train passes over the Rivertown midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station.[tpl]cite web |title=Diamondback POV|year=2009|publisher=Coaster Force|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jo1Xj9iLt4|accessdate=August 2, 2012[/tpl] One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes.

===Splashdown===

Diamondback is the first hyper coaster to feature a splashdown. Scoops positioned at the back sides of the last car on each train send water soaring at heights of [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] as the train passes. The riders don’t actually get wet in the splashdown. Splashdowns are used for a visual effect as well to slow the train down. The splashdown is located in the former Swan Boat pond.

===Trains===

Diamondback operates with three open-air stadium style steel and fiberglass trains. The trains are the same prototype trains seen on Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, Intimidator at Carowinds and Shambhala: Expedición al Himalaya at PortAventura. Diamondback was the first roller coaster in the United States to feature the new trains. Each car seats four passengers, with two front seats set near the middle of the car and two rear seats set closer to the sides of the car. The front car of each train features a yellow/orange snake head with long fangs, while the inside of the trains are black, red, and orange. Riders are restrained by a single T-shaped lap bar. There are three trains total, each train featuring a different fin color: green, red, or brown. Under the sides of the last car on each train are the scoops for the splashdown at the end.[tpl]cite news |title=Track layout and train information|year=2009|url=http://www.kidiamondback.com/public/ride/layout.cfm|publisher=Kings Island|accessdate=August 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Track===

The steel track is [tpl]Convert|5282|ft|adj=off[/tpl] in length and the height of the lift is approximately [tpl]Convert|230|ft|adj=off[/tpl]. The supports on the first lift hill and part of the second hill are yellow while the rest of the supports are tan. All of the track pieces are red. The track was fabricated at the Ohio-based Clermont Steel Fabricators.[tpl]cite web|title=Diamondback Built in Clermont|url=http://www.clermontcountyohio.biz/diamondbackCFS.aspx|publisher=Clermont County, Ohio|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]
