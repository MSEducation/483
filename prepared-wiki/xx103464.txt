"I Feel for You" is a song written by Prince that originally appeared on his 1979 self-titled album. The most successful and well known version was recorded by female R&B singer Chaka Khan, appearing on her 1984 album, I Feel for You. Prince, as songwriter, won the 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song.
Khan's version featured an all-star supporting cast, with rapping from Melle Mel, keyboard and guitar by The System's David Frank, and harmonica playing by Stevie Wonder. The song also uses vocal samples from Wonder's "Fingertips". The repetition of Khan's name by Melle Mel at the beginning of the song was originally a mistake made by producer Arif Mardin (actually a sample of Melle Mel's song "Step Off"), who then decided to keep it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5061890 |title=Arif Mardin: Tales from the Recording Studio |publisher=NPR |date=2005-12-19 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
This version of the song became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and UK, and it helped to relaunch Khan's career. The song hit #1 on the Cash Box singles chart and peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1984. The song remained on the Billboard Hot 100 for 26 weeks and became one of Billboard's five biggest pop songs of the year for 1985.

==Music videos (Chaka Khan version)==

The first version of the music video for Khan's song featured her working in a club with female dancers. As rap music and break dancing were becoming well known in mainstream pop culture at the time the song was released and started gaining popularity, the more well known video in an inner-city courtyard setting was created, featuring Khan with a Disc jockey and break dancers Adolfo Quiñones, Michael Chambers, Bruno Falcon and Ana Sánchez—all of whom appeared in the movie Breakin'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myvideo.de/watch/3034573/I_feel_for_you |title=I feel for You Video - Stiefelfreund2006 - MyVideo |publisher=Myvideo.de |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl] A remixed version of the video was created to match the 12" vinyl version of the single.
