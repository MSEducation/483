===Baseball===

The men's baseball team won national championships in 1953 and 1962 and has sent 138 players to the major leagues.Bergquist, Kevin (June 1, 2004). Prof: U-M baseball among University's storied programs. The University RecordCollege Baseball Players Who Made it to a Major League Baseball Team. Baseball Almanac – The Colleges. Retrieved March 27, 2006.  Michigan has appeared in the College World Series seven times. Notable alumni include, George Sisler, Barry Larkin, Jim Abbott, Arizona Diamondback's pitcher J. J. Putz, and Kansas City Royals' second baseman Chris Getz. Another important figure in the history of Michigan baseball is former Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey who was the head coach for 4 years from 1910–13 and recruited Sisler to Ann Arbor. The current coach of the Michigan Wolverines is Rich Maloney. He came to the University of Michigan in 2003 and helped restore Michigan to Big Ten prominence. Michigan has won 35 Conference Championships, made 21 NCAA Tournament appearances and won those 2 national titles. For 13 seasons from 1990–2002 Michigan won a lone Big Ten title (1997) and made just one NCAA appearance in 1999. In the 7 seasons since Coach Maloney arrived Michigan has made 4 NCAA appearances while winning back-to-back-to-back Conference titles in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

===Basketball===

====Men's basketball====

The men's basketball team plays its games at Crisler Arena. The Wolverines have won 14 Big Ten regular-season conference titles, as well as the inaugural Big Ten Tournament in 1998, which it later forfeited due to NCAA violations. The team has appeared in the NCAA Final Four on seven occasions (1964, 1965, 1976, 1989, 1992*, 1993*, 2013) and won the National Championship in 1989 under Steve Fisher. The program later forfeited its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances due to NCAA violations. Other notable players who played for Michigan include Roy Tarpley, Loy Vaught, Gary Grant, Terry Mills, Glen Rice, Jalen Rose, Rumeal Robinson, Antoine Joubert, Jamal Crawford, Juwan Howard, Chris Webber, Jimmy King, Cazzie Russell, Daniel Horton, Bernard Robinson, and Mark Hughes.
During the 1990s, the program became involved in a scandal involving payments from a booster named Ed Martin to four players: Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor, and Louis Bullock. The scandal ultimately resulted in four years' probation and a self-imposed ban from postseason play in the 2002–03 season. UM also voluntarily "vacated" regular season wins and NCAA tournament games from selected past seasons. Vacating the results of 113 games won while the four players were eligible, including the 1992 and 1993 Final Fours, the entire 1992–93 season, and all seasons from fall 1995 through spring 1999. After the scandal, Michigan men's basketball would then go 10 years without making the NCAA tournament from 1999-2008. They would eventually end the drought in 2009 under current head coach John Beilein. In 2013, the program would reach its first Final Four in 20 years before falling to Louisville in the national championship, 82-76.

===Cross country===

The men's and women's cross country teams have been nationally renowned since 1974 when Ron Warhurst started coaching the men, and more recently as alum Mike McGuire took on the women's team in 1991. The women's team has qualified for the NCAA championships every year but two since 1988, finishing 2nd in 1994, and winning five consecutive Big Ten titles from 2002 to 2006.Michigan Women's Cross Country Year-By-Year Results – MGOBLUE.COM – University of Michigan Official Athletic Site The men's team has qualified for the NCAA 24 times in the last 34 years, with a highest finish of 4th. Michigan men have won seven Big Ten titles in that period.

===Football===

The Wolverines have won a record 903 games and have an all-time winning percentage of .735, also the best in college football history.  Michigan won the inaugural Rose Bowl in 1902, the first college bowl game ever played.  The Wolverine football program has claimed 11 national titles.University of Michigan Football – National Championships. University of Michigan Athletics History (2002).
Michigan's 11 national championships have come under the direction of five coaches. The first six were garnered by the team's first coaching superstar, Fielding H. Yost.  Yost directed his "Point-a-Minute" teams to four consecutive national titles from 1901 to 1904, amassing a record of 41–0–1.  Yost also led Michigan to national titles in 1918 and 1923.  Yost was instrumental in the creation of Michigan Stadium and designed it to permit its expansion to expand to a capacity of over 150,000.  Yost's legacy also lives on with Yost Ice Arena, where Michigan's men's ice hockey team plays their home games.  Michigan football has won five more national titles since Yost permanently retired in 1926.  The Wolverines won back-to-back titles under Harry Kipke in 1932 and 1933 and two more consecutive championships under Fritz Crisler and Bennie Oosterbaan in 1947 and 1948.  Michigan won its most recent national title under Lloyd Carr in 1997.
Michigan's famous football coaches include: Yost, who came to Michigan from Stanford University in 1901,  Fritz Crisler, who guided Michigan to a pair of Big Ten Conference championships and the 1947 national title, has his name carried by the home of Michigan men's basketball team,  Bo Schembechler won 13 Big Ten titles in his 21 seasons as head coach between 1969 and 1989, the first in 1969 when he beat his friend and mentor Woody Hayes, beginning of "The Ten Year War" era of the Michigan – Ohio State football rivalry,  Lloyd Carr won five Big Ten titles in his 13 seasons at the helm and posted a winning percentage of .753.  His winning percentage of .779 in conference play trails only that of Schembechler in Michigan history,  Rich Rodriguez succeeded Carr following his retirement in 2007.  Rodriguez coached the Wolverines through the 2010 season, compiling a record of 15–22.
Michigan Stadium is the largest football-only stadium in the world, with an official capacity of 109,901.  Actual attendance, however, regularly exceeds that figure, and the stadium holds the NCAA single-game attendance record of 115,109, set on September 7, 2013 at Michigan's night game against Notre Dame.  After a series of expansions, the stadium's capacity has continued to end in "-01" to denote an "extra seat" in honor of Fritz Crisler.  Michigan Stadium has witnessed over 300 consecutive crowds of greater than 100,000, a streak that dates back to November 8, 1975.

====Rivalries====

Michigan has a major rivalry with Ohio State, considered one of the fiercest rivalries in American sports. In a pair of ESPN fan polls, in 2000 and 2003, the Michigan–Ohio State series was voted the greatest rivalry in sports in America.The 10 greatest rivalries (1-3-2005). ESPN.com Michigan's meeting with Ohio State is almost always the last game of the two schools' regular seasons and has provided many memorable contests, such as the "Snow Bowl" of 1950. The game has frequently decided the Big Ten Champion. Michigan leads the series 58–44–6. The contest on November 18, 2006 marked the first time ever these teams had been ranked No. 1 and No. 2 going into the game, and the first time they were both undefeated since 1973. The 2007 college football match-up between Ohio State and Michigan was predicted to be the No. 2 college football game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's "Top 20 Games To Watch in 2007" list.[tpl]cite web | title = Top 20 Games To Watch in 2007 | work = SI.com | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0708/top.cfb.games.watch/content.19.html | accessdate =  September 30, 2007[/tpl]
Michigan has an intrastate rival in Michigan State; the schools' football teams compete for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan leads the series 68–33–5.
Michigan also enjoys a spirited rivalry with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Michigan leads the series 23–16–1. The two schools are among the top college football programs in all-time wins (Michigan first, Notre Dame third) and winning percentage (Michigan first, Notre Dame second) in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), so it is perhaps fitting that when college football was in its infancy, students from the University of Michigan traveled to South Bend to teach the game to students there.
The Wolverines also have a tradition-rich history with the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The two football teams compete for the Little Brown Jug, a five-gallon jug with the respective schools' "M"s on either side and the scores of previous games down the middle. The Little Brown Jug was the first trophy played for between college football teams.  Through 2012, Michigan leads the Brown Jug series 68–22–3.

Heyliger is considered instrumental in getting the NCAA Tournament off the ground.

==Varsity Club Sports==

In 2000, athletic director Bill Martin announced the creation of a special level for sports at Michigan called Varsity Club status. The new system was established to recognize and increase support for club sports teams that have reached a level of budget, organization and competition that is similar to varsity levels. Varsity club squads are not necessarily closer to being elevated to full varsity status, and will remain for the time being primarily self-funded and administered through the Department of Recreational Sports. However, the designation will give these teams a closer relationship to the U-M athletic department.MGoBlue, Retrieved September 3, 2012. The Varsity Club status has proven to be a launching pad for sports to eventually become varsity sports at Michigan. In May 2011, Men's and Women's Lacrosse were officially granted varsity status. Men's Lacrosse began their first season of NCAA competition in 2012 while the Women's program will begin varsity competition in 2014.
