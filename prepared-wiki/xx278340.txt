==Reception==

IGN gave the game a 4/10.http://www.ign.com/games/nba-fastbreak-98-142150/ps-13735 They did praise the change from games using two dimensional sprites to 3D, as well as the actual NBA content (logos, players, uniforms, etc.) instead of being another generic basketball game. They did, however, criticize the gameplay as being "sluggish", citing that the "defense is always slower than the offense", making blocking difficult. They also criticized the crowd effect, comparing it to a "fizzled three-inch speaker". They commented that the referee whistle "sounds like a cricket" and remarked upon the poor quality of the rim sounds. They remarked this as being disappointing considering Midway's reputation for good sound effects.
Gamespot gave the game a 7.1/10, calling it a "good first attempt".http://www.gamespot.com/nba-fastbreak-98/reviews/nba-fastbreak-98-review-2548562/ They commented that the game is decent, but not the best.
