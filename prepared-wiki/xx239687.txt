Sorceror (1995-1998) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who broke down in the 1998 Jim Beam Stakes. Another horse, Time Limit, also broke down and was euthanized in that race.http://horseracing.about.com/library/weekly/aa040698.htm The three-year-old colt was trained by Hall of Famer Jack Van Berg and owned by Jim McIngvale, a Texas-based mattress manufacturer. McIngvale had just dismissed his three previous trainers, Nick Zito, Steve Moyer and Leonard Atkinson, in the past month.
Sorceror was a chestnut colt with a star on his forehead and his farm's silks were blue with white polka dots.
