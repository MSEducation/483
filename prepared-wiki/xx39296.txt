==History==

Kellogg College was the first home for part-time students at the University of Oxford and many of the students who join the college continue to work in their professions while they study. The college continues to champion ideals of access, openness and inclusivity.
The college came into being on 1 March 1990 (as Rewley House) and was named in honour of W. K. Kellogg on 1 October 1994, in recognition of the generous support given by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to the university over the preceding decades.  The college has close connections with the University Departments for Continuing Education, Medicine, Education, Computer Science, Law and other departments active in areas of professional and partâ€“time study. The college can trace its origins back to the start of university extension movement in the 1870s.
In 1878, Arthur Johnson[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] was the first to deliver an "Oxford Extension Lecture".Podcasts from the University of Oxford: Lectures and seminars, by guest lecturers, at Kellogg College. This turned into a movement which still flourishes. The movement grew out of a drive to liberalise Oxford which gained momentum in the 1850s. As a consequence, the university slowly began to open itself to religious nonconformists, poorer men, and women. It is this movement that forms the historical background of Kellogg. The  Oxford Extension movement is sometimes credited[tpl]who|date=October 2011[/tpl] for taking "Oxford to the masses". Lectures were given in town halls, public libraries and village school rooms across the country. The aim of the extension movement was twofold: social and political. It aimed at educating the larger community to achieve a better informed democracy.
