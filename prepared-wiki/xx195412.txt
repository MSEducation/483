The Boulder International Film Festival (BIFF), sponsored by the Colorado Film Society, is held annually on Presidents Day Weekend in Boulder, Colorado USA, and has developed a reputation as one of the most compelling young film festivals in the U.S., exhibiting a number of new-but-unknown feature films, documentaries, animations, and shorts that have gone on to significant box-office success and multiple Oscar nominations, including Monsieur Lazhar, Burma VJ, Revanche, Wasp, Miracle Fish, The Conscience of Nhem Eh, Waste Land, Incident in New Baghdad, Instead of Abracadabra, Raju, The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, West Bank Story, The Secret of Kells, 5 Broken Cameras, Chasing Ice, Curfew, Asad, The Missing Picture, and The Wind Rises. More than 23,600 filmmakers, national media, special guests and film enthusiasts attended the four-day BIFF 2014.
BIFF has shown the work of other honored filmmakers such as Danny Boyle, Jason Reitman, Daniel Junge, Helen Hunt, Marshall Curry, Luc Besson, and Lasse Halstrom.

==The Founding of BIFF==

The Festival was founded in 2004 by two sisters from Boulder, CO, filmmakers Kathy and Robin Beeck. Having traveled extensively to film festivals worldwide with their films, the Beeck sisters saw Boulder as the perfect venue for a new festival which celebrated "the bold spirit of independent filmmaking." With BIFF, the sisters created what they perceived as a "filmmaker's film festival." 
Festival co-creator Robin Beeck's secret to a great festival: “The theme of the festival is great storytelling. No matter what the budget, the mainstay has to be a wonderful, great story. We’ve got great stories that were expensive to make, and we have great stories that were made on a shoestring budget.”

==Colorado Film Society==

The Colorado Film Society (CFS), a non-profit umbrella organization, hosts the annual Film Festival.  CFS is dedicated to nurturing and growing the vibrant film arts community in Boulder and along the Front Range.  The mission of the CFS is to encourage and celebrate the art of film by creating a dynamic forum for artistic, social and cultural awareness in the community. The CFS offers four programs throughout the year: (1) the Boulder International Film Festival (BIFF); (2) the CFS Educational Outreach Program; (3) the CFS Community Resource Program; and (4) the CFS Film Series. 
The CFS also inspires tomorrow’s film artists through year-round educational outreach programs, including “World Cinema Days” which bring international film, filmmakers, and presentations to local students; through Schmoozers, networking events which provide a venue for people involved or interested in the film arts and industry to mix and mingle, and through the CFS Community Resource Program, which provides various forms of no-cost support, resources and mentorship to many arts organizations in Boulder County.

===2013===

Peter Fonda was BIFF's closing-night guest in 2013. BIFF's Singer/Songwriter Showcase really came into its own that year, and educational outreach programs such as the Youth Pavilion, CU @ BIFF (BIFF's college-level program in association with the University of Colorado), and expanded workshops and panels all attracted new crowds.

===2014===

Shirley MacLaine received the Career Achievement Award during her tribute at BIFF in 2014. For the first time ever, BIFF's fundraising FOOVIE (food and a movie) sold out and raised $15,000 for year-round BIFF programming. In addition, 2014 saw the release of an open-source Call 2 Action Toolkit that film festivals across the globe can use to easily adopt the festival's signature Call 2 Action program, joining the movement to harness the power of film for positive social change.

==Educational Outreach & Youth Advisory Council==

In keeping with its commitment to bringing independent films to a wider audience the Festival formed a Youth Advisory Council (YAC). The Council was founded in 2008 and is made up of 12-15 local film enthusiasts in grades 8-12. The Council represents a youth voice at the Festival and helps select films for its student film program, juries the student film category and helps organize and promote film opportunities for students in Boulder County.
In addition to its Youth Advisory Council, BIFF hosts several 'World Cinema Days' throughout the school year. Their goal is to keep students meaningfully engaged by screening thoughtful student appropriate documentaries, films and animation during unstructured days off such as teacher “professional development” or “in-service days.” And to help parents arrange activities for their child on these non-school days. Features a free film program, presentations and group discussion for students in grade 4 through 12. 
BIFF also works closely with the Boulder Public Library in offering free film to Boulder audiences through its 'Spotlight on BIFF' series at the Boulder Public Library Film Program in September, October, and November. The Spotlight includes ten “Best of the Fest” films and is free to students and the public.
