Whitesand Bay beach is popular with surfers. At high tide, the beach is divided into two: Sennen Cove beach to the south (more popular for its size, facilities and surf schools), and Gwynver beach to the north (more popular for its typically better surfing waves and walking distance of Trevedra Farm campsite). At the south end, at Sennen Cove, there are toilet facilities, a surf shop, a restaurant, and two car parks, one in a large field above the cliff, and another beside the beach. Dogs are banned on the beach from Easter Day to 1 October every year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecornishcoast.co.uk/nodogmap.htm |title=Beaches where dogs are banned Cornwall |publisher=Thecornishcoast.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25[/tpl] The South West Coast Path runs along the dunes behind the beach.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 'Explorer' map, sheet 102, ISBN 978-0-319-24016-8

==Natural history==

The west facing bay is backed by a [tpl]convert|38|ha|acre[/tpl] dune system which has developed from a limited supply of sand trapped within the shelter of the headlands, Pedn-mên-du (in the south) and Aire Point. The dunes contain the only British population of the shield bug Geotomus punctulatus which was first recorded here in 1864.[tpl]cite book|last=McDouall|first=Andrew|title=Land's End to Minehead Maritime Natural Area A nature conservation profile|year=undated|publisher=English Nature|location=Truro[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal|last=Dale|first=C W|title=Additions to list of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera|journal=Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society|year=1890|volume=3|pages=269-70[/tpl] G. punctulatus is a southern European species and associated with sparsely vegetated areas of loose sand and feeds on lady's bedstraw (Galium verum).[tpl]cite book|title=Red Data Book for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly|year=2009|publisher=Croceago Press|location=Praze-an-Beeble|isbn=978-1-901685-01-5|author=Alexander, Keith|edition=2nd|authorlink=Hemiptera|editor=In CISFBR|page=217[/tpl]
