The BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms (formerly the BBC Electric Proms) was an October music festival in London run by the BBC for five years, 2006–2010. On 31 January 2011, the BBC announced that the event would be discontinued with immediate effect due to financial cutbacks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/01_january/31/electric_proms.shtml |title= Statement on the BBC Electric Proms |publisher=BBC Press release |accessdate=31 January 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110202044647/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/01_january/31/electric_proms.shtml| archivedate= 2 February 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The name was taken from The Proms, a classical music festival running since 1895, and borrowed a few traditions from its counterpart such as the final night culminating in an interpretation of "Land of Hope and Glory". The musical performances at the festival typically involved Indie rock bands incorporating instruments outside of their usual arrangement, most commonly in the form of collaborations with the BBC Concert Orchestra.
Primarily the festival's headline acts played at The Roundhouse in Camden but events, which included a programme of film, were not limited to this venue. For example, acoustic events took place at Cecil Sharp House. In 2008 in acknowledgement of its status as European Capital of Culture, events were staged in both Liverpool and London.
In Australia, this program started airing on ABC2 from 1 May 2009 with episodes in a scattered order.[tpl]cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Airdate: BBC Electric Proms|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/04/airdate-bbc-electric-proms.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=16 April 2009|accessdate=4 October 2010[/tpl]
