Recoil is a free monthly news satire and entertainment tabloid published and distributed in West Michigan. The print magazine and its corresponding website, recoilmag.com, feature news and social satire as well as an entertainment section that includes exclusive interviews with international recording artists; local music features; music, book and movie reviews; an entertainment calendar; and monthly columnists covering food, beer, media awareness, health and studio recording.
Recoil is often compared to The Onion; both are satire magazines â€“ the distinction between the two being that Recoil focuses more on social satire than news satire. In 2002, Recoil was described by The New York Times as "The Onion of the Midwest" following Recoil's October 2002 satire story: "Martha Stewart Unveils New Line Of Prison Cell Housewares."
Recoil was founded in 2001 by Cliff and Kimberly Frantz (married).
