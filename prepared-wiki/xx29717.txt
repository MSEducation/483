[[Slow play (poker)]]

CATEGORIES: Poker gameplay and terminology, Poker strategy

Slow playing (also called sandbagging or trapping) is deceptive play in poker that is roughly the opposite of bluffing: betting weakly or passively with a strong holding rather than betting aggressively with a weak one.  The flat call is one such play.  The objective of the passive slow play is to lure opponents into a pot who might fold to a raise, or to cause them to bet more strongly than they would if the player had played aggressively (bet or raised). Slow playing sacrifices protection against hands that may improve and risks losing the pot-building value of a bet if the opponent also checks.

==Relationship between slow playing and bluffing==

Against observant opponents, the frequency of bluffing affects the effectiveness of slow playing, and vice versa. If a player's table image is that of an aggressive bluffer, slow playing is less important because his opponents will be more willing to call his usual bets and raises. Similarly, if a player is perceived as a "trappy" player (uses frequent slow plays), his bluffs are less likely to be respected (i.e., more likely to be called) because his opponents expect him to slow play his strong hands.[tpl]cite book | title = Harrington on Hold'em: Expert Strategy For No-Limit Tournaments; Volume II: Strategic Play | author = Dan Harrington and Bill Robertie | year = 2005 | publisher = Two Plus Two Publications | isbn = 1-880685-35-3[/tpl]

==Check raising as a slow play==

A check-raise is not necessarily a slow play.  Often, the purpose of a check-raise is to drive out opponents from a pot, which is the opposite of the goal of a slow play. However, within the context of a single betting round, check-raising can be employed as a slow play.
Even in games (such as California lowball) where the check-raise is not allowed, one can make other sandbagging plays such as just flat calling instead of raising with a very strong hand and then later raising.

==Fishing for the overcall==

Fishing for the overcall occurs when the last card a player is dealt makes him a very strong hand, an opponent in front of him bets, and there are more opponents yet to act behind him.  While the player might normally raise with his hand, just calling may encourage the opponents behind him to overcall when they would have folded to a raise.  For this play to be used profitably, one or more conditions like the following must be met:
A common example of fishing for overcalls occurs in High-low split games like Omaha hold 'em. If John is confident that Mary is betting a high hand, then John might flat call with his low hand to fish for overcalls rather than make it more difficult for opponents to call.  If John were to raise, he and Mary would gain no profit at all if no other opponents called.Sharing in high-low games by Steve Badger
