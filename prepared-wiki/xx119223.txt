[[2005–06 Scottish Premier League]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish Premier League seasons, 2005–06 in Scottish football leagues

The 2005–06 Scottish Premier League was won by Celtic, with a 17-point margin over their nearest challengers Hearts in the first season under the management of Gordon Strachan. Rangers, who finished third, failed to finish a Scottish top flight campaign as champions or runners-up for the first time since 1988.
As league champions, Celtic qualified for the UEFA Champions League, with runners-up Hearts also qualifying. This marked the first time since 1995 that a club outside the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers finished in the top two. Third-placed Rangers qualified for the UEFA Cup, as did Scottish Second Division champions Gretna, who took the Scottish Cup place despite losing the final to Hearts.
Livingston were relegated, and Scottish First Division winners St. Mirren were promoted.
Kris Boyd was the top scorer with 32 goals (17 for Rangers after 15 for Kilmarnock).
