==Life==

Jobst was presumably born in 1354 in Brno, Moravia. Upon his father's death in 1375 he ruled the March of Moravia often quarreling with his surviving brothers and also held the family castle Luxembourg. In 1388 Jobst became Margrave of Brandenburg, given in pawn by his cousin Sigismund, son of Charles IV, who focused on the Kingdom of Hungary.
After the death of German king Rupert in 1410, Jobst was elected successor by four of the electors on 1 October, opposing his cousin Sigismund who had already been elected by three electors on 10 September. Though Jobst had the greater support among the electors, he died on January 18, 1411, clearing the way for Sigismund's election as king and later Holy Roman Emperor.
