==History==

Volusia County was named after the then-largest-community, Volusia, when the Florida legislature divided Orange County on December 29, 1854. At the time, Volusia County had as few as 600 residents.[tpl]cite web|last=Scofield|first=Tom|title=What's in a name? Origins of Volusia|url=http://www.volusia.org/about-us/fast-facts.stml|publisher=Volusia County|accessdate=February 2, 2014[/tpl]
The origins of the word "Volusia" are unclear, though there are several theories:
The land area of present day Volusia County was inhabited by the indigenous Timucua, and Mayaca people . Neither group exists today as distinct racial entities, having been decimated by war and disease after contact with European settlers. Evidence of their habitation can still be seen in various areas of Volusia County such as the large shell middens at Tomoka State Park.
During the British occupation of Florida, a failed colony was started in southeast Volusia County by Andrew Turnbull, known as New Smyrna. This colony was connected to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, via the Kings Road. After the failure of the colony the settlers, many of Minorcan heritage made the [tpl]convert|70|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] journey to live in St. Augustine.
The Seminole Indians, descendants of the Creek tribe of Alabama and Georgia who resisted forced relocation to Indian Territory also camped in various parts of Volusia County. During the Second Seminole War (1836–1842) a large sugar plantation in what is today the city of Daytona Beach was burned by the Seminole.
On the east shore of the St. Johns River in Volusia, in present day DeBary, General Winfield Scott established a fort/depot in 1836 named Fort Florida.
