Ithaca Intersystems was a microcomputer manufacturer in the 1970s and 1980s, located in Ithaca, New York.  The early years drew on engineering talent from Cornell University when the founders worked in a small rented space in the Collegtown neighborhood adjacent to the university campus.  They initially produced the Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1 S-100 bus, Z80-based computer.  As a large commercial success, the company moved to larger spaces outside of town, and designed and produced a larger system, the Zilog Z8002-based DPS-8000.  This used the Coherent Unix operating system from Mark Williams Company. The company languished in the 1980s, not being part of the domination of the IBM PC and PC clones.
This was one of the last S100 computers to have front panel switches like the original Altair.
