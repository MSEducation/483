Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and tortuous (twisted). The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg,[tpl]cite web|title=Varicose Veins |date=2010-07-06 |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5r1PRrJul[/tpl] Mount Sinai Hospital, New York although varicose veins can occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or reflux). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the calf muscle pump mechanism), against the effects of gravity. When veins become varicose, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, varicose veins can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Life-threatening complications are uncommon, but varicose veins may be confused with deep vein thrombosis, which may be life-threatening.Żylaki – Przewlekła niewydolność żylna: Zakrzepica – Medycyna Praktyczna: Lekarze pacjentom.

Non-surgical treatments include sclerotherapy, elastic stockings, elevating the legs, and exercise. The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins. Newer, less invasive treatments  which seal the main leaking vein are available. Alternative techniques, such as ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation and endovenous laser treatment, are available as well. Because most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins, the superficial veins, which return only about 10% of the total blood of the legs, can usually be removed or ablated without serious harm.Merck Manual Home Edition, 2nd ed. Merck.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-02."Varicose veins". in Health Encyclopaedia. nhsdirect.nhs.uk
Secondary varicose veins are those developing as collateral pathways, typically after stenosis or occlusion of the deep veins, a common sequel of extensive deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Treatment options are usually support stockings, occasionally sclerotherapy, and rarely limited surgery.
Varicose veins are distinguished from reticular veins (blue veins) and telangiectasias (spider veins), which also involve valvular insufficiency,[tpl]cite journal |author=Weiss RA, Weiss MA |title=Doppler ultrasound findings in reticular veins of the thigh subdermic lateral venous system and implications for sclerotherapy |journal=J Dermatol Surg Oncol |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=947–51 |year=1993|pmid=8408914 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1993.tb00983.x [/tpl] by the size and location of the veins.  Many patients who suffer with varicose veins seek out the assistance of physicians who specialize in vein care or peripheral vascular disease. These physicians include vascular surgeons, phlebologists or interventional radiologists.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Clinical Tests===

Clinical tests that may be used include:

===Investigations===

Traditionally, varicose veins were only investigated using imaging techniques if there was a clinical suspicion of deep venous insufficiency, if they were recurrent, or if they involved the sapheno-popliteal junction. This practice is not now widely accepted. All patients with varicose veins should now be investigated using Duplex doppler ultrasound scanning. The results from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the follow up of patients with and without routine Duplex scan has shown a significant difference in recurrence rate and reoperation rate at 2 and 7 years of follow up. .Blomgren L, Johansson G, Emanuelsson L, Dahlberg-Åkerman A, Thermaenius P, Bergqvist D.  Late follow-up of a randomized trial of routine duplex imaging before varicose vein surgery. Br J Surg. 2011 Aug;98(8):1112-6. [tpl]doi|10.1002/bjs.7579[/tpl].

===Complications===

Most varicose veins are reasonably benign, but severe varicosities can lead to major complications, due to the poor circulation through the affected limb. 

==Stages==

==Causes==

Varicose veins are more common in women than in men, and are linked with heredity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ng M, Andrew T, Spector T, Jeffery S | title = Linkage to the FOXC2 region of chromosome 16 for varicose veins in otherwise healthy, unselected sibling pairs | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15744037 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.2004.024075 | pmc = 1736007[/tpl] Other related factors are pregnancy, obesity, menopause, aging, prolonged standing, leg injury, and abdominal straining. Varicose veins are unlikely to be caused by crossing the legs or ankles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/health_articles/myth-or-fact-crossing-your-legs-causes-varicose-veins|title=Myth or Fact: Crossing Your Legs Causes Varicose Veins|author=Kate Griesmann|publisher=Duke University Health System|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2014[/tpl]
Less commonly, but not exceptionally, varicose veins can be due to other causes, as post phlebitic obstruction or incontinence, venous and arteriovenous malformationsFranceschi, Claude (1996) "Physiopathologie Hémodynamique de l'Insuffisance veineuse", p. 49 in Chirurgie des veines des Membres Inférieurs, AERCV editions 23 rue Royale 75008 Paris France.
Varicose veins could also be caused by elevated levels of homocysteine in the body can degrade and inhibit the formation of the three main structural components of the artery, collagen, elastin and the proteoglycans. Homocysteine permanently degrades cysteine disulfide bridges and lysine amino acid residues in proteins, gradually affecting function and structure. Simply put, homocysteine is a 'corrosive' of long-living proteins, i.e. collagen or elastin, or lifelong proteins, i.e. fibrillin. These long-term effects are difficult to establish in clinical trials focusing on groups with existing artery decline.

==Treatment==

===Conservative===

The symptoms of varicose veins can be controlled to an extent with the following:

===Active===

Active medical intervention in varicose veins can be divided into surgical and non-surgical treatments. Some doctors favor traditional open surgery, while others prefer the newer methods. 
Newer methods for treating varicose veins such as Endovenous Thermal Ablation (endovenous laser treatment or radiofrequency ablation), and foam sclerotherapy are not as well studied, especially in the longer term."Open Surgery Is Still The Best Technique To Ablate The Great Saphenous Vein Vascular, Vol. 14 (November 2006), Suppl. 1, p. S. 25[tpl]cite journal|title=Systematic review of foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins|pmid=17636511|year=2007|last1=Jia|first1=X|last2=Mowatt|first2=G|last3=Burr|first3=JM|last4=Cassar|first4=K|last5=Cook|first5=J|last6=Fraser|first6=C|volume=94|issue=8|pages=925–36|doi=10.1002/bjs.5891|journal=The British journal of surgery[/tpl]

====Surgical====

Several techniques have been performed for over a century, from the more invasive saphenous stripping, to less invasive procedures like ambulatory phlebectomy and CHIVA.

=====Stripping=====

Stripping consists of removal of all or part the saphenous vein (great/long or lesser/short) main trunk. The complications include deep vein thrombosis (5.3%),[tpl]cite journal |author=van Rij AM, Chai J, Hill GB, Christie RA |title=Incidence of deep vein thrombosis after varicose vein surgery |journal=Br J Surg |volume=91 |issue=12 |pages=1582–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15386324 |doi=10.1002/bjs.4701 [/tpl] pulmonary embolism (0.06%), and wound complications including infection (2.2%). There is evidence for the Great Saphenous Vein growing back again after stripping.[tpl]cite journal |author=Munasinghe A, Smith C, Kianifard B, Price BA, Holdstock JM, Whiteley MS |title=Strip-tract revascularization after stripping of the great saphenous vein |journal=Br J Surg |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=840–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17410557 |doi=10.1002/bjs.5598 [/tpl] For traditional surgery, reported recurrence rates, which have been tracked for 10 years, range from 5–60%. In addition, since stripping removes the saphenous main trunks, they are no longer available for use as venous bypass grafts in the future (coronary or leg artery vital disease)[tpl]cite journal |author=Hammarsten J, Pedersen P, Cederlund CG, Campanello M |title=Long saphenous vein saving surgery for varicose veins. A long-term follow-up |journal=Eur J Vasc Surg |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=361–4 |year=1990  |pmid=2204548 |doi= 10.1016/S0950-821X(05)80867-9[/tpl]

=====Other=====

Other surgical treatments are: 

====Non-surgical treatment====

=====Sclerotherapy management=====

A commonly performed non-surgical treatment for varicose and "spider" leg veins is sclerotherapy in which medicine (sclerosant) is injected into the veins to make them shrink. The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol (POL), sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS), Sclerodex (Canada), Hypertonic Saline, Glycerin and Chromated Glycerin.  STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) and Polidocanol (branded Asclera in the United States, Aethoxysklerol in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial. Sclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years. Sclerotherapy is often used for telangiectasias (spider veins) and varicose veins that persist or recur after vein stripping.Pak, L. K. et al. "Veins & Lymphatics," in Lange's Current Surgical Diagnosis & Treatment, 11th ed., McGraw-Hill. Sclerotherapy can also be performed using foamed sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great saphenous and small saphenous veins.Thibault, Paul (2007) Sclerotherapy and Ultrasound-Guided Sclerotherapy, The Vein Book, John J. Bergan (ed.).[tpl]cite journal|author=Padbury A, Benveniste G L|title=Foam echosclerotherapy of the small saphenous vein|journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Phlebology|volume=8|issue=1|date=December 2004[/tpl] A study by Kanter and Thibault in 1996 reported a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kanter A, Thibault P |title=Saphenofemoral incompetence treated by ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy |journal=Dermatol Surg |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=648–52 |year=1996 |pmid=8680788 |doi= 10.1016/1076-0512(96)00173-2[/tpl] A Cochrane Collaboration review[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001732.pub2|chapter=Injection sclerotherapy for varicose veins|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2006|last1=Tisi|first1=Paul V|last2=Beverley|first2=Catherine|last3=Rees|first3=Angie|editor1-last=Tisi|editor1-first=Paul V|pmid=17054141|issue=4|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|pages=CD001732[/tpl] concluded sclerotherapy was better than surgery in the short term (1 year) for its treatment success, complication rate and cost, but surgery was better after 5 years, although the research is weak.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rigby KA, Palfreyman SJ, Beverley C, Michaels JA |editor1-last=Rigby |editor1-first=Kathryn A |title=Surgery versus sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev  |issue=4 |pages=CD004980 |year=2004 |pmid=15495134 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004980 [/tpl] 
A Health Technology Assessment found that sclerotherapy provided less benefit than surgery, but is likely to provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux.[tpl]cite journal |author=Michaels JA |title=Randomised clinical trial, observational study and assessment of cost-effectiveness of the treatment of varicose veins (REACTIV trial) |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=10 |issue=13 |pages=1–196, iii–iv |year=2006 |pmid=16707070|url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ1013.htm|author2=Campbell WB |author3=Brazier JE |last4=MacIntyre |first4=JB |last5=Palfreyman |first5=SJ |last6=Ratcliffe |first6=J |last7=Rigby |first7=K[/tpl] This Health Technology Assessment monograph includes reviews of the epidemiology, assessment, and treatment of varicose veins, as well as a study on clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery and sclerotherapy. Complications of sclerotherapy are rare but can include blood clots and ulceration. Anaphylactic reactions are "extraordinarily rare but can be life-threatening," and doctors should have resuscitation equipment ready.Finkelmeier, William R. (2004) "Sclerotherapy", Ch. 12 in ACS Surgery: Principles & Practice, WebMD, ISBN 097483274X.[tpl]cite journal |author=Scurr JR, Fisher RK, Wallace SB |title=Anaphylaxis Following Foam Sclerotherapy: A Life Threatening Complication of Non Invasive Treatment For Varicose Veins |journal=EJVES Extra |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=87–89 |year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.ejvsextra.2007.02.005[/tpl] There has been one reported case of stroke after ultrasound guided sclerotherapy when an unusually large dose of sclerosant foam was injected.

=====Endovenous thermal ablation=====

The Australian Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) in 2008 has determined that endovenous laser treatment/ablation (ELA) for varicose veins "appears to be more effective in the short term, and at least as effective overall, as the comparative procedure of junction ligation and vein stripping for the treatment of varicose veins."Medical Services Advisory Committee, ELA for varicose veins. MSAC application 1113, Dept of Health and Ageing, Commonwealth of Australia, 2008. It also found in its assessment of available literature, that "occurrence rates of more severe complications such as DVT, nerve injury and paraesthesia, post-operative infections and haematomas, appears to be greater after ligation and stripping than after EVLT". Complications for ELA include minor skin burns (0.4%)[tpl]cite journal |author=Elmore FA, Lackey D |title=Effectiveness of ELA in eliminating superficial venous reflux |journal=Phlebology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=21–31 |year=2008 |pmid=18361266 |doi= 10.1258/phleb.2007.007019[/tpl] and temporary paraesthesia (2.1%). The longest study of endovenous laser ablation is 39 months.
Two prospective randomized trials found speedier recovery and fewer complications after radiofrequency ablation (ERA) compared to open surgery.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rautio TT, Perälä JM, Wiik HT, Juvonen TS, Haukipuro KA |title=Endovenous obliteration with radiofrequency-resistive heating for greater saphenous vein insufficiency: a feasibility study |journal=J Vasc Interv Radiol |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=569–75 |year=2002|pmid=12050296 |doi= 10.1016/S1051-0443(07)61649-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lurie F |title=Prospective randomised study of endovenous radiofrequency obliteration (closure) versus ligation and vein stripping (EVOLVeS): two-year follow-up |journal=Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=67–73 |year=2005 |pmid=15570274 |doi=10.1016/j.ejvs.2004.09.019|author2=Creton D |author3=Eklof B |last4=Kabnick |first4=L.S. |last5=Kistner |first5=R.L. |last6=Pichot |first6=O. |last7=Sessa |first7=C. |last8=Schuller-Petrovic |first8=S.[/tpl] Myers[tpl]cite journal|author=Myers, Kenneth |title=An opinion — surgery for small saphenous reflux is obsolete!|journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Phlebology|volume=8|issue=1|date=December 2004[/tpl] wrote that open surgery for small saphenous vein reflux is obsolete. Myers said these veins should be treated with endovenous techniques, citing high recurrence rates after surgical management, and risk of nerve damage up to 15%. In comparison, ERA has been shown to control 80% of cases of small saphenous vein reflux at 4 years, said Myers. Complications for ERA include burns, paraesthesia, clinical phlebitis, and slightly higher rates of deep vein thrombosis (0.57%) and pulmonary embolism (0.17%). One 3-year study compared ERA, with a recurrence rate of 33%, to open surgery, which had a recurrence rate of 23%.
ELA and ERA require specialized training for doctors and expensive equipment. ELA is performed as an outpatient procedure and does not require the use of an operating theatre, nor does the patient need a general anaesthetic. Doctors must use high frequency ultrasound during the procedure to visualize the anatomical relationships between the saphenous structures. Some practitioners also perform phlebectomy or ultrasound guided sclerotherapy at the time of endovenous treatment. Follow-up treatment to smaller branch varicose veins is often needed in the weeks or months after the initial procedure.
