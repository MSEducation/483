Douglas B. Lenat (born in 1950) is the CEO of Cycorp, Inc. of Austin, Texas, and has been a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (with his AM and Eurisko programs), knowledge representation, blackboard systems, and "ontological engineering" (with his Cyc program at MCC and at Cycorp).  He has also worked in military simulations and published a critique of conventional random-mutation Darwinism[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] based on his experience with Eurisko. Lenat was one of the original Fellows of the AAAI.
Lenat's quest, in the Cyc project, is to build the basis of a general artificial intelligence by manually representing knowledge in the formal language, CycL, based on extensions to first-order predicate calculus.

==Background==

At the University of Pennsylvania, Lenat received his Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics, and his  Master's degree in Applied Mathematics in 1972.  He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University (published in Knowledge-based systems in artificial intelligence, along with the Ph.D. thesis of Randall Davis, McGraw-Hill, 1982) in 1976. His advisor was Professor Edward Feigenbaum.
In 1976 Lenat started teaching at Carnegie Mellon and commenced his work on Eurisko, but returned to Stanford in a teaching role in 1978.  His continuing work on Eurisko led to attention in 1982 from DARPA and MCC in Austin, Texas.  In 1984 he left Stanford to commence work on Cyc,[ref]
