The Madagascan Owl (Asio madagascariensis) also known as the Madagascan Long-eared Owl, is a medium sized owl endemic to the island of Madagascar. It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the Long-eared Owl, Asio otus.[tpl]cite book |title=Distribution and Taxonomy of Birds of the World |first1=Charles Gald |last1=Sibley |first2=Burt Leavelle |last2=Monroe |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=182 |isbn=0-300-04969-2[/tpl]  It ranges from [tpl]convert|40|â€“|50|cm|in[/tpl] in length, making it the largest of the country's owls; females are larger than males.[tpl]cite book |title=Birds of Madagascar: A Photographic Guide |last1=Morris |first1=Pete |last2=Hawkins |first2=Frank |year=1998 |publisher=Pica Press |location=Mountfield, East Sussex, UK |isbn=1-873403-45-3 |page=204[/tpl]
Its upperparts, crown and nape are brownish-black while its underparts are buff with black streaking. It has a brown facial disk, black bill and orange eyes. Its long ear tufts are dark brown, flecked with tan, matching the head.
Its call is usually a series of barks, varying in pitch and volume, but sometimes it will utter a series of more hoot-like notes, described by some as ulooh.
It is generally found at elevations ranging from sea level to [tpl]convert|1600|m|ft[/tpl], though it occasionally ranges as high as [tpl]convert|1800|m|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |title=Owls of the World: Their Lives, Behavior and Survival |first=James R. |last=Duncan |year=2003 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Richmond Hill, Ontario |isbn=1-55297-845-1 |page=287[/tpl]  It inhabits a variety of woodland habitats.
Like most owls, the Madagascan Owl is nocturnal, roosting by day in dense foliage.  It feeds mainly on small mammals, hunting either in the forest or in open areas nearby.
Little is known about its breeding biology. It is thought to lay its eggs in stick nests created by other animals.
