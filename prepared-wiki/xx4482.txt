Human sexual activity, or human sexual practice or human sexual behavior, is the manner in which humans experience and express their sexuality. People engage in a variety of sexual acts from time to time, and for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity normally results in sexual arousal and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity also includes conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners (mating and display behavior), and personal interactions between individuals, such as flirting and foreplay.
Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, emotional, behavioral and biological aspects; this includes personal bonding, shared emotions during sexual activity, and physiological processes such as the reproductive system, the sex drive and sexual intercourse and sexual behavior in all its forms.
In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, although premarital and extramarital sex are also common. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries, and some are considered against the norms of a society. For example, sexual assault, as well as sexual activity with a person below some locally determined age of consent, are criminal offenses in most jurisdictions.

==Types==

Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways. It can be divided into acts which involve one person, such as masturbation, or two or more people such as vaginal sex, anal sex, oral sex or mutual masturbation. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as group sex. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of dildos, vibrators, anal beads, and other sex toys, though these devices can also be used with a partner.
Sexual activity can be classified into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, casual sex partners or anonymous. Sexual activity can be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, urolagnia, and/or BDSM activities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships|publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=2013-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better.

The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items.
Sexual activity can also be consensual or under force or duress, or lawful/illegal or otherwise contrary to social norms or generally accepted sexual morals. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual activity==

The physiological responses during sexual activity are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.[tpl]cite book | authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M.

Sexual dysfunction is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.Kontula, O & Mannila, E (2009). Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire. Routledge , 46(1). retrieved 20 August 2012, from here. In the media, sexual dysfunction is often associated with men, but in actuality, it is more commonly observed in females (43 percent) than males (31 percent).Jha, S., & Thakar, R. (2010).

==Reasons for sexual activity==

People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity.Meston & Buss, 2007.
Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from sexual arousal, especially if they can achieve orgasm. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from foreplay and flirting, and from fetish or BDSM activities,[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better.

Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the sexual desire generated by a person to whom they feel sexual attraction; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of casual or social sex.Definition from Dictionary.com - Casual sex At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.
Also, a person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of conception. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten sexual tension, attraction and interest.[tpl]Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3[/tpl][tpl]Cite book | last=Institute | first=American Film | year=1997 | title=The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures produced in the United States, Volume 1, Part 2 | edition=reprint | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0-520-20970-1 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1k1RsGvFwwC  | page=369 [/tpl]
It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. Joan Roughgarden, in her book Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People, postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.[tpl]Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=University of California Press | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC&dq | isbn=0-520-24073-1[/tpl]

==Frequency==

The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero (sexual abstinence) to 15 or 20 times a week.Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.[ref]
