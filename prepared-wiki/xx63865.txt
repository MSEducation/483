Douglas McGarel Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham PC (28 February 1872–16 August 1950) was a British lawyer and Conservative politician.

==Background==

Hogg was the son of the merchant and philanthropist Quintin Hogg, seventh son of Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet (see Hogg Baronets). He was educated at Eton College and then studied sugar growing in the West Indies. After serving in the Boer War he was called to the Bar in 1902.

==Political career==

He was one of the foremost advocates of his age and as Attorney-General guided the Trade Disputes Act of 1927 through the House of Commons after the general strike of 1926 which had ended with large-scale unemployment while those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages, and district wage agreements. The Trade Disputes and Trade Union Act made mass picketing and all sympathetic strikes illegal and directed that union members had to contract into any political levy. It also forbade civil service unions from affiliating with the Trades Union Congress.
Hogg was a bencher of Lincoln's Inn and served as Lord Chancellor in the UK Conservative governments of 1928-29 and 1935-1938.[tpl]cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|year=1983|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|page=402|isbn=0-297-78245-2|oclc=9909629|quote=It was thus that on the morning of 20 January 1936, three members of the Privy Council came down to Sandringham...

==Family==

Lord Hailsham married Elizabeth (Brown) Marjoribanks, widow of Archibald Marjoribanks, and daughter of James Trimble Brown, in 1905, and they had two sons, including Quintin Hogg, Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone.  His grandson is Douglas Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham
