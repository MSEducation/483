Marstrand is a seaside locality situated in Kungälv Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 1,319 inhabitants in 2010. It has held city privileges since 1200. The most striking feature about Marstrand is the 17th-century fortress Carlsten, named after King Carl X Gustav of Sweden. The town got its name from its location on the island Marstrandsön. Recently the town has expanded to the neighbouring island Koön, which has bridge access to the mainland.
During the last quarter of the 18th century Marstrand had the free port status, granted by the King Gustav III. Marstrand is a popular sailing resort in summer time. It is also the venue of the annual Match Cup Sweden, a match race sailing competition.
Administratively Marstrand and its immediately surrounding islands constituted a city municipality of its own up until the local government reform in 1971, when it was merged into Kungälv Municipality.
Marstrand is, despite its small population, for historical reasons often still referred to as a city. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.
