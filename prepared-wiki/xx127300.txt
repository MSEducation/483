[[The Skull (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Trouble albums, 1985 albums, Metal Blade Records albums

The Skull is the second album by the American doom metal band Trouble, released in 1985. It was the follow-up to their 1984 classic debut Psalm 9.
Trouble gained critical recognition for The Skull and a successful tour followed. However, the album reflected singer Eric Wagner's struggles with substance abuse as well as growing turmoil within the group. This led to the departure of bassist Sean McAllister; he was replaced by Ron Holzner, who would remain with the band until their 2002 reunion. In early 1986, shortly after The Skull tour began, drummer Jeff Olson would also leave to attend college and the band regrouped with a new lineup later that year. Olson would reunite with Trouble in 1993 and play on the Plastic Green Head album, which was released two years later.
The album has been released for CD on four occasions: in 1990 by Enigma Records; again in 1991 by Metal Blade; remastered using the original master tapes and reissued again by Metal Blade in 1994; and again remastered and reissued by Escapi Music in October 2006, with a bonus DVD.
