Dos is the second album of Latin rap artist Gerardo.  It was released on September 15, 1992 on Interscope Records.  Unlike Mo' Ritmo, Gerardo's Dos was critically panned.  Alex Henderson, for instance, wrote that "this sophomore effort was a disappointment."  Likewise, Ron Wynn from Allmusic said in regards to Gerardo trying to follow up to the same success of Mo' Ritmo, "that you can only ride a fluke so long."
However, the album contains "Ven Michu Michu", a Spanish version of "Here Kitty Kitty", also from the album. A video was made for the song, and it is one of Gerardo's better known songs.
