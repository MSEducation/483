==History==

Founded in 1959, Norma Tallinn was one of the biggest football clubs in Estonian SSR. The club participated in 32 Estonian SSR championships (more than any other team), winning the title on five occasions, as well as winning six Estonian SSR Cup titles.
After Estonia regained its independence in 1991, Norma joined the newly formed Estonian Meistriliiga. Alongside their rivals Lantana Tallinn (Nikol Tallinn back then), the club became very popular among the ethnic Russian minority in Estonia. Norma won the first two Meistriliiga titles.
In 1994, Norma finished level on points with Flora Tallinn and according to the rules, had to play in a championship playoff, but, as a protest against the disqualification of Tevalte Tallinn because of match fixing allegations, Norma decided to field their youth squad. Flora won the playoff 5-2.
The following season Norma Tallinn were relegated to the Esiliiga.
