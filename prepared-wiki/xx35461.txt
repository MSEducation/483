Transport puzzles are logistical puzzles, which often represent real-life transport problems.

==Description==

In transport puzzles you move persons and/or objects through a given landscape. As in rearrangement puzzles, no piece is ever lost or added to the board. In contrast to rearrangement puzzles, however, transport puzzles have all persons and objects follow certain routes given on the board; they cannot be lifted off the board and placed on faraway positions that have no visible connection to the from-position. Hence transport puzzles often mean that the player has to move (physical) objects in a very restricted space. The player may or may not be part of the game (either directly, or as a player character on the board).

==Types of transport puzzles==

==Literature==

The famous British puzzler Henry Dudeney added several puzzles to this category.
