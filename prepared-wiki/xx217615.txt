The plight of its inhabitants worsened when, in November of that year, the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] unsuccessfully attempted to wrest the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] from Armenian control.<ref>Hovannisian. ''Republic of Armenia'', pp. 207-234.</ref>
Matters came to a head on December 17, when a frenzied Muslim mob, made up of locals and refugees fleeing from the fighting in Zangezur, made its way to Lower Agulis and began to attack its Armenian inhabitants, forcing them to retreat to the upper town.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, p. 235. On December 24, the mob, joined by the local Azerbaijani gendarmerie, entered Upper Agulis and started to pillage the town. They then proceeded to massacre its Armenian population, leaving Upper Agulis in smoldering ruins the next day. According to the Armenian government, up to 400 Armenians were killed in Lower Agulis and up to 1,000 in Upper Agulis.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, pp. 236-238. The town was partially rebuilt during the Soviet period.
