[[Estrildid finch]]

CATEGORIES: Estrildidae, Bird families

The estrildid finches are small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They can be classified as the family Estrildidae (weaver-finch), or as a subfamily within the family Passeridae, which strictly defined comprises the Old World sparrows.[tpl]cite book |title=Systematics and Taxonomy of Australian Birds|author=Christidis L, Boles WE |year=2008 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-643-06511-6 |page=177[/tpl]
They are gregarious and often colonial seed-eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colours and patterns.
All the estrildids build large, domed nests and lay 5–10 white eggs. Many species build roost nests. Some of the fire-finches and pytilias are hosts to the brood-parasitic indigobirds and whydahs, respectively.
Most are sensitive to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few have  adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia.
The smallest species of the family is the Shelley's Oliveback (Nesocharis shelleyi) at a mere [tpl]convert|8.3|cm|in[/tpl], although the lightest species is the Black-rumped Waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes) at [tpl]convert|6|g|abbr=on[/tpl]. The largest species is the Java Sparrow (Padda oryzivora), at [tpl]convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|25|g|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Evolution==

The phylogeography and possible origin of estrildid finches have been studied. The following scheme may be useful to represent an hypothetical origin in India in the last and stronger Himalayas uplift (16.5 million years ago), when monsoon rains regime established in India (see figure). The conclusions from this study[tpl]cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=A|coauthors= Gómez-Prieto P, Ruiz-de-Valle V|title= Phylogeography of finches and sparrows|journal=Nova Science Publishers|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-60741-844--3|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=13642[/tpl] are:
