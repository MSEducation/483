[[Lithuania and the euro]]

CATEGORIES: Euro by country, Coins of Lithuania, Lithuania and the European Union

Lithuania is an EU member state, and as such also a member of the Economic and Monetary Union. Its currency, the  litas, has been pegged to the euro at 3.4528 litas to 1 euro since 2002, and it has been part of ERM II since 28 June 2004, shortly after the country joined the EU on 1 May 2004.
Generally high inflation, which reached a peak of 12.7% in June 2008ECB: Inflation and the euro (well above the 4.2% limit of the time),[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/?doc=7800 | title=SEB: no euro for Lithuania before 2013 | publisher=The Baltic Course | accessdate=22 December 2008[/tpl] has delayed Lithuania's adoption of the euro. In February 2013, the government of Lithuania approved a plan for euro adoption in 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.15min.lt/en/article/politics/lithuanian-government-endorses-euro-introduction-plan-526-310363|title= Lithuanian government endorses euro introduction plan|date=2013-02-25|accessdate=2013-03-03|publisher=15 min[/tpl] This would make it the last of the three Baltic States to adopt the euro, after Estonia (2011) and Latvia (2014). However, Lithuania has not yet met all the economic criteria necessary to join the euro.

==Status==

All members of the European Union, except Denmark and the UK, are required by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. In March 2006, Lithuania requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the euro. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met 4 of the 5 criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that "there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation."[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/622&format=PDF&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|title=Commission assesses the state of convergence in Lithuania|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2014-01-12|publisher=European Commission[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/euro/euro-zone-slovenia-lithuania-hold/article-155340|title=Euro zone: Slovenia in, Lithuania on hold|date=2006-05-16|accessdate=2014-01-12[/tpl]  Lithuania is the only country to be rejected in the attempt to adopt the euro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a0ca35e0-54f9-11e3-86bc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2q2ZBK2f1|title=Lithuania shows rare enthusiasm for eurozone membership|date=2013-12-30|accessdate=2014-01-12|last1=Milne|first1=Richard|last2=Spiegel|first2=Peter|publisher=Financial Times[/tpl]
According to figures from the Bank of Lithuania, Lithuania had met 4 out of the 5 criteria by October 2013, the exception being the government deficit of 3.2% of GDP, exceeding the limit of 3.0%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lb.lt/convergence_criteria_and_their_implementation|title=Euro adoption criteria and their implementation|accessdate=2014-01-12|publisher=Bank of Lithuania[/tpl] The Lithuanian government expected this to decline to 2.9% by the first quarter of 2014. In April 2014, the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave their preliminary consent for Lithuania to join the eurozone on 1 January 2015, having concluded that the country was complying with all the criteria according to economic data from the first months of 2014.[tpl]cite web|author=Lietuvos Bankas|title=The European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs preliminary approved of the euro adoption in Lithuania|url=https://www.lb.lt/the_european_parliaments_committee_on_economic_and_monetary_affairs_preliminary_approved_of_the_euro_adoption_in_lithuania|accessdate=20 April 2014|date=8 April 2014[/tpl]  It is expected that a final assessment regarding the compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be released by the European Commission and the European Central Bank in June 2014, with a final decision by late July.[tpl]cite web|author=Lietuvos Bankas|title=V.

==Lithuanian euro design==

The proposed design of the Lithuanian euro coins share a similar national side for all denominations, featuring the Vytis symbol and the name of the country, "Lietuva".  The design was announced on 11 November 2004 following a public opinion poll conducted by the Bank of Lithuania.  It was created by the sculptor Antanas Å½ukauskas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/about-the-euro-adoption-in-lithuania/euro-banknotes-and-coins/|title=Euro Banknotes and Coins|accessdate=2014-01-12[/tpl]  The only difference between the coins is that the one and two euro coins have vertical lines on the outer circle, the fifty, twenty and ten cent coins have horizontal lines on the outer circle, and the five, two and one cent coins have no lines on the outer circle.  In January 2014 it was announced that all coins will have "2015" printed on them to display the year of Lithuania's euro adoption. The Lithuanian Mint has been chosen to mint the coins.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.lb.lt/projects_for_lithuanian_euro_coins_already_bear_the_year_2015|title=Projects for Lithuanian euro coins already bear the year 2015|publisher=Bank of Lithuania|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=9 March 2014[/tpl] Lithuania's parliament is expected to approve a euro changeover law in the spring of 2014,[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] and will subsequently be subject to an assessment by the ECB and the European Commission for its compliance with all euro adoption convergence criteria in its biennial report in May/June 2014. If approved, Lithuania will adopt the euro on 1 January 2015.

==Public opinion==

A poll by Eurobarometer in April 2013 found that 41% of Lithuanians supported switching to the euro, while 55% were opposed.  This was a decrease in support of 3% from a year earlier.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_377_en.pdf|title=Introduction of the euro in the more recently acceded member states|date=2013-04|accessdate=2014-03-27|publisher=Eurobarometer|pages=66[/tpl]
