==History==

The Shiosai service was introduced from 10 March 1975 following the completion of electrification of the Sōbu Main Line in October 1974, using 9-car 183 series EMUs, replacing five of the seven daily diesel-powered [tpl]Nihongo|Inubō|犬吠[/tpl] express services that operated between [tpl]ja-stalink|Shinjuku[/tpl]/[tpl]ja-stalink|Ryōgoku[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Chōshi[/tpl].[tpl]cite book| last = Teramoto | first = Mitsuteru | title = 国鉄・ＪＲ列車名大辞典 |trans_title= JNR & JR Train Name Encyclopedia| publisher = Chuoshoin Publishing Co., Ltd. | date = July 2001 | location = Tokyo, Japan | page = | isbn = 4-88732-093-0[/tpl]
From the start of the November 1982 timetable revision, further 183 series EMUs were drafted in, displaced from Toki limited express services following the opening of the Joetsu Shinkansen,[tpl]cite book |title = JR特急列車年鑑2013 |trans_title= Limited Express Annual 2013| publisher = Ikaros Publications Ltd. | date = 20 December 2012 | location = Tokyo, Japan | page = 166| isbn = 978-4-86320-654-0[/tpl] and the remaining Inubō express services were discontinued and absorbed into the Shiosai services, giving seven return workings daily.
From the start of the revised timetable on 10 December 2005, 255 series 9-car EMUs were introduced on Shiosai services. From the same date, services were made entirely no-smoking.
