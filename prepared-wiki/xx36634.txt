A hospital ship is a ship designated for primary function as a floating medical treatment facility or hospital.  Most are operated by the military forces (mostly navies) of various countries, as they are intended to be used in or near war zones.Hospital Ship (definition via WordNet, Princeton University)
Although attacking a hospital ship is a war crime, belligerent navies are entitled the right to board such ships for inspections.

==History==

Such ships possibly existed in ancient times. The Athenian Navy had a ship named Therapia, and the Roman Navy had a ship named Aesculapius, their names indicating that they may have been hospital ships. During the 17th century, it became customary for naval squadrons to be accompanied by special vessels with the job of taking in the wounded after each engagement. On 8 December 1798, unfit for service as a warship, HMS Victory was ordered to be converted to a hospital ship to hold wounded French and Spanish prisoners of war. 
According to Edward Hasted in 1798, two large hospital ships (also called lazarettos), (which were the surviving hulks of forty-four gun ships) were moored in Halstow Creek in Kent. The creek is an inlet from the River Medway and the River Thames.  The hospital ships watched over ships coming to England which were forced to stay in the creek under quarantine to protect the country from infectious diseases including the plague.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hasted |first=Edward |year=1799 |title=Parishes |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62945 |journal=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |volume=6 |pages=34–40 |accessdate=28 February 2014[/tpl]
Another early example of a hospital ship was USS Red Rover in the 1860s, which aided the wounded soldiers of both sides during the American Civil War. It was the sighting by the Japanese of the Russian hospital ship Orel, correctly illuminated in accordance with regulations, that led to the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War.  Orel was retained as a prize of war by the Japanese after the battle. During World War I and World War II, some passenger liners were converted for use as hospital ships. RMS Aquitania and HMHS Britannic were two examples of ships serving in this capacity.
The last British royal yacht, the post World War II HMY Britannia, was ostensibly constructed in a way as to be easily convertible to a hospital ship, but this is now thought to be largely a ruse to ensure Parliamentary funding, and she never served in this role – reputedly her lifts were too small to take standard-sized stretchers.
A development of the Lun-class ekranoplan was planned for use as a mobile field hospital for rapid deployment to any ocean or coastal location at a speed of 297 knots (550 km/h). Work was 90% complete on this model, the Spasatel, but Soviet military funding ceased and it was never completed.
Some hospital ships, such as the SS Hope and Esperanza del Mar, belong to civilian agencies, and as such are not part of any navy. Mercy Ships, an international charity, do not belong to any government.

==International law==

Hospital ships were covered under the Hague Convention X of 1907.[tpl]cite web |date= October 18, 1907|url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague10.asp|title = Convention for the adaptation to maritime war of the principles of the Geneva Convention|format = |publisher = Yale University| accessdate = August 2, 2009 | last= |quote=[/tpl]  Article four of the Hague Convention X outlined the restrictions for a hospital ship:
According to the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, a hospital ship violating legal restrictions must be duly warned and given a reasonable time limit to comply. If a hospital ship persists in violating restrictions, a belligerent is legally entitled to capture it or take other means to enforce compliance. A non-complying hospital ship may only be fired on under the following conditions:
In all other circumstances, attacking a hospital ship is a war crime. 
Modern hospital ships display large Red Crosses or Red Crescents to signify their Geneva convention protection under the laws of war. Even so, marked vessels have not been completely free from attack. Notable examples of hospital ships deliberately attacked during wartime are HMHS Llandovery Castle in 1915, the Armenia in 1941 and AHS Centaur in 1943.

==U.S. Navy hospital ships==

The first purposely built hospital ship in the U.S. Navy was the USS Relief"Modern Hospital Sails With U.S. Fleet." Popular Science Monthly, August 1927, p. 35. which was commissioned in 1921.[tpl]DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r4/relief-vi.htm[/tpl] Most hospital ships in the U.S. Navy during World War II were converted passenger liners; most were not marked as neither the Japanese nor Germans were concerned with the Hague Convention on hospital ships.
The U.S. Navy's two current hospital ships, the USNS Mercy (T-AH-19) and USNS Comfort (T-AH-20), are operated by Military Sealift Command. Their primary mission is to provide emergency on-site care for U.S. combatant forces deployed in war or other operations. The ships' secondary mission is to provide full hospital services to support U.S. disaster relief and humanitarian operations worldwide.
Each ship contains 12 fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, an intensive care ward, dental services, a CT scanner, a morgue, and two oxygen-producing plants. Each ship is equipped with a helicopter deck capable of landing large military helicopters. The ships also have side ports to take on patients at sea.
The ships are converted San Clemente-class supertankers. Mercy was delivered in 1986 and Comfort in 1987. Normally, the ships are kept in a reduced operating status in Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego, California, by a small crew of civil service mariners and active-duty Navy medical and support personnel. Each ship can be fully activated and crewed within five days. For example, the Comfort departed Baltimore for Haiti on January 16, 2010, to provide relief to victims of the country's massive earthquake four days after it hit.http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=57568

==Other shipborne hospitals==

It is common for naval ships, especially large ships such as aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships to have on-board hospitals. However, they are only one small part of the vessel's overall capability, and are used primarily for the ship's crew and its amphibious forces (and occasionally for relief missions). They do not qualify as "hospital ships", as they are not marked and designated as such, and as armed vessels they are disqualified from protection as a hospital ship under international law.World Wide Hospital Ships

Several classes of USN ships are equipped with on-board hospitals;
