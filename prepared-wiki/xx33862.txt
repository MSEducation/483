==History and overview==

===Early history===

The University of Calgary was established in 1966, yet its roots date back more than half a century earlier to the establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in 1905. The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and secondary school teachers in the new province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library1.ucalgary.ca/uploaded_files/subject_documents/Archives/roadexhibit/1905.htm |title=University of Calgary, The Road to Autonomy: 1905 |publisher=Library1.ucalgary.ca |date=1905-02-01 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl] The people of Calgary, however, attempted to establish another publicly funded university in Calgary itself. "An Act to Incorporate the University of Calgary" was presented for first reading as a Bill in the Alberta Legislature in an attempt to establish a private university in Calgary. The Legislature allowed the institution to incorporate as 'Calgary College', rather than as the 'University of Calgary'. It withheld from the College the powers to confer degrees and to hold the examinations required for admission to the professions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library1.ucalgary.ca/uploaded_files/subject_documents/Archives/roadexhibit/1910.htm |title=University of Calgary, The Road to Autonomy: 1905 |publisher=Library1.ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
Calgary strove to have an institute of higher learning with degree conferring powers which led to the University of Alberta opening a branch in Calgary in 1945. The University of Alberta Calgary Branch eventually gained full autonomy in 1966 and became the University of Calgary.
The university was modeled on the American state university (similar to the University of Alberta), with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modeled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=1936-02-07 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
In the early 20th century, professional education expanded beyond theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The University of Calgary launched its program in architecture in 1971. The University of Calgary tartan is associated with the university and with its pipe band.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottish-tartans-world-register.com/tartan.aspx?record=2723 |title=Tartan - University of Calgary |publisher=Scottish-tartans-world-register.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
The university's first president, Herbert Stoker Armstrong, held a strong belief that "although the university is accountable to the society that supports it, the university must insist on playing a leadership role in intellectual matters if it is to be worthy of the name."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/president/about/former_presidents |title=University of Calgary Former Presidents |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2001-09-01 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
During the late 1960s, the University of Calgary saw a massive construction boom. Construction on campus included Blocks F and G of Calgary Hall, Blocks C and D of the Engineering Building, the lab of the Kananaskis Centre, a research, training, and service unit, and the opening of the new University Theatre in Calgary Hall. In addition, Banff Centre (originally known as The Banff School of Fine Arts) became affiliated with the University of Calgary. The School of Social Welfare was also established. Total full-time enrolment in 1966 exceeded 4000 students and there were 355 academic members of staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://library1.ucalgary.ca/uploaded_files/subject_documents/Archives/roadexhibit/1966.htm |title=University of Calgary, The Road to Autonomy: 1966 |publisher=Library1.ucalgary.ca |date=1966-04-16 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]

==Today==

The University of Calgary's Child Development Centre is Alberta's first building designed and constructed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, the North American benchmark for environmentally high-performance buildings. The facility, which houses the university's second child-care facility and a full continuum of researchers, clinicians and frontline workers, is dedicated to child health. The building officially opened in October, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/about/ |title=About the U of C |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
In 2011, an addition of rare neurology books dated over 500 years have been added to the MacKimmie library collection. The collection broadens the neuroscience educational experience and digitizing the collection enables people around the world to share in the resource. The collection includes an original copy of the 1953 Nature paper where Nobel winners James D. Watson and Francis Crick first described the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. It also includes the rare first neurological text written in the 1600s by Thomas Willis, the man who coined the term neurology and is known as the ‘father of neurology’. The collection is valued at approximately $600,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/september2010/mackie |title=University of Calgary - Rare book collection unites neuroscience history and future |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
Canada’s fifth veterinary school, the University of Calgary Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, was opened in mid-2008.

==Grounds==

===Main Campus===

The university grounds lie about [tpl]convert|10|km|mi[/tpl] north of Downtown Calgary, and immediately south of the neighbourhoods of Varsity and Dalhousie. The University of Calgary campus occupies [tpl]convert|213|ha|acre|lk=in[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|2.13|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], an area larger than Calgary’s entire downtown. The campus is bounded by Crowchild Trail, 16 Avenue NW, 32 Avenue NW and Shaganappi Trail. 24 Avenue NW provides direct access to the interior of the campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/map/|title=University of Calgary Campus Maps |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]
The architecture is defined by a combination of Gothic Revival[tpl]Citation needed|reason=As far as I know, all buildings on Main, West, and Downtown Campuses are in styles from the last 50 years|date=April 2014[/tpl], Brutalist and Postmodern buildings spread across campus, most of them dated between 1905 and 1980.
A light rail transit link is provided to the university by the C-Train at the LRT station.
A large park is built in the center of the main campus, and is home to the infamous "Prairie Chicken" sculpture. In addition, a pond surrounded by benches and an open field is available for students to relax at. The park contains old oak trees which were specially transplanted to the location when the university was opened. Together, they form a considerable amount of tree canopies which add a more natural feeling to the campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~nickle/Old_site/campusculture/campusculture.html |title=A Conversation with Campus Culture Walking Tour |publisher=People.ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10[/tpl]

===West Campus===

In 1995, the Province of Alberta gave the University of Calgary a large tract of land west of the Main Campus with the understanding it would be used in the future to advance the University’s mission, vision, values and priorities. About a third of the size of downtown Calgary, the land overlooks the Bow River valley and covers [tpl]convert|80|ha|acre|0[/tpl] east of Shaganappi Trail between 16th Avenue (TransCanada Highway) and 32 Avenue N.W. The western campus lies on mostly hilly terrain, near the Bow River. It is adjacent to the main campus of the university, and is home to the Alberta Children's Hospital and Child Development Centre. With the recent boost in annual funding, the university has begun a development plan in order to make better use of the remaining space.
Five years ago, part of the West Campus was leased for the new Alberta Children’s Hospital and a new Ronald McDonald House. So far, the campus is only halfway developed and is considered building room for the future. From this location, it is possible to see the entire university and also Downtown Calgary.

===Health Sciences Campus===

The University of Calgary Board of Governors chose to launch a new medical school in the late 1960s, with the first tangible building to house this endeavor being the Health Sciences Building, which opened in 1972.  The Health Sciences Building shared a site with the Foothills Medical Centre some distance south of the Main Campus.  This site became known as the Health Sciences Campus, with subsequent additions being the Heritage Medical Building (opened 1987), the Health Research Innovation Centre and the Teaching, Research and Wellness building.[tpl]cite book |last=Wyse |first="D George" |year=2010 |title=Hearts, Minds and Vision: Roots of the Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta  |publisher="Kingsley Publishing" |isbn=978-1926832159 |accessdate=2014-02-03[/tpl]
