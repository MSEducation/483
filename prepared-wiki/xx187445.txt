==Overview==

His groups have been classed by some as cults, although others believe he was attempting to promote the Fourth Way, which can involve a degree of intense confrontation on a personal level. Alex was married to Anne Burrage (later Anne Haas) in the 1960s during which time he was running Red Mountain Ranch, a  part-time commune located on Sonoma Mountain in northern California. The order of events is unclear, but Anne left this group in 1969 around the time that Alex became involved with and eventually married Sharon Gans. Anne took many of the members from the ranch and started The Group, amid claims that Red Mountain Ranch had become violent and dangerous, and that Alex was becoming a cult figure. Alex and Sharon ran the Theatre of All Possibilities until 1978 when it received unfavorable press from the San Francisco ChronicleSan Francisco Chronicle Article December 23, 1978 and San Francisco ProgressSan Francisco Progress Article December 22, 1978San Francisco Progress Article January 10, 1979San Francisco Progress Article January 12, 1979San Francisco Progress Article January 14, 1979San Francisco Progress Article February 25, 1979 in the wake of the Jim Jones tragedy in November 1978.
