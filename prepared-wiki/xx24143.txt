==Etymology==

Campinas means grass fields in Portuguese and refers to its characteristic landscape, which originally comprised large stretches of dense subtropical forests (mato grosso or thick woods in Portuguese), mainly along the many rivers, interspersed with gently rolling hills covered by low-lying vegetation. [tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Campinas was also known as "Cidade das Andorinhas" (City of Swallows), because it was a favorite spot for these migratory birds, which flocked annually in enormous numbers to downtown Campinas. However, they almost disappeared around the 1950s, probably because the church and plaza where they used to roost were torn down.  Campinas' official crest and flag has a picture of the mythical bird, the phoenix, because it was practically reborn after a devastating epidemic of yellow fever in the 1800s, which killed more than 25% of the city's inhabitants.
The demonym for Campinas is a campineiro or "campinense" .http://www.campineirautilidades.com.br Campineira Utilities

==History==

The city was founded on July 14, 1774, by Barreto Leme.[tpl]cite web | title =Campinas faz 233 anos hoje | url=http://www.cpopular.com.br/mostra_noticia.asp?noticia=1520595&area=2140&authent=8999D8D6264332BCDBED94130107FE | accessdate =2009-01-06| date =2007-07-14| publisher=Correio Popular |language=Portuguese [/tpl] It was initially a simple outpost on the way to Minas Gerais and Goiás serving the "Bandeirantes" who were in search of precious minerals and Indian slaves. In the first half of the 19th century, Campinas became a growing population center, with many coffee, cotton and sugarcane farms.
The construction of a railway linking the city of São Paulo to Santos' seaport, in 1867, was very important for its growth. In the second half of the 19th century, with the abolition of slavery, farming and industrialization attracted many foreign immigrants to replace the lost manpower, mainly from Italy.http://www.internations.org/campinas-expats/italians Italians in Campinas
Coffee became an important export and the city became wealthy. In consequence, a large service sector was established to serve the growing population, and in the first decades of the 20th century, Campinas could already boast of an opera house, theaters, banks, movie theaters, radio stations, a philharmonic orchestra, two newspapers (Correio Popular and Diário do Povo), a good public education system (with the Escola Normal de Campinas and the Colégio Culto à Ciência), and hospitals, such as the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (a charity for poor people) and the Casa de Saúde de Campinas (for the Italian community, formerly known as Circolo Italiani Uniti), and the most important Brazilian research center in agricultural sciences, the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, which was founded by Emperor Pedro II. Finally, the construction of the first Brazilian highway in 1938, between Campinas and São Paulo, the Anhanguera Highway, was a turning point in the integration of Campinas into the rest of the state.
Campinas was the birthplace of opera composer Carlos Gomeshttp://www.gounin.net/ACGUS/acgbious.htm Carlos Gomes Biography (1836 — 1896) and of the President of the Republic Campos Salles (1841 — 1913).http://www.ayrtonmarcondes.com.br/blog/?page_id=307 Campos Salles It was home for 49 years to Hércules Florence, reputed as one of the early inventors of photography, photocopying and the mimeograph.http://latin.discovery.com/features/000914langsdorff/langsdorffhome.html Hercules Florence

Most of the original vegetation that had in the city, the Atlantic, was devastated. Like other 13 municipalities in the metropolitan region of Campinas, the city suffers a severe environmental stress, and Campinas is considered one of the areas subject to flooding and silting and has less than 5% of vegetation cover.
To try to reverse this situation, several projects have been and are being conducted and planned, such as building corridors, such as regulation of the Management Plan of Environmental Preservation Area (APA) in Campinas. There are also several environmental projects to combat the destruction of riparian forests located on the river london, which, as previously mentioned, has a high rate of pollution of its waters. Today Campinas houses the Area of Relevant Ecological Interest (ARIE) Santa Geneva, [tpl]convert|251|acre|km2[/tpl], established in 1985 and regulated by the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the city of Campinas, Fundação José Pedro de Oliveira.
