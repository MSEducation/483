==History==

Symonds Street Cemetery was the first official cemetery in Auckland, in use from 1842.[tpl]cite web|title=Death and dying - Symonds Street Cemetery |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/death-and-dying/4/1 |author=Ruth McManus and Rosemary Du Plessis |work=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]. Originally it was divided into four sections for Anglicans, Catholics, Jews, and a shared Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and general section. By 1852, the shared section became Presbyterian, and an additional Wesleyan and general section was added. It was closed for burials in 1886, other than to existing family plots, and in 1909 the Auckland City Council took over management of the cemetery.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10623379 |title=City's pioneers lie neglected in a wasteland of shattered gravestones |author=Rudman, Brian |authorlink=Brian Rudman |date=1 February 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Due to development of the Auckland Southern Motorway during the mid-1960s, more than 4,100 bodies were moved and re-interred into two memorial sites at the cemetery, and the land area was reduced by about a quarter. During the relocation, 2000 graves were found under 1200 headstones in the Anglican section, and 2100 graves under 400 headstones were found in the Catholic section.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3510428 |title=Auckland's founding fathers rest in badly neglected surroundings |author=Rudman, Brian |authorlink=Brian Rudman |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 September 2011 |date=2 July 2003[/tpl] Many of Auckland's early colonists are buried here, including William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand and co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi.
The New Zealand Herald columnist Brian Rudman has repeatedly criticised the state of disrepair, vandalism, and the presence of vagrants at the cemetery, and called for the city council to improve the maintenance.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=153278 |title=Rudman's City: Let old graves decay in peace |author=Rudman, Brian |authorlink=Brian Rudman |date=29 September 2000 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10702571 |title=City pioneers would turn in their graves at state of cemetery |author=Rudman, Brian |authorlink=Brian Rudman |date=28 January 2011 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Although the Auckland City Council commissioned the  Symonds St Cemetery Conservation Plan in 1996, only some of its recommendations have been carried out. The Council does employ a specialist stonemason to undertake gravestone restoration with a specialist stonemason,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10736347 |title=Ask Phoebe: Old headstones need a bit of work |author=Falconer, Phoebe |date=5 July 2011 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] but as many of the restored gravestones have been subsequently vandalised the Waitamata Local Board admits the situation is much like "treading water". Security guards do patrol the cemetery at irregular intervals,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/auckland-city-harbour-news/5635825/Grave-neglect |title=Grave neglect |author=Spyksma, Hannah |date=16 September 2011 |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl] but have proved largely ineffective in stopping further damage, in particular their inability to distinguish between vagrants and other members of the public have led to embarrassing situations, including the ejection of a heritage tour party organised by Council itself.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In October 2012 more than 20 of the headstones were sprayed with anti-Semetic graffiti and swastikas.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/20-graves-desecrated-at-Jewish-cemetery-in-Auckland/tabid/423/articleID/273356/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | first=Adam| last=Hollingworth | title= 20 graves desecrated at Jewish cemetery in Auckland| date=19 October 2012[/tpl] The vandalism occurred the night before a white nationalist celebration called "Flag Day". Three people were arrested, but in November the charges against one, Nathan Symington, were dropped due to a lack of evidence.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Charges-to-be-withdrawn-over-Jewish-grave-attack/tabid/423/articleID/275433/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Charges to be withdrawn over Jewish grave attack| date=5 November 2012[/tpl]
