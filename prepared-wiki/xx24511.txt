[[Corn syrup]]

CATEGORIES: Sweeteners, Maize products, Syrup, Starch, Corn-based sweeteners

Corn syrup is a food syrup, which is made from the starch of maize (called corn in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.
The more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup is in the United States most commonly made from corn starch.Structure of the world starch market, European Commission - Directorate Agricultural and Rural development, Evaluation of the Community Policy for Starch and Starch Products, Final report 2002, Chapter 1, page 3 http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/eval/reports/amidon/chap1.pdf[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sugar.org/consumers/sweet_by_nature.asp?id=277 |title=Sugar Association Alternative Carbohydrate Sweeteners[/tpl] Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.Wheat starch, Application, International Starch Institute DenmarkGlobal casave outlook; Guy Henry, Andrew Westby; 2007; page 600[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starch.dk/isi/starch/glosary.htm |title=International Starch Association Starch and Glucose Glossary[/tpl] 

==Commercial preparation==

Historically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then heating the mixture under pressure. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step bioprocess. First, the enzyme α-amylase is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. α-amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium Bacillus; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria are grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into oligosaccharides, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme glucoamylase, known also as "γ-amylase". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the fungus Aspergillus; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.[ref]Martin Chaplin and Christopher Bucke, Enzyme Technology (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pages 146-154.

Corn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn."Dent corn" (Zea mays var. indentata) is so called because the tops of its kernels are slightly indented. See Merriam-Webster dictionary. When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1 kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25 kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1 kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524 kg) of corn to produce one short ton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bpe.wur.nl/UK/Research/Dissertations/Enzymatic+starch+hydrolysis/Enzymatic+starch+hydrolysis+background/|title=Enzymatic starch hydrolysis: background[/tpl]Trends in U.S. production and use of glucose syrup and dextrose, 1965-1990, and prospects for the future - U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service report http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3796/is_1991_Sept/ai_11917704
The viscosity and sweetness of the syrup depends on the extent to which the hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. To distinguish different grades of syrup, they are rated according to their dextrose equivalent (DE).
Some commercial corn syrup products are actually a composition of syrups.

==Uses==

Corn syrup's major uses in commercially prepared foods are as a thickener, a sweetener and as a humectant – an ingredient that retains moisture and thus maintains a food's freshness.[tpl]cite web | last = Knehr | first = Elaine | title = Carbohydrate Sweeteners | url = http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2005/05/carbohydrate-sweeteners.aspx | publisher = Virgo Publishing | accessdate = 2008-10-17 [/tpl] 
In the United States, cane sugar quotas raise the price of sugar;[tpl]cite web|title = U.S. Sugar Import Program| url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/imports/ussugar.asp| accessdate=2009-03-21 | publisher= USDA[/tpl] hence, domestically produced corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup are less expensive alternatives that are often used in American-made processed and mass-produced foods, candies, soft drinks and fruit drinks to help control cost.
Glucose syrup was the primary corn sweetener in the United States prior to the expanded use of high fructose corn syrup production. HFCS is a variant in which other enzymes are used to convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is sweeter and more soluble. Corn syrup is also available as a retail product.  The best-known brand in the U.S. is "Karo".
If mixed with sugar, water and cream of tartar corn syrup can be used to make sugar glass.
