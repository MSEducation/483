Henry Otto Pollak (December 13, 1927) is an Austrian-American mathematician, known for his contributions
to information theory.
Born in Vienna, Austria, he since moved to USA.  He received his B.Sc. in Mathematics (1947)
from Yale University. While at Yale, he participated in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition and was on the team representing Yale University (along with Murray Gell-Mann and Murray Gerstenhaber) that won the second prize in 1947.
He earned an M.A. and Ph.D. (1951) degree in mathematics from
Harvard University, the latter on the thesis Some Estimates for Extremal Distance 
advised by Lars Ahlfors.
Pollak then joined Bell Labs (1951), where he in the early 1960s became
director of the Mathematics and Statistics Research Center.
He authored near forty papers, many of these with David Slepian and Henry Landau on 
analysis, function theory, probability theory, and mathematics education.
He has applied mathematics to  solve problems in  physics and
networks, communication theory, discrete systems, statistics and data analysis, and
economic analysis. 
Pollak also holds patents in the area of signalling.[tpl]US Patent|3710026[/tpl]
He has held teaching positions in the mathematics department at Columbia University.
