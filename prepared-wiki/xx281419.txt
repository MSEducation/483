[/ref] They are named after American physicist Anthony Arrott who introduced them as a technique for studying magnetism in 1957. 

==Details==

According to the Ginzburg-Landau mean field picture for magnetism, the free energy of a ferromagnetic material close to a phase transition can be written as:
Close to the phase transition, this gives a relation for the magnetization order parameter:
