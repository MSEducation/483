The two main traditions of classical music are Carnatic music, found predominantly in the peninsular regions, and Hindustani music, found in the northern, eastern and central regions. The basic concepts of this music includes ''[[Shruti (music)|
shruti]] (microtones), swara (notes), alankar (ornamentations), raga (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and tala'' (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called shrutis, not all equal but each roughly equal to one quarter of a whole tone of Western music.

===Hindustani music===

The Hindustani music tradition diverged from Carnatic music around the 13th - 14th centuries AD [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]. The practice of singing based on notes was popular even from the Vedic times where the hymns in Sama Veda, an ancient religious text, were sung as Samagana and not chanted. Developing a strong and diverse tradition over several centuries, it has contemporary traditions established primarily in India but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In contrast to Carnatic music, the other main Indian classical music tradition originating from the South, Hindustani music was not only influenced by ancient Hindu musical traditions, historical Vedic philosophy and native Indian sounds but also enriched by the Persian performance practices of the Mughals. Classical genres are dhrupad, dhamar, khyal, tarana and sadra, and there are also several semi-classical forms.

===Carnatic music===

The present form of Carnatic music is based on historical developments that can be traced to the 15th - 16th centuries AD and thereafter. It is said to have originated in the South Indian state of Karnataka. Like Hindustani music, Carnatic music is melodic, with improvised variations, but tends to have more fixed compositions. It consists of a composition with improvised embellishments added to the piece in the forms of Raga Alapana, Kalpanaswaram, Neraval and, in the case of more advanced students, Ragam Tanam Pallavi (Raga, Tala, Pallavi). The main emphasis is on the vocals as most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in a singing style (known as gāyaki). There are about 7.2 million ragas (or scales) in Carnatic Music, [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] with around 300 still in use today.
Purandara Dasa is considered the father of Carnatic music, while Tyagaraja, Shyama Shastry and Muthuswami Dikshitar are considered the trinity of Carnatic music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Noted artists of Carnatic Music include Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar (the father of the current concert format), Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, MS Subbulakshmi, Lalgudi Jayaraman and more recently Balamuralikrishna, TN Seshagopalan, K J Yesudas, N. Ramani, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, Sanjay Subrahmanyan, TM Krishna, Bombay Jayashri, Aruna Sairam and Mysore Manjunath.
Every December, the city of Chennai in India has its six week-long Music Season, which has been described as the world's largest cultural event.
Carnatic music has served as the foundation for most music in South India, including folk music, festival music and has also extended its influence to film music in the past 100–150 years or so.

===Film music===

The biggest form of Indian popular music is filmi, or songs from Indian films, it makes up 72% of the music sales in India.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8405891.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plans to start India music awards | date=December 10, 2009 | accessdate=May 19, 2010 | first=Prachi | last=Pinglay[/tpl] The film industry of India supported music by according reverence to classical music while utilizing the western orchestration to support Indian melodies. Music composers, like R. D. Burman, Shankar Jaikishan, S. D. Burman, Madan Mohan, Naushad Ali, Hemant Kumar, C. Ramchandra, Salil Chowdhury, Kalyanji Anandji, A. R. Rahman, Ilaiyaraja, Jatin Lalit, Anu Malik, Nadeem-Shravan, Harris Jayaraj, Himesh Reshammiya, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Salim-Sulaiman,  M.S. Viswanathan, K.V.Mahadevan, Ghantasala and S. D. Batish[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] employed the principles of harmony while retaining classical and folk flavor. Reputed names in the domain of Indian classical music like Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, Ali Akbar Khan and Ram Narayan have also composed music for films. Traditionally, in Indian films, the voice for the songs is not provided by the actors on the screen but by the so-called playback singers. In the past, only a handful of singers provided the voice in Hindi films. These include Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Kishore, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, T.M. Soundararajan, Hemant Kumar, Manna Dey, P. Susheela, Asha Bhonsle, her sister Lata Mangeshkar, Geeta Dutt, S. Janaki, Shamshad Begum, Suraiya, Noorjahan and Suman Kalyanpur.

Rahman, Sonu Nigam, Sukhwinder Singh, Kunal Ganjawala, Anu Malik, Sunidhi Chauhan, Anushka Manchanda, Raja Hasan and  Alka Yagnik. Rock bands like Indus Creed, Indian Ocean, and Euphoria exist and have gained mass appeal with the advent of cable music television.

===Interaction with non-Indian music===

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, rock and roll fusions with Indian music were well known throughout Europe and North America. Ali Akbar Khan's 1955 performance in the United States was perhaps the beginning of this trend.
Jazz pioneers such as John Coltrane—who recorded a composition entitled 'India' during the November 1961 sessions for his album Live At The Village Vanguard (the track was not released until 1963 on Coltrane's album Impressions)—also embraced this fusion.  George Harrison (of the Beatles) played the sitar on the song "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" in 1965, which sparked interest from Shankar, who subsequently took Harrison as his apprentice. Jazz innovator Miles Davis recorded and performed with musicians like Khalil Balakrishna, Bihari Sharma, and Badal Roy in his post-1968 electric ensembles. Virtuoso jazz guitarist John McLaughlin spent several years in Madurai learning Carnatic music and incorporated it into many of his acts including Shakti which featured prominent Indian musicians. Other Western artists such as the Grateful Dead, Incredible String Band, the Rolling Stones, the Move and Traffic soon incorporated Indian influences and instruments, and added Indian performers.
Legendary Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia joined guitarist Sanjay Mishra on his classic CD "Blue Incantation" (1995). Mishra also wrote an original score for French Director Eric Heumann for his film Port Djema (1996) which won best score at Hamptons film festival and The Golden Bear at Berlin. in 2000 he recorded Rescue with drummer Dennis Chambers (Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin et al.) and in 2006 Chateau Benares with guests DJ Logic and Keller Williams (guitar and bass).
Though the Indian music craze soon died down among mainstream audiences, die hard fans and immigrants continued the fusion. In 1985, a beat oriented, Raga Rock hybrid called Sitar Power by Ashwin Batish reintroduced sitar in western nations. Sitar Power drew the attention of a number of record labels and was snapped up by Shanachie Records of New Jersey to head their World Beat Ethno Pop division.
In the late 1980s, Indian-British artists fused Indian and Western traditions to make the Asian Underground. Since the 1990s, Canadian born musician Nadaka who has spent most of his life in India, has been creating music that is an acoustic fusion of Indian classical music with western styles. One such singer who has merged the Bhakti sangeet tradition of India with the western non-Indian music is Krishna Das and sells music records of his musical sadhana. Another example is Indo-Canadian musician Vandana Vishwas who has experimented with western music in her 2013 album Monologues.
In the new millennium, American hip-hop has featured Indian filmi and bhangra. Mainstream hip-hop artists have sampled songs from Bollywood movies and have collaborated with Indian artists.  Examples include Timbaland's "Indian Flute", Erick Sermon and Redman's "React", Slum Village's "Disco", and Truth Hurts' hit song "Addictive", which sampled a Lata Mangeshkar song, and The Black Eyed Peas sampled Asha Bhosle's song "Yeh Mera Dil" in their hit single "Don't Phunk With My Heart". In 1997, the British band Cornershop paid tribute to Asha Bhosle with their song Brimful of Asha, which became an international hit.  British-born Indian artist Panjabi MC also had a Bhangra hit in the U.S. with "Mundian To Bach Ke" which featured rapper Jay-Z. Asian Dub Foundation are not huge mainstream stars, but their politically charged rap and punk rock influenced sound has a multi-racial audience in their native UK. In 2008, international star Snoop Dogg appeared in a song in the film Singh Is Kinng. In 2007, hip-hop producer Madlib released Beat Konducta Vol 3–4: Beat Konducta in India; an album which heavily samples and is inspired by the music of India.
Sometimes, the music of India will fuse with the traditional music of other countries. For example, Delhi 2 Dublin, a band based in Canada, is known for fusing Indian and Irish music,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yk6J6yHBaU |title= Delhi 2 Dublin: Indian Bhangra Meets Irish Jigs  |date= August 26, 2009 |publisher= Public Radio International |accessdate= March 27, 2014[/tpl] and Bhangraton is a fusion of Bhangra music with reggaeton, which itself is a fusion of hip hop, reggae, and traditional Latin American music.reggaetonline.net
In a more recent example of Indian-British fusion, Laura Marling along with Mumford and Sons collaborated in 2010 with the Dharohar Project on a four song EP.[tpl]cite news |publisher=BBC review |title=A triumphant experiment that feels surprisingly authentic |first= Colin |last=Irwin |date=2010-09-03 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/rqzb[/tpl] The British band Bombay Bicycle Club also sampled the song "Man Dole Mera Tan Dole" for their single "Feel".[tpl]cite news | publisher= Indian Express |title= A Little This, A Little That |first= Pallavi |last= Pundir | date= March 15, 2013[/tpl] 

===Indi-pop music===

Indian pop music, often known as Indipop or Indi-pop, is based on an amalgamation of Indian folk and classical music, and modern beats from different parts of the world. Pop music really started in the South Asian region with the famous playback singer Ahmed Rushdi's song ‘Ko Ko Korina’ in 1966.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8459|title=Socio-political History of Modern Pop Music in Pakistan|publisher=Chowk|accessdate=2008-06-27[/tpl]
After that, much of Indian Pop music comes from the Indian Film Industry, and until the 1990s, few singers like Usha Uthup, Sharon Prabhakar, and Peenaz Masani outside it were popular. Since then, pop singers in the latter group have included KK, Baba Sehgal, Alisha Chinai, Shantanu Mukherjee aka Shaan, Sagarika, Colonial Cousins (Hariharan, Leslie Lewis), Lucky Ali, and Sonu Nigam, and music composers like Zila Khan or Jawahar Wattal, who made top selling albums with, Daler Mehndi, Shubha Mudgal, Baba Sehgal, Swetha Shetty and Hans Raj Hans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/12/09/stories/2002120900620200.htm |title=Music man with a golden touch |publisher= The Hindu |date=December 9, 2002 [/tpl] Daler Mehndi's "Dardi Rab Rab" and "Ho Jayegi Balle Balle", Shubha Mudgal's "Ali More Angana", Shweta Shetty's "Deewane To Deewane Hain", Hans Raj Hans' "Jhangar", Bhupi Chawla's "Jogiya Khalli Balli", Ila Arun's "Haule Haule", Malkit Singh's "Paaro" and Ali Haider's "Mahi O Mahi".
Besides those listed above, popular Indi-Pop singers include Sukhwinder Singh, Angarag Papon Mahanta, Zubeen Garg, Daler Mehndi, Raghav Sachar Rageshwari, Vandana Vishwas, Devika Chawla, Bombay Vikings, Asha Bhosle, Sunidhi Chauhan, Anushka Manchanda, Bombay Rockers, Anu Malik, Jazzy B, Malkit Singh, Hans Raj Hans, Raghav, Jay Sean, Juggy D, Rishi Rich, Sheila Chandra, Bally Sagoo, Punjabi MC, Bhangra Knights, Mehnaz, Sanober and SQS Supastars.
Recently, Indian pop has taken an interesting turn with the "remixing" of songs from past Indian movie songs,  new beats being added to them.

===Rock & metal music===

====Raga rock====

Raga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla. Raga and other forms of classical Indian music began to influence many rock groups during the 1960s; most famously The Beatles. The first traces of "raga rock" can be heard on songs such as "See My Friends" by The Kinks and The Yardbirds' "Heart Full of Soul", released the previous month, featured a sitar-like riff by guitarist Jeff Beck.[tpl]cite book|author=Miller, Andy.|page=3|year=2003|title=The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society (33⅓ series)|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-1498-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Bellman, Jonathan.|page=297|year=1997|title=The Exotic in Western Music|publisher=Northeastern|isbn=1-55553-319-1[/tpl] The Beatles song "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", which first appeared on the band's 1965 album Rubber Soul, was the first western pop song to actually incorporate the sitar (played by lead guitarist George Harrison).[tpl]cite book|author=Lewisohn, Mark.|authorlink=Mark Lewisohn|page=63|year=1989|title=The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group|isbn=0-600-55784-7[/tpl] The Byrds' March 1966 single "Eight Miles High" and its B-side "Why" were also influential in originating the musical subgenre. Indeed, the term "raga rock" was coined by The Byrds' publicist in the press releases for the single and was first used in print by journalist Sally Kempton in her review of "Eight Miles High" for The Village Voice.[tpl]cite book|author=Bellman, Jonathan.|page=351|year=1997|title=The Exotic in Western Music|publisher=Northeastern Publishing|isbn=1-55553-319-1[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=88|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0[/tpl] George Harrison's interest in Indian music, popularized the genre in the mid-1960s with songs such as "Love You To", "Tomorrow Never Knows" (credited to Lennon-McCartney), "Within You Without You" and "The Inner Light".[tpl]cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|page=293|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|page=175|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Pedler|first=Dominic|page=524|title=The Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles|publisher=Omnibus Press|location=London|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-8167-6[/tpl] The rock acts of the sixties both in turn influenced British and American groups and Indian acts to develop a later form of Indian rock.

====Indian rock====

The rock music "scene" in India is small compared to the filmi or fusion musicality "scenes" but as of recent years has come into its own, achieving a cult status of sorts. Rock music in India has its origins in the 1960s when international stars such as The Beatles visited India and brought their music with them. These artists' collaboration with Indian musicians such as Ravi Shankar and Zakir Hussain have led to the development of raga rock. International short wave radio stations such as The Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Ceylon played a major part in bringing Western pop, folk, and rock music to the masses. You can hear some of the songs that were heard over these stations during the 1960s here. However, Indian rock bands began to gain prominence only much later, around the late 1980s. 
It was around this time that the rock band Indus Creed formerly known as The Rock Machine got itself noticed on the international stage with hits like Rock N Roll Renegade. Other bands quickly followed. As of now, the rock music scene in India is quietly growing day by day and gathering more support. With the introduction of MTV in the early 1990s, Indians began to be exposed to various forms of rock such as grunge and speed metal. This influence can be clearly seen in many Indian bands today. The cities of the North Easter Region, mainly Guwahati and Shillong, Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore have emerged as major melting pots for rock and metal enthusiasts. Bangalore has been the hub for rock and metal movement in India. Some prominent bands include Dorian Platonic, Cannibals, Phinix, Just, Rubella, Crystal Ann, Morgue, Indian Ocean, Kryptos, Pentagram, Thermal and a Quarter, Abandoned Agony, No Idea,  Zero, Half Step Down, Scribe, Eastern Fare, Indus Creed, Demonic Resurrection, Zygnema Of Unity, Motherjane, Soulmate, Avial and Parikrama. The future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, DogmaTone Records, Eastern Fare Music Foundation, that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.

===Dance music===

===Indian hip hop===

Hip hop music in India had started at around 1990 and Baba Sehgal is credited as India's first rapper. Hip Hop music became all the more famous with the song 'Pettai Rap' from the Tamil movie Kadhalan starring Prabhu Deva. The song catapulted Suresh Peters as a rapper and a music director. Rap/Hip Hop was often used in the regional movies as fillers in between songs and off late has started to become main stream songs. London based The Rishi Rich Project, Bally Sagoo and Canadian based Raghav further laid steady foundations for Hip Hop/RnB music in India. Pakistani-American Punjabi rapper Bohemia became one of the best-known Punjabi rapper in the country. He became the first hip hop artist to launch a full rap album signed to Universal Music India. He has also produced songs for Bollywood movies like Chandni Chowk to China. Indian based Biju Gangadharan, also known as "FATHER OF SANSKRIT ROCK", introduced Rock music with Sanskrit Lyrics. Most of the music performed by his band in public is Hip-Hop, however the style of Biju is been followed by many young musicians from late musicians. Canadian based hip hop artist Ishq Bector became a success after the release of his superhit single 'Aye Hip Hopper'. Malaysian based Yogi B and Natchatra brought in the culture of Tamil rap in India. Yogi B, as part of Poetic Ammo, achieved success when they won at the Malaysian Anugerah Industri Muzik (AIM)(Music Awards) 1999, 2000 and 2001. Yogi B is now the most critically acclaimed Kollywood (the Tamil Movie Industry) rapper because of his work on the 2007 movie Pollathavan.
Hip hop exposure has since grown in both India, and the world, with it becoming ever popular with today's younger generation. Even international artists such as 50 Cent, Mobb Deep, The Black Eyed Peas, and Chamillionaire  have performed in India in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai. Snoop Dogg appeared in a song from the film Singh Is Kinng in 2008 which further popularized hip hop music amongst the people of India. Jay Sean has a bit of a Contemporary R&B style to his voice, as well as a little hip hop influence. While, no rapper of Indian descent has made it on the big stage. The growing influence of hiphop both on the younger generation in India, as well as Indians abroad will surely bring about a rapper of amazing talent. Also, the increasing freedom, and opportunities for diverse careers in today's Indian population helps pave the way for bright and talented musicians, and some, new talents like Naezy a.k.a Naved Shaikh self claimed best Indian rapper, with some great rapping skills that you can see in his latest song "Aafat" on YouTube.

==Jazz and blues==

==Western classical music==

The spread and following of Western classical music in India is almost entirely non-existent. It is mainly patronized by the Indian Zoroastrian community and small esoteric groups with historical exposure to Western classical music. Another esoteric group with significant patronage is the Protestant Christian community in Chennai and Bangalore.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Western Music education is also severely neglected and pretty rare in India. Western keyboard, drums and guitar instruction being an exception as it has found some interest; mainly in an effort to create musicians to service contemporary popular Indian music. Many reasons have been cited for the obscurity of Western classical music in India, a country rich in its musical heritage by its own right, however the two main reasons are an utter lack of exposure and a passive disinterest in what is considered esoteric at best. Also, the difficulty in importing Western musical instruments and their rarity has also contributed to the obscurity of classical Western music.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Despite more than a century of exposure to Western classical music and two centuries of British colonialism, classical music in India has never gained more than 'fringe' popularity. Many attempts to popularize Western classical music in India have failed in the past due to disinterest and lack of sustained efforts.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Today, Western classical music education has improved with the help of numerous institutions in India. Institutions like KM Music Conservatory founded by Oscar Winning Composer, A.R.Rahman, Calcutta School of Music, Bangalore School of Music, Eastern Fare Music Foundation,[tpl]cite news| url=http://gnews.com/outstanding-results-for-eastern-fare-in-trinity-guildhall-exam-01200923114518/ | work=G News | title=Outstanding Results for Eastern Fare in Trinity Guildhall Exam | date=November 18, 2009[/tpl] Delhi School of Music, UstadGah Foundation, Delhi Music Academy, and many others are dedicated to contributing to the progress or growth and supporting Western classical music. In 1930, notable Mehli Mehta set up the Bombay Symphony Orchestra. There is 'Melody Academy' in Darjeeling established in the early 1980s by Mr. Jiwan Pradhan who single handedly has brought the western music in the hills of Darjeeling which is very rich in its musical heritage.
The Bombay Chamber Orchestrabcoindia.co.in (BCO) was founded in 1962.
In 2006, the Symphony Orchestra of India was founded, housed at the NCPA in Mumbai. It is today the only professional symphony orchestra in India and presents two concert seasons per year, with world-renowned conductors and soloists.
Some prominent Indians in Western classical music are:

==Patriotism and music==

Patriotic feelings have been instigated within Indians through music, since the era of freedom struggle. Jana Gana Mana, the national anthem of India, by Rabindranath Tagore is largely credited[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] for uniting India through music and Vande Mataram by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay as the national song of India, both of them belonged to West Bengal. Post-independence songs such as Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo have been responsible for consolidating feelings of national integration and unity in diversity.
