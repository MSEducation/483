Cooley got his start on the Southern California club racing scene where his father ran a club racing organization. He honed his skills in the smaller classes before being hired by Pops Yoshimura to race a Kawasaki KZ1000 in the newly formed AMA production class. He won his first AMA superbike race in 1977. For the 1978 season, Yoshimura switched to better handling Suzuki bikes and Cooley began winning regularly. He teamed up with Mike Baldwin to win the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours race in Japan.1978 Suzuka 8 Hours results at Moto Racing Japan In 1980, he teamed up with Graeme Crosby to win at Suzuka a second time.1980 Suzuka 8 Hours results at Moto Racing Japan Cooley went on to win his first superbike national championship in 1979.
