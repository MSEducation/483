The Sundowe is a musical written by Edinburgh-based writers and performers John, James and Gerry Kielty and featuring their band The Martians. The Sundowe was entered into the "Highland Quest For A New Musical" competition in early 2006 and was announced as the winner in July 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highland-quest.com/|title=Highland Quest website|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl] It was then produced by Cameron Mackintosh as a full stage musical, with the world premiere on 29 November 2007 at the new Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, Scotland.
Following a three week run at Eden Court[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eden-court.co.uk/article/52/the-sundowe-is-victorious.html|title=The Sundowe is victorious|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] it toured the Scottish Highlands in January and February 2008.  
The story line centres on The Martians themselves, as their street busking is interrupted by vampires, the local council and the return of dead souls.  The musical is part comedy, part pathos, and includes references to modern Scottish politics, Greyfriars Bobby, street busking and ancient Scottish history. 
It has been described as "Shaun of the Dead meets Thriller",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hi-arts.co.uk/july06_feature_highland_quest.html|title=Hi-arts.co.uk review, July 2006|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and draws influence from cult science fiction such as Doctor Who and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
