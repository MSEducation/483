Axholme Charterhouse, North Lincolnshire is one of the ten medieval Carthusian houses (charterhouses) in England. It was established in 1397/1398 by Thomas Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham. The house was centred on a pre-existing chapel at Low Melwood in the Isle of Axholme which A Papal Bull of 1398 says "was called anciently the Priory of the Wood".
The full name of the house was The House of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary
The house was suppressed as part of the dissolution of the monasteries in June 1538.
The charterhouse was converted by John Candysshe into a house after it was dissolved: parts still survive as do some earthworks. There has been limited excavation.[tpl]cite PastScape|mnumber=60927|mname=Axholme Priory|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|chapter=Houses of Carthusian monks: The priory of Axholme |title=A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 |series=Victoria County History |date=1 January 1906 |pages=158â€“160 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38016 |accessdate=21 July 2013 |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William|isbn=9780712910453[/tpl]
