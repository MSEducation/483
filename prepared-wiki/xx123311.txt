A name generator is any process or tool that creates a name or identifier.

==Overview==

Name generators are typically software-based tools that allow a user to create names of a variety of types for different purposes. Some name generators have serious applications, and are used by writers and video gamers to come up with names for their characters. An author might use a name generator that uses census data to come up with names for his characters. There are also specialty name generators that will generate only fantasy names or science fiction names. Software-based name generators have been around at least since 1994.
An example is the Baby Name Game that uses the Elo Rating System to rank parents preferred names & select one for their child. Baby Name Game.
