==History of the University of Redlands==

===Founding the University===

The University of Redlands had its roots in the founding of two other American Baptist institutions, California College in Oakland, and Los Angeles University. After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 damaged the finances of California College, a Baptist commission began exploring the liquidation of both institutions to develop a new institution in Southern California. The Reverend Jasper Newton Field, a Baptist pastor at Redlands, persuaded the Redlands Board of Trade to propose a donation of at least 100,000 dollars and [tpl]convert|40|acre|ha[/tpl] for an interdenominational campus (on land donated by layman Mr. K.C. Wells). On June 27, 1907 the Commission voted all in favor of the Redlands proposal.
Ground was broken on April 9, 1909, on the hill where the administration building now stands. Nine founding faculty members held their first day of classes in the Redlands Baptist Church on September 30, 1909, with 39 students attending.
On January 27, 1910, the University of Redlands opened its physical doors by occupying the newly completed Administration building. Bekins Hall and the President's mansion were the only two other buildings completed. President Field was charged with further securing $200,000 for endowment, but the Great Freeze of 1911, which wiped out half the California citrus crop and severely damaged the local economy, made this impossible.
President Field resigned in 1914. Victor LeRoy Duke, Dean and Professor of Mathematics, became the next president. The Southern California Baptist community initiated a campaign to raise $50,000 to clear outstanding debt. The following spring the Northern Baptist Education Board endorsed the school, promising to help raise an endowment. 
By 1925 the faculty numbered 25, and student enrollment had increased to 465. Finances had improved to the extent that, with significant volunteer help, UR was able to erect 12 new buildings by the end of the decade. New dormitories, classrooms, a library, memorial chapel and gymnasium were built. A school of education was added. A developing alumni base also started to support the university. By 1928, the University's endowment was $2,592,000, the fourth largest in the state and among the top ten percent of American universities.Nelson, Lawrence Emmerson, "Redlands: Biography of a College, the first fifty years of the University of Redlands" University of Redlands, CA 1958.

===Redlands during the Great Depression===

By the beginning of 1932, the effects of the Great Depression started to be felt at the University. Enrollment soared, as there was no work to be found, but student indebtedness also increased exponentially, as well as the amount the University owed banks. Salaries were cut, and employees were laid-off. On March 3, 1933, the day after the governor declared a moratorium on banks, President Duke died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
The administration of UR's third President, Dr. Clarence Howe Thurber, soon ran afoul of ultra-conservative churches. Student members complained of a liberal attitude toward Baptist doctrine being taught at the campus. The later affair of Dr. William H. Roberts, a Redlands psychology professor who became the campaign manager of Upton Sinclair's run for governor in 1934, also severely strained town and gown relations.

===Redlands during and after World War II===

The 1940s brought many changes to the University of Redlands. They began with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As conscriptions and enlistments for the war depleted classes, courses were set up for the soldiers at Camp Haan and March Field.
The July 1, 1943 arrival of a Navy V-12 unit, composed of 631 men for officer candidate training, along with a civilian enrollment of 473 women and 110 men, was Redlands’ largest enrollment ever, and gradually lead to the easing of social restrictions. Military men were not required to attend chapel, and on New Year's Eve the Marines clandestinely held the first impromptu dance ever on the campus. Two months later, the Navy held the first formal dance on the commons, and the Trustees finally discarded the "no dancing" policy in 1945, after the Redlands V-12 unit had been disbanded.Moore, Frank E. "Redlands, Our Town" Moore Historical Foundation, Redlands, California, 1987
The passage of the G.I. Bill further opened the doors at Redlands. By special action of Congress, housing units for 50 veteran's families were installed on campus. Of the 219 graduates of June 1949, 126 were veterans, and of these 70 were married. 
The 50s saw other changes. Fraternity houses were established for the first time, and other improvements made to the university. The first Ph.D. ever granted by the University was received in 1957, by Milton D. Hummex, in Philosophy. 
Compulsory chapel attendance fell to the student militancy of the 1960s and 1970s.  The seventh President of the University, Dr. Douglas Moore, was not even Baptist. The campus became truly interdenominational and multicultural, going for some years without clergymen on the Board of Trustees.
Following Dr. Moore, Dr. James R. Appleton served as the eighth president of the University of Redlands for 18 years from 1987–2005. Under his leadership, the University of Redlands saw significant enhancements in campus facilities and technology — strong enrollments; balanced budgets and record-breaking private fund raising. 
Dr. Stuart Dorsey served as the ninth president of the University of Redlands from 2005 to 2010.  During this period, the University opened the [tpl]convert|42000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] Center for the Arts, and renovated the Armacost Library, adding five computer laboratories and a café. Dr. Dorsey resigned his position on March 16, 2010 amid controversy over budget deficits and proposed cuts.[tpl]cite web|author= Imran Ghori, The Press-Enterprise |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_N_nredprez17.366a0f0.html |title=University of Redlands president quits over budget cuts | San Bernardino County | PE.com | Southern California News | News for Inland Southern California |publisher=PE.com |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-11-21[/tpl] 
On March 17, 2010, current Chancellor and former president Dr. James R. Appleton was appointed interim president.

==Organization==

Students at the university study in one of five schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, the School of Business, the School of Music, or the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies.

===College of Arts and Sciences===

The College of Arts and Sciences serves approximately 2,250 undergraduate students from 42 states and 12 foreign countries. About 24 percent are Asian, Latino, African American, Native American or multi-ethnic students.
The college has 167 full-time faculty members serving 45 major areas of study. Eighty-five percent of full-time faculty have a Ph.D. or terminal degree. The student-faculty ratio is approximately 11:1; most class sizes are below 20 students, with upper-division science lectures and all science labs capped at 16 students. Professors or instructors teach all courses and sections.

====Johnston Center for Integrative Studies====

Born in the midst of the Experiential Education Movement, Johnston College, an endowed college which was to become the first cluster college at the University of Redlands.  It began as an experiment in professor-student mentor relationships where a student-initiated, contract-driven education, and operated as an autonomous unit of the university for approximately 10 years. The first class of approximately 30 students, graduated in 1972.  The structure of the educational system was based on seminars (8–10 students), tutorials (3–8), and independent studies.  
In 1979, it was integrated into the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) as the Johnston Center for Individualized Studies. It operated under that name until the mid-1990s, when it was renamed The Johnston Center for Integrative Studies.
Today, over 150 Redlands students live and learn together in the Johnston complex, which includes two residence halls and five faculty offices. Students design their own majors in consultation with faculty, and write contracts for their courses, for which they receive narrative evaluations in lieu of traditional grades.

====School of Music====

The University of Redlands School of Music was founded along with the University as its School of Fine Arts. It is today an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music, and its requirements for entrance and graduation comply with the standards of this accrediting organization.
Approximately 350 students study Music with 13 full-time and 26 adjunct faculty.  The School of Music offers Bachelors of Music (BM) in Composition, Performance, and Education, Bachelors of Arts (BA) in Music, as well as Masters of Music (MM) degrees.
Any University student may participate in musical activities through enrollment (usually by audition) in the University Choir, Chapel Singers, Madrigals, Wind Ensemble, Concert Band, Studio Jazz Band, Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, University Opera, and a variety of chamber music ensembles. Students are invited to register for private, group, or class lessons, available on all instruments and for voice.
Renowned concert organist Frederick Swann is professor of organ.

===School of Education===

The oldest graduate division within the university, the School of Education was founded in 1924. As of 2006, it serves 516 students in graduate coursework, with 17 full-time professors and 30 adjunct professors, and offers a nationally unique "Doctorate in Leadership for Educational Justice" (Ed.D.), the only doctoral program on campus, which engages 20 students each year.
Geared primarily for the working professional, the school partners with the College of Arts and Sciences to offer undergraduates a chance to earn their teaching credential. The school currently offers students the chance to obtain their Preliminary Teaching Credential, as well as Administrative and Pupil Personnel Services Credentials. It also offers Master's of Arts Degrees in School Counseling, Curriculum and Instruction, Educational Administration and Higher Education. In January 2012 the school enrolled its first cohort of students in the Special Education Credential program, this mild/moderate credential also includes the autism certificate. In the fall of 2012 the school will offer a Master's in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, this will lead to eventual licensure in the state of California through the Board of Behavioral Sciences.
In 2001 the School of Education partnered with the Lewis Center for Educational Research in Apple Valley. They offer Preliminary Teaching Credentials onsite and serve Apple Valley and the surrounding high desert communities.
In the Fall of 2008, the University of Redlands, School of Education expanded to a second satellite campus in Orange County. Working with the University of Redlands, School of Business, the School of Education offers Multiple and Single Subject Teacher Credential Programs and an Education Masters degree in Counseling. Credential courses are held twice a week and Masters level courses are held one to three nights a week.
As of 2012 he school now offers the multiple and single subject credentials in Temecula and Rancho Cucamonga.

===School of Business===

Founded in 1976 as the Alfred North Whitehead College for Lifelong Learning, the School of Business started as an experiment in providing educational services to working adults in locations throughout Southern California. It was one of the first successful ventures in quality education through off-site learning. It evolved to become the School of Business in 2001.
The School of Business currently has approximately 700 undergraduate students and close to 800 graduate students(2010), taught by 22 full-time and 46 adjunct professors. Classes are held at the Redlands campus as well as satellite locations in Burbank, Orange County, Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario, Riverside, Temecula, Torrance,  and San Diego.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The School of Business also offers a daytime MBA program, which was launched in 2006. The program provides an opportunity for a Redlands graduate to stay a fifth year and complete a masters. Some aptly prepared students could even complete the program in as little as 30 units. According to Keith Roberts, associate dean,
"The school of business has traditionally only taught working adults in an evening program, but we saw there was a need for traditional students who completed their bachelor's to move right into a graduate program so this was a new market that our school of business had never really addressed."[tpl]cite news |last=Kennedy-Ross | first=Selicia  | title= What's in the future for I.

===National and Regional rankings===

In 2012, the 'U.S. News & World Report' ranked Redlands 11th among regional universities in the western United States,[tpl]cite web|title=Regional University West Rankings|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-west|publisher=U.S. News and World Report[/tpl]  and in 2010 it was rated 7th in the western United States for its Master's degree programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whichuniversitybest.blogspot.com/2009/09/masters-universities-west-rankings.html|title=Masters Universities West Rankings[/tpl] The Princeton Review included the University as one of the country's best institutions for undergraduate education in its 2008, 2009, and 2010 editions of 'The Best Colleges'.  In 2007 the University earned fifth place (up from 7th in 2006) among western U.S. liberal arts colleges that offer undergraduate and master's degrees but few, if any, doctoral programs. Redlands also ranked in the top 4% of the 124 schools in the west in this category. Redlands was the only university in the Inland Empire in this category to make the top ten.[tpl]cite web|title=University of Redlands Fast Facts|url=http://www.collegestudentathletes.com/schools/fastfacts.cfm?SID=421|accessdate=March 2, 2012[/tpl]

===Admissions and Retention===

Admission to the University of Redlands is classified as 'selective', with an acceptance rate of approximately 65% and a freshmen retention rate of 85%, on par with those of other similarly ranked regional universities.

==Athletics==

Redlands competes in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC), which operates within NCAA Division III.  Redlands was one of the founding members of the SCIAC in 1915 and is one of only two schools to have had continuous membership.  The university currently fields ten men’s teams and eleven women’s teams.
The team mascot is the bulldog.  The university has traditionally maintained a live bulldog in this capacity.  The recently retired mascot is Duke, who held the title since 2003–10.  The new pup on campus is Thurber.  He is commonly seen at sporting events or around campus.

==Campus housing==

The University offers its students guaranteed housing during their four years of undergraduate study. Students must live on campus unless there is parental consent and a compelling reason until the age of 23.  
Many residence halls are "living-learning communities", with themes such as "freshman", "social justice", "substance-free", etc.  These themes and configurations change from time to time.  
Most students live in double-occupancy rooms with hallway or suite-style bathrooms, though triples and quads are available, as well as single rooms for students with special medical needs.  In a suite-style layout, two rooms share a single bathroom.  In a hallway-bathroom layout, residents share a common hallway bathroom, with a sink provided in each residence hall room (except for East and Williams Halls, where sinks are only in the bathrooms).  There are a few semi-private showers that are gender neutral, primarily in the Holt building of the Johnston complex. 
Air conditioning is not provided in some residence halls.  Where air conditioning is provided, it can be controlled centrally, or with a thermostat in each room.  Many students, especially in older halls, complain of poorly functioning central heat/AC systems, leading to hot summer days and very cold nights and mornings in the winter.  
Students live in the following halls and complexes:

===New units===

The University has recently added two new buildings: Lewis Hall (named after U.S. Congressman Jerry Lewis) and Appleton Hall (named after the former university president). Lewis Hall opened in the fall of 2005, and is home to the Master of Science in Geographic Information Systems Program, the Environmental Studies Program, and the Redlands Institute (an environmental research institute). Appleton Hall opened in the spring of 2006 and is home to the physics, math, astronomy, and computer science departments, which were previously in Duke and Hentschke Halls.  Appleton Hall, named after Redlands chancellor and president Jim Appleton, cost the university about $10.3 million. Its southern wall is graced by a giant sundial designed by physics professor Tyler Nordgren, including a version for daylight-saving time, that is accurate within 10 minutes.[tpl]cite news | last=Heiss | first= David James | title=Physics, up close and personal | url=http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/search/ci_4004319?IADID=Search-www.redlandsdailyfacts.com-www.redlandsdailyfacts.com | publisher=Redlands Daily Facts | date=2006-07-02 | accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl] It is also sometimes referred to as the "Hall of Numbers."

===Alternative living===

The University also offers alternative housing to various organizations. Merit houses, such as the Billings[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] and Harrison Houses are awarded to organizations for use in the school year.
The university also offers a Greek System, unaffiliated with national Greek organizations, which also contains several houses for residence by the groups' members. The houses that compile the group of Greek housing are usually located on Frat Row which is located behind the school softball field, all with the exception of the Sigma Kappa Alpha and Chi Rho Psi house.
