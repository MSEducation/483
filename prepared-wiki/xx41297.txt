==Development==

MacPaint was written by Bill Atkinson, a member of Apple's original Macintosh development team. The original MacPaint consisted of 5,804 lines of Pascal computer code, augmented by another 2,738 lines of 68000 assembly language.Hertzfeld (2005), p. 174 MacPaint's user interface was designed by Susan Kare, also a member of the Macintosh team.[tpl]cite news | last = McGeever | first =C  | title = Q&A: Susan Kare: 'I Never Planned to Be a Guiding Force in the Macintosh Design' | work = InfoWorld | page = 64 | date = September 10, 1984[/tpl] Kare also beta tested MacPaint before release.
MacPaint uses two offscreen memory buffers to avoid flicker when dragging shapes or images across the screen.Hertzfeld (2005), p. 171 One of these buffers contained the existing pixels of a document, and the other contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer was used as the basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint.Hertzfeld (2005), p. 172 The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.
The original MacPaint did not incorporate a zoom function. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle with a white border. The FatBits editing mode set the standard for many future editors.Hertzfeld (2005), p. 147 MacPaint included a "Goodies" menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the "Aids" menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed "Goodies" as public awareness of the AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.Hertzfeld (2005), pp. 155-156

==Release and version history==

MacPaint was first advertised in an 18-page brochure in December 1983, following the earlier announcement of the Macintosh 128k.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/ads/apple-mac/index.htm|title=Apple Macintosh 18 Page Brochure|publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum|accessdate=April 24, 2006[/tpl] The Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984 with two applications, MacPaint and MacWrite. For a special post-election edition of Newsweek in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue. The Newsweek advertisement included many pages dedicated to explaining how MacWrite and MacPaint worked together.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek|title=1984 Newsweek Macintosh ads|publisher=GUIdebook, Newsweek|accessdate=April 24, 2006[/tpl] After launch, a New York Times reviewer noted how MacPaint unfolded numerous graphic possibilities for the personal computer; he went further to say  "it is better than anything else of its kind offered on personal computers by a factor of 10."
MacPaint 2.0 was released on January 11, 1988 by Claris.[tpl]cite news | title = Apple Computer unit introduces enhanced versions of MacDraw, MacProject, MacWrite and MacPaint | work = Reuters | date = January 11, 1988[/tpl] It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use nine documents simultaneously.[tpl]cite news | last = Martinez | first = Carlos Domingo | title = MacPaint (Software Review) | work = MacUser | page = 103 |date=July 1988[/tpl] The original MacPaint operated as a single document application with a non-movable window.
