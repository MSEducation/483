After apartheid era, the present day City of Johannesburg was created from eleven existing local authorities, seven of which were white and four black or coloured. The white authorities were 90% self-sufficient from property tax and other local taxes, and produced and spent R 600 (US$93) per person in municipal services, while the black authorities were only 10% self-sufficient, spending R 100 (US$15) per person in municipal services.[tpl]Cite book|author=van der Merwe, Izak and Davids, Arlene|year=2006|chapter=Cape Town and Johannesburg|editor=Bekker, Simon B. and Leildé, Anne|title=Reflections on Identity in Four African Cities|location=Stellenbosch, South Africa|publisher=African Minds|page=33|isbn=978-1-920051-40-2[/tpl] Although Johannesburg was divided into eleven administrative regions, these new divisions did not correspond to the areas governed by the former local authorities.[tpl]Cite book|author=Beavon, Keith S.

The first post-apartheid City Council was created in 1995. The council adopted the slogan "One City, One Taxpayer" to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a substantially autonomous local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like Sandton and Randburg, poorer neighbouring townships such as Soweto and Alexandra, and informal settlements like Orange Farm.
However, the new post-apartheid City Council ran into problems in part due to inexperienced management and political pressure, which contributed to over-ambitious revenue projections, over-spending, wasted expenditures and out-right fraud.[tpl]Cite book|author=World Bank|year=2003|chapter=Spotlight on Johannesburg|title=World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=World Bank|pages=178–179|isbn=978-0-8213-5468-1|url=http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/wdr04/complete.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020040616/http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/wdr04/complete.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2004|deadurl=no[/tpl] In the newly combined metropole services were unnecessarily duplicated. But, by far, the biggest financial drain was the failure to collect revenues for services, which ranged from rent (rates) to utilities. Part of this failure was a result of the anti-apartheid boycott of paying the government.
In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager to reshape the city's ailing financial situation.[tpl]Cite book|author=Tomlinson, Richard|year=2005|chapter=Reinterpreting the Meaning of Decentralization in Johannesburg|editor=Segbers, Klaus; Raiser, Simon and Volkmann, Krister|title=Public Problems—private Solutions?: Globalising Cities in the South|location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=327–346|isbn=978-0-7546-4362-3[/tpl] The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called "iGoli 2002". This was a restructuring plan to be completed in 2002, that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. While strongly opposed by unions who feared a loss of jobs, the plan went into effect and returned some sectors into "cash cows" that helped support the city in general.[tpl]Cite news|author=Tabane, Rapule|date=2 June 2003|title=Market produces the goods|newspaper=Mail and Guardian|location=South Africa|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2003-06-02-market-produces-the-goods|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105181638/http://mg.co.za/article/2003-06-02-market-produces-the-goods|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] Although some jobs were lost, there were no mass firings, as agencies used attrition to remove excess staff.[tpl]Cite web|title=Restructuring Service Delivery: Johannesburg, South Africa, 1996–2001 (Policy Note 207)|publisher=Princeton University|url=http://www.princeton.edu/successfulsocieties/content/data/policy_note/PN_id207/Policy_Note_ID207.txt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105182521/http://www.princeton.edu/successfulsocieties/content/data/policy_note/PN_id207/Policy_Note_ID207.txt|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] The plan took the city from near insolvency to an operating surplus of R 153 million (US$23.6 million).
Following the relative success of iGoli 2002, the City undertook a number of initiatives both to help equalise municipal services benefits, such as the water utility's Free Basic Water policy, and to curb fraud and increase payment percentages, such as the water utility's Operation Gcin'amanzi to repipe areas to eliminate siphonage and to install water meters for excess use.[tpl]Cite web|date=8 October 2009|title=Lindiwe Mazibuko and Others v City of Johannesburg and Others|publisher=The Constitutional Court of South Africa|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2009/28media.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105202220/http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2009/28media.pdf|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] Nonetheless, according to the opposition party, fraud, theft and non-payment still remained problems as of 2013.[tpl]Cite news|author=Maimane, Mmusi|date=21 February 2013|title=Johannesburg's service delivery is being crippled by maladministration|newspaper=Democratic Alliance|url=http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&id=11864|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105204237/http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&id=11864|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] In fiscal year 2011, the city's audit had R 45,796 million chalked up to fraudulent activities.[tpl]Cite web|title=City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, Group Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011|publisher=City of Johannesburg|url=http://www.joburg-archive.co.za/2012/pdfs/cfo_report12.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105215825/http://www.joburg-archive.co.za/2012/pdfs/cfo_report12.pdf|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] In 2013, the City admitted that is would be unable to collect two-thirds of the R 18 billion in outstanding billings.[tpl]Cite news|author=Mawson, Nicola |date=19 February 2013|title=Project Phakama bites again|newspaper=IT Financial|location=Rivonia, South Africa |url=http://www.itweb.co.za/?id=61850:Project-Phakama-bites-again[/tpl]
As of August 2013, the ruling political party, African National Congress, had an overwhelming majority and administered the City of Johannesburg. Although other political parties have seats in the Johannesburg municipality, they have very little influence. The Democratic Alliance is the official opposition in the Johannesburg municipality and has won many Wards in the city. One would find DA wards more in the Northern suburbs of Johannesburg, but surprisingly the DA won a ward in Soweto. Which showed that people were not too happy with service delivery as provided by the ANC.

==Crime==

After the Group Areas Act was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by urban blight. Thousands of poor, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like Soweto and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by landlords, especially in high-density areas, such as Hillbrow. Many corporations and institutions, including the stock exchange, moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like Sandton.
Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include closed-circuit television on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech CCTV surveillance.http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20081211055919975C608175, IOL – Joburg Surveillance Zooms In, 11 December 2008. The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the Central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds. This claim however is greatly exaggerated as criminal behaviour and corruption in the South African police services is on the rise. Recent investigation by Cart Blanche, a South African investigative journalism program, highlights police involvement in organised crime.
Crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow.Drop in serious crime in Jo'burg, Mail & Guardian Online, 7 July 2006. Between 2001 and 2006, R9-Billion (US$1.2 billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-Billion (US$1.5 billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl]http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/joburg-039-s-residential-projects-are-supporting-an-acceleration-of-the-rejuvenation-effort-2007-05-25, engineeringnews.co.za – Joburg's residential projects are supporting an acceleration of the rejuvenation effort , 25 May 2007.

Murders in the Johannesburg municipality amounted to 1,697 in 2007 according to the South African Medical Research Council, a rate of 1 per 2326 inhabitants.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/nimmsreport2007.pdf|title=A profile of fatal injuries in South Africa|accessdate=22 October 2009|format=PDF|page=49|publisher=South African Medical Research Council[/tpl]

==Economy==

Johannesburg is one of the world's leading financial centreshttp://www.assr.nl/conferences/documents/StaffsempaperBourgouinnov.2008.pdf and it is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] In a 2008 survey conducted by MasterCard, Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa).http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/wcoc/pdf/WCoC_Brochure_FINAL.pdf
Mining was the foundation of the Witwatersrand's economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the city limits, most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the JSE although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.
There is also a significant informal economy consisting of cash-only street traders and vendors. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] The level of this economic activity is difficult to track in official statistics and it supports a sector of the population including immigrants who are not in formal employment. This informal industry is arguably the largest in the world, perhaps only second to the informal sector of Beijing.
The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of Lesotho, the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.
The container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest "dry port" in the world, with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of Durban and Cape Town arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government.

===Retail===

Johannesburg's largest shopping centre is Sandton City, while Melrose Arch is one of its most prestigious.[tpl]citation_needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Other centres include Rosebank, Eastgate, Westgate, Northgate, Southgate, The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, Cresta and Clearwater mall. There are also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in Midrand. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in Zulu language, indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened.[tpl]cite web|url=http://architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html|title=GREENSTONE MALL : BENTEL INTERNATIONAL :: Architect Africa Features Page|publisher=Architectafrica.com|accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl] See :Category:Shopping centres in Johannesburg.

==Communications and media==

The city is home to several media groups which own a number of newspaper and magazine titles. The two main print media groups are Independent Newspapers and Naspers (Media24). The electronic media is also headquartered in the greater metropolitan region. Beeld is a leading Afrikaans newspaper for the city and the country[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl], while the City Press is a Sunday newspaper that is the third largest selling newspaper in South Africa[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]. The Sowetan is one of a number of titles catering for the black market although in recent years it competes against newly arrived tabloids. The Mail & Guardian is an investigative liberal newspaper while The Citizen is a tabloid-style paper, and The Star is a local newspaper that mostly covers Gauteng-related issues. The Sunday Times is the most widely read national Sunday newspaper[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]. True Love is the most widely read women's magazine[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl], catering primarily to the up-and-coming middle class black female market, published by Media 24. The Times is a national newspaper that covers current issues.
Media ownership is relatively complicated with a number of cross shareholdings which have been rationalised in recent years resulting in the movement of some ownership into the hands of black shareholders. This has been accompanied by a growth in black editorship and journalism.
Johannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as YFM, Metro FM, Phalaphala FM, Talk Radio 702, Highveld Stereo, 5FM, UJ FM and Kaya FM and Classic FM. The number of radio stations has increased in recent years as the government sold off frequencies to private companies. Johannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster South African Broadcasting Corporation and pay-broadcast network Multichoice which distributes M-Net and DStv a digital satellite service, while eTV also has a presence in the city. The city has two television towers, the Hillbrow Tower and the Sentech Tower.
Johannesburg has 4 major cellular telecommunications operators: Vodacom, MTN, Cell C and the newly established Telkom Mobile mobile network launched in late 2010. Vodacom's global headquarters is located in Midrand. It was formed in 1994, just after the South African elections of 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.africanwireless.com/vodacom_history.htm|title=Vodacom History|publisher=Africanwireless.com|accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]

==Suburbs==

Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. While the Central Business District and the immediate surrounding areas were formerly desirable living areas, the spatial accommodation of the suburbs has tended to see a flight from the city and immediate surrounds. The inner city buildings have been let out to the lower income groups and illegal immigrants and as a result abandoned buildings and crime have become a feature of inner city life. The immediate city suburbs include Yeoville, a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly blue collar neighbourhoods and situated closer to some townships. The suburbs to the west have in recent years floundered with the decline of the mining industry but have in some cases experienced some revival with properties being bought up by the black middle class. The biggest sprawl lies to the east and north. The eastern suburbs are relatively prosperous and close to various industrial zones. The northern suburbs have been the recipient of most of the flight from the inner city and some residential areas have become commercialised particularly around the area of Sandton, stretching north towards Midrand, a half way point between Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.
Traditionally the northern and northwestern suburbs have been the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops as well as several upper-class residential areas such as Hyde Park, Sandhurst, Northcliff, Bryanston and Houghton, where Nelson Mandela made his home. The northwestern area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly black suburb of Sophiatown once centre of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured Melville featuring restaurants and nightlife. Auckland Park is home to the headquarters of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, AFDA (The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance) and the University of Johannesburg.
To the southwest of the City Centre is Soweto, a mostly black urban area constructed during the apartheid regime specifically for housing African people who were then living in areas designated by the government for white settlement.
To the south of Johannesburg is Lenasia, a mostly Asian area which was constructed during the Apartheid era specifically to house Asians. It is closer to the city centre and smaller than Soweto.

==Tourism==

Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to Cape Town, Durban, and the Kruger National Park. Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of more attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred around history museums, such as the Apartheid Museum (with related visits to Constitution Hill) and the Hector Pieterson Museum. There is also a large industry around visiting former townships, such as Soweto and Alexandra. Most visitors to Soweto see the Mandela Museum, which is located in the former home of Nelson Mandela.
Visitors can get a feeling for the layout of the city by visiting the Carlton Centre, in the south-eastern area of the CBD, which has an observation deck on the 50th floor. At 223 metres (731 ft), it is the highest office building in Africa and affords sweeping vistas of the city and surrounds. The Museum Africa covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of rock art. Also a large draw for tourists is Gold Reef City, a theme park which offers a depiction of mining life at the turn of the nineteenth century, including an underground mine tour; other attractions include a large amusement park and a popular Tribal Dancing show.
The city has several art museums, such as the Johannesburg Art Gallery, which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The Market Theatre complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays, and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting. The Johannesburg Civic Theatre is South Africa's foremost "receiving house" of live entertainment—presenting world class theatre, both local and international.showbusiness.co.za[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] The Suburbs of Melville, Newtown, Parkhurst, Norwood, Rosebank and Greenside are popular for their bohemian atmosphere, street life, and many restaurants and bars.
Shopping is often popular with tourists, as the city offers a range of venues and experiences, from numerous upmarket shopping malls such as Sandton City and Nelson Mandela Square, to various markets and flea markets, such as the Oriental Plaza and the Rosebank Flea Market; the latter are popular for souvenirs and African Art. See above. (Cultural) tourists also visit the "Mai Mai Market"Mai Mai Market, joburg.org.za ("Ezinyangeni" – the place of healers; located on the eastern wing of the city centre) dedicated to traditional herbs and traditional healers.
The Cradle of Humankind a UNESCO World Heritage Site is [tpl]convert|25|km[/tpl] to the northwest of the city. The Sterkfontein fossil site is famous for being the world's richest hominid site and produced the first adult Australopithecus africanus and the first near-complete skeleton of an early Australopithecine. Other attractions in this area include the Lesedi Cultural Village, while Magaliesburg and the Hartbeespoort Dam are popular weekend (and holiday) destinations for Johannesburg residents. The Origins Centre Museum, see below, covers the origins of humankind in Africa, and houses an extensive collection of rock art.
Johannesburg and environs offer various options to visitors wishing to view wildlife. The Johannesburg Zoo is one of the largest in South Africa. The Lion Park nature reserve, near Lanseria, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the Krugersdorp Nature Reserve, a 1500 Ha Game Reserve, is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centredewildt.co.za in the Magaliesberg runs a successful breeding program for cheetah, wild dog and other endangered species. The Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve,rhinolion.co.za situated in the "Cradle of Humankind" on 1200 Ha of "the typical highveld of Gauteng" also runs a breeding programme for endangered species including Bengal Tigers, Siberian Tigers and the extremely rare White lion.

==Sports teams and stadiums==

Johannesburg's most popular sports by participation are association football, cricket, rugby union, and running. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs.

===Football===

The city has several football clubs in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and the National First Division. In the PSL, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include Kaizer Chiefs (nicknamed Amakhosi), Orlando Pirates (nicknamed the Buccaneers), Moroka Swallows and Wits University (nicknamed the Clever Boys). They are based at the city's FNB, Orlando, Dobsonville and Bidvest stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at Soccer City the venue of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. First Division teams are Jomo Cosmos and FC AK.
Katlehong City and Alexandra United, play at Alexandra and Reiger Park stadium respectively.

===Cricket===

Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the Highveld Lions represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West Province at the Wanderers Stadium which was the venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final in which Australia successfully defended their title against India. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever ODI match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs. They take part in the first class SuperSport Series, the one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Ram Slam T20 Challenge. Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, in which India beat Pakistan in the final.

===Rugby===

The Lions, formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, North West and Mpumalanga in the Southern Hemisphere's Super Rugby competition, which includes teams from South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The Golden Lions compete in the Currie Cup, which they have won on ten occasions.

==Transport==

Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.

===Airports===

Johannesburg is served principally by OR Tambo International Airport (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that was known as Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. Lanseria Airport, located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of Sandton, is used for commercial flights to Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Botswana, and Sun City. Other airports include Rand Airport and Grand Central Airport. Rand Airport, located in Germiston, is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of South African Airways's first Boeing 747 Classic, the Lebombo, which is now an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.

===Freeways===

The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the Johannesburg Ring Road. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an [tpl]convert|80|km|adj=on[/tpl] loop around it: the N3 Eastern Bypass, which links Johannesburg with Durban; the N1 Western Bypass, which links Johannesburg with Pretoria and Cape Town; and the N12 Southern Bypass, which links Johannesburg with Witbank and Kimberley. The N3 was built exclusively with asphalt, while the N12 and N1 sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the R24 Airport Freeway intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26 |publisher=SA National Roads Agency |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl] It is also claimed[tpl]cite news |last=Staff Reporter |title=18 perish in road accidents |url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents/ |accessdate=15 July 2013 |newspaper=NewsDay |date=10 May 2013[/tpl] that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.
Johannesburg has the most freeways connected to it.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2009[/tpl] It has the N1, N3, N12, N14, N17, R21, R24 and the R59, all leading to Johannesburg. The M1 and M2 freeways were built to direct traffic towards the city centre. These two freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.

===Taxis===

Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, metered taxis and minibus taxis. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase use of metered taxis in the city.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
The minibus "taxis" are the de facto standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s The minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by turf wars.

===Mass transit===

The Metrorail Gauteng commuter rail system connects central Johannesburg to Soweto, Pretoria, and most of the satellite towns along the Witwatersrand. The railways transport huge numbers of commuters everyday. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of Sandton, Midrand, Randburg, and Rosebank, are served by the rapid rail link Gautrain.

====Trains====

A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, Gautrain has made provision for a rapid rail link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the OR Tambo International Airport. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and as of August 2011, all stations were running except for Park Station in Johannesburg's CBD. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the North-South line include Johannesburg's Park Station (underground), Rosebank (underground), Sandton (underground), Marlboro (above-ground and raised), Midrand, Pretoria Station and Hatfield. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via Rhodesfield (raised) and Marlboro.
The east-west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, while the North-South line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station which will open at a later date.
The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the N1 freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs.
