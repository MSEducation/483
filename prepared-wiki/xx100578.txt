CATEGORIES: Parties

A foam party is a social event in which participants dance to music on a dance floor covered in several feet of suds or bubbles dispensed from a foam machine.

==History==

Foam parties can be dated back to A Rhapsody in Black and Blue, a 1932 short subject directed by Aubrey Scotto[tpl]IMDb title|23393|A Rhapsody in Black and Blue[/tpl] where Louis Armstrong dances, sings, and plays his trumpet in a large area of soap suds. Songs performed in the foam are "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You" and "Shine".http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023393/plotsummary Another film featuring foam parties is The Partyhttp://www.foam-party.co.uk/about_foam_parties.php featuring Peter Sellers.
Modern foam parties were developed in the early 1990s by club promoters in Ibiza,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Generally machines were large ceiling mounted foam generators, creating a large volume of foam that fell from the ceiling onto clubbers. This was not seen as practical in a lot of venues due to the large water usage and subsequent clean up required.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
As Ibiza foam parties became more popular the craze spread, and the foam cannon was developed by Roy Barlow from The Entertainment Biz and Robin Wincup from Galaxy and introduced into the UK in 1992; these were the first machines to meet with all UK health and safety requirements.

==Safety==

In 2008, three people were electrocuted and two others injured at a foam party at the Venezia Palace Hotel in Antalya, Turkey.
