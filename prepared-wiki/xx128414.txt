==Early television career==

Bruner began his career in television as "Wally the Weatherman" with WTHI-TV in Terre Haute, Indiana in the mid-1950s and continued with a variety of roles in small-market stations around the country. He also built and operated Radio Station WKZI in Casey, IL with his first wife, Patricia. He also was News Director of KTVK-TV, the then ABC affiliate in Phoenix, Arizona where he worked with his Assistant News Director and cinematographer, Stanley Rocklin. He then landed a job as Capitol Hill Correspondent for ABC News and he moved to Washington, D.C.. As a news correspondent, he covered the US Congress and the White House throughout the 1960s; was nominated for an EMMY for his coverage of the war in Santo Domingo; and went to Viet Nam to cover the war. Upon his return from Viet Nam, he helped organize the AFTRA strike (which divided the news team of Huntley & Brinkley)to force the networks to treat war correspondents more fairly. Following his time with ABC, he served as coanchor with Alan Smith of the nightly news for Washington, D.C., television station WTTG, Channel 5, with Maury Povich (sports).

==What's My Line?==

In 1968, producer Mark Goodson approached Bruner to audition for the new syndicated version of What's My Line?[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvofyourlife.com/WHATSMYLINE.htm|title=What's My Line Quiz / Panel (1950-1975)|publisher=tvofyourlife[/tpl], Retrieved 2013-05-29. Like the original host John Charles Daly, Bruner had worked for ABC News as a correspondent. 
Part of the audition was an opportunity to view old kinescopes of the original CBS version.  Bruner told Goodson that he did not need to do so, since one of his jobs in the 1950s had been to direct commercial breaks of the network feed of What's My Line? He claimed to have seen every episode that aired over a period of several years.
Bruner hosted the show from CBS Studio 50, the Ed Sullivan Theater, from 1968 to 1972. Broadway actor Larry Blyden succeeded him for the program's final three seasons.

==Wally's Workshop==

After leaving What's My Line?, with over 1000 episodes under his belt, Bruner created and hosted a home-repair how-to show called Wally's Workshop. The show featured Bruner and wife Natalie working on home projects in a studio space. Wally's Workshop was syndicated in 80 markets, running from 1971 to the mid-1980s.
