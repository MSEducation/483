Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/myth-renewable-energy |title=The myth of renewable energy | Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Thebulletin.org |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl] Renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and rural (off-grid) energy services.REN21 (2010). Renewables 2010 Global Status Report[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] p. 15.
About 16% of global final energy consumption presently comes from renewable resources, with 10% http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/cooking.pdf of all energy from traditional biomass, mainly used for heating, and 3.4% from hydroelectricity. New renewables (small hydro, modern biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels) account for another 3% and are growing rapidly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf|title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=REN21 |year=2011 |pages=17, 18[/tpl] At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.[tpl]cite web |url=http://new.ren21.net/Portals/0/REN21_GFR_2013_print.pdf |title=Renewables global futures report 2013 |author=REN21 |year=2013 |work= [/tpl] Wind power, for example, is growing at the rate of 30% annually, with a worldwide installed capacity of 282,482 megawatts (MW) at the end of 2012.
Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ETP2012SUM.pdf |title=Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 |author= International Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= [/tpl] In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power.United Nations Environment Programme Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3.
While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development.World Energy Assessment (2001). Renewable energy technologies, p. 221. United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/u-n-secretary-general-renewables-can-end-energy-poverty?cmpid=WNL-Friday-August26-2011 |title=U.N.
