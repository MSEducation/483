[[Convulsion]]

CATEGORIES: Neurological disorders, Medical terminology

A convulsion is a medical condition where body muscles contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in an uncontrolled shaking of the body.Medlineplus medical encyclopedia  Because a convulsion is often a symptom of an epileptic seizure, the term convulsion is sometimes used as a synonym for seizure. However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Convulsions are also consistent with an electric shock. For non-epileptic convulsions, see non-epileptic seizures.
The word "fit" is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.Merriam-Webster: Fit.
