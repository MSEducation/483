==Nefty==

Nefty started with Menudo at age 13, and stayed in the group until he was 15. Nefty graduated in 1986 from Marquette University in Computer Sciences. He is an Information Technology Officer (ITO) in a company in Puerto Rico.

==Fernando==

Fernando started in Menudo at age 12, and was one of the primary voices in the group until he left at age 15. He sang lead vocal on Chiquitita, which became one of Menudo's biggest hits. After he left the group, Fernando became popular as a soloist in Puerto Rico and in South America. He suffers from Neuromuscular disease, a rare condition that has no cure. It is difficult for him to move, and he has needed his family's assistance for the last few years. He continues to gain strength and movement, but is confined to a wheel chair.Vibe, Nov 1998, v. 6, no. 9

==XCHANGE==

In 1987, 4 of the original 5 Menudo members, Carlos & Ricky Melendez, and Nefty and Fernando Sallaberry reunited on a project they called: XCHANGE. There was some publicity and they recorded a few demos (EP) but were not offered a recording contract. They soon disbanded.
