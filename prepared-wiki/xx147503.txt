[[1924 Isle of Man TT]]

CATEGORIES: 1924 in British motorsport, Isle of Man TT

The 1924 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy saw the introduction of the Ultra-Lightweight class for motorcycles of 175 cc capacity that was run only twice; this season and in 1925. This was the second year of the Sidecar race that would also be dropped after 1925.
The Ultra-Lightweight TT began with a massed-start for competitors rather than pairs for the normal time-trial format of the Isle of Man TT Races. The first winner of the Ultra-Lightweight TT in 1924 was Jock Porter riding a New Gerrard at an average speed of [tpl]convert|51.21|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The Junior TT race was won by Ken Twemlow on a New Imperial at an average speed of [tpl]convert|55.67|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the same Junior TT race Jimmie Simpson set a new lap record of 35 minutes and 5 seconds at an average speed of [tpl]convert|64.54|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] on an AJS; the first 60 plus mph average lap. The Lightweight TT and the Senior TT races where run in conjunction and Eddie Twemlow (the brother to Ken Twemlow) riding a New Imperial won the 6 lap race in 4 hours, 5 minutes and 3 seconds, an average speed of [tpl]convert|55.44|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The Senior TT, like the Junior race, was also run at a record breaking pace and was the first with a race average speed over [tpl]convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. The 6 lap race was won by Alec Bennett riding a Norton in 3 hours, 40 minutes and 24. 6 seconds with an average speed of [tpl]convert|61.64|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
