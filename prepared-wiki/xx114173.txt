===Crocks of Gold===

The following story is related in English folklore:
 
 Many years ago there resided in the village of Upsall a man who dreamed three nights successively that if he went to London Bridge he would hear of something greatly to his advantage. He went traveling the whole distance from Upsall to London on foot arrived there he took his station on the bridge where he waited until his patience was nearly exhausted and the idea that he had acted a very foolish part began to rise in his mind. At length he was accosted by a Quaker who kindly enquired what he was waiting there so long for. After some hesitation he told his dreams. The Quaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that he had had that night a very curious dream himself, which was, that if he went and dug under a certain bush in Upsall Castle in Yorkshire, he would find a pot of gold; but he did not know where Upsall was, and enquired of the countryman if he knew, who seeing some advantage in secrecy pleaded ignorance of the locality; and then thinking his business in London was completed, returned immediately home dug beneath the bush, and there he found a pot filled with gold and on the cover an inscription in a language he did not understand. The pot and cover were however preserved at the village inn where one day a bearded stranger like a Jew made his appearance saw the pot and read the inscription the plain English of which was 

    ''Look lower where this stood'' 
    ''Is another twice as good''
 
The man of Upsall hearing this resumed his spade returned to the bush dug deeper and found another pot filled with gold far more valuable than the first encouraged by this he dug deeper still and found another yet more valuable.The Vale of Mowbray: A Historical and Topographical Account of Thirsk and Its Neighbourhood; p. 277-278; By William Grainge, John Gilbert Baker; Published by Simpkin, Marshall, and co., 1859
