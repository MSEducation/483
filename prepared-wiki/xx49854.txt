==Glacial recession in Rwenzori==

A subject of concern in recent years has been the impact of climate change on Rwenzori's glaciers. In 1906 the Rwenzori had 43 named glaciers distributed over 6 mountains with a total area of [tpl]convert|7.5|km2|mi2[/tpl], about half the total glacier area in Africa. By 2005 less than half of these were still present, on only three mountains, with an area of about [tpl]convert|1.5|km2|mi2[/tpl]. Recent scientific studies, such as those by Dr. Richard Taylor of University College London, have attributed this retreat to global climate change and have investigated the impact of this change on the mountain's vegetation and biodiversity.Tom Knudson, the Mountains of the Moon, A Trek to Africaâ€™s Last Glaciers, Yale Environment 360 Report, 4 Feb 2010Glaciers (East Africa), Tropical Glaciology Group, Innsbruck University
