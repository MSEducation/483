Totem Acoustic is a Montreal, Canada-based manufacturer of loudspeaker systems.

==History==

Totem Acoustic was founded in 1987 by Vince Bruzzese, also the company's chief designer. The totem represents, to the native North American people, an entity that chooses an individual and then guides that person during his or her life. The name was chosen as an ongoing symbolic representation of this mission and vision. The company's mission is "to develop a totally new transducer, a loudspeaker capable of reproducing a truly musical and involving performance". 
After two years of research, Totem released its first small-volume box design loudspeaker, the Model One in 1989. This was the company's only model in the early years. In 1992, the Tott, the Rokk, and the Mani-2 were launched. 
Totem has continued to specialise in small box loudspeakers, of both mini-monitors and floor standing types. It also manufacturers subwoofers and speaker systems for home theater.

===Design===

Totem loudspeakers have been designed to exhibit liveliness and spaciousness of the sound of live music. This is in part attributed to the boro-silicate material (similar to that used on the space shuttle) used to damp the insides of the cabinets, and partly due to the attention paid to the crossover components.

===Sonic characteristics===

Totem speakers have been widely acclaimed,Audiophile Theater: Totem Acoustic Dreamcatcher 5.1, Home theater magazine, February 21, 2002 particularly for their dynamics, soundstage, harmonics, neutral timbre, and rhythm.
