==Background==

Lear achieved her greatest international success between 1976 and 1983 when she was signed to West German label Ariola Records. The six Ariola albums were all released in Continental Europe as well as Scandinavia, Japan, South America and some parts of the former Eastern Bloc. Lear was in fact one of the very few Western artists in the 1970s to have her music officially released in the Soviet Union, on state-owned label Melodiya.
Amanda Lear's debut single was a cover of Elvis Presley's "Trouble", released in 1975 in France by a subsidiary of Polydor Records as well as by Creole Records on the British market. The single passed fairly unnoticed, however, it did gain some attention in West Germany. It was subsequently licensed and re-released by German Polydor in March 1976, with Lear promoting the single on German TV show Musikladen in May of that same year, which resulted in her being offered a seven year and six album recording contract by the Ariola Records label. The French language version of the song appeared on the first European editions of Lear's 1977 debut album I Am a Photograph which also contained her international breakthrough single "Blood and Honey".
Following her initial signing to Ariola, various other labels were used to distribute her records in other nations, for example Chrysalis Records in the United States, Les Disques Direction Records, Siamese Records and Inter Global Records/Epic Records in Canada, RCA Victor in Australasia and South America, Columbia Records/Nippon Columbia in Japan, Eurodisc and Arabella in France, Epic Records in Greece and Cyprus, RTB in Yugoslavia, and both Polydor, RCA Victor and Ariola in Italy. In other European countries like Sweden, albums and singles were first imported West German Ariola pressings. With Lear achieving mainstream success in Sweden in 1980 with album Diamonds for Breakfast, the Scandinavian Ariola distributor, CBS Records, did however start manufacturing its own pressings of both albums and singles to meet with public demand. They also issued singles like "When" in 1980 and "Nymphomania" in 1981, targeted for the Scandinavian market specifically, although these tracks were never A-side releases in West Germany or any other territory.
In 1982 Lear took legal action against Ariola-Eurodisc in order to be released from her recording contract on the grounds of artistic differences. The lawsuit was unsuccessful and she remained with the label as stipulated in the original deal until the end of 1983, resulting in single "Incredibilmente donna" and album Tam-Tam being recorded in Italy and double A-side single "Love Your Body"/"Darkness and Light" with Anthony Monn's sound engineer Peter LÃ¼dermann. The relationship between Lear, Monn and her former record company was to stay strained all the way into the early 2000s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/learinterviews.html |title=Amanda Lear - Interviews |publisher=www.eurodancehits.com |accessdate=2009-04-11[/tpl]
