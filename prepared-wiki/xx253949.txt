UltraMantis Black (born July 17, 1975) is a professional wrestler, who performs primarily in the Chikara professional wrestling promotion, where he is the leader of The Spectral Envoy of the Final Judgment, while also regularly commentating on matches in which he is not competing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/DVDs_-_VGames_-_Books_25/article_23684.shtml|title=DVD Review: Chikara Pro "Best of Chikara," with Quackenbush, Hero, Castagnoli, Jigsaw, Gran Akuma, Sweeney|work=PWTorch|date=2007-11-20|last=Vetter|first=Chris|accessdate=2010-01-11[/tpl] Throughout his career he has also worked for promotions such as Big Japan Pro Wrestling, Combat Zone Wrestling, Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South and Jersey All Pro Wrestling.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2257&page=4|title=Matches|work=Cagematch|accessdate=2010-01-11[/tpl] As part of his gimmick, he wears a mantis mask. As UltraMantis, his original red and green attire was based on the main protagonist from the Kamen Rider series, while his ring name was derived from another Japanese television program, Ultraman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chikarafans.com/Ultra_Mantis_Black.php|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071015071550/www.chikarafans.com/Ultra_Mantis_Black.php|archivedate= 2007-10-12|title=Chikara Fans profile|accessdate=2010-08-31|work=Chikara Fans[/tpl] In May 2004 he renamed himself UltraMantis Black and adopted a new mask and a red and black attire, while also beginning to express communist views. In June 2006 he formed his own stable, the Order of the Neo–Solar Temple and adopted the dark look he has used to this day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=348|title=Chikara Fans profile|work=Chikara Fans|accessdate=2010-01-11[/tpl] UltraMantis Black, Chikara founder Mike Quackenbush, Hallowicked and Icarus are the only wrestlers who performed on Chikara's first ever show on May 25, 2002, and are still working for the promotion today.

==Professional wrestling career==

UltraMantis started his professional wrestling training in 2002 at the brand new Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was trained by Mike Quackenbush and Reckless Youth. He trained on the first term of the school alongside the likes of Hallowicked and Icarus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=1331|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103163135/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=1331|archivedate=2010-01-03|title=Chikara Wrestle Factory Terms|work=Chikara Fans|accessdate=2010-01-11[/tpl]

===Chikara===

====Debut and alliance with Mister Zero(2002–2003)====

On May 25, 2002, UltraMantis made his Chikara debut as a tecnico superhero on the promotion's first show, where he was defeated by fellow Wrestle Factory graduate Blind Rage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=548|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104002640/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=548|archivedate=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Chikara Live" (debut show) – 5/25/2002|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] Afterwards, he teamed up with another Wrestle Factory graduate, Mister Zero, to form the tag team Ultra/Zero, and together they would feud with The Wildcards (Eddie Kingston and BlackJack Marciano) for most of 2003. The long feud ended on July 5, 2003, when Ultra/Zero defeated The Wildcards in the semifinals of the inaugural Tag World Grand Prix. The duo would lose in the finals against Night Shift (Blind Rage and Hallowicked) after Zero suffered an injury. On September 27, 2003, UltraMantis received a shot at the Chikara Young Lions Cup, but was defeated by the defending champion Hallowicked.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=610|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103234446/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=610|archivedate=2010-01-03|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Chikara Live" – 9/27/2003|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl]

====Turning rudo (2004–2005)====

In early 2004, UltraMantis began showing signs of a becoming a rudo after adopting a more aggressive style and attacking fellow wrestlers after they had managed to defeat him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=622|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103231008/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=622|archivedate=2010-01-03|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Kids Eat Free On Tuesday" – 3/20/2004|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] Finally, on April 9, 2004, UltraMantis turned on Zero and abandoned him during a tag team match against Joker and Sabian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=624|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103230823/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=624|archivedate=2010-01-03|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Pick Up or Delivery" – 4/9/2004|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] At the following show on May 15, he debuted a new black mask and declared that UltraMantis was dead before announcing the birth of UltraMantis Black. He would then form a tag team with Hallowicked, known collectively as the Dark Breed, and together they would feud with Mister Zero and his new tag team partner Shane Storm. For the 2004 torneo cibernetico, the Dark Breed joined Larry Sweeney's faction Sweet 'n' Sour International, but after neither of them managed to win the match, they left the faction. In early 2005, UltraMantis Black began suffering from injuries that would force him to take on the roles of a commentator, a role he continues to hold, and a manager for Hallowicked.

====Alliance and feud with Hydra (2005–2008)====

On November 13, 2005, UltraMantis Black debuted his newest protégé, Hydra. With UltraMantis out with an injury, Hallowicked became a tecnico after forming the tag team Incoherence with tecnico wrestler Delirious. Beginning in 2006, Ultramantis debuted an entirely new mantis mask. Later on in June of that year, during the Young Lions Cup tournament, UltraMantis attacked Hallowicked and then announced the death of the Dark Breed and the birth of The Order of the Neo–Solar Temple. In October of that same year, Crossbones joined UltraMantis and Hydra as the third member of the stable. The feud between the Neo–Solar Temple and Incoherence would end during the season five finale weekend, where Incoherence first defeated UltraMantis and Hydra in a tag team match on November 17 and then UltraMantis, Hydra, Crossbones and Blind Rage in an eight man tag team match, where they teamed up with Cheech and Cloudy, the following day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=767|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104000204/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=767|archivedate=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Brick" – 11/17/2006|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=769|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104000114/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=769|archivedate=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Talent Borrows, Genius Steals" – 11/18/2006|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl]
UltraMantis, Hydra and Crossbones spent 2007 wrestling together on the undercards of Chikara events. Towards the end of the year, the team started to grow apart and on November 17, UltraMantis inexplicably helped Shane Storm, who had been on a long losing streak, defeat Hydra. On April 19, 2008, UltraMantis defeated Tim Donst, whom he had dropped on his head in Donst's debut the previous year, with the Praying Mantis Bomb. After the match, the Neo–Solar Temple kidnapped the concussed Donst and managed to convince him to become the fourth member of the faction. However, this would all be revealed a plan by Mike Quackenbush as he had sent Donst to infiltrate the Neo–Solar Temple in order to find out who had leaked the secret of the Chikara Special to Chris Hero.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/123128| title=Contemplating Chikara 11.28.09: Long Tall Weekend|accessdate=2010-01-11|last=Ford|first=Kevin|date=2009-11-28|publisher=411Mania[/tpl] Quackenbush had been feuding with Hero and in the course of the feud, Quackenbush invented a move which Hero could not break. After defeating him in a singles match, Quackenbush taught the move to every tecnico on the Chikara roster. However, on November 17, 2007, Hero had been able to break the hold and use it himself to win his feud against Equinox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=866|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104010041/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=866|archivedate=2010-01-04|title="The Sordid Perils of Everyday Existence" – 11/17/2007|accessdate=2010-01-11|publisher=ChikaraFans[/tpl] On June 18, 2008, Donst left the Neo–Solar Temple and with information gathered undercover, he was able to reveal to Quackenbush that Shane Storm, Quackenbush's longtime tag team partner, had been the one who had leaked the move and the counter to it to UltraMantis Black, who in turn taught the move to Hero. After being given an ultimatum by UltraMantis, Hydra left the Order with Donst and together they would form the tag team known as the Sea Donsters, resulting in the Neo–Solar Temple being dwindled down to a tag team. UltraMantis and Crossbones would feud the rest of the year with Donst and Hydra. On December 12, 2008, the Sea Donsters defeated the Neo–Solar Temple in a tag team match after Donst pinned Crossbones with the Donstitution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=1965|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103230200/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=1965|archivedate=2010-01-03|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Face With a View" – 12/12/2008|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] Two days later, at the season seven finale, UltraMantis and Hydra faced each other in a singles match, which Hydra was able to win after forcing his former mentor to tap out to the Hydra Lock, effectively ending their feud.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=2056|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103230117/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=2056|archivedate=2010-01-03|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Duel and Duality" – 12/14/2008|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl]

====The Eye of Tyr and BDK (2009–2010)====

In 2009 UltraMantis and Crossbones began looking for a third member in the Neo–Solar Temple. Pinkie Sanchez and Sami Callihan were given chances, but neither of them could help the Neo–Solar Temple to qualify for the 2009 King of Trios. In early 2009 UltraMantis, after being threatened by Quackenbush, revealed that the reason he had wanted the Chikara Special from Shane Storm the previous year was that with it he could get his hands on the Eye of Tyr, a mysterious artifact that could be used to control minds. The artifact, which had gone missing from Switzerland, had suddenly appeared in possession of Dr. Cube over at Kaiju Big Battel. Cube was a fan of Chris Hero's and was ready to swap the Eye of Tyr for him. Shane Storm came to UltraMantis and offered to teach him the move in order to get back to his winning ways and this is why UltraMantis had helped him defeat Hydra back in November 2007. After learning the move, UltraMantis taught it to Hero, who then, after winning his feud with Equinox, agreed to leave Chikara for Kaiju Big Battel and in exchange, Dr. Cube handed the Eye of Tyr to UltraMantis.
In April 2009, UltraMantis saw a chance to finally get revenge on his former Dark Breed partner Hallowicked and on April 26, he and Crossbones kidnapped Delirious after Incoherence's match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=3663|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104001633/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=3663|archivedate=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="The Bobliographon" – 4/26/2009|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] On May 23, 2009, UltraMantis Black and Crossbones debuted the new third member of the Neo–Solar Temple, Delirious, who had been brainwashed with the Eye of Tyr and was now under the control of UltraMantis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=3941|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104000710/http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=3941|archivedate=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|title="Aniversario Yin" – 5/23/2009|publisher=Chikara Fans[/tpl] With their newest recruit, the Order went on a winning streak, which included tag team victories over The Super Smash Bros.

However, UltraMantis did not believe this and refused to let go of the Eye. On August 16, 2009, during the third night of the annual Young Lions Cup, a man dressed in a white mask and clothes confronted UltraMantis Black in the ring and gave him a box. Inside of the box was a message stating that a war was coming. That same man would then begin sending messages over the internet to UltraMantis saying that he and his Temple would be destroyed if he did not return the Eye of Tyr to the "family".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chikarapro.com/blog65.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717202555/http://www.chikarapro.com/blog65.shtml|title=Blog #65 - UltraMantis Black|archivedate=2011-07-17|date=2009-10-04|accessdate=2010-01-11|work=Chikara[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqOUbC_KIdA|title=Urutoramantisu burakku|date=2009-09-08|accessdate=2010-01-11|publisher=YouTube|work=Chikara[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7EL6vm2XsQ|title=Neo soraa tenpuru|date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2010-01-11|publisher=YouTube|work=Chikara[/tpl] On October 18, 2009, at Cibernetico Increible the man was joined by another larger man dressed in similar fashion and together they appeared in the crowd and confronted UltraMantis, who proceeded to flee the arena. Following the event a cyborg named Vökoder, who had debuted during the Young Lions Cup, came to UltraMantis and offered to protect the Eye of Tyr and to convince him of his sincerity, Vökoder started interfering in UltraMantis' matches in order to help him win. Eventually, UltraMantis made Vökoder the fourth member of The Order of the Neo–Solar Temple.
On November 22, 2009, during the season eight finale titled Three-Fisted Tales, UltraMantis and Delirious defeated Hallowicked and his new Incoherence partner Frightmare to earn their third point, which meant that they could now challenge for the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?p=5036|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103151600/http://chikarafans.com/?p=5036|archivedate=2010-01-03|title="Three-Fisted Tales" ~ Live Results|accessdate=2010-01-11|work=Chikara Fans[/tpl] At the conclusion of the event the two masked men once again confronted UltraMantis, calling him the man with the real power in Chikara. This time both men removed their masks and revealed themselves as Ares and Tursas. Immediately following this, Vökoder, who had been given the Eye of Tyr for safekeeping, attacked UltraMantis, while Claudio Castagnoli, Carpenter Ant, Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze all turned rudo and helped Ares and Tursas beat down the tecnicos, who had gathered around the ringside area. Once the fight had subdued with the new group on top, Carpenter Ant unmasked as Pinkie Sanchez and Vökoder unmasked as Tim Donst, both of whom had a history with UltraMantis Black. After a salute, the group fled the arena with the Eye of Tyr intact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?p=5062|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100103151313/http://chikarafans.com/?p=5062|archivedate=2010-01-03|title=The Brüderschaft Have Formed|accessdate=2010-01-11|work=Chikara Fans[/tpl] Following the event, UltraMantis met with Quackenbush and claimed that in order to defeat the new group, named Bruderschaft des Kreuzes, tecnicos and rudos would have to join forces as they now had a common enemy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsL_bjwJ3u8|title=Special Update UltraMantis Black|date=2009-12-23|accessdate=2010-01-11|publisher=YouTube|work=Chikara[/tpl]

On February 28, 2010, at A World of Comforting Illusions UltraMantis Black and Delirious used their three points and challenged The Colony of Fire Ant and Soldier Ant for the Campeonatos de Parejas. The Colony retained their titles in two straight falls, after Ares came out and used the Eye of Tyr to release Delirious, who then proceeded to go crazy and run out of the arena, abandoning UltraMantis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/columns/131899/The-CHIKARA-Special-3.07.10:-A-Day-Late,-a-Dollar-Short.htm|title=The Chikara Special 3.07.10: A Day Late, a Dollar Short|last=Ford|first=Kevin|work=411Mania|date=2010-03-07|accessdate=2010-03-07[/tpl] The following day Ares declared victory over UltraMantis and announced that now that he had gained revenge on him by destroying his dream of winning, not only the Campeonatos de Parejas, but also the King of Trios, he would be returning the Eye of Tyr to Switzerland and his father's collection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chikarapro.com/blog94.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717202729/http://www.chikarapro.com/blog94.shtml|title=Blog #94 - Ares|archivedate=2011-07-17|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-03-02|work=Chikara[/tpl]

====The Spectral Envoy (2010–present)====

At the season nine finale, Reality is Relative, on December 12, Hallowicked defeated UltraMantis Black in a singles match. After the match the third hooded figure from the previous month entered the arena and revealed himself as Sinn Bodhi. Bodhi then revealed that UltraMantis Black had come to him asking for his help against BDK and he had given him Obariyon and Kodama and now he had come for his payment, the Eye of Tyr. When UltraMantis was unable to produce the Eye of Tyr he was attacked by Obariyon, Kodama and the debuting Kobald. In the end, Hallowicked and Frightmare made the save for UltraMantis and chased Bodhi's group, later named The Batiri, out of the ring.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/167475/100-Percent-Fordified:-CHIKARA-Reality-is-Relative.htm|title=100 Percent Fordified: Chikara Reality is Relative|last=Ford|first=Kevin|date=2010-12-25|accessdate=2010-12-25|work=411Mania[/tpl] Two days later UltraMantis revealed in a blog that after the debut of BDK, he had gone soul searching and ran into three strange beings, who while a possible asset to the Order of the Neo–Solar Temple, needed training. UltraMantis could not send them to the Chikara Wrestle Factory, which was run by BDK leader Claudio Castagnoli and turned to his old acquaintance Sinn Bodhi for help. Bodhi not only trained the three, but also made them obey him, not UltraMantis and with his actions cost him his match against Ares the previous month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chikarapro.com/blog191.shtml|title=Blog #191 - UltraMantis Black|date=2010-12-14|accessdate=2010-12-14|work=Chikara[/tpl] At the season ten premiere, Chaos in the Sea of Lost Souls, on January 23, 2011, UltraMantis Black defeated Bodhi via disqualification, after being attacked by The Batiri.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/173599/100-Percent-Fordified:-CHIKARA-Chaos-in-the-Sea-of-Lost-Souls.htm|title=100 Percent Fordified: Chikara Chaos in the Sea of Lost Souls|last=Ford|first=Kevin|date=2011-02-13|work=411Mania|accessdate=2011-02-15[/tpl] A rematch between UltraMantis Black and Bodhi took place on March 13, with Bodhi emerging victorious, while also tearing his opponent's mask to shreds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/19827/|title=Mon. update: Last night's main events, UFC specials this week, Snooki, UFC activities|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|date=2011-03-14|work=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|accessdate=2011-03-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1300474356|title=Viva La Raza!
