The  Catholic Monarchs ([tpl]lang-es|Reyes Católicos[/tpl])"Reyes Católicos" is literally "Catholic Kings" rather than "Monarchs", and is sometimes incorrectly so rendered in English; but in Spanish it is usual for the masculine plural to be used in an essentially gender-indifferent way, so for example it is usual in Spanish to call the children of a person or couple "hijos", literally sons, regardless of actual gender, while in English "sons", and "kings", are exclusively masculine. is the joint title used in history for Queen Isabella I of Castile[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08177a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Isabella I |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl] and King Ferdinand II of Aragon.  They were both from the House of Trastámara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; on marriage they were given a papal dispensation to deal with consanguinity by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. Their marriage united both crowns under the same family. John Elliot and many other historians consider that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, but newer historical opinions recognize that under their rule Spain was still a composite monarchy. Castile and Aragon remained largely separate entities for decades to come. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local feudal lords.
The title of "Catholic King and Queen" was bestowed on them by Pope Alexander VI in 1496, for defending Catholic dogmas within their realms.
"Catholic monarchs" or "kings" can also be used in a generic sense (e.g., "the Pope had authority over Catholic monarchs..."); the particular or generic use can be distinguished from the context.
