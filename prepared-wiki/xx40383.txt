The Crimean Peninsula ([tpl]lang-ru|Крымский полуостров[/tpl], [tpl]lang-uk|Кримський півострів[/tpl], [tpl]lang-crh|Qırım yarımadası[/tpl]), also known simply as Crimea, is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by water. The peninsula is located just south of the Ukrainian mainland and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is surrounded by two seas: the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the east. It is connected with the Ukrainian mainland by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast; a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov.
Crimea—or the Tauric Peninsula, as it was formerly known—has historically been at the boundary between the classical world and the steppe. Its southern fringe was colonised by the ancient Greeks, the ancient Romans, the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading steppe nomads, such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, Goths, Bulgars, Huns, Khazars, Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde.
Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the Crimean Khanate during the 15th to 18th century before falling to the Russian Empire and being organised as its Taurida Oblast in 1783. In 1954, the Soviet Crimean Oblast was transferred from Russia to Ukraine. It became the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine in 1991, with Sevastopol having its own administration within Ukraine but outside of the Autonomous Republic.
Sovereignty and control of the peninsula became the subject of the ongoing 2014 Crimean crisis, a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine.

==Name==

The classical name Tauris or Taurica is from the Greek  Ταυρική, after the peninsula's Scytho-Cimmerian  inhabitants, the Tauri. Strabo and Ptolemy refer to the Strait of Kerch as the Bosporus Cimmerius, and to Cimmerium as the capital of the Taurida, whence the peninsula, or its easternmost part, was also named Promontorium Cimmerium.An universal history, from the earliest accounts to the present time, vol. 9 (1779), p. 127.
In English, the Crimean Khanate is referred to as Crim Tartary in the early modern period.[ref]Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 1, 306f. "the peninsula of Crim Tartary, known to the ancients under the name of Chersonesus Taurica"; ibid. Volume 10 (1788), p. 211: "The modern reader must not confound this old Cherson of the Tauric or Crimean peninsula  with a new city of the same name".

gradually replacing the classical name of Tauric peninsula in the course of the 19th century. 
The omission of the definite article in English ("Crimea" rather than "the Crimea") becomes common during the later 20th century.
The name "Crimea" ultimately, via Italian, takes its origin with the name of  Qırım (today's Stary Krym) which served as a capital of the Crimean province of the Golden Horde. 
The name of the capital was extended to the entire peninsula at some point during Ottoman suzerainty.W. Radloff, Versuch eines Wörterbuches der Türk-Dialecte (1888), ii. 745
The origin of the name Qırım  itself is uncertain. It is mostly explained as:
Alexander MacBean, Samuel Johnson, Cimmerium in A Dictionary of Ancient Geography (1773).[/ref]
The classical name was revived in the name of the Russian Taurida Governorate.[ref]Edith Hall, Adventures with Iphigenia in Tauris (2013), p. 176:
"it was indeed at some point between the 1730s and the 1770s that the dream of recreating ancient 'Taurida' in the southern Crimea was conceived. Catherine's plan was to create a paradisiacal imperial 'garden' there, and her Greek archbishop Eugenios Voulgaris obliged by inventing a new etymology for the old name of Tauris, deriving it from taphros, which (he claimed) was the ancient Greek for a ditch dug by human hands." 
[/ref]
While it was abandoned in the Soviet Union, and has had no official status since 1921, it is still used by some institutions in Crimea, such as the  Taurida National University, or the  Tavriya Simferopol football club.

==History==

In ancient times, it was the home of Cimmerians and Scythians, as well as the site of Greek colonies. The most important city was Chersonesos at the edge of today's Sevastopol.
Later occupiers included the Romans, Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Khazars, the state of Kievan Rus', the Byzantine Empire, the Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde. In the 13th century, portions were controlled by the Republic of Venice and by the Republic of Genoa.
In the 9th century, Byzantium established the Cherson theme to fend against incursions by the Rus' Khaganate, and the Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and Khazaria. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres, and became a center of slave trade in particular, the word slave itself deriving from the ethnonym of the Slavs who were sold to the Muslim world and Byzantium during this period. 
In the 1230s, this status quo was swept away by the Mongol invasions, and Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century.
The Crimean Khanate, a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, succeeded the Golden Horde and lasted from 1449 to 1779.[tpl]cite web |author=Brian Glyn Williams |title=The Sultan’s Raiders: The Military Role of the Crimean Tatars in the Ottoman Empire |url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/Crimean_Tatar_-_complete_report_01.pdf |work=The Jamestown Foundation|year=2013|page=27[/tpl] Until the late 18th century, Crimean Tatars maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire, exporting about 2 million slaves from Russia and Ukraine over the period 1500–1700.Darjusz Kołodziejczyk, as reported by [tpl]cite web |author=Mikhail Kizilov |title=Slaves, Money Lenders, and Prisoner Guards:The Jews and the Trade in Slaves and Captivesin the Crimean Khanate |url=http://www.academia.edu/3706285/Slaves_Money_Lenders_and_Prisoner_Guards_The_Jews_and_the_Trade_in_Slaves_and_Captives_in_the_Crimean_Khanate |work=The Journal of Jewish Studies|year=2007|page=2[/tpl] The Khanate was conquered by the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great in 1783. From 1853 to 1856, the peninsula was the site of the principal engagements of the Crimean War, a conflict fought between the Russian Empire and an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia.
During the Russian Civil War, Crimea was controlled by the White Army. After they were defeated by the Red Army, Crimea became part of the Soviet Union in 1921 as Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the Second World War the peninsula was occupied by Nazi Germany from July 1942-May 1944.
In 1954, it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union."Ukraine and the west: hot air and hypocrisy". The Guardian. March 10, 2014. In 1991, it became part of independent Ukraine as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. As a result of the 2014 Crimean crisis, the accompanying Russian military intervention and the Crimean status referendum, 2014, the sovereignty over the peninsula is currently disputed between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The peninsula is de facto controlled by the Russian Federation, in the form of two federal subjects: the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.

==Geography==

Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the western coast of the Sea of Azov, bordering Ukraine's Kherson Oblast from the north.
The natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland is formed by the Sivash or "Rotten Sea", a large system of shallow lagoons. The peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's Henichesk Raion, and thus the European mainland, via the  Isthmus of Perekop, a strip of land about  [tpl]convert|5|–|7|km|mi|1[/tpl] wide, as well as by bridges over the narrow Chongar and Henichesk straits. The northern part of Arabat Spit is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of Shchaslyvtseve and Strilkove. The eastern tip of the peninsula is the Kerch Peninsula, separated from Taman Peninsula on the Russian mainland by the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, at a width of between [tpl]convert|3|–|13|km|mi|1[/tpl].
Geographically, the peninsula is generally divided into three zones: steppe, mountains and southern coast.

===Coastline===

The Crimean peninsula comprises many smaller peninsulas, such as the mentioned Kerch peninsula, Heracles Peninsula, Tarhankut Peninsula and many others. Crimea also possesses lots of headlands such as Cape Priboiny,  Cape Tarkhankut, Sarych,   Cape Fonar,   Kazantyp, Cape Akburun, and many others.
The Crimean coastline is broken by several bays and harbors. These harbors lie west of the Isthmus of Perekop by the Bay of Karkinit; on the southwest by the open Bay of Kalamita between the port cities of Eupatoria and Sevastopol.
The Kerch Peninsula is attached to  the Crimean mainland by Isthmus of Yenikale, delimited by the    Bay of Arabat to the north (interrputed by the incoming Arabat Spit),  and the Bay of Caffa[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] to the south (arching eastward from the port of Feodosiya).

===Crimean Mountains===

The southeast coast is flanked at a distance of [tpl]convert|8|–|12|km|mi|1[/tpl] from the sea by a parallel range of mountains, the Crimean Mountains.The Crimean Mountains may also be referred to as the Yaylâ Dağ or Alpine Meadow Mountains. These mountains are backed by secondary parallel ranges.
The main range of these mountains shoots up with extraordinary abruptness from the deep floor of the Black Sea to an altitude of [tpl]convert|600|–|750|m|ft|0[/tpl], beginning at the southwest point of the peninsula, called Cape Fiolente.  It was believed that this cape was supposedly crowned with the temple of Artemis, where Iphigeneia is said to have officiated as priestess.See the article "Crimea" in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.
Uchan-su waterfall on the south slope of the mountains is the highest  in Ukraine.

===Steppe===

Seventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid prairie lands, a southward continuation of the Pontic steppes, which slope gently to the northwest from the foot of the Crimean Mountains. 
Numerous kurgans, or burial mounds, of the ancient Scythians are scattered across the Crimean steppes.

===Crimean Riviera===

The terrain that lies beyond the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character. Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are smothered with greenery. This "riviera" stretches along the southeast coast from capes Fiolente and Aya, in the south, to Feodosiya, and is studded with summer sea-bathing resorts such as Alupka, Yalta, Gurzuf, Alushta, Sudak, and Feodosiya. During the years of Soviet rule, the resorts and dachas of this coast served as the prime perquisites of the politically loyal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]why here? and ref? In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region. Fishing, mining, and the production of essential oils are also important. Numerous Crimean Tatar villages, mosques, monasteries, and palaces of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.

===Climate===

Most of Crimea has a temperate continental climate, except for the south coast where it experiences a humid subtropical climate[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl], due to warm influences from the Black Sea and the high ground of the Crimean Mountains. Summers can be hot ([tpl]convert|28|°C|°F|1|disp=s[/tpl] Jul average) and winters are cool ([tpl]convert|-0.3|°C|°F|1|disp=s[/tpl] Jan average) in the interior, on the south coast winters are milder ([tpl]convert|4|°C|°F|1|disp=s[/tpl] Jan average) and temperatures much below freezing are exceptional. On the high ground, freezing weather is common in winter. Precipitation throughout Crimea is low, averaging only [tpl]convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] a year. The Crimean coast is shielded from the north winds by the mountains, and as a result usually has mild winters. Cool season temperatures average around [tpl]convert|7|°C|°F|1[/tpl] and it is rare for the weather to drop below freezing except in the mountains, where there is usually snow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/climate.html |title=Climate in Crimea,Weather in Yalta:How Often Does it Rain in Crimea? |publisher=Blacksea-crimea.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl] Because of its climate, the southern Crimean coast is a popular beach and sun resort for Ukrainian and Russian tourists.

===Strategic value===

The Black Sea ports of Crimea provide quick access to the Eastern Mediterranean, Balkans and Middle East. Historically, possession of the southern coast of Crimea was sought after by most empires of the greater region since antiquity (Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Russian, British and French, Nazi German, Soviet).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10671066/What-is-the-Crimea-and-why-does-it-matter.html |title=What is the Crimea, and why does it matter? |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2014-03-02 |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl]
The Dnieper River is a major waterway and transportation route that crosses the European continent from north to south and ultimately links the Black Sea with the Baltic Sea, of strategic importance since the historical trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. The Black Sea serves as an economic thoroughfare connecting the Caucasus region and the Caspian Sea to central and Eastern Europe.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2014/March/Russias-Deputy-PM-Scoffs-at-US-Sanctions/ | title=Crimea Annexation 'Robbery on International Scale' | work=CBN News | date=2014-03-19 | accessdate=19 March 2014 | agency=CBN News [/tpl]

==Economy==

The main branches of the Crimean economy are tourism and agriculture.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Industrial plants are situated for the most part in the northern regions of the republic. Important industrial cities include Dzhankoy, housing a major railway connection, Krasnoperekopsk and Armyansk, among others.
The most important industries in Crimea include food production, chemical fields, mechanical engineering and metal working, and fuel production industries. Sixty percent of the industry market belongs to food production. There are a total of 291 large industrial enterprises and 1002 small business enterprises.
Agriculture in the region includes cereals, vegetable-growing, gardening, and wine-making, particularly in the Yalta and Massandra regions. Livestock production includes cattle breeding, poultry keeping, and sheep breeding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/printable_article?art_id=301361|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070121174522/http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/printable_article?art_id=301361|archivedate=2007-01-21 |title=Autonomous Republic of Crimea – Information card |accessdate=February 22, 2007 |work=Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine [/tpl] Other products produced on the Crimean Peninsula include salt, porphyry, limestone, and ironstone (found around Kerch).[tpl]Cite book| title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition | author=Bealby, John T. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1911 | page= 449[/tpl]

===Energy===

Crimea also possesses several natural gas fields both onshore and offshore, all connected to Ukraine's pipeline system and were starting to be drilled by western oil and gas companies before annexation.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/07/ukraine-crisis-gas-crimea-idUSL6N0M41R320140307 |title=Ukraine's Black Sea gas ambitions seen at risk over Crimea |date=[tpl]date|2014-03-07[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]date|2014-03-07[/tpl] |first=Henning |last=Gloystein |publisher=Reuters [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eegas.com/ukraine.htm |title=East European Gas Analysis - Ukrainian Gas Pipelines |publisher=Eegas.com |date=2013-02-09 |accessdate=2014-03-08[/tpl] The inland fields are located in Chornomorske and Dzhankoy, while offshore fields are located in the western coast in the Black Sea and in the northeastern coast in the Azov Sea:[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26387353 |title=Ukraine crisis in maps |date=[tpl]date|2014-03-05[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]date|2014-03-07[/tpl] |publisher=BBC [/tpl]
The republic also possesses two oil fields: one onshore, the Serebryankse oil field in Rozdolne, and one offshore, the Subbotina oil field in the Black Sea.

===Infrastructure===

Almost every settlement in Crimea is connected with another settlement with bus lines. Crimea contains the longest (96 km or 59 mi) trolleybus route in the world, stretching from Simferopol to Yalta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/Places/trolleybuses.html |title=The longest trolleybus line in the world! |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com [/tpl] The trolleybus line starts near Simferopol's Railway Station through the mountains to Alushta and on to Yalta. The length of line is about 90 km. It was founded in 1959.
Railroad lines running through Crimea include Armyansk—Kerch (with a link to Feodosiya), and Melitopol—Sevastopol (with a link to Yevpatoria), connecting Crimea to the Ukrainian mainland.
The cities of Yalta, Feodosiya, Kerch, Sevastopol, Chornomorske and Yevpatoria are connected to one another by sea routes. In the cities of Yevpatoria and nearby townlet Molochnoye are tram systems.

===Tourism===

The development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century. The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of the Russian Empire.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a major development of palaces, villas, and dachas began—most of which remain. These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination. There are many Crimean legends about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.
A new phase of tourist development began when the Soviet government realized the potential of the healing quality of the local air, lakes and therapeutic muds. It became a "health" destination for Soviet workers, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet tourists visited Crimea.
Artek is a  former Young Pioneer camp  on the Black Sea in the town of Hurzuf, near Ayu-Dag, established in 1925.   In 1969 it had an area of 3.2 km². The camp consisted of 150 buildings Unlike most of the young pioneer camps, Artek was an all-year camp, due to the warm climate. Artek was considered to be a privilege for Soviet children during its existence, as well as for children from other communist countries. During its heyday, 27,000 children a year vacationed at Artek. Between 1925 and 1969 the camp hosted 300,000 children.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Entry on Artek After the breaking up of the Young Pioneers in 1991 its prestige declined, though it remained a popular vacation destination.The International Children Center Artek - Ukrainian tours
In the 1990s, Crimea became more of a get-away destination than a "health-improvement" destination. The most visited areas are the south shore of Crimea with cities of Yalta and Alushta, the western shore - Eupatoria and Saki, and the south-eastern shore - Feodosia and Sudak.
According to National Geographic, Crimea was among the top 20 travel destinations in 2013.Best Trips 2013 Crimea, National Geographic Society
Crimea possesses significant historical and natural resources and is a region where it is possible to find practically any type of landscape; mountain ranges and plateaus, grasslands, caves. Furthermore, Saki poses unique therapeutic mud and Eupatoria has vast empty beaches with the purest quartz sand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecrimea.org.ua|title=Crimea Travel Guide|publisher=CrimeaTravel|accessdate=2012-12-25[/tpl]

Ethnic composition of Crimea's population has changed dramatically since the early 20th century. The 1879 Russian Empire Census for the Taurida Governorate
reported: 194,294 (35.55%) Crimean Tatars, 180,963 (33.11%) Russians  and  64,703 (11.84%) Ukrainians.

Jews in Crimea were historically Krymchaks and Karaites (the latter a small group centered at Yevpatoria). The 1879 census for the Taurida Governorate reported  a Jewish population of 4.20%, not including a Karaite population of 0.43%.
The Krymchaks (but not the Karaites) were targeted for annihilation during Nazi occupation.
