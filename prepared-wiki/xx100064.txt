[[Norte Grande (Azores)]]

CATEGORIES: Parishes of Velas (Azores)

Norte Grande is a civil parish in the municipality of Velas on the island of São Jorge in the Azores; owing to the existence of an ecumenical faith community throughout its history, the parish has also taken on the name of its religious invokation (Nossa Senhora dos Neves, or Neves, for short).  The population in 2001 is 688, its density is 21.5/km² and the area is 32.06 km².

==History==

Owing to the number of settlers, a main road was justified into the area of Neves and surrounding areaas around 1570.

==Geography==

Norte Grande straddles the interior crest and northern coast of São Jorge, approximately the middle of the island. Apart from an interior that is covered in spatter cones, the parish is dotted by sea level debris fields called "fajãs". During the settlement period these became sites of colonization, since the northern coast is wall of cliffs, historically accessible by foot or pack-animal. There are few settlements in the relatively sparse interior, apart from the two primary fajãs (Fajã da Aeira and Fajã do Ouvidor), only two many settlements are observable: Outeiro da Cruz and Neves. Between these settlements and the southern border are plains of agricultural and forested land, in addition to many inactive volcanic cones.
