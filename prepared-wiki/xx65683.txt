The pineal gland, also known as the pineal body, conarium or epiphysis cerebri, is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain. It produces the serotonin derivative, melatonin, a hormone that affects the modulation of sleep patterns in the circadian rhythms and seasonal functions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Macchi M, Bruce J |title= Human pineal physiology and functional significance of melatonin |journal=Front Neuroendocrinol |volume=25 |issue=3–4 |pages=177–95 |year=2004 |pmid=15589268 |doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.08.001[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Arendt J, Skene DJ |title=Melatonin as a chronobiotic |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=25–39 |year=2005 |pmid=15649736 |quote=Exogenous melatonin has acute sleepiness-inducing and temperature-lowering effects during 'biological daytime', and when suitably timed (it is most effective around dusk and dawn) it will shift the phase of the human circadian clock (sleep, endogenous melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol) to earlier (advance phase shift) or later (delay phase shift) times. |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2004.05.002[/tpl] Its shape resembles a tiny pine cone (hence its name), and it is located in the epithalamus, near the centre of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join.
Nearly all vertebrate species possess a pineal gland.  The most important exception is the hagfish, which is often thought of as the most primitive type of vertebrate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vernadakis AJ, Bemis WE, Bittman EL |title=Localization and partial characterization of melatonin receptors in amphioxus, hagfish, lamprey, and skate |journal=Gen.

The lamprey (considered almost as primitive as the hagfish), however, does possess one.  A few more developed vertebrates, including the alligator, lack pineal glands because they have been lost over the course of evolution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Erlich SS, Apuzzo ML |title=The pineal gland: anatomy, physiology, and clinical significance |journal=J. Neurosurg. |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=321–41 |date=September 1985 |pmid=2862230 |doi=10.3171/jns.1985.63.3.0321[/tpl]
The gland has been compared to the photoreceptive, so-called third parietal eye present in the epithalamus of some animal species, which is also called the pineal eye. René Descartes believed the pineal gland to be the "principal seat of the soul" and viewed it as the third eye.

==Structure==

The pineal gland is reddish-gray and about the size of a grain of rice (5–8 mm) in humans, located just rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus and behind and beneath the stria medullaris, between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies. It is part of the epithalamus. It is located in the quadrigeminal cistern and is bathed in the cerebrospinal fluid.http://www.ajnr.org/content/19/9/1631.full.pdf
The pineal gland is a midline structure (the geometrical center) shaped like a pine cone,[tpl]cite web|last=Bowen|first=R.|title=The Pineal Gland and Melatonin|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/pineal.html|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] 

===Blood supply===

Unlike much of the rest of the mammalian brain, the pineal gland is not isolated from the body by the blood–brain barrier system;[tpl]cite book |last=Pritchard |first=Thomas C. |coauthors=Alloway, Kevin Douglas |title=Medical Neuroscience |url=http://books.google.com/?id=m7Y80PcFHtsC&printsec=frontcover#PPA76,M1 |format=Google books preview |accessdate=2009-02-08 |year=1999 |publisher=Hayes Barton Press |isbn= 1-889325-29-5 |pages=76–77[/tpl] it has profuse blood flow, second only to the kidney.

===Innervation===

The pineal gland receives a sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion. However, a parasympathetic innervation from the pterygopalatine and otic ganglia is also present. Further, some nerve fibers penetrate into the pineal gland via the pineal stalk (central innervation). Also, neurons in the trigeminal ganglion innervate the gland with nerve fibers containing the neuropeptide PACAP.

===Histology===

The pineal body consists in humans of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue spaces. The gland's surface is covered by a pial capsule.
The pineal gland consists mainly of pinealocytes, but four other cell types have been identified. As it is quite cellular (in relation to the cortex and white matter), it may be mistaken for a neoplasm.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Prayson RA |title=An algorithmic approach to the brain biopsy—part I |journal=Arch.

Human follicles contain a variable quantity of gritty material, called corpora arenacea (or "acervuli," or "brain sand"). Chemical analysis shows that they are composed of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate, and ammonium phosphate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bocchi G, Valdre G |title=Physical, chemical, and mineralogical characterization of carbonate-hydroxyapatite concretions of the human pineal gland |journal=J Inorg Biochem |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=209–20 |year=1993 |pmid=8381851 |doi=10.1016/0162-0134(93)80006-U[/tpl] In 2002, deposits of the calcite form of calcium carbonate were described.[tpl]cite journal |author=Baconnier S, Lang S, Polomska M, Hilczer B, Berkovic G, Meshulam G |title=Calcite microcrystals in the pineal gland of the human brain: first physical and chemical studies |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=488–95 |year=2002 |pmid=12224052 |doi=10.1002/bem.10053[/tpl] Calcium, phosphorus[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hum/bter/2007/00000119/00000002/art00004 |title=IngentaConnect High Accumulation of Calcium and Phosphorus in the Pineal Bodies |publisher=Ingentaconnect.com |date= 2006-06-16 |accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl] deposits in the pineal gland have been linked with aging.

==Function==

Melatonin is N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine, a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan, which also has other functions in the central nervous system. The production of melatonin by the pineal gland is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light.[tpl]cite journal |author=Axelrod J |title=The pineal gland |journal=Endeavour |volume=29 |issue=108 |pages=144–8 |year=1970 |pmid=4195878[/tpl]Lowrey, Phillip L., and Joseph S. Takahashi. "Genetics of the mammalian circadian system: photic entrainment, circadian pacemaker mechanisms, and posttranslational regulation." Annual review of genetics 34.1 (2000): 533-562. Photosensitive cells in the retina detect light and directly signal the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), entraining its rhythm to the 24-hour cycle in nature. Fibers project from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), which relay the circadian signals to the spinal cord and out via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there into the pineal gland.
The compound pinoline is also produced in the pineal gland; it is one of the beta-carbolines.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

===Drug metabolism===

Studies on rodents suggest that the pineal gland may influence the actions of recreational drugs, such as cocaine,[tpl]cite journal |author=Uz T, Akhisaroglu M, Ahmed R, Manev H |title=The pineal gland is critical for circadian Period1 expression in the striatum and for circadian cocaine sensitization in mice |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=2117–23 |year=2003 |pmid=12865893 |doi= 10.1038/sj.npp.1300254[/tpl] and antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac),[tpl]cite journal |author=Uz T, Dimitrijevic N, Akhisaroglu M, Imbesi M, Kurtuncu M, Manev H |title=The pineal gland and anxiogenic-like action of fluoxetine in mice |journal=Neuroreport |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=691–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15094477 |doi=10.1097/00001756-200403220-00023[/tpl] and its hormone melatonin can protect against neurodegeneration.[tpl]cite journal |author=Manev H, Uz T, Kharlamov A, Joo J |title=Increased brain damage after stroke or excitotoxic seizures in melatonin-deficient rats |journal=FASEB J |volume=10 |issue=13 |pages=1546–51 |year=1996 |pmid=8940301[/tpl]
Dr. Rick Strassman, who conducted research on the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in the 1990s at the University of New Mexico, has speculated that the pineal gland plays a role in the production of DMT in the human brain. Strassman has also advanced the controversial hypothesis that a massive release of DMT from the pineal gland prior to death, or near death, can result in a near-death experience (NDE). Strassman has suggested that the pineal gland is responsible for DMT production  because enzymatic material needed to produce DMT is found there (see evidence in mammals) in substantially greater concentrations than in any other part of the body, Strassman (p. 69[tpl]cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule.

In 2013, researchers first reported DMT in the pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barker SA, Borjigin J, Lomnicka I, Strassman R |title=LC/MS/MS analysis of the endogenous dimethyltryptamine hallucinogens, their precursors, and major metabolites in rat pineal gland microdialysate |journal=Biomed Chromatogr. |date=Jul 2013 |volume= |issue= |pages= |pmid=23881860 |doi=10.1002/bmc.2981[/tpl]

==Clinical significance==

===Calcification===

The pineal gland is often seen in skull X-rays, when it is calcified (in old age).[tpl]cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Robert A|title=Age-Related Incidence of Pineal Calcification Detected by Computed Tomography|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/142/3/659.full.pdf|publisher=Radiological Society of North America|accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl]
Calcification of the pineal gland is typical in adults, and has been observed in children as young as 2.  Calcification rates vary widely by country and tend to increase by age, with calcification occurring in an estimated 40% of Americans by their 17th year. Calcification of the pineal gland is largely associated with corpora arenacea (or "acervuli," or "brain sand").
It seems that the internal secretions of the pineal gland inhibit the development of the reproductive glands, because, in cases where it is severely damaged in children, the result is accelerated development of the sexual organs and the skeleton. In animals, the pineal gland appears to play a major role in sexual development, hibernation, metabolism, and seasonal breeding.Strassman
Some recent studies show that the degree of pineal gland calcification is significantly higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease vs. other types of dementia.[tpl]cite pmid|17097768[/tpl]
Pineal gland calcification may also contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and may reflect an absence of crystallization inhibitors.
Calcium, phosphorus, and fluoride deposits in the pineal gland have been correlated with aging, showing that, as the brain ages, more deposits collect.[tpl]cite journal | last = Luke | first = Jennifer |date=March–April 2001| title = Fluoride Deposition in the Aged Human Pineal Gland | journal = Caries Res | volume = 2001 | issue = 35 | pages = 125–128 | publisher = | pmid = 11275672 | doi = 10.1159/000047443 | oclc =  | accessdate = 2009-05-20 | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = [/tpl]

===Cancer===

All tumors involving the pineal gland are rare; most (50% to 70%) arise from sequestered embryonic germ cells. They most commonly take the form of so-called germinomas, resembling testicular seminoma or ovarian dysegerminoma. Other lines of germ cell differentiation include embryonal carcinomas; choriocarcinomas; mixtures of germinom, embryonal carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma, and, uncommonly, typical teratomas (usually benign). Whether to characterize these germ cell neoplasms as pinealomas is still a subject of debate, but most pinealophiles favor restricting the terms pinealoma to neoplasms arising from the pineocytes.
A pineal tumor can compress the superior colliculi and pretectal area of the dorsal midbrain, producing Parinaud's syndrome. Pineal tumors also can cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus.
These neoplasms are divided into two categories, pineoblastomas and pineocytomas,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates with their neoplastic aggressiveness. The clinical course of patients with pineocytomas is prolonged, averaging 7 years.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The lesions being located where they are, it is understandable that successful excision is at best difficult.

==Other animals==

Pinealocytes in many non-mammalian vertebrates have a strong resemblance to the photoreceptor cells of the eye. Some evolutionary biologists believe that the vertebrate pineal cells possess a common evolutionary ancestor with retinal cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Klein D |title=The 2004 Aschoff/Pittendrigh lecture: Theory of the origin of the pineal gland—a tale of conflict and resolution |journal=J Biol Rhythms |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=264–79 |year=2004 |pmid=15245646 |doi=10.1177/0748730404267340[/tpl]
Pineal cytostructure seems to have evolutionary similarities to the retinal cells of chordates. Modern birds and reptiles have been found to express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the pineal gland. Avian pineal glands are believed to act like the SCN in mammals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Natesan A, Geetha L, Zatz M |title=Rhythm and soul in the avian pineal |journal=Cell Tissue Res |volume=309 |issue=1 |pages=35–45 |year=2002 |pmid=12111535 |doi=10.1007/s00441-002-0571-6[/tpl]
In some vertebrates, exposure to light can set off a chain reaction of enzymatic events within the pineal gland that regulate circadian rhythms.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 6015532 | volume=155 | issue=759 | title=Visual pathway mediating pineal response to environmental light |date=January 1967 | journal=Science | pages=220–3 | author=Moore RY, Heller A, Wurtman RJ, Axelrod J | doi = 10.1126/science.155.3759.220[/tpl] Some early vertebrate fossil skulls have a pineal foramen (opening). This correlates with the physiology of the modern "living fossils," the lampreys and the tuatara, and some other vertebrates that have a parietal eye| which, in some of them, is photosensitive. The parietal eye represents evolution's earlier approach to photoreception.[tpl]cite journal |last=Schwab |first=I.R. |coauthors=O'Connor, G.R. |date=March 2005 |title=The lonely eye |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=89 |issue=3 |page=256 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2004.059105 |pmc=1772576 |pmid=15751188[/tpl] The structures of the pineal eye in the tuatara are analogous to the cornea, lens, and retina, though the latter resembles that of an octopus rather than a vertebrate retina. The asymmetrical whole consists of the "eye" to the left and the pineal sac to the right. "In animals that have lost the parietal eye, including mammals, the pineal sac is retained and condensed into the form of the pineal gland."
Fossils seldom preserve soft anatomy. The brain of the Russian Melovatka bird, about 90 million years old, is an exception, and it shows a larger-than-expected parietal eye and pineal gland.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kurochkin |first=Evgeny N. |coauthors=Gareth J. Dyke, Sergei V. Saveliev, Evgeny M. Pervushov, Evgeny V. Popov |date=June 2007 |title=A fossil brain from the Cretaceous of European Russia and avian sensory evolution |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=309–313 |publisher=The Royal Society |pmid=17426009 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0617 |pmc=2390680[/tpl]
In humans and other mammals, the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the pineal gland.

==Society and culture==

René Descartes, dedicating much time to the study of the pineal (Pine-cone-shaped) gland, called it the "principal seat of the soul".Descartes and the Pineal Gland (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) He believed it to be the point of connection between the intellect and the body.Descartes R. "The Passions of the Soul" excerpted from "Philosophy of the Mind," Chalmers, D. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc.; 2002. ISBN 978-0-19-514581-6 Descartes attached significance to the gland because he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part rather than one-half of a pair. He argued that, because a person can never have "more than one thought at a time," external stimuli must be united within the brain before being considered by the soul, and he considered the pineal gland to be situated in "the most suitable possible place for this purpose," located centrally in the brain and surrounded by branches of the carotid arteries.
Baruch de Spinoza criticized Descartes' viewpoint for neither following from self-evident premises nor being "clearly and distinctly perceived" (Descartes having previously asserted that he could not draw conclusions of this sort), and questioned what Descartes meant by talking of "the union of the mind and the body."http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ethics_%28Spinoza%29/Part_5
The notion of a "pineal-eye" is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study Against Architecture. In this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a "pineal-eye" as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess and delirium.Hollier, D, Against Architecture: The Writings of Georges Bataille, trans. Betsy Wing, MIT, 1989. This conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts, The Jesuve and The Pineal Eye.Bataille, G, Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927–1939 (Theory and History of Literature, Vol 14), trans. Allan Stoekl et al., Manchester University Press, 1985
Numerous spiritual philosophies contain the notion of an inner Third Eye that is related to the Ajna chakra and also the pineal gland, and to which is attributed significance in mystical awakening or enlightenment, clairvoyant perception, and higher states of consciousness. This idea occurs historically in ancient central and east Asia, and also in contemporary occult theories relating to yoga, Theosophy,Hinduism, Pagan religions, and New Age spiritual philosophies. There is no clinical evidence to support these assertions.

==History==

The secretory activity of the pineal gland is only partially understood. Its location deep in the brain suggested to philosophers throughout history that it possesses particular importance. This combination led to its being regarded as a "mystery" gland with mystical, metaphysical, and occult theories surrounding its perceived functions.
The pineal gland was originally believed to be a "vestigial remnant" of a larger organ. In 1917, it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin. Dermatology professor Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues at Yale University, hoping that a substance from the pineal might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated and named the hormone melatonin in 1958.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lerner AB, Case JD, Takahashi Y |title=Isolation of melatonin and 5-methoxyindole-3-acetic acid from bovine pineal glands |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=235 |pages=1992–7 |year=1960 |pmid=14415935[/tpl] The substance did not prove to be helpful as intended, but its discovery helped solve several mysteries such as why removing the rat's pineal accelerated ovary growth, why keeping rats in constant light decreased the weight of their pineals, and why pinealectomy and constant light affect ovary growth to an equal extent; this knowledge gave a boost to the then new field of chronobiology.[tpl]cite book |last=Coates |first=Paul M. |others=Marc R.
