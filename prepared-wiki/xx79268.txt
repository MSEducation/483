CATEGORIES: 1970 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1970 was held on April 29, 1970, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The former Legislative Assembly had been renamed the "National Assembly" in 1968. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa, defeated the incumbent Union Nationale, led by Jean-Jacques Bertrand.
The Union Nationale, which had governed Quebec through most of the 1940s and 1950s, never held power again.
This election marked the first appearance by a new party, the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, led by former Liberal cabinet minister René Lévesque. The PQ won a modest seven seats, although Lévesque was defeated in his own riding.  The PQ would later win over many of the Union Nationale's nationalist supporters, contributing to that party's demise.
Only a few months after the election, Quebec faced a severe test with the October Crisis, in which Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and assassinated by the Front de libération du Québec, a violent pro-independence group.
