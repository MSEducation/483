Jack Erwin Spikes (born February 5, 1937 in Big Spring, Texas) is a former American collegiate and Professional Football running back and placekicker.  He played in the American Football League for the Dallas Texans, Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers, and the Buffalo Bills.  He played college football at Texas Christian University.
Spikes played a key role in Professional Football's longest championship game, the 1962 American Football League Championship game between the Texans and the Houston Oilers.  Spikes' teammate Bill Hull intercepted the Oilers' George Blanda late in the first overtime. Hull's interception allowed the Texans to start the second overtime with two powerful runs by Spikes, to move the ball to the Oilers' 25-yard line, and Tommy Brooker kicked a field goal to give the Texans the win, 20 - 17.
