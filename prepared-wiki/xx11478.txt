In the theory of classical electromagnetism, free space has the following properties:
[/ref]

[/ref] For example, the electric potential generated by two charges is the simple addition of the potentials generated by each charge in isolation. The value of the electric field at any point around these two charges is found by calculating the vector sum of the two electric fields from each of the charges acting alone.
[/ref] and magnetic constant μ0, respectively (in SI units), or exactly 1 (in Gaussian units).

The vacuum of classical electromagnetism can be viewed as an idealized electromagnetic medium with the constitutive relations in SI units:
relating the electric displacement field D to the electric field E and the magnetic field or H-field H to the magnetic induction or B-field B. Here r is a spatial location and t is time.

==Quantum mechanics==

In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the ground state of the Hilbert space). In quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as 'QED vacuum' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics, denoted as QCD vacuum. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no photons, no gravitons, etc. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the blackbody photons.) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.
QED vacuum has interesting and complex properties. In QED vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values, but their variances are not zero.[ref]
For example, see [tpl]cite book |title=Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics |author=D. P. Craig, T. Thirunamachandran |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rpbdozIZt3sC&pg=PA40 |page=40 |isbn=0-486-40214-2 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1998 |edition=Reprint of Academic Press 1984[/tpl]
[/ref] As a result, QED vacuum contains vacuum fluctuations (virtual particles that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called vacuum energy. Vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory. Some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include spontaneous emission and the Lamb shift.  Coulomb's law and the electric potential in vacuum near an electric charge are modified.[ref]
In effect, the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum of classical electromagnetism is changed. For example, see [tpl]cite book |chapter=§19.1.9 Vacuum polarization in quantum electrodynamics |author=Eberhard Zeidler |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=miwuxaEXvOsC&pg=PA952 |page=952 |isbn=3-642-22420-2 |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |title=Quantum Field Theory III: Gauge Theory: A Bridge Between Mathematicians and Physicists[/tpl]
[/ref]
Theoretically, in QCD vacuum multiple vacuum states can coexist. The starting and ending of cosmological inflation is thought to have arisen from transitions between different vacuum states. For theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory, each stationary point of the energy in the configuration space gives rise to a single vacuum. String theory is believed to have a huge number of vacua — the so-called string theory landscape.

==Outer space==

Outer space has very low density and pressure, and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is truly perfect, not even in interstellar space, where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.
Stars, planets and moons keep their atmospheres by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about [tpl]nowrap|3.2 × 10−2 Pa[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] of altitude,[tpl]Cite journal | first=Tom | last=Squire | date=September 27, 2000 | title=U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | publisher=NASA | work=Thermal Protection Systems Expert and Material Properties Database | url=http://tpsx.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-perl/alt.pl | accessdate=2011-10-23 | postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] the Kármán line, which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space. Beyond this line, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind, so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to space weather. Astrophysicists prefer to use number density to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.
But although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. Most artificial satellites operate in this region called low earth orbit and must fire their engines every few days to maintain orbit.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] The drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on solar sails, a proposed propulsion system for interplanetary travel. Planets are too massive for their trajectories to be significantly affected by these forces, although their atmospheres are eroded by the solar winds.
All of the observable universe is filled with large numbers of photons, the so-called cosmic background radiation, and quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos. The current temperature of this radiation is about 3 K, or -270 degrees Celsius or -454 degrees Fahrenheit.

==Historical interpretation==

Historically, there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist.  Ancient Greek philosophers debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of atomism, which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following Plato, even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. Aristotle believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.
In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although Lucretius argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and Hero of Alexandria tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD,[tpl]Cite book| last =Genz | first =Henning | publication-date =1999 | year =1994 | title =Nothingness, the Science of Empty Space | edition =translated from German by Karin Heusch | place =New York | publisher =Perseus Book Publishing | isbn =978-0-7382-0610-3 | oclc =48836264 [/tpl] it was European scholars such as Roger Bacon, Blasius of Parma and Walter Burley in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following Stoic physics in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.[tpl]cite book |first=J.D. |last=Barrow |year=2002 |title=The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas About the Origins of the Universe |series=Vintage Series |publisher=Vintage |isbn=9780375726095 |lccn=00058894 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sU_K0wbBeugC&pg=PA77 |pages=71–72, 77[/tpl]
Almost two thousand years after Plato, René Descartes also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism, without the problematic nothing–everything dichotomy of void and atom. Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position, that a vacuum does not occur in nature, the success of his namesake coordinate system and more implicitly, the spacial–corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume. By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct. With the acquiescence of Cartesian mechanical philosophy to the "brute fact" of action at a distance, and at length, its successful reification by force fields and ever more sophisticated geometric structure, the anachronism of empty space widened until "a seething ferment"[tpl]cite book |first=P. |last=Davies |year=1985 |title=Superforce |series=A Touchstone Book |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=9780671605735 |lccn=84005473 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Bna5p4vJtucC&pg=PA105 |page=105 |quote=What might appear to be empty space is, therefore, a seething ferment of virtual particles. A vacuum is not inert and featueless, but alive with throbbing energy and vitality. A 'real' particle such as an electron must always be viewed against this background of frenetic activity. When an electron moves through space, it is actually swimming in a sea of ghost particles of all varieties -- virtual leptons, quarks, and messengers, entangled in a complex mêlée. The presence of the electron will distort this irreducible vacuum activity, and the distortion in turn reacts back on the electron. Even at rest, an electron is not at rest: it is being continually assaulted by all manner of other particles from the vacuum.[/tpl] of quantum activity in the 20th century filled the vacuum with a virtual pleroma.
The explanation of a clepsydra or water clock was a popular topic in the Middle Ages. Although a simple wine skin sufficed to demonstrate a partial vacuum, in principle, more advanced suction pumps had been developed in Roman Pompeii.Institute and Museum of the History of Science.

In the medieval Middle Eastern world, the physicist and Islamic  scholar, Al-Farabi (Alpharabius, 872-950),  conducted a small experiment concerning the existence of vacuum, in which he investigated handheld plungers in water.[tpl]Cite book| publisher = AZP (ZMD Corporation) | isbn = 978-0-9702389-0-0 | last = Zahoor | first = Akram | title = Muslim History: 570-1950 C.E. | location = Gaithersburg, MD | year = 2000[/tpl][tpl]Self-published inline|date=December 2009[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=September 2010[/tpl] He concluded that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent.Arabic and Islamic Natural Philosophy and Natural Science, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy However, according to Nader El-Bizri, the physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965-1039) and the Mu'tazili theologians disagreed with Aristotle and Al-Farabi, and they supported the existence of a void.

Medieval thought experiments into the idea of a vacuum considered whether a vacuum was present, if only for an instant, between two flat plates when they were rapidly separated.[ref]
