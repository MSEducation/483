===Potential negotiations with Japan Airlines===

Air France–KLM, along with its partner Delta Air Lines, were in talks about investing with Japan Airlines, which is part of the Oneworld alliance (rival to SkyTeam) but is experiencing financial problems. Air France–KLM, along with Delta and Delta's rival American Airlines (AMR Corporation; part of Oneworld) discussed investments for a sum of $200–300 million to help the financially struggling carrier, which is Asia's largest airline by revenue. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan had recommended Air France–KLM and/or Delta for being partners because of their "healthy" financial status compared to AMR Corporation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSN1452655820090915 |title=Air France–KLM in talks to invest in JAL-source |agency=Reuters |accessdate=12 April 2012 |date=15 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUST19446720090915 |title=JAL alliance talks heat up with Air France–KLM entry |agency=Reuters |accessdate=12 April 2012 |date=15 September 2009[/tpl] Delta was also recommended because of its extensive Asian network acquired through the acquisition of Northwest Airlines; Korean Air, also a SkyTeam member, was also in talks with JAL on the negotiations. Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Korean Air, and Vietnam Airlines are SkyTeam members that currently have codesharing with JAL.
On 7 February 2010 several news outlets reported that JAL will decide to keep its alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. New JAL CEO Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances (from Oneworld to SkyTeam) would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around the airline quickly.
On 9 February 2010 JAL officially announced their decision to strengthen its partnership with American, which includes the joint application of antitrust immunity approval on transpacific routes. The airline will also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aa.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=2844 |title=Comments By American Airlines CEO Gerard Arpey on Japan Airlines Decision to Continue Membership in oneworld Alliance – 9 Feb 2010 |publisher=Aa.mediaroom.com |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]
