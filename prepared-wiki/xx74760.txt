[tpl]nihongo|Mitoyo Kawate|川手 ミトヨ|Kawate Mitoyo|May 15, 1889 – November 13, 2003[/tpl] was a Japanese supercentenarian and, at the age of 114 years 182 days, briefly the oldest recognized living person after the death of Japanese man Yukichi Chuganji.
Another Hiroshima woman, Asa Takii (1884–1998), had also lived to age 114, and in doing so she had become the oldest in Japan, but Kawate is the oldest person in the city's history and the only one from there to become the oldest recognized living person. She was known for her fondness for custard.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
She was taken to a hospital shortly before her death from pneumonia. Her 'oldest person' reign lasted only 46 days. Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan became the oldest living person.
Her death left Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan of Puerto Rico the oldest documented person in the world, though this was not recognized by Guinness World Records until 2004 (Charlotte Benkner of the U.S. had been given the title in the interim).
