==History==

Joe Scherman (Born 1902) was California's first state ranger and was intimately involved in GSCOC's purchase of the property that Camp Scherman now resides upon.  All [tpl]convert|700|acre|km2[/tpl] were originally owned by James Wellman a somewhat legendary big game hunter and good friend of Joe Scherman.  Scherman helped GSCOC negotiate with Wellman over the property and in 1959 the first [tpl]convert|560|acre|km2[/tpl] were purchased from Wellam for $96,500.  Eighteen years later, in 1977, the final [tpl]convert|140|acre|km2[/tpl] were purchased from the Wellman family to complete the property line that exists today.
