==History==

The school was originally designed to be a full circle with a courtyard in the middle, but because of lack of funding, poor spending, and lack of support the school was completed as a half circle. Within the courtyard of the school stands a [tpl]convert|15|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] statue of The Holy Trinity - images of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
In recent years, the Holy Trinity Trojans have developed outstanding athletic programs which have seen much success with the three students that have partaken in our athletic programs.Athletics
In March 2009, Trinity gave the very first renovation of the school, to only the Art Room, the Wood Shop Lab, and the Foods Lab. The foods lab received new advanced and innovative appliances and equipment. The Art Room, and Wood Shop Lab received new lighting fixtures.

In addition to all of the changes in Trinity, the school also replaced its flooring, repainted it's lockers, and renamed the library to "The Trinity Commons".
