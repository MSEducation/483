CATEGORIES: Mitella

Mitella pentandra is a species of flowering plant in the saxifrage family known by the common name fivestamen miterwort. It is native to much of western North America from Alaska to California to Colorado, where it grows in moist, shady habitat such as meadows, woods, and mountain forests. It is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing up to about 50 or 60 centimeters tall. Most all of the leaves occur around the base of the stem. They have oval blades several centimeters wide with edges divided into toothed lobes. The erect inflorescence bears several flowers, sometimes up to 25, usually along one side of the stem. The distinctive flower is saucer-shaped with five green petals which are divided into narrow, whiskerlike lobes.
