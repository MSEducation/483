===Utah Transit Authority (UTA)===

Salt Lake Central is the name of UTA portion of the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub and that is the station name used on all route maps and schedules (bus, the FrontRunner, and TRAX). The intermodal hub is in the Free Fare Zone of Downtown Salt Lake City which allows transportation patrons that both enter and exit bus or TRAX service within the Zone to ride fare free. The intermodal hub is also located within the Quiet Zone, so all trains (including Amtrak's) do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/no-more-horns-quiet-zone-now-in-effect-for-trains/article_b084ed5d-7b22-51d7-ace8-a229acc9aec2.html|last=Hesterman|first=Billy|title=No more horns: Quiet zone now in effect for trains|newspaper=Daily Herald|location=Provo, Utah|publisher=Lee Enterprises|date=29 Nov 2012|accessdate=4 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=Projects-FrontLines2015-FrontRunnerSouth-FAQs|title=Front Runner South FAQs|accessdate=4 May 2013|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority[/tpl] Unlike most FrontRunner and TRAX stations, there is only a small Park and Ride lot in close proximity to Salt Lake Central.[tpl]refn|group="Note"|Recently UTA announced that beginning 1 July 2013 it will start a one year pilot program involving most of its TRAX and FrontRunner Park and Ride lots. The purpose of the new program is to make rider connections with the Salt Lake City International Airport more convenient by avoiding the need to park at the airport. The programs allows UTA patrons to park for an "unlimited amount of time" in the designated Park and Ride lots. In addition, UTA will allow free parking in all of its parking garages. Previous UTA policy limited parking to no more than 24 hours, except at its parking garages. As part of the year long pilot program, "UTA will measure parking lot usage and monitor costs, maintenance requirements, impacts to snow removal and security issues before determining if the program will be extended." There are eight Park and Ride lots that are excluded from this test program and the 24 hour time limit will still apply to these lots. Salt Lake Central Station's lot is specifically not included in this test program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/news/2013/06/uta-offers-free-multi-day-parking/|title=UTA Offers Free Multi-Day Parking|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority|date=26 Jun 2013|accessdate=10 Jan 2014[/tpl] Notwithstanding permission to park for extended periods in the applicable Park and Ride Lots, updated signage at the stations advises that the UTA Transit Police request that they be notified anytime a car is parked in one of the lots for more than seven days.[/tpl] UTA indicates there there is "limited parking" available.
All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-Accessibility-FixedRouteAccessibility|title=Fixed Route Accessibility|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority|accessdate=13 Mar 2013[/tpl]  Since not all FrontRunner passenger cars are wheelchair accessible, signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the passenger cars clearly indicate accessibility options. In addition, each train has one or more Train Hosts available to provide assistance as may be needed, including the placement of ramps for wheelchair boarding on FrontRunner trains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-Accessibility-RidersWithDisabilities|title=Riders with Disabilities|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority|accessdate=17 Mar 2013[/tpl] Ramps on the passenger platform and assistance from the TRAX train operator may be necessary for wheelchair boarding on TRAX Blue Line (weekdays only). In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, "smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-RiderRules|title=Rider Rules|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority|accessdate=12 Mar 2013[/tpl]

====Local bus====

There are also multiple UTA Bus service routes that include Salt Lake Central as one of their stops. Local bus service is provided to all areas of Salt Lake City, as well as a few other cities within Salt Lake County. Additional service to Park City is provided through PC-SLC Connect. (See UTA bus connections below for more details.)

====The FrontRunner====

On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips on weekdays between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Odgen and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (increasing to half hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am the next morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday there is service to Pleasant View with two trains picking up passengers (no dropping off) in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening for the commute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rideuta.com/uploads/route750dec2013schx.pdf|title=FrontRunner|website=rideuta.com|publisher=Utah Transit Authority|format=PDF|date=8 Dec 2013|accessdate=13 Dec 2013[/tpl]

====TRAX====

Service by TRAX and the FrontRunner commenced on 27 April 2008, with the opening ceremony on 26 April at 12:30 pm. Salt Lake Central is the northern terminus of the TRAX Blue Line and the former northern terminus of the Green Line. There is not direct connection with the Red Line, nor the Green Line after 8 December 2012 following its reroute to the Salt Lake City International Airport). The Blue Line provides service to Draper in southern Salt Lake County as well as connections with the Green and Red lines (with the Red Line providing service between University of Utah and the Daybreak Community in South Jordan in southwest Salt Lake County and the Green Line providing service from West Valley City to the Salt Lake City International Airport (via Downtown Salt Lake City).

Greenbike offers 7-day and annual memberships, but 24 hour passes are also available for non-members.  Greenbike members are allowed unlimited short trips, with a trip being defined as the time between when the bicycle is removed from a docking station and when it is returned to a docking station.

The bicycles provided by Greenbike are equipped with GPS traking system that records and provides the member with the miles ridden (and calories burned). Greenbike is seasonal and, depending on weather conditions, shuts down operations in November–December and starts up again in March–April.  Other Greenbike docking stations are located near the City Center TRAX, Gallivan Plaza, and Library stations.

==History==

Before moving to the intermodal hub in 1999, Amtrak trains provided service at the Union Pacific Depot at 400 West and South Temple, and in 1986 moved to the Rio Grande Depot at 300 South Rio Grande Street.
Original plans did not have TRAX serving the intermodal hub, only Amtrak, Greyhound, the FrontRunner, and UTA buses.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600146091/Intermodal-hub-is-ready-for-prime-time.html?pg=all|title=Intermodal hub is ready for prime time:  But it still must wait for commuter and light rail|last=Snyder|first=Brady|date=4 Jul 2005|newspaper=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret Digital Media|location=Salt Lake City|accessdate=1 Apr 2013[/tpl]  However by 2004, UTA decided to extend TRAX to the intermodal hub.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/585036914/TRAX-extension-to-new-hub-is-unveiled.html?pg=all|title=TRAX extension to new hub is unveiled|last=Arave|first=Lynn|date=11 Jan 2004|newspaper=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret Digital Media|location=Salt Lake City|accessdate=1 Apr 2013[/tpl] By 2005, a three-station extension from Arena to the intermodal hub was decided on, and construction began in 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635153922/SL-Council-OKs-proposal-for-2-light-rail-stations.html?pg=all|title=S.L.

==Future Plans==

Future expansion of the FrontRunner is anticipated to eventually include service north to Brigham City and south to Payson) and possibly Santaquin or maybe even Nephi.
There are ongoing studies regarding the feasibility of resuming Amtrak's Desert Wind and Pioneer routes, but so far there does not appear there would be sufficient riders to support the return of either route in the near future.[tpl]cite web|title=Pioneer Route Passenger Rail Study|date=16 Oct 2009|accessdate=1 May 2011|website=amtrak.com|publisher=Amtrak|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1249200496429&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-disposition&blobheadervalue1=attachment;filename=Amtrak_PioneerServiceStudy.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Moreover, most of the current focus regarding the Desert Wind route is between Los Angeles, California and the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada. In addition, of the four possible routes considered for the Pioneer, two of them run from Denver, Colorado through southern Wyoming to Odgen, then north to Pocatello, Idaho and thereby entirely bypassing Salt Lake City.
