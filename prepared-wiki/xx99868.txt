[[Private good]]

CATEGORIES: Goods

A private good is defined in economics as "an item that yields positive benefits to people"[tpl]cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|title=Intermediate Microeconomics And Its Application|year=2004|publisher=South-Western, a division of Thomson Learning|location=United States of America|isbn=0-324-27419-X|pages=59[/tpl] that is excludable, i.e. its owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits; and rivalrous, i.e. consumption by one necessarily prevents that of another. A private good, as an economic resource is scarce, which can cause competition for it.Hallgren,M.M.,McAdams A.K.,1995.

The Journal of Electronic Publishing. doi http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0001.125The market demand curve for a private good is a horizontal summation of individual demand curves.[tpl]cite web|title=Public Goods: Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=public+goods:+demand|work=AmosWEB Encyclonomic WEB*pedia|publisher=AmosWEB LLC|accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl]
Unlike public goods, private goods are less likely to have the free rider problem. Assuming a private good is valued positively by everyone, the efficiency of obtaining the good is obstructed by its rivalry, that is simultaneous consumption of a rivalrous good is theoretically impossible; the feasibility of obtaining the good is made difficult by its excludability, that is people have to pay for it to enjoy its benefits.Malkin,J. & ,Wildavasky,A.,1991.

One of the most common ways of looking at goods in the economy, illustrated in the table below, is by examining the level of competition in obtaining a given good, and the possibility of excluding its consumption; one cannot, for example, prevent another from enjoying a beautiful view, or clean air.Rivalry and Excludability in Goods.

==Pricing==

Private goods, like most categories of good, obey the law of demand: the price increases when the demand is high but the supply is low.'Public finance and public policy''. New York: Worth Publishers. ISBN: 978-0716786559[/ref]

==Example of a private good==

An example of the private good is bread: bread eaten by a given person cannot be consumed by another (rivalry), and it is easy for a baker to refuse to trade a loaf (exclusive).
To illustrate the horizontal summation characteristic, assume there are only two people in this economy and that:
As a result, a new market demand curve can be derived with the following results:
Private good can also defined as an exclusive production of goods.
