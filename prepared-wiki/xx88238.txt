The A6 provides a link from the northern and western suburbs to the inner western suburbs, Bankstown and the Princes Highway  Some stretches such as Silverwater Road, Alfords Point Road, New Illawarra Road and Heathcote Road have very few junctions or are in (currently) rural areas, and the speed limit is therefore relaxed slightly.
The A6 includes a few bridges. One of them is the Silverwater Bridge over the Parramatta River, another is the Alfords Point Bridge  over the Georges River.
The name "A6" is just the route allocation for the route as a whole. Actually, the A6 route runs along a whole series of roads which also have other names. From north to south they are:[tpl]Cite web | url = https://six.nsw.gov.au/ | publisher = New South Wales Land and Property Information | title = Spatial Information Exchange [/tpl]

==History==

The earliest route allocation of A6 was State Route 45. It was introduced in 1974, with the route going from Victoria Road in [tpl]NSWcity|Ermington[/tpl] to Princes Highway in [tpl]NSWcity|Heathcote[/tpl].State Route 45, Ozroads, Retrieved on 2 August 2013.[tpl]Self-published source|date=November 2013[/tpl] State Route 45 has undergone several realignments since then. The Lidcombe bypass opened in 1982 and State Route 45 was re routed onto the bypass. In 1996, the Silverwater Road extension opened and State Route 45 was extended to Cumberland Highway.
State Route 45 was replaced by Metroad 6 in January 1999 in conjunction with the opening of the Stacey Street Extension. The northern terminus of Metroad 6 was the Marsden Rd/Pennant Hills Road intersection in Carlingford. When the then Metroad 7 was reassigned from Cumberland Highway to the Westlink M7 motorway when it was opened in December 2005, Metroad 6 was extended northwards to the M2 Hills Motorway.
In 2013, as part of the alphanumeric route scheme, Metroad 6 was decommissioned. The Pennant Hills Road Section of Metroad 6 was replaced by A28 in May–June 2013 while the rest of the Metroad 6 was replaced by A6 in August–October 2013.
