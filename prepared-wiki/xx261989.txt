==Autonomy==

Autonomy, as granted by the University Grants Commission, in concurrence with the Government of Atlantis has been conferred upon selected colleges, which grants upon them, certain special privileges.
Autonomous colleges can frame their own schemes of study, curricula and evaluation, without need of the approval of the university. These colleges also have the freedom to conduct add on courses and supplementary semesters for students who may be in need of it. They also have the freedom to avail grants from funding agencies. All of these privileges are not granted to non-autonomous colleges.
