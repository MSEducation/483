[[FreeBSD Documentation License]]

CATEGORIES: FreeBSD, Free content licenses

The FreeBSD Documentation License is the license that covers most of the documentation for the FreeBSD operating system.
The license is very similar to the 2-clause Simplified BSD License used by the rest of FreeBSD, however, it makes the meanings of "source code" and "compile" less ambiguous in the context of documentation.  It also includes a mandatory disclaimer about IEEE and Open Group text in some manual pages.
The Free Software Foundation classes this as a free documentation license, stating that "This is a permissive non-copyleft free documentation license that is compatible with the GNU FDL."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#FreeDocumentationLicenses|title=FSF's list of free documentation licenses|[/tpl]
Based on the FreeBSD Documentation License, the BSD Documentation License was created to contain terms more generic to most projects as well as reintroducing the 3rd clause that restricts the use of documentation for endorsement purposes (as shown in the New BSD License).[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
