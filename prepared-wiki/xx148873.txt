==Filming locations==

==Halting==

Letters from a Killer was originally supposed to be finished earlier than its release but filming was halted for two months due to Patrick Swayze suffering serious injuries in the lone area while he fell off his horse and hit a tree. He ended up with both legs broken and four tendons in his shoulder immediately became detached. Although it was released later, Swayze was reported to have trouble resuming his career until later.
