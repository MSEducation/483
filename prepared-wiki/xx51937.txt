[[List of ship names of the Royal Navy]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Royal Navy ships, Lists of ships of the United Kingdom, Military units and formations of the United Kingdom, Ship names

This is an alphabetical list of all the names of ships that have ever been in service with the Royal Navy, as well as a list of fictional vessels in literature about the Royal Navy.  Many of the names have been re-used over the years and thus represent more than one ship.
Altogether over 13,000 ships have been in service with the Royal Navy.Colledge and Warlow (2006) Page viii.
Note that, unlike many other naval services, the Royal Navy designates certain types of shore establishment (e.g. barracks, naval air stations and training establishments) as "ships" and names them accordingly. These establishments are often referred to in service slang as stone frigates.
