==Characteristics==

Cornell University economist Robert H. Frank, author of Luxury Fever, has remarked, "When people were denouncing yuppies, they had considerably lower incomes than yuppies, so the things yuppies spent their money on seemed frivolous and unnecessary from their vantage point." Pro-skateboarder and businessman Tony Hawk has said that yuppies give "us visions of bright V-neck sweaters with collars underneath, and all that was vile in the eighties", and he has also remarked that a "bitchin’ tattoo cannot hide your inner desire to be Donald Trump."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/200611/tony-hawk-takes-on-yuppies#ixzz0whupwMIo|publisher=Details|title=Tony Hawk Takes On Yuppies|first=Gillian|last=Telling|accessdate=August 15, 2010[/tpl]
Author and political commentator Victor Davis Hanson has written:
[tpl]quote|Yuppism... is not definable entirely by income or class. Rather, it is a late-20th-century cultural phenomenon of self-absorbed young professionals, earning good pay, enjoying the cultural attractions of sophisticated urban life and thought, and generally out of touch with, indeed antithetical to, most of the challenges and concerns of a far less well-off and more parochial Middle America. For the yuppie male a well-paying job in law, finance, academia, or consulting in a cultural hub, hip fashion, cool appearance, studied poise, elite education, proper recreation and fitness, and general proximity to liberal-thinking elites, especially of the more rarefied sort in the arts, are the mark of a real man.[tpl]Cite news|author=Victor Davis Hanson|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/243667/obama-fighting-yuppie-factor-victor-davis-hanson|title=Obama: Fighting the Yuppie Factor|accessdate=August 16, 2010|publisher=National Review|date=August 13, 2010[/tpl][/tpl]

==History==

Although the term yuppies had not appeared until the early 1980s, there was discussion about young urban professionals as early as 1968.
 Critics believe that the demand for "instant executives" has led some young climbers to confuse change with growth. One New York consultant comments, "Many executives in their 20s and 30s have been so busy job-hopping that they've never developed their skills. They're apt to suffer a sudden loss of career impetus and go into a power stall."[tpl]Cite journal| issn = 0025-1895| volume = 57| issue = 3| page = 25| last = Kessler| first = Felix| title = Executive Promotion Path: Fast Track for Young Managers| journal = Management Review[/tpl] 
Joseph Epstein was credited for coining the term in 1982,[tpl]Cite book| title = Movers And Shakers: A Chronology of Words That Shaped Our Age | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | last = Ayto | first = John | isbn = 0-19-861452-7 | page = 128[/tpl] although this is contested and it is claimed that the first printed appearance of the word was in a May 1980 Chicago magazine article by Dan Rottenberg.[tpl]Cite news|title= About that urban renaissance.... there'll be a slight delay |author=Dan Rottenberg|publisher=Chicago Magazine|date=May 1980|page = 154ff[/tpl] The term gained currency in the United States in 1983 when syndicated newspaper columnist Bob Greene published a story about a business networking group founded in 1982 by the former radical leader Jerry Rubin, formerly of the Youth International Party (whose members were called yippies); Greene said he had heard people at the networking group (which met at Studio 54 to soft classical music) joke that Rubin had "gone from being a yippie to being a yuppie". The headline of Greene's story was From Yippie to Yuppie.[tpl]Cite book| title = Global Finance and Urban Living: A Study of Metropolitan Change| first = Leslie| last = Budd| coauthors = Whimster, Sam| year = 1992| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-07097-X| page = 316[/tpl]Hadden-Guest, Anthony The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night New York:1997--William Morrow Page 116 East Bay Express humorist Alice Kahn claimed to have coined the word in a 1983 column. This claim is disputed.[tpl]cite news|author=Clarence Petersen. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-28/features/8601230082_1_diaper-chronicle-ferdinand |title=The Wacky Side Of Chicago-born, Berkeley-bred Alice Kahn - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1986-03-28 |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Jorge |first=Trendy |url=http://yuppie-living.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_archive.html |title=Yuppie Living: June 2006 |publisher=Yuppie-living.blogspot.com |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl] The proliferation of the word was affected by the publication of The Yuppie Handbook in January 1983 (a tongue-in-cheek take on The Official Preppy HandbookLiving: Here Come the Yuppies!, Time, January 9, 1984), followed by Senator Gary Hart's 1984 candidacy as a "yuppie candidate" for President of the United States. The term was then used to describe a political demographic group of socially liberal but fiscally conservative voters favoring his candidacy.[tpl]Cite book| title = Campaign for President: The Managers Look at '84| first = Jonathan| last = Moore| publisher = Praeger/Greenwood| year = 1986| isbn = 0-86569-132-0| page = 123[/tpl] Newsweek magazine declared 1984 "The Year of the Yuppie", characterizing the salary range, occupations, and politics of yuppies as "demographically hazy".  The alternative acronym yumpie, for young upwardly mobile professional, was also current in the 1980s but failed to catch on.Here Comes the Yumpies, Time, March 26, 1984
In a 1985 issue of The Wall Street Journal, Theressa Kersten at SRI International described a "yuppie backlash" by people who fit the demographic profile yet express resentment of the label: "You're talking about a class of people who put off having families so they can make payments on the SAABs ... To be a Yuppie is to be a loathsome undesirable creature". Leo Shapiro, a market researcher in Chicago, responded, "Stereotyping always winds up being derogatory. It doesn't matter whether you are trying to advertise to farmers, Hispanics or Yuppies, no one likes to be neatly lumped into some group".
Later, the word lost most of its political connotations and, particularly after the 1987 stock market crash, gained the negative socio-economic connotations that it sports today. On April 8, 1991, Time magazine proclaimed the death of the yuppie in a mock obituary.[tpl]Cite news| title = The Birth and -- Maybe -- Death of Yuppiedom | first = Walter | last = Shapiro | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972695-1,00.html | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | work=Time | date=1991-04-08[/tpl]
In the 1990s, most yuppies made a transition to the middle class but they maintain an upper-middle level lifestyle, as they age well to their 30's and 40's the "yuppie" generation often got married and settled down to have children. The economic boom at the time have transformed some yuppies or higher-income couples into Bobos or the "bohemian bourgeois". [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
The term has experienced a resurgence in usage during the 2000s and 2010s. In October 2000, David Brooks remarked in a Weekly Standard article that Benjamin Franklin- due to his extreme wealth, cosmopolitanism, and adventurous social life- is "Our Founding Yuppie".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/011/743hxgre.asp|author=David Brooks|title=Our Founding Yuppie|date=October 23, 2000|accessdate=August 21, 2010|publisher=The Weekly Standard|authorlink=David Brooks (journalist)[/tpl] A recent article in Details proclaimed "The Return of the Yuppie", stating that "the yuppie of 1986 and the yuppie of 2006 are so similar as to be indistinguishable" and "he’s a shape-shifter... he finds ways to reenter the American psyche."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/200611/the-return-of-the-yuppie?currentPage=1|publisher=Details|title=The Return of the Yuppie|first=Jeff|last=Gordinier|accessdate=August 15, 2010[/tpl] Victor Davis Hanson also recently wrote in National Review very critically of yuppies.

==Usage outside of the United States==

A September 2010 article in The Standard described the items on a typical Hong Kong resident's "yuppie wish list" based on a survey of 28 to 35 year olds. About 58% wanted to own their own home, 40% wanted to professionally invest, and 28% wanted to become a boss.[tpl]Cite news|publisher=The Standard|date=September 8, 2010|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=102699&sid=29504212&con_type=1|title=Homes, cash top fairy tales on yuppie wish list|first=Natalie|last=Wong[/tpl] A September 2010 article in the New York Times defined as a hallmark of Russian yuppie life adoption of yoga and other elements of Indian culture such as their clothes, food, and furniture.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/world/europe/15iht-moscow.html|title=Russians Embrace Yoga, if They Have the Money|date=September 14, 2010|title=New York Times|work=The New York Times|first=Sophia|last=Kishkovsky[/tpl]
In Mexico, the term "yupi" is a neologism for high class young people usually from the largest cities and  known for having a modern white-collar economy. Yuppification has occurred in economic booming nations of China, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and South Africa in the late 1990s and 2000s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
