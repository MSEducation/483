[[Capra (goat dance)]]

CATEGORIES: Romanian culture

Capra is the name of a traditional Romanian dance, practiced around New Years. It's executed by a young man with a goat mask and a sheep skin on his back. The 'goat' and his companions go from house to house, dancing at each door in New Year's Eve. This custom is first mentioned in Descriptio Moldaviae by Dimitrie Cantemir.
