==Early years==

Schuller was born near Alton, Iowa, on September 16, 1926 to Jennie (née Beltman) and Anthony Schuller.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/603/000022537/ |title=Robert Schuller |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] The youngest of 4 children, he is of Dutch descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toetsalles.nl/htmldoc/schuller1.htm |title=Robert Schuller A Profil |publisher=Toetsalles.nl |date=September 14, 1980 |accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] He studied at Hope College and received a Master of Divinity degree from Western Theological Seminary in 1950. He was ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. He worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. There he opened the Garden Grove Community Church in 1955 in a drive-in movie theater. He also built a new 300-seat chapel about four miles (6 km) from the drive-in theater. Schuller conducted a service in the chapel at 9:30 Sunday mornings and then drove his organ to the drive-in to conduct a second service there.Penner, James. Goliath: The Life of Robert Schuller (1992), p. 119.
As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2[/tpl] at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a "walk-in, drive-in" church serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958, for construction of the new church designed by international architect Richard Neutra.  The church was completed in 1961 at a cost of $3,000,000.Penner, p. 155.[tpl]cite web|title=Drive in church[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Garden Grove Community Church|publisher=ArchInform.net|date=May 21, 2009|url=http://eng.archinform.net/projekte/6331.htm |accessdate=October 6, 2009[/tpl] The dedication service was held November 5, 1961.Schuller, Robert H. "My Journey"
The design of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars as well as to members of the congregation inside the church.[tpl]cite news|title=Churches: Drive-In Devotion|work=Time|date=November 3, 1967|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837478,00.html|accessdate=October 6, 2009[/tpl]
A "Tower of Hope" building was added on the north side of the drive-in church building in 1968; it rose [tpl]convert|90|ft|m[/tpl] in the air, the highest structure in Orange County at that time, and was topped by a cross. That same year, Schuller purchased the [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] walnut grove that bordered the north side of the Garden Grove Community Church for the construction of the much larger "Crystal Cathedral" designed by architect Philip Johnson. The church, which has glass walls and ceiling, was dedicated on September 14, 1980.

==Ministry==

Schuller focuses on what he believes are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoids condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus "met needs before touting creeds". Once in relationship with God, Schuller emphasizes, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He is known to say, "Sin is a condition before it is an action." Schuller encourages Christians (and non-Christians) to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, "If you can dream it, you can do it!"[tpl]cite news |title=Diocese to retain Crystal Cathedral exterior |url= http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=43734 |newspaper=Catholic Online |date=November 20, 2011 |accessdate=November 3, 2012[/tpl]
As the Crystal Cathedral’s founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world’s most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1500 of which were recorded. In March 2012, under new leadership, the ministry began broadcasting a shortened 30-minute version of the Hour of Power. Discovery Channel and Lifetime are airing the shortened show, but the 60-minute version is continuing on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

==Personal life==

On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan, a church organist, who was instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and produced the Hour of Power for over 40 years.  The Schullers had one son, Robert, and four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen.Robert Schuller at NNDB
Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, and eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, have both been senior pastors of Crystal Cathedral. His grandson Robert V. Schuller succeeded as the lead pastor of the Hour of Power in 2013.
Schuller's second daughter, Jeanne Dunn, and her husband, Paul Dunn, oversaw The Glory of Christmas and The Glory of Easter productions. Jeanne Dunn has assisted in various editorial contributions to various printed works and for Schuller's books. Her husband co-authored The Possibility Thinker's Bible and Living Debt Free with Schuller.
The third daughter, Carol Schuller Milner, was the writer, director, and producer of Creation: Once Upon All Time that debuted in 2005 to an audience of over 70,000. She co-wrote Schuller's autobiography, My Journey, and has written several other works.
The youngest daughter, Gretchen Schuller Penner, was director of programming for the ministry. Her husband, James Penner, was the producer of the Hour of Power telecast.  Both were fired in a restructuring of Crystal Cathedral Ministries in March 2012.[tpl]cite web |title=3 Schuller family members fired from Crystal Cathedral |url= http://www.ocregister.com/articles/schuller-343365-coleman-cathedral.html |first=Roxana |last=Kopetman |date=March 7, 2012 |work=The Orange County Register |accessdate=November 3, 2012[/tpl]

==Retirement and succession==

On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral.  On October 25, 2008, however, Schuller removed his son from that position citing "a lack of shared vision".[tpl]cite news|title='Hour of Power' Preacher Removed by Father|publisher=FOXNews.com|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,444085,00.html|date=October 26, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl] Schuller stated that "different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry" with his son "made it necessary ... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry".[tpl]cite news|author=Robert H.

"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller", he said.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/27/local/me-schuller27 |title=Hour of Power in media |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |first1=Mike |last1=Anton |first2=Sam |last2=Quinones[/tpl]
On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors.[tpl]cite news|title=Crystal Cathedral founder stepping down|work=Orange County Register|date=July 11, 2010|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/church-257228-schuller-cathedral.html|accessdate=July 11, 2010[/tpl]  After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010.

Schuller, the new pastor for the Hour of Power[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hourofpower.org//|title= Hour of Power |date= |publisher=Crystal Cathedral|accessdate=[/tpl] television program as well as a non-voting member of the board.
Bobby Schuller, who was filling in as a guest pastor, remained an unpaid pastor until the ministry moved to a new campus, the St. Callistus Catholic Church, which occurred in June 2013. Bobby Schuller is also a teaching pastor at the Tree of Life Community Church in Orange.
In late August 2013, Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment that could extend his life.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ff-schuller-cancer-20130906,0,1342887.story |title=Doctors say Robert Schuller has cancer, could live another two years - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl]
