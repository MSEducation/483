The Joshua Project (formerly part of AD2000), is an organization seeking to highlight the ethnic people groups of the world with the least followers of evangelical Christianity. Joshua Project maintains  ethnologic data to support Christian missions and is based in Colorado Springs, USA. Joshua Project began in 1995 from within the former AD2000 and Beyond Movement. From 2001 through 2005 Joshua Project was at different times informally connected with Caleb Project, ICTA and World Help. In 2006 Joshua Project officially became part of the U.S. Center for World Mission.
Focusing on ethnicity, they maintain a database of "unreached peoples" listed by country and language. As of 2010, they list 9,803 ethnic groups. These are further divided into 16,350 peoples-by-countries, counting national minorities individually for each of 236 countries, of which 6,642 are classified as "unreached peoples". Ethnic groups are organized hierarchically in 251 "People Clusters" which in turn are divided in 16 "Affinity Blocs" (Arab World, East Asians, Eurasians, Horn of Africa-Cushitic, Iranian-Median, Jews, Latin-Caribbean Americans, Malay peoples, North American peoples, Pacific Islanders, South Asians, Southeast Asians, Sub-Saharan Africans, Tibetan / Himalayan peoples, Turkic peoples and Unclassified). Each ethnicity is listed as speaking at least one of 6,510 languages.[tpl]cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/great-commission-statistics.php |title=Great Commission Statistics |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2010-03-11[/tpl]
