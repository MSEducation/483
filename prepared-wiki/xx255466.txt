==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, noted that "there's been a lot of discussion ... about how much Liz has or hasn't grown since the series began, and also about whether 30 Rock is a show that needs character development — or if, in fact, that growth would be counter-productive on such a silly, cartoonish show." He opined that "if a comedy is as funny as 30 Rock is capable of being — and as it's been so frequently in this late-in-life season — I'm fine with the characters being virtually identical now to the way they were in the pilot."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/30-rock-the-shower-principle-30-rock-already-did-it|title=Review: '30 Rock' - 'The Shower Principle': 30 Rock already did it!|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|work=HitFix|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2012[/tpl] Indrapramit Das, writing for Slant Magazine, awarded the season three stars out of four and commented that "there's something to be said for 30 Rock's unrepentant adherence to formula. By now, the characters' repeated bumbling through the cyclical purgatory at 30 Rockefeller Plaza has attained a certain rhythm, a comforting familiarity akin to long-running sitcoms like Friends." He concluded that "the cast's unfailing enthusiasm points to an ensemble that's only strengthening with age", but commented that the talents of guest star Kristen Schaal had been "wasted".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/30-rock-season-six/321|title=30 Rock: Season Six|last=Das|first=Indrapramit|work=Slant Magazine|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2012[/tpl]
Dan Forcella, reviewing for TV Fanatic, opined that "television shows, especially sitcoms, normally lose some of their luster as time goes on. Whether it be that the series actually gets worse, or simply our perception of it does because the novelty has worn off, more often than not, things are not going to be the same by season six. Because of that fact, 30 Rock should be commended for how good its sixth season has been. There have been misses ... and big hits ... but all in all, this spring has been a solid run for the veteran sitcom."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2012/05/30-rock-review-i-now-pronounce-you-divorced/|title=30 Rock Review: I Now Pronounce You Divorced|last=Forcella|first=Dan|work=TV Fanatic|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=June 4, 2012[/tpl] Writing for Splitsider, Jesse David Fox called the series "the best comedy of the 2011–2012 season" and went on to remark "next season is the show's last but it's not because of an overstayed welcome. The show is as sharp as ever, as gutsy as ever, as strange as ever, as funny as ever. Guys, it's the best."[tpl]cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/05/why-30-rock-was-the-best-show-of-2011-2012-season/|title=Why '30 Rock' Was the Best Comedy of 2011-2012 Season|last=Fox|first=David Jesse|work=Splitsider|date=May 25, 2012|accessdate=June 17, 2012[/tpl]
