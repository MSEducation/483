==Life==

Fibonacci was born around 1170 to Guglielmo Bonacci, a wealthy Italian merchant and, by some accounts, the consul for Pisa.[tpl]according to whom|date=April 2014[/tpl] Guglielmo directed a trading post in Bugia, a port in the Almohad dynasty's sultanate in North Africa. Fibonacci traveled with him as a young boy, and it was in Bugia (now Béjaïa, Algeria) that he learned about the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.[tpl]cite web|author=Dr R Knott: fibandphi (AT) ronknott DOT com |url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibBio.html |title=Who was Fibonacci? |publisher=Maths.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02[/tpl]
Alternatively, according to a history text by mathematician Tobias Dantzig, his father was "a lowly shipping clerk nicknamed Bonaccio, which, in the idiom of the period, meant 'simpleton' ... hence 'Fibonacci,' the 'son of a simpleton.'"[tpl]citation|title=Mathematics in Ancient Greece|first=Tobias|last=Dantzig|publisher=Dover Publications,Inc.|year=1983|isbn=0-486-45347-2|page=113[/tpl].
Recognizing that arithmetic with Hindu–Arabic numerals is simpler and more efficient than with Roman numerals, Fibonacci travelled throughout the Mediterranean world to study under the leading Arab mathematicians of the time. He returned from his travels around 1200, and in 1202, the 32-year-old recorded what he had learned in Liber Abaci (Book of Abacus or Book of Calculation), and thereby popularized Hindu–Arabic numerals in Europe.
Fibonacci became a guest of Emperor Frederick II, who enjoyed mathematics and science. In 1240 the Republic of Pisa honored Fibonacci (referred to as Leonardo Bigollo)See the incipit of Flos: "Incipit flos Leonardi bigolli pisani..." (quoted in the MS Word document Sources in Recreational Mathematics: An Annotated Bibliography by David Singmaster, 18 March 2004 – emphasis added), in English: "Here starts 'the flower' by Leonardo the wanderer of Pisa..." The basic meanings of "bigollo" appear to be "good-for-nothing" and "traveller" (so it could be translated by "vagrant", "vagabond" or "tramp"). A. F. Horadam contends a connotation of "bigollo" is "absent-minded" (see first footnote of "Eight hundred years young"), which is also one of the connotations of the English word "wandering". The translation "the wanderer" in the quote above tries to combine the various connotations of the word "bigollo" in a single English word. by granting him a salary.
The date of Fibonacci's death is not known, but it has been estimated to be between 1240[tpl]citation|title=Fibonacci and Lucas Numbers with Applications|first=Thomas|last=Koshy|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118031315|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1iDKKceqD2sC&pg=PA3|page=3[/tpl]. and 1250,[tpl]citation|title=Encyclopédia of Mathematics|first=James Stuart|last=Tanton|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9780816051243|page=192|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MfKKMSuthacC&pg=PA192[/tpl]. most likely in Pisa.

==Liber Abaci==

In the Liber Abaci (1202), Fibonacci introduced the so-called modus Indorum (method of the Indians), today known as Arabic numerals (Sigler 2003; Grimm 1973). The book advocated numeration with the digits 0–9 and place value. The book showed the practical importance of the new numeral system by applying it to commercial bookkeeping, conversion of weights and measures, the calculation of interest, money-changing, and other applications.  The book was well received throughout educated Europe and had a profound impact on European thought.

==Fibonacci sequence==

Liber Abaci also posed, and solved, a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers. The number sequence was known to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century,[tpl]cite book |title = Toward a Global Science | author = Susantha Goonatilake |publisher = Indiana University Press |year = 1998 |page = 126 |isbn = 978-0-253-33388-9 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=SI5ip95BbgEC&pg=PA126&dq=Virahanka+Fibonacci [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title = The Art of Computer Programming: Generating All Trees – History of Combinatorial Generation; Volume 4 |author=Donald Knuth |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-321-33570-8 | page=50 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=56LNfE2QGtYC&pg=PA50&dq=rhythms[/tpl]Rachel W. Hall. Math for poets and drummers.  Math Horizons  15 (2008) 10–11. but it was Fibonacci's Liber Abaci that introduced it to the West.
In the Fibonacci sequence of numbers, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci began the sequence not with 0, 1, 1, 2, as modern mathematicians do but with 1,1, 2, etc.  He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place (fourteenth in modern counting), that is 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377.Fibonacci Numbers from The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.Il Liber Abbaci, 1857 edition, p. 231. Online at Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence.

==Legacy==

In the 19th century, a statue of Fibonacci was constructed and erected in Pisa. Today it is located in the western gallery of the Camposanto, historical cemetery on the Piazza dei Miracoli.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epsilones.com/paginas/artes/artes-027-historia-estatua-ingles.html |title=Fibonacci's Statue in Pisa |publisher=Epsilones.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02[/tpl]
There are many mathematical concepts named after Fibonacci, for instance because of a connection to the Fibonacci numbers. Examples include the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity, the Fibonacci search technique, and the Pisano period. Beyond mathematics, namesakes of Fibonacci include the asteroid 6765 Fibonacci and the art rock band The Fibonaccis.
