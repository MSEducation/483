Attak, the first KMFDM album following a three-year hiatus, was released in 2002 on Metropolis Records and is the group's twelfth studio album overall. It was recorded in Seattle, Washington. The album was also the last to feature Tim Sk√∂ld in his original tenure in KMFDM.

==History==

The album was originally going to be titled Attaq and written in a Middle Eastern font, but was changed after the September 11 attacks by Konietzko, who explained that the band's history with the Columbine shootings would have made the original title "pretty fucking harsh".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/music/0702/kmfdm.shtml | title=KMFDM Reloads with: Attak | author1=Freedland, Israel | author2=Schneider, Justin | work=Hybrid Magazine | accessdate=May 9, 2012[/tpl]
