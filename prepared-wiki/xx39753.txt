==Appearances==

===A New Hope===

Greedo appears in A New Hope as a Rodian bounty hunter working for Jabba the Hutt. Jabba hires him to capture Han Solo, who lost the Hutt's cargo during an assignment. Greedo approaches Han at Mos Eisley Spaceport on Tatooine and tries to take him in; he also offers to let Han go in exchange for his ship, the Millennium Falcon, an offer Han refuses. Han then shoots him dead with a concealed blaster.

===Star Wars: The Clone Wars===

Greedo also appears in the 2010 Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode "Sphere of Influence". In this series, set 20 years before A New Hope, Greedo is hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Baron Papanoida's daughters, Che Amanwe and Chi Eekway. He is ultimately foiled by Ahsoka Tano, however.

==Portrayal==

Paul Blake played Greedo in the shots that feature both Greedo and Han Solo in the same frame. For Greedo's close-ups, a new articulated head was built for pickups at the end of the shoot, and Maria De Aragon was enlisted to play Greedo. His voice was provided by linguist Larry Ward. In the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series, Greedo was voiced by Tom Kenny.
