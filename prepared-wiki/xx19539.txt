His experimental research in improved crop yields earned the support of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, especially following the famine and loss of productivity resulting from forced collectivization in several regions of the Soviet Union in the early 1930s. In 1940, he became director of the Institute of Genetics within the USSR's Academy of Sciences, and Lysenko's anti-Mendelian doctrines were further secured in Soviet science and education by the exercise of political influence and power. Scientific dissent from Lysenko's theories of environmentally acquired inheritance was formally outlawed in 1948.
Though Lysenko remained at his post in the Institute of Genetics until 1965,[tpl]cite book |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049549 |title= Lysenko, Trofim Denisovich. |work= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date= 16 August 2013 |accessdate= 26 January 2014[/tpl] his influence on Soviet agricultural practice had declined by the 1950s.

==Early rise==

Trofim Lysenko, the son of Denis and Oksana Lysenko, was born to a peasant family in Karlivka, Poltava Governorate (in present-day Poltava Oblast, Ukraine) and attended the Kiev Agricultural Institute (now the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine). In 1927, at 29 years of age, working at an agricultural experiment station in Azerbaijan, he embarked on the research that would lead to his 1928 paper on vernalization, which drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Soviet agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter-wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Lysenko coined the term "Jarovization" to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals ("Jarovoe"); this term was translated as "vernalization" from the Latin "vernum" for western texts.
Later, however, Lysenko incorrectly claimed that a vernalized state could be inherited – i.e., that the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly.
At the 6th International Congress of Genetics (1932), Vavilov, known as one of the strongest critics of Lysenko, said: "The remarkable discovery recently made by T D Lysenko of Odessa opens enormous new possibilities to plant breeders and plant geneticists of mastering individual variation. He found simple physiological methods of shortening the period of growth, of transforming winter varieties into spring ones and late varieties into early ones by inducing processes of fermentation in seeds before sowing them".[tpl]cite journal |last1= Li |first1= X. |last2= Liu |first2= Y. |title= The conversion of spring wheat into winter wheat and vice versa: False claim or Lamarckian inheritance? |journal= Journal of Biosciences |volume= 35 |issue= 2 |year= 2010 |pages= 321–5 |doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0035-1[/tpl]
Praise for Lysenko's work included such items as credit from the Soviet newspaper Pravda for having discovered a method to fertilize fields without using fertilizers or minerals, and for having proven that a winter crop of peas could be grown in Azerbaijan, "turning the barren fields of the Transcaucasus green in winter, so that cattle will not perish from poor feeding, and the peasant Turk will live through the winter without trembling for tomorrow."[tpl]cite book |first= David |last= Joravsky |title= The Lysenko Affair |publisher= University Of Chicago Press |year= 1986 |isbn= |page= |ref= [tpl]SfnRef|Joravsky|1896[/tpl][/tpl]
Lysenko argued that there is not only competition, but also mutual assistance among individuals within a species, and that mutual assistance also exists between different species. Experiments demonstrate that individual flowers of the Brassica napus L. are affected by defoliation, but not by intraspecific competition.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Cresswell |first= J.E. |last2= Hagen |first2= C. |last3=Woolnough |first3= J.M. |year= 2001 |title= Attributes of individual flowers of Brassica napus L. are affected by defoliation but not by intraspecific competition |journal= Annals of Botany |volume= 88 |issue= 1 |pages= 111–7 |doi= 10.1006/anbo.2001.1431 |url= http://eurekamag.com/research/003/655/attributes-of-individual-flowers-of-brassica-napus-l-are-affected-by-defoliation-but-not-by-intraspecific-competition.php[/tpl] British zoologist Tim Clutton-Brock believes that mutualism may play a more important role in the evolution of cooperative societies than has been previously thought.[tpl]cite journal |first= Yongsheng |last= Liu |url= http://imichurin.narod.ru/liu2004.htm |title= Lysenko’s contributions to biology and his tragedies |journal= Biology Forum |volume= 97 |year= 2004 |pages= 483–8[/tpl]
According to Lysenko,
[tpl]quote|The organism and the conditions required for its life are an inseparable unity. Different living bodies require different environmental conditions for their development. By studying these requirements we come to know the qualitative features of the nature of organisms, the qualitative features of heredity. Heredity is the property of a living body to require definite conditions for its life and development and to respond in a definite way to various conditions.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/lysenko/works/1940s/report.htm |title= Soviet Biology |work= marxists.org[/tpl][/tpl]
Lysenko made noteworthy practical achievements in agriculture. For regions with poor summer rainfall, vernalization was used, which chilled seeds of winter varieties, then planting them in the spring. The technique of summer planting was proposed by Lysenko in 1935 to solve the problem of planting potatoes in the hot, dry regions of southern Russia. He created a variety of spring wheat suitable for the region. Lysenko brought about massive increases in the yield of millet, which played an important role in feeding the Red Army soldiers during the Great Patriotic War. He increased yields of kok-sagyz by cluster-planting. And he solved the problem of over-wintering wheat in Siberia by sowing in the autumn stubble. Lysenko's achievements won him the respect and affection of the Russian people.
By the late 1920s, the Soviet political leaders had given their support to Lysenko. This support was a consequence, in part, of policies put in place by Communist Party personnel to rapidly promote members of the proletariat into leadership positions in agriculture, science and industry. Party officials were looking for promising candidates with backgrounds similar to Lysenko's: born of a peasant family, without formal academic training or affiliations to the academic community.
Lysenko in particular impressed political officials further with his success in motivating peasants to return to farming.[tpl]cite book |last= Graham |first= Loren R. |authorlink= Loren Graham |title= Science and Philosophy in the Soviet Union |publisher= Knopf |year= 1972 |page= 208[/tpl]  The Soviet's Collectivist reforms forced the confiscation of agricultural landholdings from peasant farmers and heavily damaged the country's overall food production, and the dispossessed peasant farmers posed new problems for the regime. Many had abandoned the farms altogether; many more waged resistance to collectivization by poor work quality and pilfering. The dislocated and disenchanted peasant farmers were a major political concern to the Soviet leadership.[tpl]cite book |last= Fitzpatrick |first= Sheila |authorlink= Sheila Fitzpatrick |title= Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village after Collectivization |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1994 |pages= 4–5[/tpl]  Lysenko emerged during this period inaugurating radically new agricultural methods, and also promising that the new methods provided wider opportunities for year-round work in agriculture. Lysenko proved himself very useful to the Soviet leadership by reengaging peasants to return to work, helping to secure from them a personal stake in the overall success of the Soviet revolutionary experiment.
Lysenko's genetic theories were grounded in Lamarckism. His work was primarily devoted to developing new techniques and practices in agriculture. But he also contributed a new theoretical framework which would become the foundation of all Soviet agriculture: a discipline called agrobiology that is a fusion of plant physiology, cytology, genetics and evolutionary theory. Central to Lysenko's tenets was the concept of the inheritability of acquired characteristics. In 1932 Lysenko was given his own journal, The Bulletin of Vernalization, and it became the main outlet for touting emerging developments of Lysenkoist research.[tpl]cite book |first= Nikolai |last= Krementsov |title= Stalinist Science |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 1997[/tpl] Based on the works of Darwin and Michurin, Lysenko applied graft hybridization to the practice of plant breeding. About 500 scientific papers on graft hybridization published in Russia during 1950–1958 support Lysenko's work, and several groups of scientists in recent years have demonstrated that graft-induced characteristics are stable and reliable.

==After Stalin==

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Lysenko retained his position, with the support of the new leader Nikita Khrushchev. However, mainstream scientists re-emerged, and found new willingness within Soviet government leadership to tolerate criticism of Lysenko, the first opportunity since the late 1920s. In 1962 three of the most prominent Soviet physicists, Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich, Vitaly Ginzburg, and Pyotr Kapitsa, presented a case against Lysenko, proclaiming his work as false science.[tpl]cite web|title=Trofim Lysenko|url=http://www.famousscientists.org/trofim-lysenko/|work=Famous Scientists|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl] They also denounced Lysenko's application of political power to silence opposition and eliminate his opponents within the scientific community. These denunciations occurred during a period of structural upheaval in Soviet government, during which the major institutions were purged of the strictly ideological and political machinations which had controlled the work of the Soviet Union's scientific community for several decades under Stalin.
In 1964, physicist Andrei Sakharov spoke out against Lysenko in the General Assembly of the Academy of Sciences:
The Soviet press was soon filled with anti-Lysenkoite articles and appeals for the restoration of scientific methods to all fields of biology and agricultural science. In 1965[ref]
