==History==

Star Wreck Studios Oy Ltd and Wreckamovie were created by a group of filmmakers from Finland, who in 2005 created the freely downloadable Star Trek parody movie Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning. It gained web fame for being created and distributed by a community of enthusiasts over the internet, and for its special effects only made on a shoestring budget using standard home computers. The experiences of the group creating the aforementioned film, their first feature film, led them to develop a platform that's open and easy to use for everyone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wreckamovie.com/about |title=http://www.Wreckamovie.com/About |publisher=Star Wreck Studios Oy Ltd|accessdate=2009-10-16[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Wreckamovie is considered a model example of the potential of Web 2.0 according to Cisco Systems Finland Oy. As a business model it presents the exact opposite of the traditional way of making movies. With it a community creates and distributes the film, and only then, once popularity has already been gained, profitability steps in.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sttinfo.fi/pressrelease/detail.do?pressId=12757 |title=Suomalainen verkkopalvelu elokuvien tekemiseen esiteltiin Cisco Expossa (engl.

Wreckamovie serves all kinds of audiovisual productions, from short films and music videos to full feature-length films. The concept is that anyone can build a community for a movie or any audiovisual project, and ask for assistance in desired tasks for the production. The service makes it possible to produce films together with the community, and thus to create a real interaction with the audience from the development stage.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nordiskfilmogtvfond.com/news_story.php?cid=895&sid=14&ptid=7|author= |title=Finnish Cannes Wrecking Campaign Pays|work=Nordisk Film & TV Fond |accessdate=2009-10-16[/tpl]
The service doesn't distinguish between "professionals" and "amateurs", but emphasizes on enthusiasm.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mindtrek.org/2008/competition|title=MindTrek Competition 2008 |work=mindtrek.org/2008/ |accessdate=2009-10-16[/tpl]
In addition to online distribution, the creators want to distribute movies in every possible way, ranging from traditional movie screens to cell phones.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/ict/article78120.ece|author=Veera Jussila |title=Star Wreckin seuraaja syntyy nettiyhteisössä|work=Tekniikka & Talous |accessdate=2009-10-16[/tpl] Then the existing community serves as a strong potential base for viral marketing.
