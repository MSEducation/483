==Coat and color==

The breed's most distinctive feature is the unusual felted coat, a normal and healthy characteristic of the breed. The coat is characterized by three types of hair: a fine, dense, oily undercoat, long harsher hairs similar to a goat's and a top woolly outer-coat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dog-breeds-expert.com/Bergamasco-Sheepdog.html |title=Dog Breeds Expert Website: Bergamasco Sheepdog |publisher=Dog-breeds-expert.com |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-01-01[/tpl] The three types of hair weave together as the dog gets older to form flat mats or flocks. The mats start from the spine and go down the flanks, growing every year to reach the ground. The color of the coat can be anything from an appearance of gray or silver gray (in fact a merle) to a mixture of black to coal, with brown shades also intermixed. These colors may have served as a camouflage when working in the mountains. Bergamascos are born with short, smooth fur, which slowly develops the characteristic mats as the dog grows. The coat is olid grey or with grey patches of all possible shades from a most delicate grey to a brighter shade of grey on to black; Isabel and light fawn shades are permitted.  An all-black coat is allowed providing the black is really opaque.  An all-white coat is prohibited. White patches are tolerated as long as their surface is not more than a fifth of the total surface of the coat.[tpl]cite book |last=Renna |first=Christine Hartnagle |title=Herding Dogs: Selecting and Training the Working Farm Dog |year=2008 |publisher=Kennel Club Books (KCB)|isbn=978-1-59378-737-0|pages=[/tpl]

==Temperament==

The Bergamasco is an alert, observant and patient dog breed with good self-control and balance. This breed is suited even as a guard and companion dog.  The Bergamasco establishes close bond with his owner.
Aggressive or overly shy behavior is a fault.

==Activities==

Bergamasco can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Bergamasco exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.[tpl]cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-157779-106-5|pages=|chapter=[/tpl] The Bergamasco is still used in the Alps in Italy and in Switzerland to herd cattle. The cattlemen just let the dog go and the dog brings the herd back to the stable without human supervision. Bergamascos are often photographed herding sheep, but they are actually superb cattle dogs, who can perform in a mountain environment.

==Health==

Health information for this breed is sparse.  The only health survey appears to be a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, which had a sample size of 0 deceased dogs and 10 living dogs, far too few dogs from which to draw any conclusions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 |title=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004.
