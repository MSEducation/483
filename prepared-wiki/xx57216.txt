==History==

===World War II===

Bradley has its origins in the 1940 acquisition of [tpl]convert|1700|acre[/tpl] of land in Windsor Locks by the State of Connecticut. In 1941 this land was turned over to the U.S. Army, as the country began its preparations for the impending war.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bradleyairport.com/News/factsheet.aspx | title = Media Kit Fact Sheet | publisher = Bradley International Airport | accessdate = October 9, 2010[/tpl]
The airfield was named after 24-year-old Lt. Eugene M. Bradley of Antlers, Oklahoma, assigned to the 64th Pursuit Squadron, who died when his P-40 crashed during a dogfight training drill on August 21, 1941.[tpl]cite news | last = Marks | first = Paul | title = Archaeological Sleuths Hunt For Site Of Bradley Airport Namesake's Fatal Crash | url = http://articles.courant.com/2006-05-28/business/0605280234_1_history-mystery-bradley-international-airport-plane | accessdate = November 14, 2011 | newspaper = Hartford Courant | date = May 28, 2006 | quote = Bradley's fatal accident occurred during a simulated aerial dogfight with Frank Mears, commander of the 64th Pursuit Squadron. The plane Bradley was flying spun out of control as he went into a sharp turn at about 5,000 feet. Stunned witnesses saw the plane spiral slowly into a grove of trees. Soon a column of smoke arose. They theorize that the young pilot blacked out from the gravitational forces felt during such a sharp aerial turn.[/tpl]

===Post-war to present===

The airfield began civilian use in 1947 as Bradley International Airport. Its first commercial flight was Eastern Air Lines flight 624. International cargo operations at the airport also began that year. Bradley eventually came to replace the older, smaller Hartford-Brainard Airport as Hartford's primary airport.
In 1948 the federal government deeded the Airport to the State of Connecticut for public and commercial use.
In 1950 Bradley International Airport exceeded the 100,000-passenger mark, handling 108,348 annual passengers.
In 1952 the Murphy Terminal was opened. Later dubbed Terminal B, the terminal was the oldest passenger terminal in the US when it closed in 2010.[tpl]cite web | url = http://articles.courant.com/2010-04-02/business/hc-bradley-terminal.artapr02_1_million-terminal-improvement-project-airport-cleaning-crews-terminal-s-construction | title = Airlines To Clear Out Of Bradley Airport's Murphy Terminal, The Nation's Oldest, By April 15 | publisher = Hartford Courant | date = April 2, 2010 | accessdate = October 9, 2010 | first = Eric | last = Gershon[/tpl]
The April 1957 OAG shows 39 weekday departures: 14 American, 14 Eastern, 9 United and 2 Northeast. Nonstops never reached west of Chicago or south of Washington until Eastern and Northeast began Miami in 1967. Nonstops to Los Angeles and Atlanta started in 1968.
In 1960 Bradley handled 500,238 passengers.
In 1971 the Murphy Terminal was expanded with an International Arrivals wing. This was followed by the installation of instrument landing systems on two runways in 1977.
In 1976 an experimental monorail was completed to link the terminal to a parking lot seven-tenths of a mile away. The "people mover" cost $4 million USD, and was anticipated to cost $250 thousand annually to operate. Due to the high operating cost the monorail was never put in service and was dismantled in 1984 to make room for a new terminal building.Marks, Paul.

In 1979, a tornado ripped through Windsor Locks, wreaking destruction along the eastern portions of the airport. The New England Air Museum sustained some of the worst damage. It reopened in 1982.
In 1986, new Terminal A and Bradley Sheraton Hotel was completed. The Roncari cargo terminal was also constructed.
In 2001, construction commenced on a new parking garage. When completed, the garage could not immediately be used. The intervening attacks of 9/11 led to regulations requiring parking structures to be set back farther from the tarmac. After opening, for several weeks every vehicle had to be individually inspected, severely reducing its value. Bradley eventually received a waiver for normal operation of the garage from the Department of Homeland Security.
2001 also saw the commencement of the Terminal Improvement Project to expand Terminal A with a new concourse, construct a new International Arrivals Building, and centralize passenger screening. The airport expansion was part of a larger project to enhance the reputation of the Hartford metropolitan area as a destination for business and vacation travel. The new East Concourse, designed by HNTB,HNTB demonstrates engineering expertise at ACEC annual conference opened in September 2002.
In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened to the west of Terminal B. This structure houses the Federal Inspection Station and has one jetway for deboarding aircraft.[tpl]cite book | title = Bradley Airport Master Plan | publisher = Bradley International Board of Directors[/tpl] Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft as large as a Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, which included the building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bradleyairport.com/pdfs/Fact_Sheet_FIS.pdf | title = Fact Sheet: Federal Inspection Station | publisher = Bradley International Airport | accessdate = October 9, 2010[/tpl]  All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB.  International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.
In July 2007, Northwest Airlines commenced nonstop service from Bradley International Airport to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, the airline normally flew a Boeing 757-200 on the Hartford-Amsterdam route but more than once substituted with a slightly larger 757-300, these 757 variants became the largest scheduled passenger aircraft to fly out of Bradley. It was Bradley's only overseas flight. Northwest Airlines discontinued the flight in 2009."Bradley loses flight to Europe again", Associated Press via WTNH.com, March 27, 2009. Retrieved August 6, 2012. Currently, Bradley does not have any scheduled overseas passenger service.
On October 2–3, 2007, the Airbus A380 visited Bradley as part of its world tour, stopping in Hartford to showcase the aircraft to Connecticut workers for Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand, both divisions of United Technologies, which helped build the GP7000 TurboFan engines, which is an option to power the aircraft. Bradley Airport is one of only 68 airports worldwide large enough to accommodate the A380. Despite this statement, no International Airlines or Carriers have yet considered Bradley Airport for possible A380 service.
On October 18, 2007, Bradley International Airport was named one of the top five small airports in the North American Airport Satisfaction Study by J. D. Power and Associates.
On October 7, 2008, Embraer, an aerospace company based in Brazil, selected Bradley as its service center for the Northeastern United States. An $11 million project was begun with support from teams of the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Connecticut's Economic and Community Development. The center is intended to be a full maintenance and repair facility for its line of business jets, and is expected to employ up to 60 aircraft technicians. The facility was temporarily closed ten months after opening due to economic conditions, reopening on February 28, 2011.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.courant.com/business/hc-embraer-closes.artaug26,0,7319658.story| title = Embraer Closes Jet Maintenance Center At Bradley Airport Months After Opening | publisher = Hartford Courant | date = August 26, 2009 | accessdate = October 9, 2010 | first = Eric | last = Gershon[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/news17101.html| title = Brazil's Embraer reopens at Bradley | publisher = Hartford Business Journal | date = March 1, 2011 | accessdate = March 31, 2011 | first = Gregory | last = Seay[/tpl]

===Rail===

The nearby Windsor Locks and Windsor train stations are both served by Amtrak.Amtrak – Station Search Results Connecticut Transit buses travel between the Windsor train station and the airport. The New Haven–Hartford–Springfield commuter rail line, which is expected to begin service in 2016, will increase the speed, frequency and reliability of trains along the corridor.
