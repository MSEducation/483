==Media==

Kinshasa is home to a large number of media outlets, including multiple radio and television stations that broadcast to nearly the entire country, including state-run Radio-Television Nationale Congolaise (RTNC) and privately run Digital Congo and Raga TV. The private channel RTGA is also based in Kinshasa.
Several national radio stations, including La Voix du Congo, which is operated by RTNC, MONUC-backed Radio Okapi and Raga FM are based in Kinshasa, as well as numerous local stations. The BBC is also available in Kinshasa on 92.6 FM.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1076399.stm#media|title =Democratic Republic of Congo country profile – Media|accessdate=15 December 2010|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
The state-controlled Agence Congolaise de Presse news agency is based in Kinshasa, as well as several daily and weekly newspapers and news websites, including L'Avenir (daily), La Conscience L'Observateur (daily), Le Phare, Le Potentiel, and Le Soft."Countries: Democatric Republic of the Congo: News" (Archive).[tpl]sic[/tpl] Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources.

Most of the media uses French and Lingala to a large extent; very few use the other national languages.

==Language==

The official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which Kinshasa is the capital, is French (See: Kinshasa French vocabulary). Kinshasa is the second largest officially Francophone city in the world[ref][tpl]cite book|title=The Story of French|last=Nadeau|first=Jean-Benoit|year=2006|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312341831|page=301|page=483|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl]
The world's second-largest francophone city is not Montreal, Dakar, or Algiers, as most people would assume, but Kinshasa, capital of the former Zaire.

A third factor is simply a demographic one. At least one in ten Congolese live in Kinshasa. With its population approaching ten million, it is the second largest city in sub-Saharan Africa (after Lagos). It is also the second largest French-speaking city in the world, according to Paris (even though only a small percentage of Kinois speak French correctly).[/ref] although Lingala is widely used as a spoken language. French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of uneven rank; people of equal rank, however, speak the Congolese languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba or Swahili) among themselves.[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Francophone sub-Saharan Africa: Democracy and Dependence, 1985–1995|last=Manning|first=Patrick|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London and New York|isbn=9780521645195|page=189|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LwzFF2FnbzMC&pg=PA189&dq=Kinshasa+second+largest+francophone+city&lr=&ei=T-0iSpzsEYOIzQTSl_XRBw|accessdate=31 May 2009[/tpl]
The apostles of francophonie in the 1980s labelled Zaire as the second-largest francophone country, and Kinshasa as the second-largest francophone city. Yet Zaire seemed unlikely to escape a complex multilingualism. Lingala was the language of music, of presidential addresses, of daily life in government and in Kinshasa. But if Lingala was the spoken language of Kinshasa, it made little progress as a written language. French was the written language of the city – as seen in street signs, posters, newspapers and in government documents. French dominated plays and television as well as the press; French was the language of the national anthem and even for the doctrine of authenticity. Zairian researchers found French to be used in vertical relationsihps among people of uneven rank; people of equal rank, no matter how high, tended to speak Zairian languages among themselves. Given these limits, French might have lost its place to another of the leading languages of Zaire – Lingala, Tshiluba, or Swahili – except that teaching of these languages also suffered from limitations on its growth.[/ref]  Thus, while the culture is dominated by the Francophonie, a complex multilingualism is present in Kinshasa.

==Transport==

Several private companies whose Urban Transport Company (STUC) and the Public City train (12 cars in 2002 [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]) serves the city. The bus lines are:
Other companies also provide public transport: Urbaco, Tshatu Trans, Socogetra, Gesac and MB Sprl. The city bus carries up to 67,000 passengers per day. Several companies operate taxis and taxi-buses. The majority (95.8%) of transport is provided by individuals.
During the early years of the 21st century, the city's planners considered creating a tramway in collaboration with public transport in Brussels (STIB), whose work would start in 2009. That work has not moved beyond the planning stage, partly due to lack of a sufficient electrical supply.[tpl]fr[/tpl] La Stib à Kinshasa ?, La Dernière Heure, 24 May 2007.[tpl]nl[/tpl] Werkt MIVB mee aan uitbouw tramnetwerk Kinshasa?[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Air===

Several airlines serve Kinshasa (Ndjili) International Airport (FIH) in Kinshasa, including Kenya Airways, Air Gabon, Cameroon Airlines, Bravo Air Congo, Air Zimbabwe, South African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air France and Turkish Airlines.
As of April 2014 DR Congo has two major national airlines (CAA and Korongo Airlines) which offered flights inside DR Congo and to a small number of international locations. Korongo Airlines is based in Lumbumbashi and CAA was based in Kinshasa but both airlines operated many of the same flight routes.

===Rail===

ONATRA operates three lines of urban railways linking the town centre, which goes to Bas-Congo.[tpl]fr[/tpl] L’enfer des chemins de fer urbains kinois, Le Potentiel, 25 July 2005.
In 2007 Belgium assisted in a renovation of the country's internal rail network.DRC CONGO: KINSHASHA|Railways Africa This improved service to Kintambo, Ndolo, Limete, Lemba, Kasangulu, Gombe, Ndjili and Masina.

===External transport===

Kinshasa is the major river port of the Congo. The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about [tpl]convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] along the river, comprising scores of quays and jetties with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to Brazzaville, a distance of about [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as Kisangani and Bangui.
There are road and rail links to Matadi, the sea port in the Congo estuary [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Atlantic Ocean.
There are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition.
The city has two airports: N'djili Airport is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. N'Dolo Airport, located close to the city center, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft.

==Conservation==

===Lola ya Bonobo===

Founded by Claudine André in 1994, Lola ya Bonobo is the world's only sanctuary for orphaned bonobos.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Sanctuary. A love story|journal=Educator.

Lola ya Bonobo means 'paradise for bonobos' in Lingala. In 2008, Lola ya Bonobo was home to 60 bonobos who live in 30 hectares of primary forest.
