Ghadir Al-Khumm (Arabic غدیر الخم "Pond of Khumm", Persianized  Ghadir(-e) Khum, or Khom) is a location in the Wadi Rabigh mentioned in the Hadith of the pond of Khumm.
It was a pond or marsh formed by a spring in the wadi, located to the east of the road from Medina to Mecca, three (according to other sources two) Arab miles (roughly 4 to 6 km) from Al-Johfa (modern Rabigh), roughly 180 km from both Mecca and Medina, at ca. [tpl]Coord|22|49|30|N|39|4|30|E|[/tpl]. 
The Arab geographers mention the thick trees that surround it and the Mosque of the Prophet lying between it and the spring.
It was situated on the Incense Route between Syria and Yemen where travelers could replenish their resources of water in the most arid part of Arabia between Mecca and Medina.
The Shias claim that what is known as the Hadith of the pond of Khumm, that Muhammad is reported to have pronounced Ali ibn Abi Talib the mawla (patron, master) of those for whom Muhammad was patron.http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e706?_hi=6&_pos=2 Shia Muslims accept their version of the hadith as an announcement of Ali bin Abi Talib being the first caliph after the Prophet's death and they celebrate this announcement each year as Eid al-Ghadeer. Many sunnis also accept that the Prophet did actually declare Ali as the mawla, however they refuse to believe that this meant succession to the Prophet. According to the Muwatta by Malik ibn Anas, the oldest book in Islam after the Quran.
 " 46.3 Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, "I have left two things with you. As long as you hold fast to them, you will not go astray. They are the Book of Allah and the Sunna of His Prophet."the hadith in Muwatta 
The Hadith al-Thaqalayn refers to a saying (hadith) about al-Thaqalayn, which translates to "the two weighty things." In this hadith Muhammad referred to the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt ('people of the house', Muhammed's family) as the two weighty things. Although the Hadith is accepted by both Sunnis and Shi'as, the two groups differ on the exact wording of what Muhammad said, as well how to interpret these words. The Shias use the Hadith al-Thaqalayn to prove their claim that Muhammad meant for all his successors to be from his own family (Ahl al-Bayt). Some sunnis reject this view and believe in a different interpretation of Hadith al-Thaqalayn, whilst others believe that the Hadith does refer to the Family of the Prophet and his successors.
According to Sunnis, there is no record of any disagreement between Muslim scholars concerning the alleged caliphate of Ali bin Abi Talib in the years proceeding the Prophet. Imam Jafar al-Sadiq whose views most Shias follow and Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas whose views most Sunnis follow worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. Along with Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Muhammad al-Baqir, Zayd ibn Ali and over 70 other leading jurists and scholars. On the other hand, according to shias, the dispute between Ali and the rest of the companions started right at the death of the Prophet when they abandoned him with the Prophet's dead body and quickly chose Abu Bakar as the caliph.
