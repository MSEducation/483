Prabhu Narayan Singh (26 November 1855 â€“ 4 August 1931) was ruler of the Indian Princely State of  Benares State (Royal House of Benares) from 1889 to 1931.
He was the nephew and adopted son of Raja Ishwari Prasad Narayan Singh, who was granted the title of Maharaja by the British for his loyalty during the Indian Mutiny. He succeeded to the Family Domains, as they then were, in 1889. Always on good relations with the British, the British Raj formally recognised his territory as a Princely State in 1911.
He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1892, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (GCIE) in 1898, and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) for his services in the First World War in the 1921 New Year Honours.[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=32178 |date=1 January 1921 |startpage=5|supp=yes [/tpl]
