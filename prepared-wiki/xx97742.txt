[[To the Teeth]]

CATEGORIES: Ani DiFranco albums, 1999 albums

To the Teeth is singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco's tenth studio album (excluding EPs and her collaborations with Utah Phillips), released in November 1999.
To the Teeth has a more political and self-questioning edge than many of her earlier works. It is also considerably more experimental, with "Freakshow", "Swing", "Carry You Around" and "The Arrivals Gate" branching out into genres such as blues, jazz and funk. She was also supported by Prince on the track "Providence".
It opens with the title track, an indictment of America's gun culture, and a response to the Columbine High School massacre. It also contains "Soft Shoulder", about two lovers missing their opportunity, and "Hello Birmingham", a sad, angry response to the shooting murder of abortion doctor Barnett Slepian.
To the Teeth reached No. 76 on the Billboard Music Chart Top 200, and No. 9 on their Top Internet Albums chart.
