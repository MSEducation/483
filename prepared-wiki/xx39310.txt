The Cult Awareness Network provided referrals to activist members who provided lists of deprogrammers, which in turn provided referrals to deprogrammers. Deprogrammers relied upon CAN to provide a steady supply of paying customers.Gallagher, E.V. and W.M. Ashcraft. 2006.

The National Resource Development and Economic Council was formed in the mid 1980s and had became institutionalized as a special unit within CAN by 1987.Shupe, A. and S.E. Darnell. 2011. Agents of Discord: Deprogramming, Pseudo-Science, and the American Anticult Movement: Transaction Publishers.
The unit's role was to provide referrals to deprogrammers in exchange for a 'kickback' - either in cash or in the form of a tax deductible "donation" or "commissions" which were then funnelled back to national CAN headquartersDavis, D. and B.
