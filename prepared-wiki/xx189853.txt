2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is a natural phenol found in Phyllanthus acidus[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1124/mol.106.025262 | pmid=17065237 | volume=71 | issue=1 | title=An extract from the medicinal plant Phyllanthus acidus and its isolated compounds induce airway chloride secretion: A potential treatment for cystic fibrosis |date=January 2007 | journal=Mol. Pharmacol. | pages=366–76 | author=Sousa M, Ousingsawat J, Seitz R, et al.[/tpl] and in the aquatic fern Salvinia molesta.[tpl] cite PMID|18177906[/tpl] It is also abundant in the fruits of Flacourtia inermis. It is a dihydroxybenzoic acid, a type of organic compound. 
The colorless solid occurs naturally, being formed via the shikimate pathway. It is incorporated into various siderophores, which are molecules that strongly complex iron ions for absorption into bacteria.  2,3-DHB consists of a catechol group, which upon deprotonation binds iron centers very strongly, and the carboxylic acid group by which the ring attaches to various scaffolds via amide linkages. A famous high affinity siderophore is enterochelin, which contains three dihydroxybenzoyl substituents linked to the depsipeptide of serine.[tpl]cite journal | author = I. G. O'Brien, G. B. Cox, F.
