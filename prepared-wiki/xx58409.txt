Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English broadcaster, journalist and writer who specialises in motoring. He is best known for his role on the BBC TV show Top Gear along with co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. He also writes weekly columns for The Sunday Times and The Sun.
From a career as a local journalist in Northern England, Clarkson rose to public prominence as a presenter of the original format of Top Gear in 1988. Since the mid-1990s, Clarkson has become a recognised public personality, regularly appearing on British television presenting his own shows and appearing as a guest on other shows. As well as motoring, Clarkson has produced programmes and books on subjects such as history and engineering. From 1998 to 2000, he also hosted his own chat show, Clarkson.
His opinionated but humorous tongue-in-cheek writing and presenting style has often generated much public reaction to his viewpoints. His actions both privately and as a Top Gear presenter have also sometimes resulted in criticism from the media, politicians, pressure groups and the public. He has also generated a significant following from the public, being credited as a major factor in the resurgence of Top Gear as one of the most popular shows on the BBC.

Clarkson played the role of a public schoolboy, Taplin, in a BBC radio Children's Hour serial adaptation of Anthony Buckeridge's Jennings novels until his voice broke.

Clarkson's fondness for wearing jeans has been blamed by some for the decline in sales of denim in the mid-1990s, particularly Levi's, because of their being associated with middle aged men, the so-called 'Jeremy Clarkson effect'.[tpl]cite news | last = Benady | first =Alex | title = Shakespeare's Bottom pinched by Levi admen |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 24 January 2005 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1481871/Shakespeare's-Bottom-pinched-by-Levi-admen.html | accessdate =22 July 2008 | quote = "For a period in the late '90s denim became unfashionable," said Louise Foster, of the fashion trade magazine Draper's Record.

For an episode of the first series of the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are? broadcast in November 2004, Clarkson was invited to investigate his family history. It included the story of his great-great-great grandfather John Kilner (1792–1857), who invented the Kilner jar: a container for preserved fruit.
Clarkson is a fan of the rock band Genesis and attended the band's reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007. He also provided sleeve notes for the reissue of the album Selling England by the Pound as part of the Genesis 1970–1975 box set.[tpl]cite news | url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5050592.ece | title= The famous fans of Genesis | work=The Times | location=London | date=2 November 2008 | accessdate=2 April 2010 | first1=Fiona | last1=Hamilton | first2=Sam | last2=Coates | first3=Michael | last3=Savage[/tpl]  He uses his love for Genesis to mock his fellow presenter of BBC Top Gear, Richard Hammond.

In 1984, Clarkson formed the Motoring Press Agency (MPA), in which, with fellow motoring journalist Jonathan Gill, he conducted road tests for local newspapers and automotive magazines. This developed into pieces for publications such as Performance Car.Jeremy Clarkson at AskMen.com. Retrieved 27 April 2007. He has regularly written for Top Gear magazine since its launch in 1993.
Clarkson writes regular columns in the tabloid newspaper The Sun, and for the broadsheet newspaper The Sunday Times. The Times columns are republished in The Weekend Australian newspaper. He also writes for the "Wheels" section of the Toronto Star.

===Television===

Clarkson's first major television role came as one of the presenters on the British motoring programme Top Gear, from 27 October 1988 to 3 February 2000,IMDB – Jeremy Clarkson – Filmography by TV series in the programme's original format, and then again from 20 October 2002, when it was relaunched in a new format after a brief period off the air.

Clarkson presented the first series UK version of Robot Wars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spheretv.com/site/television/game-show/robot-wars.html |title=Robot Wars |accessdate=18 November 2006 |work=SphereTV[/tpl] His talk show, Clarkson, comprised 27 half-hour episodes aired in the United Kingdom between November 1998 and December 2000, and featured guest interviews with musicians, politicians and television personalities. Clarkson went on to present documentaries focused on non-motoring themes such as history and engineering, although the motoring shows and videos continued. Alongside his stand-alone shows, many mirror the format of his newspaper columns and books, combining his love of driving and motoring journalism, with the examination and expression of his other views on the world, such as in Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld, Jeremy Clarkson's Car Years and Jeremy Clarkson Meets the Neighbours.
Clarkson's views are often showcased on television shows. In 1997, Clarkson appeared on the light-hearted comedy show Room 101, in which a guest nominates things they hate in life to be consigned to nothingness. Clarkson dispatched caravans, houseflies, the sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, the mentality within golf clubs, and vegetarians. He has made several appearances on the prime time talk shows Parkinson and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross since 2002. By 2003, his persona was deemed to fit the mould for the series Grumpy Old Men, in which middle-aged men talk about any aspects of modern life which irritate them. Since the topical news panel show Have I Got News for You dismissed regular host Angus Deayton in October 2002, Clarkson has become one of the most regularly used guest hosts on the show. Clarkson has appeared as a panellist on the political current affairs television show  Question Time twice since 2000.
In 2007, Clarkson won the National Television Awards Special Recognition Award. Also in 2007, it was reported that Clarkson earned £1 million a year for his role as a Top Gear presenter, and a further £1.7 million from books, DVDs and newspaper columns.Pay us the same as Clarkson – or we quit!

==Opinions and influence==

===Politics===

Clarkson is in favour of personal freedom and against government regulation, stating that government should "build park benches and that is it. They should leave us alone."BBC News Clarkson: 'I'd be a rubbish PM', 27 May 2008 He has a particular contempt for the Health and Safety Executive. He often criticised the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, especially the 'ban' culture, frequently fixating on the bans on smoking and 2004 ban on fox hunting.
Jeremy Clarkson's comments have both a large number of supporters and opposers. He often comments on the media-perceived social issues of the day such as the fear of challenging adolescent youths, known as 'hoodies'. In 2007 Clarkson was cleared of allegations of assaulting a hoodie while visiting central Milton Keynes, after Thames Valley Police said that if anything, he had been the victim.[ref]BBC News
Clarkson quizzed over gang ordeal, 6 December 2007[/ref] In the five-part series Jeremy Clarkson: Meets the Neighbours he travelled around Europe in a Jaguar E-Type, examining (and in some cases reinforcing) his stereotypes of other countries.
As a motoring journalist, he is frequently critical of government initiatives such as the London congestion charge or proposals on road charging. He is also frequently scornful of caravanners and cyclists. He has often singled out John Prescott the former Transport Minister, and Stephen Joseph the head of the public transport pressure group Transport 2000 for ridicule.
In September 2013 a tweet proposing that he might stand for election in Doncaster North, the constituency of the current Labour leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, excited much interest in the press.

===Environment===

Clarkson is unsympathetic to the green movement and has little respect for groups such as Greenpeace—he believes that the "eco-mentalists" are a by-product of the "old trade unionists and CND lesbians" who had found a more relevant cause—This has been my perfect week Clarkson Times column 13 January 2008 but "loves the destination" of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly. Regarding windfarms, he says that in the future, they will be described as "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet"ruralvoice.co.uk, March 2012 Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate,"Okay, you’ve got me bang to rights – I’m a secret green" The Times, 17 May 2009 but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying "let's just stop and think for a moment what the consequences might be. Switzerland loses its skiing resorts? The beach in Miami is washed away? North Carolina gets knocked over by a hurricane? Anything bothering you yet?"
In an attempt to prove the press and public furore over the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal was a fuss about nothing, he published his own bank account number and sort code, together with instructions on how to find out his address, in The Sun newspaper, expecting nobody to be able to remove money from his account. He later discovered that someone had set up a monthly direct debit for £500 to Diabetes UK.[tpl]cite news |first= Andrew |last= Hendry |title= Top Gear host publishes bank details, loses money |url= http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;562113308|publisher=Computerworld |date= 9 January 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2008[/tpl]

===Himself===

Whilst Clarkson states such views in his columns and in public appearances, his public persona does not necessarily represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying "I don't believe what I write, any more than you (Alastair Campbell) believe what you say"Gear'' Series 15, Episode 2
Clarkson has been described as a "skilful propagandist for the motoring lobby" by The Economist. With a forthright and sometimes deadpan delivery, Clarkson is said to thrive on the notoriety his public comments bring, and has risen to the level of the bête noire of the various groups who disagree with his views. On the Channel 4 organised viewer poll, for the 100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate programme, Clarkson polled in 66th place. By 2005, Clarkson was perceived by the press to have upset so many people and groups, The Independent put him on trial for various 'crimes', declaring him guilty on most counts.The Independent The People vs Jeremy Clarkson, 13 November 2005

===Media===

Responses to Clarkson's comments are often directed personally, with derogatory comments about residents of Norfolk leading to some residents organising a "We hate Jeremy Clarkson" club. In The Guardian's 2007 'Media 100' list, which lists the top 100 most "powerful people in the media industry", based on cultural, economic and political influence in the UK, Clarkson was listed as a new entrant at 74th. Some critics even attribute Clarkson's actions and views as being influential enough to be responsible for the closure of Rover and the Luton manufacturing plant of Vauxhall.Auto Trader Clarkson versus the world, 13 April 2007 Clarkson's comments about Rover prompted workers to hang an "Anti-Clarkson Campaign" banner outside the defunct Longbridge plant in its last days.
The BBC often plays down his comments as ultimately not having the weight they are ascribed. In 2007 they described Clarkson as "Not a man given to considered opinion", and in response to an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: "Jeremy's colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC. More often than not they are said with a twinkle in his eye."[tpl]cite news | title = Clarkson in the doghouse |work=BBC News | date = 26 October 1998 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/201675.stm | accessdate =2 August 2006[/tpl]
On his chat show, Clarkson, he caused upset to the Welsh by placing a 3D plastic map of Wales into a microwave oven and switching it on. He later defended this by saying, "I put Wales in there because Scotland wouldn't fit."

===Recognition===

In 2005, Clarkson received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the Oxford Brookes University.Jeremy Clarkson, Doctor of Engineering (HonDEng) – website of the Oxford Brookes University His views on the environment precipitated a small demonstration at the award ceremony for his honorary degree, when Clarkson was pied by road protester Rebecca Lush.[tpl]cite news | last = Curtis | first = Polly | title = Clarkson hit by pie at degree ceremony |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 12 September 2005 | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,1568215,00.html | accessdate =2 August 2006 | quote = The controversial BBC motoring presenter Jeremy Clarkson today received an honorary degree from Oxford Brookes University – and a banana meringue pie in the face from an environmental protester.

I told her it was a great shot and then I told her she had used too much sugar in the mix. | location=London[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Clarkson has spoken in support of hydrogen cars.
In 2008, an internet petition was posted on the Prime Minister's Number 10 website to "Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister". By the time it closed, it had attracted 49,446 signatures. An opposing petition posted on the same site set to "Never, Ever Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister" attracted 87 signatures. Clarkson later commented he would be a rubbish Prime Minister as he is always contradicting himself in his columns. In their official response to the petition, Number 10 agreed with Clarkson's comments.
In response to the reactions he gets, Clarkson has stated "I enjoy this back and forth, it makes the world go round but it is just opinion." On the opinion that his views are influential enough to topple car companies, he has argued that he has proof that he has had no influence. "When I said that the Ford Orion was the worst car ever it went on to become a best-selling car."
Clarkson was ranked 49th on Motor Trend Magazine's Power List for 2011, its list of the fifty most influential figures in the automotive industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/1102_the_2011_power_list/jeremy_clarkson.html |title=BBC Top Gear Host Jeremy Clarkson – 2011 Power List |publisher=Motor Trend |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl]
