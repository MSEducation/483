[[General Motors 122 engine]]

CATEGORIES: Chevrolet engines

In OHV form, it was available in the US beginning in 1982 for the GM J platform compact cars and S-series trucks, For the J cars it evolved through 2002 when it was replaced by GMs Ecotec line of DOHC 4-cylinder engines. In the S-10 related models it evolved through 2003 when it was known as the Vortec 2200. Production ceased consistent with the replacement of the S-series trucks with the GMT 355 sub-platform.

==1.8==

===L46===

The 1.8 L pushrod engine was the first engine to power the J-Body cars.  Introduced with the models in 1982, the 1.8 used a 2-barrel Rochester carburetor and produced [tpl]Convert|88|hp|kW|appr=on[/tpl], at higher rpm. Acceleration in these cars was quite sluggish, with a test 1982 Pontiac J2000 accelerating from 0–60 mph in 16.3 seconds, with a quarter mile (~400 m) time of 20.6 seconds.
Applications:

==2.0==

===LQ2===

This engine was similar to the LQ5 however it didn't use throttle body fuel injection, instead it had a 2-barrel carburetor. This engine was used in the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 compact pickup trucks and their Blazer and Jimmy counterparts until 1985, when it was replaced by the 2.5 L Tech IV engine. This engine produced [tpl]convert|83|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] @ 4600 RPM and [tpl]convert|108|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] @ 2400 RPM.
Applications:

===LQ5===

A stroked version of the 1.8 L engine, displacing 2.0 L, was introduced midway through 1982, to provide more low-rpm power for the J cars. This engine replaced the 1.8 L engine altogether and had throttle body fuel injection. It produces [tpl]Convert|86|hp|K=kw|appr=on[/tpl].
Applications:

===LL8===

This engine replaced the LQ5 and was used from 1987 until 1989. it feature throttle body fuel injection and produced [tpl]Convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|108|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque.
Applications:

==2.2==

===LM3===

For the 1990 model year, GM replaced the 2.0 L engine with a stroked version displacing 2.2 L; with throttle body fuel injection (TBI). Commonly called the 2.2, it produced [tpl]Convert|95|hp[/tpl] and [tpl]Convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. 
Applications:

===LN2===

For 1992, the 2.2 received multi-port fuel injection (MPFI) replacing the TBI version in the J-body cars increasing power to [tpl]Convert|110|hp[/tpl] and torque to [tpl]Convert|130|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. In the L-body cars it was converted straight to Sequential Fuel injection. In 1994, all 2.2 L engines were updated to sequential multi-port fuel injection and power increased to [tpl]Convert|120|hp[/tpl] with torque increasing to [tpl]Convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The MPFI and SFI versions produced enough power to allow the 2.2 to replace the old Pontiac Iron Duke engine as the 4-cylinder offering in the S/T platform trucks and A-body cars. For 1996, it became known as the Vortec 2200 in the S/T trucks.
For 1998, the engine was revised for emissions regulations and became known as the 2200; this revision lowered power to [tpl]convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and torque to [tpl]Convert|135|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The engine was discontinued in 2003, replaced by the 2.2 L DOHC Ecotec engine. Although it displaces 134 cu. in, the 2.2 L OHV is still commonly referred to as the GM 122 today, and has been reputed for its simplicity, reliability and ease of maintenance in the J-body cars and S-Series Trucks, and a few L-Body cars. The 2003 model LN2 is equipped with secondary air injection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/division/2003_prodinfo/03_powertrain/03_truck_engine/index.html|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] 
Applications:

===L43===

The Vortec 2200 (RPO code L43) is an OHV straight-4 truck engine. This engine is equipped with secondary air injection, and is flex-fuel capable. It is entirely different from the Iron Duke having been the last North American iteration of the GM 122 engine. The 2200 uses an iron block and aluminum 2-valve pushrod cylinder head. Output is [tpl]convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5000 rpm and [tpl]convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3600 rpm. Displacement is [tpl]convert|2189|cc|L cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] with an [tpl]convert|89|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] bore and [tpl]convert|88.00|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] stroke. 2200s were built in Tonawanda, New York. This engine was replaced by the LN2 in September of 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/division/powertrain/products/engine/truckengines/2003/truck_benefits/ln2.doc|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl]
