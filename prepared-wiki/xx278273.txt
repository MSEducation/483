Thomas Kelway (c. 1695 - 1744) was an English organist and composer.

==Career==

He became a chorister in the choir of Chichester Cathedral in 1704 and studied the organ with John Reading and Samuel Peirson. He succeeded Peirson as Organist of Chichester Cathedral in 1720 - however he was placed under probation for a period of 13 years before he was confirmed in the office. Kelway died in office, and left numerous compositions; his service in B minor remains a part of the choir's repertoire.
