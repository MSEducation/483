[[Lysosome]]

CATEGORIES: Vesicles, Cell anatomy

Lysosome (derived from the Greek words lysis, meaning "to loosen", and soma, "body") is a membrane-bound cell organelle found in animal cells. (They are absent in red blood cells; and fungi have analogous organelles called vacuoles.) They were discovered and named by Belgian biologist Christian de Duve, who eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974. They are structurally and chemically spherical vesicles containing acid hydrolases, which are capable of breaking down virtually all kinds of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and cellular debris. They are known to contain more than fifty different enzymes which are all active at an acidic environment of about pH 5. Thus they act as waste disposal system of the cell by digesting unwanted materials in the cytoplasm, both from outside of the cell and obsolete components inside the cell. For this function they are popularly referred to as "suicide bags" or "suicide sacs" of the cell. Further, lysosomes are responsible for cellular homeostasis for their involvements in secretion, plasma membrane repair, cell signalling and energy metabolism, which are related to health and diseases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Settembre|first=Carmine|coauthors=Fraldi, Alessandro; Medina, Diego L.; Ballabio, Andrea|title=Signals from the lysosome: a control centre for cellular clearance and energy metabolism|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|year=2013|volume=14|issue=5|pages=283–296|doi=10.1038/nrm3565|pmid=23609508[/tpl] Depending on their functional activity their sizes can be very different, as the biggest ones can be more than 10 times the smallest ones.[tpl]cite book|editor=Saftig, Paul|author=Lüllmann-Rauch, Renate|chapter=History and morphology of lysosome|title=Lysosomes|year=2005|publisher=Landes Bioscience/Eurekah.com|location=Georgetown, Tex.|isbn=9780387289571|pages=1–16|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=mTgNUPS5tcUC&dq|edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl]
Enzymes of the lysosomes are synthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymes are released from Golgi apparatus in small vesicles which ultimately fuse with acidic vesicles called endosomes, thus becoming full lysosomes. In the process the enzymes are specifically tagged with mannose 6-phosphate to differentiate them from other enzymes. Lysosomes are interlinked with three intracellular processes namely phagocytosis, endocytosis and autophagy. Extracellular materials such as microorganisms taken up by phagocytosis, macromolecules by endocytosis, and unwanted cell organelles are fused with lysosomes in which they are broken down to their basic molecules. Thus lysosomes are the recycling units of a cell.[tpl]cite journal|last=Appelqvist|first=H.|coauthors=Waster, P.; Kagedal, K.; Ollinger, K.|title=The lysosome: from waste bag to potential therapeutic target|journal=Journal of Molecular Cell Biology|year=2013|volume=5|issue=4|pages=214–226|doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjt022|pmid=23918283[/tpl]
Synthesis of lysosomal enzymes are controlled by nuclear genes. Mutations in the genes for these enzymes are responsible for more than 30 different human genetic diseases, which are collectively known as lysosomal storage diseases. These diseases are due to deficiency in a single lysosomal enzyme that prevent break down of target molecules, and consequently undegraded materials accumulate within the lysosomes often giving rise to severe clinical symptoms. Further, these genetic defects are related to several neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and ageing-related diseases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Platt|first=F.

==Discovery==

Christian de Duve, then chairman of the Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, had been studying the mechanism of action of a pancreatic hormone insulin in liver cells. By 1949 he and his team had focused on the enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase, which is the first crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism and the target of insulin. They already suspected that this enzyme played a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. However, even after a series of experiments, they failed to purify and isolate the enzyme from the cellular extracts. Therefore they tried a more arduous procedure of cell fractionation, by which cellular components are separated based on their sizes using centrifugation. They succeeded in detecting the enzyme activity from the microsomal fraction. This was the crucial step in the serendipitous discovery. To estimate the enzyme activity, they used that of standardised enzyme acid phosphatase, and found that the activity was quite low (10% of the expected value). One day, the enzyme activity of purified cell fractions which had been refrigerated for five days was measured. Surprisingly the enzyme activity was increased to normal of that of the fresh sample. The result was the same no matter how many times they repeated the estimation. This led to the conclusion that a membrane-like barrier limited the accessibility of the enzyme to its substrate, so that the enzymes were able to diffuse after a few days. They described the membrane-like barrier as a "saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase."[tpl]cite journal |author= Susana Castro-Obregon|year= 2010 |title= The Discovery of Lysosomes and Autophagy |url= http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-discovery-of-lysosomes-and-autophagy-14199828|journal= Nature Education |volume=3 |issue= 9 | pages=49 [/tpl] It became obvious that an unrelated enzyme from the cell fraction came from a membranous fractions which were definitely cell organelles, and in 1955 De Duve named them "lysosomes" to reflect their digestive properties.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=16136179 |year=2005 |last1=De Duve |first1=C |title=The lysosome turns fifty |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=847–9 |doi=10.1038/ncb0905-847 |journal=Nature cell biology[/tpl] That same year, Alex B. Novikoff from the University of Vermont visited de Duve´s laboratory, and successfully obtained the first electron micrographs of the new organelle. Using a staining method for acid phosphatase, de Duve and Novikoff confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes using light and electron microscopic studies.[tpl]cite journal |pmid= 13357540 |year= 1956 |last1= Novikoff |first1= AB |last2= Beaufay |first2= H |last3= De Duve |first3= C |title= Electron microscopy of lysosomerich fractions from rat liver |volume= 2 |issue= 4 Suppl |pages= 179–84 |pmc= 2229688 |journal= The Journal of biophysical and biochemical cytology |doi= 10.1083/jcb.2.4.179[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid= 18567941 |year= 2008 |last1= Klionsky |first1= DJ |title= Autophagy revisited: A conversation with Christian de Duve |volume= 4 |issue= 6 |pages= 740–3 |journal= Autophagy[/tpl] de Duve won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for this discovery.

==Function and structure==

Lysosomes are cellular organelles that contain acid hydrolase enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris. They can be described as the stomach of the cell. Lysosomes digest excess or worn-out organelles, food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria. The membrane around a lysosome allows the digestive enzymes to work at the pH they require. Lysosomes fuse with autophagic vacuoles (phagosomes) and dispense their enzymes into the autophagic vacuoles, digesting their contents. They are frequently nicknamed "suicide bags" or "suicide sacs" by cell biologists due to their autolysis.
The size of lysosomes varies from 0.1–1.2 μm.[tpl]cite book | last=Kuehnel | first=W | title=Color Atlas of Cytology, Histology, & Microscopic Anatomy | publisher=Thieme | year=2003 | edition=4th | pages=34 | isbn=1-58890-175-0 [/tpl] At pH 4.8, the interior of the lysosomes is acidic compared to the slightly basic cytosol (pH 7.2). The lysosome maintains this pH differential by pumping protons (H+ ions) from the cytosol across the membrane via proton pumps and chloride ion channels. Vacuolar H+-ATPases are responsible for transport of protons, while the counter transport of chloride ions is performed by ClC-7 Cl-/H+ antiporter. In this way a steady acidic environment is maintained.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mindell|first=Joseph A.|title=Lysosomal acidification mechanisms|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=69–86|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142317|pmid=22335796[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Ishida|first=Y.|coauthors=Nayak, S.; Mindell, J. A.; Grabe, M.|title=A model of lysosomal pH regulation|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|year=2013|volume=141|issue=6|pages=705–720|doi=10.1085/jgp.201210930|pmid=23712550| pmc=3664703 [/tpl] The lysosomal membrane protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The cell is additionally protected from any lysosomal acid hydrolases that drain into the cytosol, as these enzymes are pH-sensitive and do not function well or at all in the alkaline environment of the cytosol. This ensures that cytosolic molecules and organelles are not destroyed in case there is leakage of the hydrolytic enzymes from the lysosome.

==Formation==

Many components of animal cells are recycled by transferring them inside or embedded in sections of membrane. For instance, in endocytosis, a portion of the cell’s plasma membrane pinches off to form a vesicle that will eventually fuse with an organelle within the cell. Without active replenishment, the plasma membrane would continuously decrease in size. It is thought that lysosomes participate in this dynamic membrane exchange system and are formed by a gradual maturation process from endosomes.[tpl]cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce et al.|title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-3218-1|edition=4th[/tpl]
The production of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment. Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus. mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol, where they are translated by ribosomes. The nascent peptide chains are translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are modified. Upon exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport, a specific lysosomal tag, mannose 6-phosphate, is added to the peptides. The presence of these tags allow for binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus, a phenomenon that is crucial for proper packaging into vesicles destined for the lysosomal system.[tpl]cite book|last=Lodish|first=Harvey et al.|title=Molecular cell biology|year=2000|publisher=Scientific American Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7167-3136-3|edition=4th[/tpl]
Upon leaving the Golgi apparatus, the lysosomal enzyme-filled vesicle fuses with a late endosome, a relatively acidic organelle with an approximate pH of 5.5. This acidic environment causes dissociation of the lysosomal enzymes from the mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The enzymes are packed into vesicles for further transport to established lysosomes. The late endosome itself can eventually grow into a mature lysosome, as evidenced by the transport of endosomal membrane components from the lysosomes back to the endosomes.

==Disease==

Lysosomes are responsible for a group of genetically inherited disorders called lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). They are a type of inborn errors of metabolism caused by malfunction of one of the enzymes. The rate of incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5,000 live births, and the true figure expected to be higher as many cases are likely to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The primary cause is deficiency of an acidic hydrolase, while there are conditions of defects in lysosomal membrane proteins that fail to transport the enzyme, or non-enzymatic soluble lysosomal proteins. The initial effect is accumulation of specific macromolecules or monomeric compounds inside the endosomal–autophagic–lysosomal system. This results in abnormal signaling pathways, calcium homeostasis, lipid biosynthesis and degradation and intracellular trafficking, ultimately leading to pathogenetic disorders. The organs most affected are brain, viscera, bone and cartilage.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Mark L.|coauthors=Tecedor, Luis; Chang, Michael; Davidson, Beverly L.|title=Clarifying lysosomal storage diseases|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2011|volume=34|issue=8|pages=401–410|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2011.05.006|pmid=21723623[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Andrew P.|coauthors=Puertollano, Rosa; Raben, Nina; Slaugenhaupt, Susan; Walkley, Steven U.; Ballabio, Andrea|title=Autophagy in lysosomal storage disorders|journal=Autophagy|year=2012|volume=8|issue=5|pages=719–730|doi=10.4161/auto.19469|pmid=22647656[/tpl] There is no direct medical treatment to cure LSDs.[tpl]cite journal|last=Parenti|first=Giancarlo|title=New strategies for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (Review)|journal=International Journal of Molecular Medicine|year=2012|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.3892/ijmm.2012.1187|pmid=23165354[/tpl] The most common LSD is Gaucher's disease, which is due to deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Consequently the enzyme substrate, the fatty acid glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood cells, which in turn affects spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow. The disease is characterized by bruises, fatigue, anaemia, low blood platelets, osteoporosis, and enlargement of the liver and spleen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=Barry E.|coauthors=Weinreb, Neal J.|title=Gaucher Disease: A Comprehensive Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis|year=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=163–175|doi=10.1615/CritRevOncog.2013006060|pmid=23510062[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Sidransky|first=E|title=Gaucher disease: insights from a rare Mendelian disorder.|journal=Discovery Medicine|year=2012|volume=14|issue=77|pages=273–81|pmid=23114583[/tpl]

==Lysosomotropism==

Weak bases with lipophilic properties accumulate in acidic intracellular compartments like lysosomes. While the plasma and lysosomal membranes are permeable for neutral and uncharged species of weak bases, the charged protonated species of weak bases do not permeate biomembranes and accumulate within lysosomes. The concentration within lysosomes may reach levels 100 to 1000 fold higher than extracellular concentrations. This phenomenon is called "lysosomotropism"[tpl]cite journal|pmid= 4606365|year= 1974|last1= De Duve|first1= C|last2= De Barsy|first2= T|last3= Poole|first3= B|last4= Trouet|first4= A|last5= Tulkens|first5= P|last6= Van Hoof|first6= F|title= Commentary.

A significant part of the clinically approved drugs are lipophilic weak bases with lysosomotropic properties. This explains a number of pharmacological properties of these drugs, such as high tissue-to-blood concentration gradients or long tissue elimination half-lifes; these properties have been found for drugs such as haloperidol,[tpl]cite journal|pmid= 10360127|year= 1999|last1= Kornhuber|first1= J|last2= Schultz|first2= A|last3= Wiltfang|first3= J|last4= Meineke|first4= I|last5= Gleiter|first5= CH|last6= Zöchling|first6= R|last7= Boissl|first7= KW|last8= Leblhuber|first8= F|last9= Riederer|first9= P|title= Persistence of haloperidol in human brain tissue|volume= 156|issue= 6|pages= 885–90|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry|display-authors= 9[/tpl] levomepromazine,[tpl]cite journal|pmid= 15997416|year= 2006|last1= Kornhuber|first1= J|last2= Weigmann|first2= H|last3= Röhrich|first3= J|last4= Wiltfang|first4= J|last5= Bleich|first5= S|last6= Meineke|first6= I|last7= Zöchling|first7= R|last8= Härtter|first8= S|last9= Riederer|first9= P|last10= Hiemke|first10= C|title= Region specific distribution of levomepromazine in the human brain|volume= 113|issue= 3|pages= 387–97|doi= 10.1007/s00702-005-0331-3|journal= Journal of Neural Transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)[/tpl] and amantadine.[tpl]cite journal|pmid= 8532138|year= 1995|last1= Kornhuber|first1= J|last2= Quack|first2= G|last3= Danysz|first3= W|last4= Jellinger|first4= K|last5= Danielczyk|first5= W|last6= Gsell|first6= W|last7= Riederer|first7= P|title= Therapeutic brain concentration of the NMDA receptor antagonist amantadine|volume= 34|issue= 7|pages= 713–21|journal= Neuropharmacology|doi=10.1016/0028-3908(95)00056-c[/tpl] However, high tissue concentrations and long elimination half-lives are explained also by lipophilicity and absorption of drugs to fatty tissue structures.

==Controversy in botany==

By scientific convention, the term lysosome is applied to those vesicular organelles only in animals, and vacuoles to plants, fungi and algae. Discoveries in plant cells since the 1970s started to challenge this definition. Plant vacuoles are found to be much more diverse in structure and function than previously thought.[tpl]cite journal|last=Marty|first=Francis|title=Plant Vacuoles|journal=Tha Plant Cell|year=1999|volume=11|issue=4|pages=587–599|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/11/4/587.full|doi=10.2307/3870886[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pmid=16006126 |title=The endocytic network in plants |year=2005 |last1=Šamaj |first1=Jozef |last2=Read |first2=Nick D. |last3=Volkmann |first3=Dieter |last4=Menzel |first4=Diedrik |last5=Baluska |first5=František |journal=Trends in Cell Biology |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=425–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2005.06.006[/tpl] Some vacuoles contain their own hydrolytic enzymes and perform the classic lysosomal activity, which is autophagy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Matile|first=P|title=Biochemistry and Function of Vacuoles|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|year=1978|volume=29|issue=1|pages=193–213|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.29.060178.001205[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Moriyasu|first=Y.|coauthors=Ohsumi, Y.|title=Autophagy in Tobacco Suspension-Cultured Cells in Response to Sucrose Starvation|journal=Plant Physiology|year=1996|volume=111|issue=4|pages=1233–1241|pmid=12226358|pmc=161001[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Jiao|first=B.-B.|coauthors=Wang, J.-J.; Zhu, X.-D.; Zeng, L.-J.; Li, Q.; He, Z.-H.|title=A Novel Protein RLS1 with NB-ARM Domains Is Involved in Chloroplast Degradation during Leaf Senescence in Rice|journal=Molecular Plant|year=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=205–217|doi=10.1093/mp/ssr081|pmid=21980143[/tpl] These vacuoles are therefore seen as fulfilling the role of the animal lysosome. Based on de Duve's description that “only when considered as part of a system involved directly or indirectly in intracellular digestion does the term lysosome describe a physiological unit”, some botanist strongly argued that these vacuoles are lysosomes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sarah J.
