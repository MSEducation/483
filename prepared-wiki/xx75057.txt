Chikungunya (in the Makonde language "that which bends up") virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus, of the genus Alphavirus, that is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying Aedes mosquitoes.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lahariya C, Pradhan SK |title=Emergence of chikungunya virus in Indian subcontinent after 32 years: A review |journal=J Vector Borne Dis |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=151–60 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17175699 |url=http://www.mrcindia.org/journal/issues/434151.pdf[/tpl] There have been recent breakouts of CHIKV associated with severe illness.
CHIKV infection causes an illness with a similar mode of transmission as dengue fever, with an acute febrile phase lasting two to five days, followed by a longer period of joint pains in the extremities. The pain associated with CHIKV infection of the joints may persist for weeks or months, or in some cases years.[tpl]cite journal |author=Powers AM, Logue CH |title=Changing patterns of chikungunya virus: re-emergence of a zoonotic arbovirus |journal=J.

Prevention is via mosquito control and preventing bite by infected mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment with medications used to help with symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==

The incubation period of chikungunya disease ranges from one to twelve days, usually two to three. Its symptoms include a fever up to [tpl]convert|40|°C|°F[/tpl], a petechial or maculopapular rash of the trunk and occasionally the limbs, and arthralgia or arthritis affecting multiple joints.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chhabra M, Mittal V, Bhattacharya D, Rana U, Lal S |title=Chikungunya fever: a re-emerging viral infection |journal=Indian J Med Microbiol |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=5–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18227590 |doi=10.4103/0255-0857.38850[/tpl] Other nonspecific symptoms can include headache, nausea, vomitting, conjunctivitis, slight photophobia and partial loss of taste.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.onlymyhealth.com/after-effects-chikungunya-fever-1300445384 |title=After effects of Chikungunya Fever |author=Vatsal Anand |date=18 March 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-06-29[/tpl] Ocular inflammation from Chikungunya may present as iridocyclitis, and have retinal lesions as well.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mahendradas P, Ranganna SK, Shetty R, et al. |title=Ocular manifestations associated with chikungunya |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=287–91 |date=February 2008 |pmid=17631967 |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2007.03.085[/tpl] Pedal oedema (swelling of legs) is observed in many patients, the cause of which remains obscure as it is not related to any cardiovascular, renal or hepatic abnormalities.
Typically, the fever lasts for two days and then ends abruptly. However, other symptoms—namely joint pain, intense headache, insomnia and an extreme degree of prostration—last for a variable period; usually for about five to seven days. Patients have complained of joint pains for much longer time periods; some as long as two years, depending on their age.[tpl]cite journal |author=Simon F, Parola P, Grandadam M, et al. |title=Chikungunya infection: an emerging rheumatism among travelers returned from Indian Ocean islands. Report of 47 cases |journal=Medicine |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=123–37 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17505252 |doi=10.1097/MD/0b013e31806010a5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Taubitz W, Cramer JP, Kapaun A, et al. |title=Chikungunya fever in travelers: clinical presentation and course |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=e1–4 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17554689 |doi=10.1086/518701[/tpl] Recovery from the disease varies by age.  Younger patients recover within 5 to 15 days; middle-aged patients recover in 1 to 2.5 months.  Recovery is longer for the elderly.  The severity of the disease as well as its duration is less in younger patients and pregnant women.  In pregnant women, no untoward effects are noticed after the infection.

===Chronic disease===

Observations during recent epidemics have suggested chikungunya may cause long-term symptoms following acute infection. Following the La Reunion outbreak in 2006, greater than 50% of subjects over 45 reported long term musculoskeletal pain[tpl]cite journal|last=Gérardin|first=P|coauthors=Fianu, A; Michault, A; Mussard, C; Boussaïd, K; Rollot, O; Grivard, P; Kassab, S; Bouquillard, E; Borgherini, G; Gaüzère, BA; Malvy, D; Bréart, G; Favier, F|title=Predictors of Chikungunya rheumatism: a prognostic survey ancillary to the TELECHIK cohort study.|journal=Arthritis research & therapy|date=Jan 9, 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=R9|pmid=23302155|doi=10.1186/ar4137[/tpl] with up to 60% of patients reporting prolonged arthralgia 3 years following initial infection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schilte|first=C|coauthors=Staikowsky, F; Couderc, T; Madec, Y; Carpentier, F; Kassab, S; Albert, ML; Lecuit, M; Michault, A|title=Chikungunya virus-associated long-term arthralgia: a 36-month prospective longitudinal study.|journal=PLoS neglected tropical diseases|year=2013|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e2137|pmid=23556021|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002137[/tpl]  A study of imported cases in France reported that 59% of patients still suffered from arthralgia two years after acute infection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Larrieu|first=S|coauthors=Pouderoux, N; Pistone, T; Filleul, L; Receveur, MC; Sissoko, D; Ezzedine, K; Malvy, D|title=Factors associated with persistence of arthralgia among Chikungunya virus-infected travellers: report of 42 French cases.|journal=Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology|date=Jan 2010|volume=47|issue=1|pages=85–8|pmid=20004145|doi=10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.014[/tpl] Following a local epidemic of chikungunya in Italy, 66% of patients reported myalgia, arthralgia, or asthenia at one year post acute infection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Moro|first=ML|coauthors=Grilli, E; Corvetta, A; Silvi, G; Angelini, R; Mascella, F; Miserocchi, F; Sambo, P; Finarelli, AC; Sambri, V; Gagliotti, C; Massimiliani, E; Mattivi, A; Pierro, AM; Macini, P; Study Group “Infezioni da Chikungunya in, Emilia-Romagna”|title=Long-term chikungunya infection clinical manifestations after an outbreak in Italy: a prognostic cohort study.|journal=The Journal of infection|date=Aug 2012|volume=65|issue=2|pages=165–72|pmid=22522292|doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2012.04.005[/tpl] Long-term symptoms are not an entirely new observation; long-term arthritis was observed following an outbreak in 1979.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fourie|first=ED|author2=Morrison, JG|title=Rheumatoid arthritic syndrome after chikungunya fever.|journal=South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde|date=Jul 28, 1979|volume=56|issue=4|pages=130–2|pmid=494034[/tpl] Common predictors of prolonged symptoms are increased age and prior rheumatalogical disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sissoko|first=D|coauthors=Malvy, D; Ezzedine, K; Renault, P; Moscetti, F; Ledrans, M; Pierre, V|title=Post-epidemic Chikungunya disease on Reunion Island: course of rheumatic manifestations and associated factors over a 15-month period.|journal=PLoS neglected tropical diseases|year=2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=e389|pmid=19274071|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000389[/tpl] The cause of these chronic symptoms is currently not fully known.

==Virology==

Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus with a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 11.6kb. It is a member of the Semliki Forest Virus complex and is closely related to Ross River Virus, O’Nyong Nyong virus and Semliki Forest Virus.[tpl]cite journal|last=Powers|first=AM|coauthors=Brault, AC; Shirako, Y; Strauss, EG; Kang, W; Strauss, JH; Weaver, SC|title=Evolutionary relationships and systematics of the alphaviruses.|journal=Journal of Virology|date=Nov 2001|volume=75|issue=21|pages=10118–31|pmid=11581380|doi=10.1128/JVI.75.21.10118-10131.2001|pmc=114586[/tpl]  In the United States it is classified as a Category C priority pathogen[tpl]cite web|title=NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens|url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/biodefenserelated/biodefense/pages/cata.aspx|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl]  and work requires Biosafety Level III precautions.[tpl]cite web|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition|url=http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL5_sect_VIII_f.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl]
Human epithelial, endothelial, primary fibroblasts and monocyte-derived macrophages are permissive for chikungunya virus in vitro and viral replication is highly cytopathic but susceptible to type I and II interferon.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sourisseau|first=M|coauthors=Schilte, C; Casartelli, N; Trouillet, C; Guivel-Benhassine, F; Rudnicka, D; Sol-Foulon, N; Le Roux, K; Prevost, MC; Fsihi, H; Frenkiel, MP; Blanchet, F; Afonso, PV; Ceccaldi, PE; Ozden, S; Gessain, A; Schuffenecker, I; Verhasselt, B; Zamborlini, A; Saïb, A; Rey, FA; Arenzana-Seisdedos, F; Desprès, P; Michault, A; Albert, ML; Schwartz, O|title=Characterization of reemerging chikungunya virus.|journal=PLoS Pathogens|date=Jun 2007|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e89|pmid=17604450|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030089|pmc=1904475[/tpl] In vivo, chikungunya virus appears to replicate in fibroblasts, skeletal muscle progenitor cells and myofibers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schilte|first=C|coauthors=Couderc, T; Chretien, F; Sourisseau, M; Gangneux, N; Guivel-Benhassine, F; Kraxner, A; Tschopp, J; Higgs, S; Michault, A; Arenzana-Seisdedos, F; Colonna, M; Peduto, L; Schwartz, O; Lecuit, M; Albert, ML|title=Type I IFN controls chikungunya virus via its action on nonhematopoietic cells.|journal=The Journal of experimental medicine|date=Feb 15, 2010|volume=207|issue=2|pages=429–42|pmid=20123960|doi=10.1084/jem.20090851|pmc=2822618[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Rohatgi|first=A|coauthors=Corbo, JC; Monte, K; Higgs, S; Vanlandingham, DL; Kardon, G; Lenschow, DJ|title=Infection of myofibers contributes to the increased pathogenicity during infection with an epidemic strain of Chikungunya Virus.|journal=Journal of Virology|date=Dec 11, 2013|pmid=24335291|doi=10.1128/JVI.02716-13|volume=88|issue=5|pages=2414–25[/tpl]

===Type 1 interferon===

Upon infection with chikungunya, the host's fibroblasts will produce type 1 (alpha and beta) interferon.[tpl]cite journal|author=Schilte C, Couderc T, Chretien F, et al. |title=Type I IFN controls chikungunya virus via its action on nonhematopoietic cells |journal=J. Exp. Med.|volume=207 |issue=2 |pages=429–42 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20123960 |pmc=2822618|doi=10.1084/jem.20090851[/tpl]  Mice that lack the interferon alpha receptor die in 2–3 days upon being exposed to 102 chikungunya PFU, while wild type mice survive even when exposed to as much as 106 PFU of the virus. 
At the same time, mice that are partially type 1 deficient (IFN α/β +/−) are mildly affected and experience symptoms such as muscle weakness and lethargy.[tpl]cite journal|author=Couderc T, Chrétien F, Schilte C, et al. |title=A mouse model for Chikungunya: young age and inefficient type-I interferon signaling are risk factors for severe disease|journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e29 |date=February 2008|pmid=18282093 |pmc=2242832 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0040029[/tpl] Partidos et al. 2011 saw similar results with the live attenuated strain CHIKV181/25. However, rather than dying, the type 1 interferon deficient (IFN α/β −/−) mice were temporarily disabled and the partially type 1 interferon deficient mice did not have any problems.[tpl]cite journal |author=Partidos CD, Weger J, Brewoo J, et al. |title=Probing the attenuation and protective efficacy of a candidate chikungunya virus vaccine in mice with compromised interferon (IFN) signaling |journal=Vaccine |volume=29 |issue=16|pages=3067–73 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21300099 |pmc=3081687|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.01.076[/tpl]
Several studies have attempted to find the upstream components of the type 1 interferon pathway involved in the host's response to chikungunya infection. So far, no one knows the chikungunya specific pathogen associated molecular pattern.[tpl]cite journal |author=White LK, Sali T, Alvarado D, et al. |title=Chikungunya virus induces IPS-1-dependent innate immune activation and protein kinase R-independent translational shutoff |journal=J. Virol. |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=606–20 |date=January 2011|pmid=20962078 |pmc=3014158 |doi=10.1128/JVI.00767-10[/tpl] Nonetheless, IPS-1—also known as Cardif, MAVS, and VISA—has been found to be an important factor. In 2011, White et al. found that interfering with IPS-1 decreased the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of IFN-β. Other studies have found that IRF3 and IRF7 are important in an age-dependent manner. Adult mice that lack both of these regulatory factors die upon infection with chikungunya.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rudd PA, Wilson J, Gardner J, et al. |title=Interferon response factors 3 and 7 protect against Chikungunya virus hemorrhagic fever and shock|journal=J.

Chikungunya counters the Type I interferon response by producing NS2, a non-structural protein that degrades Rpb and turns off the host cell's ability to transcribe DNA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Akhrymuk I, Kulemzin SV, Frolova EI |title=Evasion of the innate immune response: the Old World alphavirus nsP2 protein induces rapid degradation of Rpb1, a catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==

Common laboratory tests for chikungunya include RT-PCR, virus isolation, and serological tests.

==Prevention==

The most effective means of prevention are protection against contact with the disease-carrying mosquitoes and mosquito control. These include using insect repellents with substances such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide; also known as N,N'-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide or NNDB), icaridin (also known as picaridin and KBR3023), PMD (p-menthane-3,8-diol, a substance derived from the lemon eucalyptus tree), or IR3535. Wearing bite-proof long sleeves and trousers (pants) also offers protection.
In addition, garments can be treated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides that often has repellent properties. Vaporized pyrethroids (for example in mosquito coils) are also insect repellents. Securing screens on windows and doors will help to keep mosquitoes out of the house. In the case of the day-active Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, however, this will have only a limited effect, since many contacts between the mosquitoes and humans occur outside.

===Vaccine===

There are currently no approved vaccines available. A phase II vaccine trial, used a live, attenuated virus, developing viral resistance in 98% of those tested after 28 days and 85% still showed resistance after one year.[tpl]cite journal |author=Edelman R, Tacket CO, Wasserman SS, Bodison SA, Perry JG, Mangiafico JA |title=Phase II safety and immunogenicity study of live chikungunya virus vaccine TSI-GSD-218 |journal=Am.

==Treatment==

Currently there is no specific treatment.[tpl]cite journal|last=Caglioti|first=C|coauthors=Lalle, E; Castilletti, C; Carletti, F; Capobianchi, MR; Bordi, L|title=Chikungunya virus infection: an overview.|journal=The new microbiologica|date=Jul 2013|volume=36|issue=3|pages=211–27|pmid=23912863[/tpl] Efforts to improve the symptoms include the use of NSAIDs such as naproxen, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and fluids. Aspirin is not recommended.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/chikungunya_fever/basic_facts/pages/factsheet_health_professionals.aspx|title=Chikungunya—Fact sheet|accessdate=2013-12-17|publisher=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)|date=[/tpl]

===Chronic arthritis===

In those who have more than two weeks of arthritis, ribavirin may be useful. The effect of chloroquine is not clear. It does not appear to help acute disease but there is tentative evidence that it might help the chronic arthritis. Steroids do not appear useful either.

Chikungunya is generally spread through bites from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, but recent research by the Pasteur Institute in Paris has suggested chikungunya virus strains in the 2005-2006 Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus).[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin E |title=EPIDEMIOLOGY: Tropical Disease Follows Mosquitoes to Europe |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |page=1485 |year=2007 |pmid=17872417 |doi=10.1126/science.317.5844.1485a[/tpl]
Concurrent studies by arbovirologists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, confirmed definitively that enhanced chikungunya virus infection of A. albopictus was caused by a point mutation in one of the viral envelope genes (E1).[tpl]cite journal |author=Tsetsarkin KA, Vanlandingham DL, McGee CE, Higgs S |title=A Single Mutation in Chikungunya Virus Affects Vector Specificity and Epidemic Potential |journal=PLoS Pathog |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e201 |year=2007 |pmid=18069894 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030201 |pmc=2134949[/tpl]ProMED-mail (2007) Chikungunya virus: genetic change.

In Africa, chikungunya is spread via a sylvatic cycle in which the virus largely resides in other primates in between human outbreaks.
On 28 May 2009 in Changwat Trang of Thailand where the virus is endemic, the provincial hospital decided to deliver by Caesarean section a male baby from his chikungunya-infected mother, Khwanruethai Sutmueang, 28, a Trang native, to prevent mother-fetus virus transmission. However, after delivering the baby, the physicians discovered the baby was already infected with the virus, and put him into intensive care because the infection had left the baby unable to breathe by himself or to drink milk. The physicians presumed the virus might be able to be transmitted from a mother to her fetus, but without laboratory confirmation.T Rath (2009).

==History==

The word chikungunya is thought to derive from a description in the Makonde language, meaning "that which bends up", of the contorted posture  of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain and arthritic symptoms associated with this disease.[tpl]cite journal |title=Chikungunya fever diagnosed among international travelers—United States, 2005–2006 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=55 |issue=38 |pages=1040–2 |date=29 September 2006 |pmid=17008866 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5538a2.htm |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[/tpl] The disease was first described by Marion Robinson[tpl]cite journal |author=Robinson MC |title=An epidemic of virus disease in Southern Province, Tanganyika Territory, in 1952-53. I. Clinical features |journal=Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |year=1955 |pmid=14373834|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(55)90080-8[/tpl] and W.H.R. Lumsden[tpl]cite journal |author=Lumsden WH |title=An epidemic of virus disease in Southern Province, Tanganyika Territory, in 1952–53. II. General description and epidemiology |journal=Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=33–57 |year=1955 |pmid=14373835|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(55)90081-X[/tpl] in 1955, following an outbreak in 1952 on the Makonde Plateau, along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (the mainland part of modern day Tanzania).
According to the initial 1955 report about the epidemiology of the disease, the term chikungunya is derived from the Makonde root verb kungunyala, meaning to dry up or become contorted.  In concurrent research, Robinson glossed the Makonde term more specifically as "that which bends up". Subsequent authors apparently overlooked the references to the Makonde language and assumed the term derived from Swahili, the lingua franca of the region.  The erroneous attribution of the term as a Swahili word has been repeated in numerous print sources. Many other erroneous spellings and forms of the term are in common use including "chicken guinea", "chicken gunaya", and "chickengunya".[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Since its discovery in Tanganyika, Africa, in 1952, chikungunya virus outbreaks have occurred occasionally in Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, but recent outbreaks have spread the disease over a wider range.
The first recorded outbreak of this disease may have been in 1779.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carey DE |title=Chikungunya and dengue: a case of mistaken identity? |journal=J Hist Med Allied Sci |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=243–62 |date=July 1971 |pmid=4938938 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/XXVI.3.243[/tpl] This is in agreement with the molecular genetics evidence that suggests it evolved around the year 1700.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cherian SS, Walimbe AM, Jadhav SM, et al. |title=Evolutionary rates and timescale comparison of Chikungunya viruses inferred from the whole genome/E1 gene with special reference to the 2005-07 outbreak in the Indian subcontinent |journal=Infect.
