==Gameplay==

Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2009 makes use of the Wii Balance Board and the Wii Remote in a series of 11 different user-selectable activities with varying intensities (light, medium, and hard) and durations (between 10 and 60 minutes). The game also includes unlockable fitness, diet, and lifestyle tips from Jillian Michaels herself. As with the Wii Fit, players can keep track of their progress over time. Unlike Wii Fit, however, the game features a competitive mode where two players compete simultaneously against one another - with the winner being the one who has burned more calories at the finish.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.majescoentertainment.com/games/display_game.php?PLTFRM=nintendo-wii&GN=jillian-michaels-fitness-ultimatum-2009|title=Jillian Michaels' Fitness Ultimatum 2009|publisher=Majesco|date=2008-09-14|accessdate=2008-10-06[/tpl]
