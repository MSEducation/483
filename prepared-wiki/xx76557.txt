[[Strontium unit]]

CATEGORIES: Units of radiation dose, Strontium

The strontium unit is a unit used to measure the amount of radioactivity from strontium-90, a radionuclide found in nuclear fallout, in a subject's body; as the human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium, incorporating it into the skeleton, its presence is very common. One strontium unit is equal to one picocurie from strontium-90 per gram of calcium (37 becquerels per kilogram) in the subject's skeleton.
The United States National Academy of Sciences holds that the maximum safe measure of strontium-90 in a person is one hundred strontium units (3700 Bq/kg). The average American is estimated to have three to four strontium units.
The strontium unit was formerly known briefly as the sunshine unit,[tpl]cite news|title=Doctor Warns of Atom War Results|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1MFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2gENAAAAIBAJ&pg=4333,3366520&dq=sunshine-units&hl=en|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=Meriden Journal, via Google News|date=3 June 1957[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Electromagnetic Radiation Effects Addressed by Canadian Hospital|url=http://ivn.us/2012/06/24/electromagnetic-radiation-effects-canadian-hospital/|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=IVN.us|date=24 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Project Pluto|url=http://www.merkle.com/pluto/pluto.html|accessdate=23 July 2012[/tpl] a term promoted by the United States Department of Defense until public ridicule brought about its disuse. (Among the sources of this outcry was a George Carlin performance, released on the CD Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics, during a passage on governmental euphemisms for dangerous or unethical activities: "The Pentagon has actually begun measuring nuclear radiation in something they call 'sunshine units'!")
