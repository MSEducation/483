==History==

A Masonic Lodge named Archer No. 157 was established by the Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons of North Carolina on December 6, 1854, at what was then known as Creachville.  In 1865, the lodge building was razed and the charter destroyed by Gen. William T. Sherman's Union army on their way to Raleigh.  The Lodge received a new charter after the war, but a clerical error resulted in a misnumeration, and it was designated Archer Lodge No. 165.http://www.archerlodge.org/History/ABridgeToTheGoodLife.pdf
The community has had several Post Offices over the years.  The first was called Creachville, and it existed from 1851−1866.  This was followed by Archer Lodge (1877–1896). Finally, it was known as Archer, from 1896−1912.  After 1912, the area was covered by either the Clayton or Wendell Post Offices.Notification Service | Post Offices

The building that used to be the boarding house for the teachers at Archer Lodge School still stands next to the ball park and is being used as a private residence.  White Oak Baptist Church stands at the heart of the community.  The church used to be known as the Archer Lodge Missionary Baptist Church, but changed its name when it moved to its current location under a stand of white oak trees.
