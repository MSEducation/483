Ben Kennedy (born 14 February 1987 in Newcastle, Australia) is a football (soccer) player goalkeeper who plays for the Newcastle United Jets in the A-League.

==Biography==

Kennedy was a train-on player for the Jets, but was brought into the full squad for the 2006/07 Hyundai A-League season. Until half-way through the 2006-2007 A-League season, Newcastle only had the inexperienced Ben Kennedy as a registered goalkeeper in their squad, until former Socceroo Ante Covic joined the squad.
Kennedy became the Jets first-choice goalkeeper for the 2009-10 A-League season thanks to some strong performances in the 2009 AFC Champions League, after the departure of Ante Covic to Sweden. However, he was criticised by his coach Branko Čulina for poor performances during the season and making mistakes that cost the Jets vital points.[tpl]cite web|last=Leeson |first=Josh |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/branko-cranks-up-the-heat-on-jets/1653698.aspx |title=Branko cranks up the heat on Jets | Newcastle Herald |publisher=Theherald.com.au |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Leeson |first=Josh |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/culina-lays-blame-on-kennedy-for-lost-points/1652484.aspx |title=Culina lays blame on Kennedy for lost points | Newcastle Herald |publisher=Theherald.com.au |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl]
He was replaced as Newcastle's first choice keeper by Neil Young, due to impressive performances by the 30-year-old. Young was injured when he broke his nose and Kennedy came back into the team. Kennedy was the hero in the match against Gold Coast United, making crucial saves throughout the game and saving two penalties, in a game that Newcastle won 6-5.[tpl]cite web|last=Gardiner |first=James |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/man-of-the-moment-kennedy-keeping-focused-on-next-goal/1757010.aspx |title=Man of the moment Kennedy keeping focused on next goal | Newcastle Herald |publisher=Theherald.com.au |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=By  Sportal Australia |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/News/122990,kennedy-the-penalty-hero.aspx |title=Kennedy The Penalty Hero - Australia News - Australian FourFourTwo - The Ultimate Football Website |publisher=Au.fourfourtwo.com |date=2010-02-20 |accessdate=2013-09-03[/tpl]
