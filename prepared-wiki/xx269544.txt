==Synopsis==

Kay Stanton (Jean Seberg) lives on the French Riviera with her psychiatrist husband Neil Stanton (Arthur Hill) and son Tommy (Peter Robbins). One day while Neil is away, Kay meets an American naval ensign, Mark (Sean Garrison), and they begin an affair. Kay realises she does love her husband and tries to break off the relationship. She and Mark argue, and Kay accidentally shoots him. With the help of her friend Daphne (Honor Blackman), she dumps his body into a ravine, then calls the police anonymously to tell them of its location. 
Later, Neil gets a request from the police to help an amnesiac victim recovering from a gunshot wound; the man is Mark. Mark manages to regain his memory but does not betray Kay. Neil realises the truth as well, but is certain that his wife really loves him.
