[[Aussa Sultanate]]

CATEGORIES: Afar people, History of Ethiopia, Sultanates

The Aussa Sultanate (alternate spelling: Awsa or Assaw) (r. 1734-present), also known as the Afar Sultanate, was a kingdom that existed in eastern Ethiopia in the area bordering Eritrea and Djibouti. It was considered to be the leading monarchy of the Afar people, to whom the other Afar rulers nominally acknowledged primacy. 

==History==

Afar society has traditionally been divided into independent kingdoms, each ruled by its own Sultan.Matt Phillips, Jean-Bernard Carillet, Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea, (Lonely Planet: 2006), p.301.
The Aussa Sultanate succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne.Abir, p. 23 n.1.
In 1734, the Afar leader Kedafu, head of the Mudaito clan, seized power and established the Mudaito Dynasty.Abir, pp. 23-26.[tpl]cite book|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|title=The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century|year=1997|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=0932415199|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=MQ1CH3-RMe0C&pg=PA391&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] This marked the start of a new and more sophisticated polity that would last into the colonial period. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.Trimingham, p. 262.
After 15 years of rule, Kedafu's son, Muhammäd Kedafu, succeeded him as Sultan. Muhammäd Kedafu three decades later bequeathed the throne to his own son, Ijdahis, who in turn would reign for another twenty-two years. According to Richard Pankhurst, these relatively long periods of rule by modern standards pointed to a certain degree of political stability within the state.[tpl]cite book|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|title=The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century|year=1997|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=0932415199|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=MQ1CH3-RMe0C&pg=PA391&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Sultan Mahammad ibn Hanfadhe defeated and killed Werner Munzinger in 1875, who was leading an Egyptian army into Ethiopia.Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 90. ISBN 0-19-285061-X. In 1865, the newly unified Italy bought Asseb from a local Sultan (which became the colony of Eritrea in 1890), and led Sultan Mahammad to sign several treaties with that country. As a result, the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II stationed an army near Aussa to "make sure the Sultan of Awsa would not honor his promise of full cooperation with Italy" during the First Italo–Ethiopian War.Chris Proutky, Empress Taytu and Menilek II (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 143. ISBN 0-932415-11-3.
During the Second Italian-Ethiopian War, the Sultan Mahammad Yayyo again agreed to cooperate with the Italian invaders.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (Brooklyn: Olive Branch Press, 2003), p. 111. As a result, in 1943 the reinstalled Ethiopian government sent a military expedition that captured Sultan Muhammad, and made one of his relatives Sultan.Trimingham, p. 172.
Until his death in April 2011, the most recent Sultan of the Afars was Alimirah Hanfere. He was exiled to Saudi Arabia in 1975, but returned after the fall of the Derg regime in 1991.
