Nairobi [tpl]IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|r|oʊ|b|i[/tpl] is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The city and its surrounding area also form the Nairobi County. The name "Nairobi" comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nyrobi, which translates to "cold water". The phrase is also the Maasai name of the Nairobi river, which in turn lent its name to the city. However, it is popularly known as the "Green City in the Sun" and is surrounded by several expanding villa suburbs.[tpl]cite web |last=Pulse Africa|title=Not to be Missed: Nairobi 'Green City in the Sun' |publisher=pulseafrica.com |date= |url=http://www.pulseafrica.com/Highlights_1110000000_1_Nairobi+Green+City+In+The+Sun.htm |accessdate=2007-06-14[/tpl] Inhabitants of Nairobi are called Nairobians, and the city is governed by the County Government of Nairobi, whose current governor is Evans Kidero.

==History==

The area was essentially uninhabited swamp until a supply depot of the Uganda Railway was built in 1899, which soon became the railway's headquarters. The city was named after a water hole known in Maasai as Enkare Nairobi, meaning "place of cool waters". It was completely rebuilt in the early 1900s after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town. The location of the Nairobi railway camp was chosen due to its central position between Mombasa and Kampala. It was also chosen because its network of rivers could supply the camp with water and its elevation would make it cool enough for residential purposes.[tpl]cite web |last=United Nations University|title=Nairobi: National capital and regional hub |publisher=unu.edu |date= |url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu26ue/uu26ue0o.htm |accessdate=2007-06-17[/tpl] However, malaria was a serious problem, leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/all/5592863/the-inconvenient-truth-about-malaria.thtml |title=The inconvenient truth about malaria |author=Paul Reiter |work=Spectator |date=5 December 2009[/tpl]
