[[Old Order German Baptist Brethren]]

CATEGORIES: Anabaptist denominations established in the 20th century, Religious organizations established in 1921

The Old Order German Baptist Brethren are a small group of Schwarzenau Brethren that split from the Old German Baptist Brethren (OGBB) in 1921, when members of the latter began to accept automobiles. Though similar to the OGBB in faith and practice, the Old Order German Baptist Brethren represent those who desired to maintain a strict adherence to tradition, such as the use of horse and buggy for transportation. As of 2000 the group had 125 members and a total population of 281 in 3 congregations in Ohio.Donald B. Kraybill, C. Nelson Hostetter: "Anabaptist World USA", Scottdale PA, 2001, pages 145, 156.
This group should be distinguished from the Old Brethren German Baptists, a similar horse and buggy group that split off from the OGBB in 1939, and has members living near Camden, Indiana and in Missouri.Information from Indiana Old Brethren German Baptists
