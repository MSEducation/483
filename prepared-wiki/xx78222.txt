[[Flag of Lebanon]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Lebanon, Flags of Asia

The flag of Lebanon ([tpl]lang-ar|علم لبنان[/tpl]) is formed of two horizontal red stripes enveloping a horizontal white stripe. The white stripe is to be two times a red one (ratio 1:2:1)—a Spanish fess. The green cedar in the middle touches each of the red stripes and its width is one third of the width of the flag.The description of the flag is cited in the Lebanese Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 5.[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl]

==Symbolism==

It was designed to be a neutral flag, not allied to any one of Lebanon's religious groups. The red stripes symbolize the pure blood shed in the aim of liberation. The white stripe symbolizes peace, and the white snow covering Lebanon's mountains. The green cedar, (Species: Cedrus libani or Lebanon Cedar) symbolizes immortality and steadiness.
This cedar is referenced many times in the Bible: "The righteous flourish like the palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon" (Psalms 92:12).Psalm 92:12 The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He
There is also some reference in W. Smith's 1980 book on the colours: "The red and white colours are those associated, respectively, with the Qaysites and Yemenites, opposing clans that divided Lebanese society between 634 and 1711 AD". However, that explanation is poorly known (not to mention quite unheard of) in the Lebanese tradition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/dday/print?articleId=93896&fullArticle=true&tocId=9093896 |title=Flag of Lebanon|accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl]
It is a common mistake to draw the branches of the cedar and the tree trunk in brown or black which could be seen as unconstitutional. The cedar should be fully green regarding the provisions in the Constitution.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.presidency.gov.lb/presidency/symbols/flag/flag.htm |title=The symbols of the republic|accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=Lebanese Presidency Official Site |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223141711/http://www.presidency.gov.lb/presidency/symbols/flag/flag.htm  |archivedate = 2007-12-23[/tpl]

During the French Mandate of Lebanon, the Lebanese flag was designed by the president of the Lebanese Renaissance Movement, the late Naoum Mukarzel. It was similar to the tricolour flag of France but with a Cedar in the middle.

===Lebanese Republic===

The present Lebanese flag was adopted just prior to independence from France in 1943. Seeking independence, the actual flag was first drawn by member of parliament Henri Pharaon[ref]
