Mellum is an uninhabited island lying southeast of Wangerooge, off the coastal settlements of Horumersiel and Schillig.
Mellum formed as an island off the end of the Butjadingen peninsula – which divides the outflows into the Wadden Sea of the Jade and Weser rivers – only at the end of the nineteenth century.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ecomare.nl/index.php?id=4947&L=2 | title=Mellum | publisher=Ecomare | accessdate=July 21, 2012[/tpl] It is chiefly composed of dunes and tidal marshes. The influence of sea currents and winds is constantly altering the shape and position of the island, which in 2006 had a total surface area of approximately 750 hectares (1853 acres).
An important breeding and feeding ground for wild birds, Mellum is part of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park and a nature protection zone.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nationalpark-wattenmeer.de/nds/natur-und-wissen/lebensraeume/mellum | title=Die Insel Mellum - Paradies zwischen Jade und Weser | publisher=Nationalpark wattenmeer | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 21, 2012 | language = German[/tpl] The islands only house is today used during the summer months for wildlife observation and scientific research purposes only.
