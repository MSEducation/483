[tpl]Nihongo|Iron Chef|料理の鉄人|Ryōri no Tetsujin|literally "Ironmen of Cooking"[/tpl] is a Japanese television cooking show produced by Fuji Television.  The series, which premiered on October 10, 1993, is a stylized cook-off featuring guest chefs challenging one of the show's resident "Iron Chefs" in a timed cooking battle built around a specific theme ingredient. The series ended on September 24, 1999, although occasional specials were produced until 2002. The series aired 309 episodes. Repeats are regularly aired on the Cooking Channel in the United States and on Special Broadcasting Service in Australia. Fuji TV will air a new version of the show, titled Iron Chef (アイアンシェフ), beginning in October 26, 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/fujitv/news/pub_2012/121016-371.html|title=1993年から約10年にわたり、料理の格闘番組として好評を博した『料理の鉄人』。新しい『アイアンシェフ』として凱旋上陸を果たす！！|author=Fuji Television|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=October 16, 2012 |language=Japanese[/tpl]

==Features==

The host is the flamboyant Takeshi Kaga, known on the show as [tpl]Nihongo|Chairman Kaga|鹿賀主宰|Kaga Shusai[/tpl], who is famous for the words from Arthur Rimbaud "If memory serves me right...「私の記憶が確かならば…」"(Jadis) si je me souviens bien..." and "Allez cuisine!" ("Go cook!"). The show has two regular commentators and one or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges). The commentary covers ingredients, history of contenders, and other background information  to give viewers context for what is happening in the kitchen.

===Backstory===

The supposed "story" behind Iron Chef is recounted at the beginning of every episode.  It is said that Kaga had "realised his dream in a form never seen before" and specially constructed a cooking arena called "Kitchen Stadium" in his castle. There, visiting chefs from "around the world" would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire.
The English name Iron Chef comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs at the beginning of the battle. Kaga theatrically announced the start of each battle with Allez, cuisine![tpl]Cite book|title=Iron Chef:The Official Book (Tibetan Edition) |last=Hoketsu |first=Kaoru |coauthors=Fuji Television |year=2000 |publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-425-18088-3 |page=4 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0425194078/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link |accessdate=02-11-2009[/tpl] This expression translates loosely from the French as "Go, cook!"

===United States reception===

While always a success in Japan, Iron Chef became a surprise cult favorite in the United States [tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ | title = Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we’re getting it wrong | publisher = AsianWeek | accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl] when it was picked up by the Food Network and dubbed in English. Part of the U.S. appeal was due to the dubbing, which gave the show a campy charm that evoked English-dubbed Chinese kung fu movies of the 1970s. Audiences also found amusing some of the over-the-top culinary concoctions regularly featured on the show.

====New Iron Chefs====

===Original format===

Originally, challengers vied with each other in preliminary "battles" to earn the right to face an Iron Chef in a 90-minute competition, and should a challenger win twice against Iron Chefs, the challenger would be given the title of "Honorary Iron Chef".  However, this format proved unpopular, the preliminary round was scrapped and the main contest was reduced to the now familiar 60 minutes. The awarding of honorary Iron Chef titles to challengers was also discontinued (although this was largely a moot point as few challengers ever defeated two Iron Chefs in separate contests), but was given as an emeritus title for a retiring Iron Chef.  Once honorary titles were no longer issued, challengers who beat an Iron Chef had to settle for, according to the English version's introduction, "the people's ovation and fame forever".
In each episode, chefs have one hour to cook and improvise a multi-course meal around a theme ingredient that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the chefs are given a short list of possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed.  Judges' primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to "best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient". In rare cases, the format changed—angler fish battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and noodle battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger's dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.

===Theme ingredients===

Featured ingredients tend toward the exotic and expensive. Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese origin of the show—river eel, tofu, udon—though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as bell peppers, summer corn, and peaches, are spotlighted as well. In one episode devoted to asparagus, the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of lobster (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto.
Initially, a minimum of three dishes were to be prepared, although some challengers have finished only a single dish; four is the typical number. The record for highest number of dishes prepared for a battle was eight, first set by challenger Kenji Kaji against Iron Chef Michiba in "Battle Umeboshi".  Five (later six) servings of each dish are prepared: one each for the Chairman and judges, and one for photography and presentation.

===Assistant chefs===

Each chef is also given two assistants, who are supposedly students of Kaga's "Gourmet Academy" (in reality, they are students of  Hattori Nutrition College).  If the challenger does not speak Japanese, students who can speak in the challenger's native language are sometimes provided. In a notable exception, San Francisco chef Ron Siegel struggled with his assistants, who did not speak English. One assistant, Kenichi Miyanaga, became a challenger himself, taking on Iron Chef Morimoto in a sweetfish battle.

===Commentary and judging===

Throughout the cook-off, running commentary is made in a booth near the cooking area by an announcer, Kenji Fukui; a commentator, Yukio Hattori, and one or two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally Shinichiro Ohta) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four and, later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality.  Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with ten given for taste and five each for presentation and originality.  The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef that makes the highest points total.)
Chairman Kaga tastes the dishes along with the judges.  While he occasionally makes comments and seeks input from judges during tasting, he generally does not participate in scoring; he did, however, during the 2000th Dish Battle.  During this episode, a team of French cuisine chefs—captain Hiroyuki Sakai, the original Iron Chef French Yutaka Ishinabe and Etsuo Joh—battled a team of Chinese cuisine chefs composed of captain Chen Kenichi, Sozo Myamoto and Yuji Wakiya.  To break the tie, Chairman Kaga asked them to allow him this one instance of selfishness, and he cast his vote for the French team.

===Ties===

In the case of a deadlock (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate "overtime battle" was held to determine the winner. In overtime the chefs are given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.This occurred during a challenge between Iron Chef Chen Kenichi and French challenger Dominique Corby of the Tour d'Argent in episode #IC1C16, where the main theme was foie gras, and in episode #IC1C17 (overtime), where the theme was asparagus.

==Notable challengers==

==Broadcast history==

The stage setting for the show, [tpl]Nihongo|"Kitchen Stadium"|キッチンスタジアム|Kitchin Sutajiamu[/tpl], the high-quality (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga's extravagant costumes required the show to have a budget far higher than that of most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of foie gras, 54 sea breams, 827 Ise shrimp, 964 matsutake mushrooms, 4,593 eggs, 1,489 truffles, 4,651 grams of caviar, and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to ¥843,354,407Foreword by Takeshi Kaga, "Iron Chef:The Official Book" (Kaoru Hoketsu, translator) (Berkley Books, 2001) (or about $7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle Swallow's Nest, which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.
For the show's grand finale, the Iron Chefs faced off against each other with the winner to face French chef Alain Passard, owner of Michelin three-star restaurant L’Arpege, with the winner dubbed the "King of Iron Chefs".
In the first round, Iron Chef Chinese Chen defeated Iron Chef Italian Kobe in Battle Pork (Tokyo X). In the second round Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto in Battle Bell Pepper. In the final match, Sakai defeated Chen in Battle Homard Lobster and was dubbed "King of Iron Chefs."
In the final bonus match in Kitchen Stadium, with all of the current and previous Iron Chefs looking on, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Alain Passard in Battle Long-Gang Chicken. Thus, Hiroyuki Sakai was dubbed as both "King of Iron Chefs" and "The No. 1 in the World."
There were two reunion specials produced in 2000.  The first was "The Millennium Special"; the second was "New York Special", staged in a makeshift Kitchen Stadium at Webster Hall in New York City, and was the first appearance of Bobby Flay.  Another reunion episode of the show (entitled "Iron Chef: 21st Century Battle") was produced and broadcast in 2001.  A final reunion episode was produced and broadcast in 2002, entitled "The Japan Cup".
The show was presented in the United States and Canada on the Food Network, dubbed and/or subtitled into English. It is also actively broadcast on SBS TV in Australia. In the case of SBS this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling. It may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps by the fact that in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed. However, episodes aired since February 2009 have seen the Chairman's voice dubbed rather than subtitled as was the case in previous airings, except when he sends the chefs into battle.
The show is also currently being broadcast on the Finnish channel SubTV, as well as the Swedish channel TV400 (TV4). Iron Chef was also broadcast on Challenge in the UK in 2003 and 2004, as part of its "Japanese Christmas Cracker" and "Japanorama" strands.
The show had again aired in the U.S. on the Fine Living Network from May 5, 2008 until the channel went off the air on May 30, 2010; however, the music from earlier broadcasts, taken from the film Backdraft, had been replaced due to music licensing issues with NBC Universal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] The Cooking Channel picked up the series on June 1, 2010, when it replaced Fine Living.http://www.cookingchanneltv.com  The stations that have carried the series, Fine Living, Cooking Channel and Food Network, are all owned by Scripps Networks Interactive.

==International editions==

===Iron Chef USA===

The U.S. UPN network presented two one-hour episodes of Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, perhaps because the show focused little on cooking—a major part of the Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.

===Iron Chef America===

In 2004, Food Network announced that they would show an Iron Chef special, called "Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters", featuring Sakai and Morimoto dueling with American Iron Chefs Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, and Wolfgang Puck, all Food Network personalities and renowned American celebrity chefs. (Morimoto and Flay battled in two previous Iron Chef specials that were made after the original series aired.) The specials featured Alton Brown as the announcer and Mark Dacascos playing the role of The Chairman (in the storyline, this Chairman is the nephew of Takeshi Kaga).
The show received high ratings and rave reviews and in October 2004, Food Network began taping weekly episodes that premiered starting in January 2005.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]  Some changes were made to the show, most notably replacing Puck with Morimoto as an Iron Chef (a fourth, Cat Cora, was added later), and the location was moved from Los Angeles to New York City. The fifth Iron Chef, Michael Symon, was added for his win in The Next Iron Chef. In 2009, Chef Jose Garces became the sixth Iron Chef following his victory in the second season of The Next Iron Chef. In 2010, Chef Marc Forgione won the third season of The Next Iron Chef, becoming the seventh Iron Chef on Iron Chef America.  Chef Geoffrey Zakarian won The Next Iron Chef's fourth season in 2011, making him the eighth Iron Chef. In 2012, Chef Alexandra Guarnaschelli became the ninth and most recent Iron Chef after winning the fifth season of The Next Iron Chef.
Even though both Todd English and Kerry Simon from Iron Chef USA have competed on Iron Chef America, there has been no mention of their ICU tenure.

===Krav Sakinim===

In 2007, Krav Sakinim ([tpl]lang-he|קרב סכינים[/tpl], Knives Fight), a show based on Iron Chef, began airing on Israel's Channel 10. Each episode features a different prominent Israeli chef, who competes against one of the show's featured foreign chefs. All Israeli winners compete against one another in the finals and the winner competes against a foreign chef for the title of season champion. Season 1 featured only French chef Stéphane Froidevaux, who won the season's finale, while season 2 saw the inclusion of Italian chef Alfredo Russo,One dish too many, Haaretz, Retrieved March 19, 2008 meaning both Michelin star holders would have to compete against each other for a spot in the final bout. The show is actively hosted by actor Oded Menashe and the regular commentators are chef Yaron Kastenboim and catering company owner Ran Shmueli. While in season 1, the panel of judges was made up mostly of celebrities from the entertainment industry, season 2 features renowned persons from the culinary industry, such as restaurant critics and chefs. The competitors prepare a three-course meal, with each dish given a score of up to 10 points by each member of the panel and commentators, accumulating up to 150 points per chef (compared to 90 points in season 1, where the commentators had relatively more points to give).

===Iron Chef UK===

In 2010, UK public television network Channel 4 debuted Iron Chef UK, based on Iron Chef. The show airs five days a week, and is hosted by Olly Smith and Nick Nairn.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/apr/26/iron-chef-uk-review|title=Iron Chef UK|last=Wollaston|first=Sam |date=2010-04-27|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl] The four Iron Chefs are Tom Aikens, Martin Blunos, Sanjay Dwivedi and Judy Joo.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/tv/todays-tv/2010/04/26/iron-chef-uk-115875-22212037/|title=Iron Chef UK|last=Simon|first=Jane |date=2010-04-26|publisher=The Daily Mirror|accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl] Like the original Iron Chef, the competitions are held in Kitchen Stadium and presided over by The Chairman. Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses. Two challengers prepare the appetizer, producing one appetizer each, while the Iron Chef prepares two. These are judged, and the standing for the team versus the Iron Chef are announced. Then the second half begins: the challenging team and the Iron Chef return to the kitchen to prepare the main course. The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced.  The challengers with the best dish returns on Friday to compete against the best Iron Chef of the week.

===Iron Chef Australia===

The Seven Network announced in August 2010 that an Australian version was planned, in part to capitalize on the success of the highly popular MasterChef Australia.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/tv/iron-chef-australia-to-take-on-masterchef/story-e6freqj6-1225907013229|title=Iron Chef Australia to take on MasterChef|publisher=The Courier-Mail|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010[/tpl]
The Australian Iron Chefs were Neil Perry, Guy Grossi and Guillaume Brahimi, while the show features a static judging panel composed of food critics Larissa Dubecki, Simon Thomsen and Leo Schofield. Mark Dacascos reprises his role as The Chairman from Iron Chef America, and the program is hosted by Grant Denyer, with additional commentary provided by Richard Cornish.
Iron Chef Australia began airing on October 19, 2010, attracting an audience of 1.13 million viewers for its first episode.
It was cancelled at the end of its first season.

===Iron Chef Thailand===

On January 25, 2012, the first episode of Iron Chef Thailand broadcast on BBTV channel 7. The chairman is Mr. Santi Sawatwimol. In this version of Iron Chef, there are four Iron Chefs: Chumpol Chaengprai (Thai cuisine); Boontham Pakpo (Japanese cuisine); Pongtawat "Ian" Chareomkittichai (Western cuisine); and Chaitep "Mr. Lee" Pattarapornpaisarn (Chinese cuisine). The program is hosted by Chakrit Yamnarn and the field reporter is DJ Pong (Nattapong Taengkasem). The format is different, in that in the first half of the program, there are three challengers who compete with each other to find out who is the best chef. The winner will compete against the Iron Chef on the second half of the program. This format was used for only 3 episode.
On February 22, 2012 the format of Iron Chef Thailand has been changed to: the first 30 minutes of the program is where the Challenger Chef will present his/her "Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient" to the guests. Then followed by the actual "Iron Chef Battle", similar to Iron Chef Japan where the host will ask the Challenger Chef to select the Iron Chef he/she want to challenge. After the Challenger Chef has selected the Iron Chef the Chairman will reveal the "Secret Ingredient" and once the Chairman says "Allez Cuisine" the battle begins. The battle time is 60 minutes where they will need to complete at least 4 dishes. The order in which Chefs present to the Judges will be determined by a coin toss conducted by the Host. The last 30 minutes of the program is "Cooking with Iron Chef". Guests learn how to cook from the Iron Chef and win the "Best Student" at the end of the program.
On May 9, 2012 Chaitep Pattarapornpaisarn resigned from Iron Chef Chinese cuisine and was replaced by Hing Chung Lai (Peter Lai).
On June 27, 2012 "Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient" became Signature Dish with Special Tests Challenger by variety choice
On December 5, 2012 Three new Iron Chefs have been appointed. They are: Thanarak "Pom" Chuto (Contemporary Chinese); Thanunya "Gai" Wilkinson (Dessert) and Thanintorn "Noom" Chantharawan (Modern Cuisine: Italian Twist).

===Iron Chef Vietnam===

The Vietnamese version is set to air from June 6, 2012 on VTV3. In this version there are only three Iron Chefs namely David Thái, Long Chef and Yu Zhi Da. The ultimate winner will be a 2013 Iron Chef.

===Iron Chef Indonesia (Allez Cuisine)===

The Indonesian adaptation of Iron Chef is called Allez Cuisine, and aired on Indosiar from 1 March 2003 until 12 August 2006. The Kitchen Stadium owner role was played by Derry Drajat, and the main commentator was Gunardjo, an Indonesian food expert. The show featured three Master Chefs or Iron Chefs.
