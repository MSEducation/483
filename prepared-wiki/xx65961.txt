==Other names==

The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran is known by a variety of names including:
Note: The acronyms MEK is used throughout this article, as it is commonly used by the media and national governments around the world to refer to the People's Mujahedin.

==Membership==

The MEK was believed to have a 5,000–7,000-strong armed guerrilla group based in Iraq before the 2003 war, but a membership of between 3,000–5,000 is considered more likely.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2002-03/03rn43.htm|title=Behind the Mujahideen-e-Khalq (MeK)| accessdate = 2007-07-15|publisher=Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Group, Parliament of Australia|year=2003| first =Nigel | last = Brew[/tpl] In 2005 the U.S. think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations believed that the MEK had 10,000 members, one-third to one-half of whom were fighters.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cfr.org/publication/9158/ |title=Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (Iranian rebels)|accessdate = 2006-09-05| publisher =Council on Foreign relations|year=2005[/tpl] According to a 2003 article by the New York Times, the MEK was composed of 5,000 fighters based in Iraq, many of them female.[tpl]cite web | url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/sloth/2003-07-15.html| title= The Cult of Rajavi| first= The New York Times |last=Rubin | first = Elizabeth|accessdate= 2006-04-21[/tpl] A 2013 article in Foreign Policy claimed that there were some 2,900 members in Iraq.[tpl]cite web | url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/thecable/2013/10/30/meet_the_weird_well_connected_ex_terrorists_threatening_our_relationship_with_iraq#.UnF7tJ867nE.twitter| title= Meet The Weird, Super-Connected Group That's Mucking Up U.S. Talks With Iraq| publisher= Foreign Policy |last=Dreazen | first = Yochi|accessdate= 2013-10-31[/tpl]

==History==

===Before the Islamic Revolution===

====Foundation====

The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran was founded in September 5, 1965 by six former members of the Liberation or Freedom Movement of Iran, students at Tehran University, including Mohammad Hanifnejad, Saied Mohsen and Ali-Asghar Badizadegan. The MEK opposed the rule of Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, considering him corrupt and oppressive, and considered the Liberation Movement too moderate and ineffective.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 489[/tpl]  They were committed to the Ali Shariati's approach to Shiism.[tpl]cite web|last=Ostovar|first=Afshon P.|title=Guardians of the Islamic Revolution  Ideology, Politics, and the Development of Military Power in Iran  (1979–2009)|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/64683/afshon_1.pdf;jsessionid=DF7BFA33BF18FF73E9117CB0504F14E1?sequence=1|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=26 July 2013|format=PhD Thesis|year=2009[/tpl] However although the MEK are often regarded as devotees of Ali Shariati, in fact their pronouncements preceded Shariati's, and they continued to echo each other throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1989 | pp = 81–126[/tpl]
In its first five years, the group primarily engaged in ideological work.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1989 | p = 88[/tpl]  Their thinking aligned with what was a common tendency in Iran at the time – a kind of radical, political Islam based on a Marxist reading of history and politics. The group's main source of inspiration was the Islamic text Nahj al-Balagha (a collection of analyses and aphorisms attributed to Imam Ali). Despite some describing a Marxist influence, the group never used the terms "socialist" or "communist" to describe themselves,[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p = 2[/tpl] and always called themselves Muslims – arguing along with Ali Shariati, that a true Muslim – especially a true Shia Muslim, that is to say a devoted follower of the Imams Ali and Hossein – must also by definition, be a revolutionary.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1989 | pp = 81–126[/tpl] However, they generously adopted elements of Marxism in order to update and modernize their interpretation of radical Islam.[ref]Rebels With A Cause: The Failure of the Left in Iran
 By Maziar Behrooz, page vi</ref>
The group kept a friendly relationship with the only other major Iranian urban guerrilla group, the Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas (OIPFG).[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 491[/tpl]

====Schism====

In October 1975, the MEK underwent an ideological split.
While the remaining primary members of MEK were imprisoned, some of the original low-level members of MEK formed a new organization that followed Marxist, not Islamic, ideals; these members appropriated the MEK name to establish and enhance their own legitimacy.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p = 137[/tpl]
This was expressed in a book entitled Manifesto on Ideological Issues, in which the central leadership declared "that after ten years of secret existence, four years of armed struggle, and two years of intense ideological rethinking, they had reached the conclusion that Marxism, not Islam, was the true revolutionary philosophy." Mujtaba Taleqani, son of Ayatallah Taleqani, was one of these converts to Marxism. Thus after May 1975 there were two rival Mujahedin, each with its own publication, its own organization, and its own activities.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | pp = 493–4[/tpl]  A few months before the Iranian Revolution the majority of the Marxist Mujahedin renamed themselves "Peykar", on December 7, 1978 (16 Azar, 1357); the full name is: Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. This name was after the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class", which was a left wing group in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire. It was founded by Lenin in the autumn of 1895.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press (1999), p. 151

====Anti-American campaign====

In the years between 1973 and 1975, MEK intensified its armed operations. In 1973 they bombed ten major buildings including those of the Plan Organization, Pan-American Airlines, Shell Oil Company, Hotel International, and Radio City Cinema. In addition, they assassinated six Americans:[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 141-142[/tpl]
On September 6, 2011, the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) elected Zohreh Akhyani as its new Secretary General for a two-year term.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ncr-iran.org/en/ncri-statements/iran-resistance/11213-MEKmek-abbual-congress-elects-zohreh-akhyani-as-new-secretary-general |title=PMOI (MEK) Annual Congress elects Zohreh Akhyani as new Secretary General|publisher=NCR|date=September 8, 2011| accessdate = 2012-09-29[/tpl] The new Secretary General joined the MEK 32 years ago following the anti-monarchy revolution in Iran in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mojahedin.org/pagesen/detailsNews.aspx?newsid=14188| title = Zohreh Akhyani was elected as the new Secretary General of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran in Annual Congress |publisher=Mojahedin|accessdate= 2012-09-29[/tpl]

===After the Revolution===

The group was the supporter of the revolution at the initial phase.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sreberny-Mohammadi|first=Annabelle|coauthors=Ali Mohammadi|title=Post-Revolutionary Iranian Exiles: A Study in Impotence|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=January 1987|volume=9|issue=1|pages=108–129|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3991849[/tpl] It participated in the referendum held in March 1979. Its candidate for the head of the newly founded council of experts was Masoud Rajavi in the election of August 1979. However, he lost the election. The group also supported for the occupation the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979. In January 1980, Rajavi announced his candidacy for the presidency, but he was banned, since he was regarded by Ayatollah Khomeini as ineligible. In February 1980, concentrated attacks by hezbollahi toughs began on the meeting places, bookstores, newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists driving the left underground in Iran. Hundreds of PMOI supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested. Ultimately, the organization called for a massive demonstration under the banner of Islam on June 20, 1981 to protest Iran's new leadership which was also attacked.

===Ideology===

====Before 1979 Iranian Revolution====

The MEK's ideology of revolutionary Shiaism is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of Ali Shariati that "many concluded" they were inspired by him. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that "in later years" that Shariati and "his prolific works" had "indirectly helped the Mujahedin."[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 490[/tpl]
In the group's "first major ideological work," Nahzat-i Husseini or Hussein's Movement, authored by one of the group's founders, Ahmad Reza'i, it was argued that Nezam-i Towhid (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. "Shiism, particularly Hussein's historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture."[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 491[/tpl]
As described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued 
“Reza’i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi’I Imams, especially Ali, Hassan, and Hussein, was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping Caliphs who betrayed the Nezam-i-Towhid. For Reza’i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all muslims to continue this struggle to create a ‘classless society’ and destroy all forms of capitalism, despotism, and imperialism. The Mujahidin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: 'After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi’I ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi’ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi’ism, particularly Hussein’s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.”Keddle, Nikki R. Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution, First Edition. New Haven Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2006. 220-221.

====After the revolution====

In 1981, the MEK formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) with the stated goal of uniting the opposition to the Iranian government under one umbrella organization. The MEK says that in the past 25 years, the NCRI has evolved into a 540-member parliament-in-exile, with a specific platform that emphasizes free elections, gender equality and equal rights for ethnic and religious minorities. The MEK claims that it also advocates a free-market economy and supports peace in the Middle East. However, the FBI claims that the NCRI "is not a separate organization, but is instead, and has been, an integral part of the MEK at all relevant times" and that the NCRI is "the political branch" of the MEK, rather than vice versa. Although the MEK is today the main organization of the NCRI, the latter previously hosted other organizations, such as the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran.
According to the publicly stated ideology of the MEK, elections and public suffrage are the sole indicators of political legitimacy.  Their publications reported that the Word of God and Islam are meaningless without freedom and respect for individual volition and choice. Their interpretation of Islam and the Quran says that the most important characteristic distinguishing man from animals is his free will. It is on this basis that human beings are held accountable. Without freedom, no society can develop or progress. Although its leaders presents themselves as Muslims, the MEK describes itself as a secular organization: "The National Council of Resistance believes in the separation of Church and State."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.iran-e-azad.org/english/ncri.html |title=National Council of Resistance of Iran |publisher=Iran-e-azad |accessdate= 2013-01-05[/tpl]
In more recent years under the guidance of Maryam Rajavi the organization has adopted strong principles in favor of women. Women assumed some senior positions of responsibility within the ranks of the MEK and although women make up only a third of fighters, two-thirds of its commanders are women. Rajavi ultimately believes that women should enjoy equal rights with men.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.iran-democracy.com/Maryam-Rajavi/ | title = Iran democracy | contribution = Maryam Rajavi[/tpl]

===Bombings and armed conflict with the Islamic government===

Following the 1979 revolution, the newly established theocratic government of Ayatollah Khomeini moved to squash dissent. Khomeini attacked the MEK as elteqati (eclectic), contaminated with Gharbzadegi ("the Western plague"), and as monafeqin (hypocrites) and kafer (unbelievers).[tpl]Sfn | Moin | 2001 | pp = 234, 239[/tpl]  In February 1980 concentrated attacks by hezbollahi pro-Khomeini militia began on the meeting places, bookstores and newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftistsBakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs (1984) p. 123. driving the Left underground in Iran. Hundreds of MEK supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 | title = TKB[/tpl]
On August 30, a bomb was detonated killing the popularly elected President Rajai and Premier Mohammad Javad Bahonar.  An active member of the Mujahedin, Massoud Kashmiri, was identified as the perpetrator, and according to reports came close to killing the entire government including Khomeini.[tpl]Sfn | Moin | 2001 | pp = 242–3[/tpl]  The reaction to both bombings was intense with many arrests and executions of Mujahedin and other leftist groups, but "assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the regime by the Mujahedin were to continue for the next year or two."[tpl]Sfn | Moin | 2001 | p = 243[/tpl]
Eventually, the majority of the MEK leadership and members fled to France, where it operated until 1986, when tension arose between Paris and Tehran over the Eurodif nuclear stake and the French citizens kidnapped in the Lebanon hostage crisis. After Rajavi flew to Baghdad, French hostages were released.

====National Liberation Army of Iran====

The MEK transferred its headquarters to Iraq after France agreed to expel them in order to release French hostages in Lebanon in 1986, during the Iran–Iraq War. Near the end of the 1980–88 war between Iraq and Iran, a military force of 7000 members of the MEK, armed and equipped by Saddam's Iraq and calling itself the National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA), went into action.  On July 26, 1988, six days after the Ayatollah Khomeini had announced his acceptance of the UN brokered ceasefire resolution, the NLA advanced under heavy Iraqi air cover, crossing the Iranian border from Iraq. It seized and razed to the ground the Iranian town of Islamabad-e Gharb. As it advanced further into Iran, Iraq ceased its air support and Iranian forces cut off NLA supply lines and counterattacked under cover of fighter planes and helicopter gunships. On July 29 the NLA announced a voluntary withdrawal back to Iraq. The MEK claims it lost 1400 dead or missing and the Islamic Republic sustained 55,000 casualties (either IRGC, Basij forces, or the army).  The Islamic Republic claims to have killed 4500 NLA and Iraqi troops during the operation.Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War (1999), pp. 246–7  The operation was called Foroughe Javidan (Eternal Light) by the MEK and the counterattack Operation Mersad by the Iranian forces.

====1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners====

A large number of prisoners from the MEK, and a lesser number from other leftist opposition groups (somewhere between 1,400 and 30,000),[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.pww.org/article/view/5754/1/231/ | title = Iranian party demands end to repression | publisher = PWW[/tpl].[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] were executed in 1988, following Operation Eternal Light.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mehr.org/massacre_1988.htm |title=1988 massacre |publisher=Mehr | accessdate= 2013-01-05[/tpl][tpl]Efn | In this operation MEK penetrated as deep as 170 km into Iranian soil and very close to Kermanshah, the most important city in western Iran.[tpl]Citation |date=Sep 2004 | url = http://www.americanthinker.com/2004/09/the_1988_iran_massacre_crimes.html | title = The 1988 Iran massacre crimes | newspaper = The American Thinker[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=160 | title = Memories of a slaughter in Iran |publisher=Iran focus |date=2004-09-05 | accessdate =2013-01-05[/tpl][tpl]Citation | first = Nasrin | last = Alavi | year = 2005 | title = We Are Iran[/tpl][tpl]Citation | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/02/04/wiran04.xml | title = Khomeini fatwa 'led to killing of 30,000 in Iran' | newspaper = The Telegraph | date = February 2, 2001[/tpl] Dissident Ayatollah Montazeri has written in his memoirs that this massacre, deemed a crime against humanity, was ordered by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and carried out by several high-ranking members of Iran's current government.

===Relations with France in the mid-1980s===

In 1986, after French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac struck a deal with Tehran for the release of French hostages held prisoners by the Hezbollah in Lebanon, the MEK was forced to leave France and relocated in Iraq. Investigative journalist Dominique Lorentz has related the 1986 capture of French hostages to an alleged blackmail of France by Tehran concerning the nuclear program.[tpl]Citation | author1-link = Dominique Lorentz| last1 = Lorentz | first1 = Dominique | first2 = Carr-Brown | last2 = David | title = La République atomique | trans_title = The Atomic Republic | date = November 14, 2001 | language = French | publisher = Arte TV[/tpl]

====Post-war====

In the following years the MEK conducted several high-profile assassinations of political and military figures inside Iran, including Asadollah Lajevardi, the former warden of the Evin prison, in 1998 and deputy chief of the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff, Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi, who was assassinated on the doorsteps of his house on April 10, 1999.
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, MEK camps were bombed by coalition forces because of its alliance with Saddam Hussein. On April 15, U.S. Special Forces brokered a ceasefire agreement with the leaders of the MEK and entered into a ceasefire agreement with the coalition after the attack.  All compounds surrendered without hostilities.[tpl]Citation | title = Labeled terrorist group turns over weapons to U.S.; Members of MEK – backed by Saddam Hussein – also agree to be interviewed by intelligence officials | first = Eric | last = Slater | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | publisher = The Grand Rapids Press | publisher = Grand Rapids, MI | date = May 12, 2003 | page = A.3[/tpl][tpl]Citation | title = U.S. gets Iranian rebels in Iraq to disarm | edition = Chicago Final | first = EA | last = Torriero | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | publisher = Chicago, IL | date = May 11, 2003 | page = 8[/tpl][tpl]Citation | title = Agreement disbands Iranian exile force | edition = Final | newspaper = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | place = Milwaukee, WI | date = May 11, 2003 | page = 14.A[/tpl] This was a controversial agreement both in the public sphere and privately among the Bush administration due to the MEK's designation as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpt-mi.org/pdf_secure.php?pdffilename=MeK| title = Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK) Dossier|format=PDF|date=March 15, 2005| first =Nicole | last = Cafarella[/tpl]
In the operation, the U.S. reportedly captured 6000 MEK soldiers and over 2000 pieces of military equipment, including 19 British-made Chieftain tanks.[tpl]Citation | title = Armed Iranian exiles surrender; 6,000-member unit accepts U.S. terms | first = John | last = Sullivan | publisher = Knight Ridder | newspaper = The Record | place = Bergen County, NJ | date = May 11, 2003 | page = A.17[/tpl][tpl]Citation | publisher = US DoD | type = news briefing | title = M2 Presswire | place = Coventry | date = June 19, 2003 | page = 1[/tpl] The MEK compound outside Fallujah became known as Camp Fallujah and sits adjacent to the other major base in Fallujah, Forward Operating Base Dreamland.

After a four-month investigation by several U.S. agencies, including the State Department, only a handful of charges under U.S. criminal law were brought against MEK members, all American citizens. The MEK remained listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the Department of State until September 28, 2012.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm | title = Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) | publisher = Department of State | place = Washington, DC[/tpl].[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-04/pdf/2012-24505.pdf Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared MEK personnel in Ashraf protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

On January 1, 2009 the U.S. military transferred control of Camp Ashraf to the Iraqi government.

In 2012 MEK moved from Camp Ashraf to Camp Hurriya in Baghdad (a onetime U.S. base formerly known as Camp Liberty). A rocket and mortar attack killed 5 and injured 50 others at Camp Hurriya on February 9, 2013. Iranian residents of the facility and their representatives and lawyers appealed to the UN Secretary-General and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they say has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection.

====Iraqi government's crackdown====

On January 23, 2009, and while on a visit to Tehran, Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie reiterated the Iraqi Prime Minister’s earlier announcement that the MEK organisation will no longer be able to base itself on Iraqi soil and stated that the members of the organisation will have to make a choice, either to go back to Iran or to go to a third country, adding that these measures will be implemented over the next two months.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Al-Jazeera |language=Arabic |url= http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/09F45E44-4EA9-41F5-9190-BE6B6CE7B7C5.htm |title=العراق يقرر طرد أعضاء مجاهدي خلق من أراضيه |trans_title= Iraq Decides to Expel MEK Members from its Territory |date=January 24, 2009 |accessdate= 2011-12-07[/tpl]

===2003 French raid===

In June 2003 French police raided the MEK's properties, including its base in Auvers-sur-Oise, under the orders of anti-terrorist magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière, after suspicions that it was trying to shift its base of operations there. 
U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on South Asia, then accused the French of doing "the Iranian government's dirty work". Along with other members of Congress, he wrote a letter of protest to President Jacques Chirac, while longtime MEK supporters such as Sheila Jackson-Lee, Democrat of Texas, criticized Maryam Radjavi's arrest. Subsequently, the MEK members were quickly released.

===Negotiations between Tehran and Washington===

During the Iraq war, U.S. troops disarmed the MEK and posted guards at its bases.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cfr.org/publication/9158/ |title=Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK) | first = Holly | last = Fletcher | date = April 8, 2008 |publisher=CFR | accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl] The U.S. military also protected and gave logistical support to the MEK as U.S. officials viewed the group as a high value source of intelligence on Iran.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZB9F74tiE-kC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=saddam+hussein+mek#v=onepage&q=saddam%20hussein%20mek&f=false | title = The United States and Iran: Sanctions, wars and the policy of dual containment | isbn = 978-0-415-77396-6 | author = Fayazmanesh | first = Sasan | year = 2008[/tpl] The MEK is credited with revealing Iran's nuclear program in 2003 and alerting Americans to Iranian advancements in nuclear technology.[tpl]cite news| first = Michael | last = Ware | newspaper = CNN |url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/04/05/protected.terrorists/ |title=U.S. protects Iranian opposition group in Iraq, April 6, 2007 | date=2007-04-06 |accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl]
The same year that the French police raided the MEK's properties in France (2003), Tehran attempted to negotiate with Washington. Iranian officials offered to withdraw military backing for Hamas and Hezbollah, and to give open access to their nuclear facilities in return for Western action in disbanding the MEK, which was revealed by Newsnight, a BBC current affairs program, in 2007. The BBC uncovered a letter written after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 where Tehran made this offer[tpl]cite news| last = Puri |first=Kavita |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6272661.stm |title= Newsnight | publisher =BBC |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl] The proposition was done in a secret letter to Washington via Switzerland.

===Nuclear issue===

The MEK and the NCRI claim to be the first entities that revealed Iran's nuclear activities in 2002, which has turned to be a major concern for the U.S. and some of its allies today. On February 20, 2008, the NCRI claimed to have revealed another nuclear site of the Islamic Republic.Exiled dissidents claim Iran building new nuclear site

==MEK and the US government==

Before their exile, 'Anti-Imperialism' was preached by MEK both before and after revolution. The Mojahedin Organization praised writers such as Al-e Ahmad, Saedi and  Shariati for being 'anti-imperialist'.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =229[/tpl] Rajavi in his presidential campaign after revolution used to warn against what he called the 'imperialist danger'.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =197[/tpl] The matter was so fundamental to MEK that it criticized the Iranian regime on that basis, accusing the Islamic Republic of 'capitualation to imperialism' and being disloyal to democracy that according to Rajavi was the only means to 'safeguard from American imperialism'.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =209[/tpl]
However, after exile, Rajavi toned down the issues of imperialism, social revolution, and classless society. Instead he stressed on human rights and respect for 'personal property'.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =245[/tpl]

==MEK and the Israel/Palestine Controversy==

In the beginning, MEK used to criticize the Pahlavi regime for allying with Israel and South Africa ;[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =98[/tpl] even calling them racist states and demanding cancellation of all political and economic agreements with them.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =185[/tpl] The Central Cadre established contact with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), by sending emissaries to Paris, Dubai, and Qatar to meet PLO officials. In one occasion, seven leading members of MEK spent several months in the PLO camps in Jordan and Lebanon.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =127[/tpl] On August 3, 1972,  they bombed the Jordanian embassy as a means to revenge King Hussein's unleashing his troops on the PLO in 1970.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1992 | p =140[/tpl]
After the revolution and while in exile, however, they teamed up with Israel to conduct terrorist operations against the Iranian nuclear scientists as a means to combat the Iranian regime.NBC NewsHaaretz

==The 'ideological revolution' and the issue of women's right==

On 27 January 1985, Rajavi appointed Maryam Azodanlu as his co-equal leader. The announcement, stated that this would give women equal say within the organization and thereby 'would launch a great ideological revolution within Mojahedin, the Iranian public and the whole Muslim World'. At the time Maryam Azodanlu was known as only the younger sister of a veteran member, and the wife of Mehdi Abrishamchi. According to the announcement, Maryam Azodanlu and Mehdi Abrishamchi had recently divorced in order to facilitate this 'great revolution'. As a result, the marriage further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. This was mainly because, the middle class would look at this marriage as an indecent act which to them resembled wife-swapping. (especially when Abrishamchi declared his own marriage to Musa Khiabani's younger sister). The fact that it involved women with young children and the wives of close friends was considered a taboo in traditional Iranian culture. The effect of this incident on secularists and modern intelligentsia was equally outrageous as it portrayed a private matter onto the public. Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu's giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 251-253[/tpl]
According to Ervand Abrahamian: "the Mojahedin, despite contrary claims did not give women equal representation within their own hierarchy. The book of martyrs indicates that women formed 15 percent of the organization's rank-and-file, but only 9 percent of its leadershp. To rectify this, the Mojahedin posthumously revealed some of the rank and file women martyrs especially those related to prominent figures, into leadership positions."[tpl]Sfn | Abrahamian | 1982 | p = 233-234[/tpl]

==Designation as a terrorist organization==

The United States put MEK on the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in 1997. However, since 2004 the United States also has considered the group as "noncombatants" and "protected persons" under the Geneva Conventions because most members have been located in a refugee camp in Iraq for more than 25 years.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/28/politics/mek-terror-delisting/ | title = Iranian exile group removed from U.S. terror list | publisher = CNN | newspaper = Wire Staff | date = September 28, 2012[/tpl] In 2002 the European Union, pressured by Washington, added MEK to its terrorist list.[tpl]Citation | url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/amir-taheri-france-paints-an-abstract-picture-to-please-iran-1.359636 | first = Amir | last = Taheri | title = France paints an abstract picture to please Iran | newspaper = Gulf News | date = June 25, 2003[/tpl]
MEK leaders then began a lobbying campaign to be removed from the list by promoting itself as a viable opposition to the mullahs in Tehran. In 2008 US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice denied MEK its request to be delisted, despite its lobbying the State Department.
In 2011, several former senior U.S. officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, three former chairmen of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, two former directors of the CIA, former commander of NATO Wesley Clark, two former U.S. Ambassadors to the United Nations, the former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, a former White House Chief of Staff, a former commander of the United States Marine Corps, former U.S. National Security Advisor Frances Townsend, and U.S. President Barack Obama's retired National Security Adviser General James L. Jones called for the MEK to be removed from its official State Department foreign terrorist listing on the grounds that they constituted a viable opposition to the Iranian regime.[tpl]cite news|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/09/12/freeh.corbett.waddington.mek/ |title=Take Iran opponent MEK off terror list|publisher=CNN|date= September 12, 2011[/tpl]
In April 2012, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site up until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.alternet.org/world/154938/seymour_hersh%3A_us_training_iranian_terrorists_in_nevada|title = Seymour Hersh: U.S. Training Iranian Terrorists in Nevada|publisher=AlterNet| first = Amy | last = Goodman | author-link = Amy Goodman |date=April 10, 2012[/tpl] Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton.

===Removal of the designation===

In January 2009 the Council of the European Union removed the terrorist designation. This followed the 2008 Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg censure of France for failing to disclose alleged new evidence of MEK's terrorist threat. Delisting allowed MEK to pursue tens of millions of dollars of frozen assets and lobby in Europe for more funds. It also removed the terrorist label from MEK members at their Iraqi Camp Ashraf.
On September 28, 2012 The U.S. State Department formally removed MEK from its official list of terrorist organizations, beating an October 1 deadline in a MEK lawsuit. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement the decision was made because MEK had renounced violence and had cooperated in closing their Iraqi paramilitary base. An official denied that lobbying by well-known figures influenced the decision to remove the designation.[tpl]Citation | first = Andrew | last = Quinn | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/28/iraq-iran-mek-idUSL1E8KSF3B20120928?type=marketsNews | title = US drops Iranian MEK dissident group from terrorism list | newspaper = Reuters | date = September 28, 2012[/tpl]
The National Iranian American Council denounced the decision, stating it “opens the door to Congressional funding of the M.E.K. to conduct terrorist attacks in Iran” and “makes war with Iran far more likely.” Iran state television condemned the delisting of the group, saying that the U.S. considers MEK to be "good terrorists because the U.S. is using them against Iran."[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/29/iran-condemns-us-mek-terror-delisting | title = Iran condemns US for 'double standards' over MEK terror de-listing | publisher = Associated Press | newspaper = The Guardian | date = September 29, 2012[/tpl]

==MEK's human rights record before 2003==

In May 2005, Human Rights Watch issued a report describing prison camps within Iraq run by the MEK and severe human rights violations committed by the group against former members.[tpl]cite news | title= Human Rights Abuses in the MEK camps|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=May 2005|url= http://hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/iran0505/4.htm[/tpl]
Following the 1988 military defeat by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Rajavi's leadership of MEK became increasingly authoritarian and cultlike, according to the report. One MEK defector's memoir indicated that Rajavi claimed to have a mystical relationship with a prophet known as Imam Zaman, (the Mahdi or Twelfth Imam of Shia Islam). In order to better cement their relationship with their leader, and hence ultimately their Messiah, Rajavi then instructed his followers to divorce their spouses. The group had already established a practice of self criticism, under which members were asked to undergo their own personal "ideological revolution" by confessing personal inadequacies in cultlike confession sessions. Human Rights Watch stated that the testimony of former MEK prisoners paints a grim picture of how the organization treated its members, particularly those who held dissenting opinions or expressed an intent to leave the organization. Other witnesses told Human Rights Watch claimed it was the practice of MEK interrogators to tie thick ropes around prisoners necks and drag them along the ground. One witness told investigators: "Sometimes prisoners returned to the cell with extremely swollen necks — their head and neck as big as a pillow." In a statement accompanying its investigative report, Joe Stork, a Human Rights Watch expert on the Middle East, commented:
[tpl]Quote | The Iranian government has a dreadful record on human rights.

The report prompted a response by the MEK and a few friendly European MPs, who published a counter-report in September 2005.[tpl]cite web|url= http://ncr-iran.org/images/stories/advertising/ep%20report-with%20cover.pdf |format=PDF|title=People's Mojahedin of Iran – Mission report | accessdate =2006-08-29|publisher=Friends of Free Iran – European Parliament|year=2005[/tpl] They stated that HRW had "relied only on 12 hours interviews with 12 suspicious individuals", and stated that "a delegation of MEPs visited Camp Ashraf in Iraq" and "conducted impromptu inspections of the sites of alleged abuses." Alejo Vidal-Quadras Roca (PP), one of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament, alleged that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) was the source of the evidence against the MEK.
Prompted by the FOFI document, Human Rights Watch re-interviewed all 12 of the original witnesses, conducting private and personal interviews lasting several hours with each of them in Germany and the Netherlands, where the witnesses now live. All of the witnesses restated their claims about the MEK camps from the 1991–2003 period, saying MEK officials subjected them to various forms of physical and psychological abuses once they made known their wishes to leave the organization.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/02/14/statement-responses-human-rights-watch-report-abuses-mojahedin-e-khalq-organization- |title = Statement on Responses to Human Rights Watch Report on Abuses by the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK) | accessdate = 2006-08-29 |publisher=Human Rights Watch|year= 2003[/tpl]
According to Mohsen Kadivar and Ahmad Sadri writing Salon.com,
[tpl]Quote | Countless first-rate analysts, scholars and human rights organizations – including Human Rights Watch – have determined that the MEK is an undemocratic, cultlike organization whose modus operandi vitiates its claim to be a vehicle for democratic change.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/26/iran_green_movement | title = Hillary Clinton's crucial choice on Iran | date = March 26, 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
In an interview with RFERL escaped MEK leader Abdul Latif Shardouri (aka Abdollatif Shadvari) who said he had been in the MEK for 25 years stated that his family thought he was dead because he had had no contact with them during those 25 years. "Using the telephone, mobile phone, Internet, and even listening to radio is forbidden in the organization."[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/persian_letters_camp_ashraf_escapee_says_MKO_bans_marriage_radio_internet/9501036.html | title = Camp Ashraf Escapee Says MKO Bans Marriage, Radio, Internet | publisher = RFERL | date = April 21, 2011[/tpl]
The HRW report covered only the period from 1991 to 2003. In a letter of May 2005 to HRW, the senior US military police commander responsible for the Camp Ashraf area, Brigadier General David Phillips, who had been in charge during the year 2004 for the protective custody of the MEK members in the camp, disputed the alleged human rights violations: 
According to a database of Terrorism Victims in Iran run by an Iranian organisation opposed to the PMOI, the group is allegedly responsible for the deaths of some 17,000 Iranians and up to 25,000 Iraqis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.habilian.ir/en/Legal/3/ |title=Legal - Page 1 of 150 |publisher=Habilian.ir |accessdate=2013-11-07[/tpl]
