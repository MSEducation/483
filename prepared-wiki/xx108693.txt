The Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (also known as the G-20, G20, and Group of Twenty) is a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 major economies. The members, shown highlighted on the map at right, include 19 individual countries—Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States—and the European Union (EU), with Spain participating as a "permanent guest", and further short-term guests named annually by the group's rotating chairperson. The EU is represented by the President of the European Council and by the European Central Bank. 
Collectively, the G-20 economies account for around 85% of the gross world product (GWP), 80% of world trade (or if excluding EU intra-trade: 75%), and two-thirds of the world population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.g20.org/about_g20/g20_members|title=G20 Members|publisher=G20.org|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl] The G-20 heads of government or heads of state have also periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008.

The heads of the G-20 nations met semi-annually at G-20 summits between 2008 and 2011. Since the November 2011 Cannes summit, all G-20 summits have been held annually. Russia currently holds the chair of the G-20, and hosted the eighth G-20 summit in September 2013. The next summit is in Australia in Brisbane in 2014, chaired by Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of Australia.

==History==

The G-20, which superseded the G33 (which had itself superseded the G22), was foreshadowed at the Cologne Summit of the G7 in June 1999, but was only formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers' meeting on 26 September 1999. The inaugural meeting took place on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin. In 2008, Spain and the Netherlands were included, by French invitation, in the G-20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy.
The theme of the 2006 G-20 meeting was "Building and Sustaining Prosperity". The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve "sustained growth", global energy and resource commodity markets, 'reform' of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes due to an aging population. Trevor A. Manuel, the South African Minister of Finance, was the chairperson of the G-20 when South Africa hosted the Secretariat in 2007. Guido Mantega, Brazil's Minister of Finance, was the chairperson of the G-20 in 2008; Brazil proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets, clean energy and economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development. In a statement following a meeting of G7 finance ministers on 11 October 2008, US President George W. Bush stated that the next meeting of the G-20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning economic crisis of 2008. An initiative by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown led to a special meeting of the G-20, a G-20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy, on 15 November 2008."The G-20 Summit: What’s It All About?". Brookings Institute. 27 October 2008. Retrieved 28 October 2012.
Despite lacking any formal ability to enforce rules, the G-20's prominent membership gives it a strong input on global policy. However, there remain disputes over the legitimacy of the G-20,D+C 2011/01 – Berensmann/Fues/Volz – The G20: an informal power broker with growing developmental relevance – Development and Cooperation – International Journal.

===Summits===

The G-20 Summit was created as a response both to the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and to a growing recognition that key emerging countries were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. The G-20 Summits of heads of state or government were held in addition to the G-20 Meetings of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who continued to meet to prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions. After the 2008 debut summit in Washington, D.C., G-20 leaders met twice a year in London and Pittsburgh in 2009, Toronto and Seoul in 2010."US to host next G20 world meeting". BBC News. 28 May 2009. Retrieved 9 December 2012.
Since 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G-20, the summits have been held only once a year."Leaders' statement, the Pittsburgh Summit," p. 19 §50 (PDF). G20.org. 25 September 2009.

===G-20 leaders' chair rotation===

To decide which member nation gets to chair the G-20 leaders' meeting for a given year, all 19 sovereign nations are assigned to one of five different groupings. Each group holds a maximum of four nations. This system has been in place since 2010, when South Korea, which is in Group 5, held the G-20 chair. In 2013, Russia, which is in Group 2, hosted the G-20 leaders' summit. Australia, the host of the 2014 G-20 summit, is in Group 1. The table below lists the nations' groupings:[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2010/11/future-g20-process| title=The Future of the G20 Process| publisher=Centre for International Governance Innovation| first=Barry| last=Carin| date=4 November 2010| accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl]

==Organization==

The G-20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff. The group's chair rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries. The chair is part of a revolving three-member management group of past, present and future chairs, referred to as the "Troika". The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings. The role of the Troika is to ensure continuity in the G-20's work and management across host years. The current chair of the G-20 is Australia; the chair was handed over from Russia after the 2013 G-20 Summit. The 2015 Summit will be presided by Turkey.

===Proposed permanent secretariat===

In 2010, President of France Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the establishment of a permanent G-20 secretariat, similar to the United Nations. Seoul and Paris were suggested as possible locations for its headquarters."Who Would Host a G20 Secretariat?" Chosun Ilbo. 15 November 2010. Retrieved 14 March 2013. China and Brazil supported the establishment of a secretariat, while Italy and Japan expressed opposition to the proposal. South Korea proposed a "cyber secretariat" as an alternative.

==List of members==

Currently, there are 20 members of the group. These include, at the leaders summits, the leaders of 19 countries and of the European Union, and, at the ministerial-level meetings, the finance ministers and central bank governors of 19 countries and of the European Union. In addition, Spain participates in every meeting as a permanent guest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.g20.org/about_what_is_g20.aspx |title=What is the G-20 |publisher=G20.org |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] The first of the tables below lists the member entities and their heads of government, finance ministers and central bank governors. The second table lists relevant statistics such as population and GDP figures for each member, as well as detailing memberships of other international organisations, such as the G7, BRICS or MIKTA. Total GDP figures are given in millions of US dollars.

===Role of Asian countries===

A 2011 report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted that large Asian economies such as China and India would play a more important role in global economic governance in the future. The report claimed that the rise of emerging market economies heralded a new world order, in which the G-20 would become the global economic steering committee.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/98506/7361425.html|title=Asia to play bigger role on world stage, G20: ADB report |work=The People's Daily|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] The ADB furthermore noted that Asian countries had led the global recovery following the late-2000s recession. It predicted that the region would have a greater presence on the global stage, shaping the G-20's agenda for balanced and sustainable growth through strengthening intraregional trade and stimulating domestic demand.

==Invitees==

Typically, several countries that are not permanent members of the G-20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits. The invitees are chosen by the host country. For the 2010 summits, for example, both Canada and South Korea invited Ethiopia (chair of NEPAD), Malawi (chair of the African Union), Vietnam (chair of ASEAN), and Spain. Canada also invited the Netherlands, while South Korea invited Singapore. Both Canada and South Korea invited seven international organizations: the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Trade Organization, and the Financial Stability Board."Five leaders invited to join G20 at Toronto summit".

==Criticisms==

===Exclusivity of membership===

Although the G-20 has stated that the group's "economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system,""About G-20". G20.org. Retrieved 11 December 2012. its legitimacy has been challenged. With respect to the membership issue, U.S. President Barack Obama has noted the difficulty of pleasing everyone: "everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them. So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G-21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out."Kelly Chernenkoff. "Obama to Usher In New World Order at G-20". Fox News. 25 September 2009. Retrieved 11 December 2012. A 2011 report for the Danish Institute for International Studies, entitled "The G-20 and Beyond: Towards Effective Global Economic Governance", criticised the G-20's exclusivity, highlighting in particular its under-representation of the African continent. Moreover, the report stated that the G-20's practice of inviting observers from non-member states is a mere "concession at the margins", and does not grant the organisation representational legitimacy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vestergaard|first=Jakob|url=http://www.diis.dk/graphics/publications/reports2011/rp2011-04-g20-and-beyond_web.pdf|title=The G20 and Beyond: Towards Effective Global Economic Governance|journal=DIIS Report|date=April 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013[/tpl] However, Global Policy stated in 2011 that the G-20's exclusivity is not an insurmountable problem, and proposed mechanisms by which it could become more inclusive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/global-governance/g20-and-its-regional-critics-search-inclusion|title=The G20 and Its Regional Critics: The Search for Inclusion|work=Global Policy|date=May 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013[/tpl]

Støre characterized the G-20 as a "self-appointed group", arguing that it undermines the legitimacy of international organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as the IMF, World Bank and United Nations:

====Global Governance Group (3G) response====

In June 2010, Singapore's representative to the United Nations warned the G-20 that its decisions would affect "all countries, big and small", and asserted that prominent non-G-20 members should be included in financial reform discussions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/content/mfa/overseasmission/newyork/nyemb_statements/global_governance_group/2010/201006/press_201006_3.html|title=STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR VANU GOPALA MENON, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF SINGAPORE TO THE UNITED NATIONS|publisher=Singapore UN Mission|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] Singapore thereafter took a leading role in organizing the Global Governance Group (3G), an informal grouping of 28 non-G-20 countries (including several micronations and many Third World countries) with the aim of collectively channelling their views into the G-20 process more effectively."SIIA welcomes new 3G initiative for small states".

====Foreign Policy critiques====

The American magazine Foreign Policy has published articles condemning the G-20, in terms of its principal function as an alternative to the supposedly exclusive G8. It questions the actions of some of the G-20 members, and advances the notion that some nations should not have membership in the first place. For example, it has suggested that Argentina should be formally replaced in the group by Spain, because Spain's economy is larger.[tpl]cite news| url=http://bosco.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/04/19/boot_argentina_from_the_g20| title=Who would replace Argentina on the G20?| work=Foreign Policy| first=David| last=Bosco| date=19 April 2012| accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] Furthermore, with the effects of the Great Recession still ongoing, the magazine has criticized the G-20's efforts to implement reforms of the world's financial institutions, branding such efforts as failed.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/04/12/the_g_20_is_failing| title=The G-20 Is Failing| work=Foreign Policy| first=Edwin M.| last=Truman| date=12 April 2012| accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]
On 14 June 2012, an essay published by the National Taxpayers Union was forwarded to Foreign Policy, espousing a critical view of the application of G-20 membership. The essay's authors, Alex Brill and James K. Glassman, used a numerical table with seven criteria to conclude that Indonesia, Argentina, Russia and Mexico do not qualify for G-20 membership, and that Switzerland, Singapore, Norway and Malaysia had overtaken some of the current members. However, the gap between current members Mexico and Russia and the lower-ranked entries in the authors' list (Malaysia and Saudi Arabia) was only slight. Thus, it was concluded that there is no obvious group of twenty nations that should be included in the G20, and that fair and transparent metrics are essential, as they justify the difficult decisions that will be required in order to differentiate among similarly situated countries.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aei.org/files/2012/06/14/-brill-g20-ntu-paper_095940274931.pdf | title = Who Should the Twenty Be?

===Wider concerns===

The G-20's transparency and accountability have been questioned by critics, who call attention to the absence of a formal charter and the fact that the most important G-20 meetings are closed-door.Daniele Archibugi. "The G-20 ought to be increased to 6 Billion". OpenDemocracy.net. 31 March 2009. Retrieved 26 April 2013. In 2001, the economist Frances Stewart proposed an Economic Security Council within the United Nations as an alternative to the G-20. In such a council, members would be elected by the General Assembly based on their importance in the world economy, and the contribution they are willing to provide to world economic development.Stewart, Frances and Daws, Sam. "An Economic and Social Security Council at the United Nations" (PDF). Oxford University. March 2001. Retrieved 8 January 2013.
The cost and extent of summit-related security is often a contentious issue in the hosting country, and G-20 summits have attracted protesters from a variety of backgrounds, including information activists, nationalists, and opponents of Fractional Reserve Banking and crony capitalism. In 2010, the Toronto G-20 summit sparked mass protests and rioting, leading to the largest mass arrest in Canadian history.
