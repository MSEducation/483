Oregon City is the county seat of Clackamas County, Oregon, located on the Willamette River near the southern limits of the Portland metropolitan area.  Established in 1829 by the Hudson's Bay Company, in 1845 it became the first U.S. city west of the Rocky Mountains to be incorporated.  As of the 2010 census, the city population was 31,859.

==History==

Known in recent decades as the site of several large paper mills on the Willamette River, the city played a significant role in the early history of the Oregon Country. It was established by Hudson's Bay Company's Dr. John McLoughlin in 1829 near the confluence of the Clackamas River with the Willamette to take advantage of the power of Willamette Falls to run a lumber mill. During the 1840s and 1850s it was the destination for those wanting to file land claims after traveling the Oregon Trail as the last stop on the trail.The Oregon Trail: Oregon CityAmerica's Byways: Historic Columbia River Highway It was the capital of the Oregon Territory from its establishment in 1848 until 1851, and rivaled Portland for early supremacy in the area. In 1846, the city's newspaper, the Oregon Spectator, was the first American newspaper to be published west of the Rocky Mountains. The center of the city retains part of its historic character through the preservation of houses and other buildings from the era of the city's founding.
The town became the see city of the first Roman Catholic archdiocese in the western United States, when the diocese of Oregon City, established in 1846, was raised to metropolitan rank, with Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet as its ordinary. Its territory included all of the western United States. The population in the area of Oregon City declined due to the California Gold Rush. That of nearby Portland grew, and the headquarters of the archdiocese was moved there in 1926. In 1928 the name Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon replaced the former name. No longer a residential bishopric, Oregon City is now a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ISBN 978-88-209-9070-=1), p. 945[tpl]cite news| last=Roberts | first=Anthony | url=http://thetribonline.com/metro_news/story.php?story_id=124760354919257800 |title=Oregon City gets its own bishop — sort of | newspaper=The Oregon City News | date=July 14, 2009| accessdate=March 28, 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

The town is divided into upper and lower areas; the lower area is on a bench next to the Willamette River, and the upper area atop a bluff composed of Columbia Plateau basalt.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]  For many years, Indian trails connected the two, but stairs were built in the 19th century. In 1915 the town built the water-powered Oregon City Municipal Elevator to connect the two parts, which was converted to electricity in the 1920s. In 1952, a new electric elevator was constructed with the specification that it was to be "as plain as possible and without ornament."[tpl]cite web|title=Oregon City Elevator history|url=http://www.orcity.org/publicworks/municipal-elevator|work=Oregon City historical information website|publisher=Oregon City|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|9.29|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|9.05|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.24|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl]  The major waterways of Oregon City include the Willamette River, which flows along the northwest side of the city, and the Clackamas River, which merges with the larger Willamette to the north of the city.  The Willamette forms the boundary between Oregon City and West Linn; the Clackamas serves as the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone.

===Willamette Falls===

The Willamette Falls Locks in West Linn were the first multi-lift navigational locks in the United States and are now a National Historical Site, no longer in use. The first long-distance electrical service in the United States originated in Oregon City, transmitting electricity [tpl]convert|14|mi[/tpl] to Portland.

==Economy==

For much of its existence, Oregon City's economy has been dominated by the forestry industry, until the decline of the Pacific Northwest lumber industry started in the 1980s. At its height, several mills operated in the city and surrounding communities; all but one paper mill have been shuttered.
Today, the city is home to several notable high technology and light manufacturing concerns. Notable companies based in Oregon City include Benchmade, a manufacturer of high-end cutlery. Chrome Systems Corporation (formerly Chrome Data) was founded there, but has since moved to nearby Portland. Medrisk, LLC is a major insurance brokerage which does business in the Northwest and is headquartered in Oregon City.  In 2006 Anderson Vending Inc. chose Oregon City as its new headquarters.

==Points of interest==

===Museums and historic buildings===

Museums include the Museum of the Oregon Territory and the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, with costumed "living history" guides.  The Clackamas County Historical Society archives, housed in the Museum of the Oregon Territory, also include the incorporation plat for the city of San Francisco.  Clackamas Heritage Partners owns and operates these museums, along with the Stevens Crawford Museum.  In 2009, Clackamas Heritage Partners announced that it could no longer afford to keep the museums open.  The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center was closed to the public indefinitely in September 2009, while the Stevens Crawford Museum and Museum of the Oregon Territory, which are staffed largely by volunteers, will operate on a limited schedule.
The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center reopened, however, during the summer of 2013 thanks to grants and donations from numerous sources.[tpl]cite news|last=Rendleman|first=Raymond|title=Reporter|url=http://www.pamplinmedia.com/cr/24-news/158939-end-of-oregon-trail-center-reopens|accessdate=2014-01-16|newspaper=Clackamas Review|date=August 14, 2013[/tpl]
The Stevens Crawford Museum is an 1908 structure with 15 furnished rooms, many with their original fittings, as the house was used as a home continuously until 1968. Other historical buildings in Oregon City include the McLoughlin House, the Ermatinger House (oldest in Clackamas County), the Ainsworth House, the Harvey Cross House, and the First Congregational Church.

===Parks===

Oregon City has over 22 city parks.  One of the city's larger parks is Clackamette Park, at the confluence of the Clackamas and Willamette Rivers. The park's features include RV camping, a boat launch and dock, a skateboard park, and other recreational facilities.  Several community festivals are held there throughout the year.  Other major parks include Chapin, Hillendale, Rivercrest, and the new Wesley Lynn.

==Transportation==

The city is served by the following transportation links:
Interstate 205 passes through the city's northern edge, and is the only freeway to serve the city. In addition, three state highways (OR 43, OR 99E, and OR 213) pass through or terminate in Oregon City. The former two serve the city's downtown core, the latter provides service to the southern parts of Oregon City.
The Union Pacific Railroad mainline passes through the city. The city also has an Amtrak station, which is served twice daily in each direction by Amtrak Cascades trains running between Portland and Eugene, Oregon. The Coast Starlight (Seattle-Los Angeles) passes through but does not stop.
There are no public airports located within the city. A small private airfield is located along Beavercreek Road, south of Oregon City. Oregon City is served by Portland International Airport, located [tpl]convert|15|mi[/tpl] to the north, and by Portland-Mulino Airport, a general-aviation facility located in the town of Mulino, located approximately [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] to the south.
The Willamette River in Oregon City is navigable to small craft, and Oregon City has a thriving fishing and recreational boating industry. The Willamette Falls Locks allow boats to navigate around the falls. The Clackamas River is not navigable, except for the lowermost portions.
As part of the greater Portland metropolitan area, Oregon City is served by TriMet, the regional transit authority, with several bus lines which converge at the Oregon City Transit Center. Until 1958, an interurban trolley line operated by the now-defunct Portland Traction Company connected Oregon City with Portland;[tpl]cite book| last=Thompson | first=Richard | year=2006 | title= Portland's Streetcars| pages= 114–121 | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | isbn=0-7385-3115-4[/tpl] remnants of this line are still visible (such as an abandoned bridge across the Clackamas River, just east of the OR 99E bridge). In more recent years, the city operated a "historic trolley" service during the summer months, primarily to serve the needs of tourism, but the vehicles used were trolley-replica buses, rather than actual trolley cars, and in 2013 it was decided to discontinue that service and sell the vehicles.[tpl]cite news|last=Mayes|first=Steve|title=Oregon City trolley makes its last run on Labor Day, 3-bus fleet will be sold|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=July 27, 2013|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/index.ssf/2013/07/oregon_city_trolly_makes_its_l.html|accessdate=October 6, 2013[/tpl]
Two other public agencies provide transit service in Oregon City, supplementing that of TriMet. The South Clackamas Transportation District (SCTD) operates a route between Clackamas Community College on the south east end of Oregon City to Molalla, about [tpl]convert|18|mi|km[/tpl] south on Oregon Route 213. Canby Area Transit (CAT) operates regular service on Oregon Route 99E between the Oregon City Transit Center and Canby. SMART, South Metro Area Regional Transit, serving Wilsonville, connects to CAT in Canby. CAT also has service to Woodburn.
Dial-a-ride service is operated by TriMet, but CAT also operates within the Oregon City city limits for trips originating or terminating in the CAT service area. If transfers between TriMet and CAT are necessary, they are accomplished at the Oregon City Transit Center (OCTC) at 11th & Main, which is at the northeast end of the downtown area.

==Climate==

Oregon City has a Mediterannean climate. The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.
