==Plot summary==

Miss Blandish, a sheltered heiress (Linden Travers), is targeted for a simple robbery by a cheap thug who ultimately involves two groups of rival gangsters, their goal being her $100,000 diamond jewellery. The robbery is botched when Riley (Richard Nielson) kills the bridegroom and the three would-be robbers decide to kidnap Miss Blandish for ransom instead (her papa is worth $100 million). 
The three original kidnappers are killed, and Blandish ends up hostage of the Bailey gang. Papa puts a private detective on the case. The rival Grisson gang, led by Ma Grisson (Lilli Molnar), intends to collect the ransom and kill Blandish rather than take the risk of releasing her. Meanwhile Slim Grisson (Jack La Rue) and Blandish fall in love and plan on running off together to flee both the police and the Bailey gang. 
Blandish sends the diamonds to her father with a note saying she is in love with Slim, but he refuses to believe it. Ma Grisson is shot by rival gangsters when she cannot get Slim to the phone. The police surround the cabin where Slim and Miss Blandish are holed up and machinegun Slim down, "rescuing" the kidnap victim and returning her safely home. At the end of the movie, she throws herself from her balcony in sorrow over the loss of Slim.

==Reception==

The film, about a kidnapped heiress who falls in love with her abductor, caused enormous controversy on its release, because of the high levels of violence that had got past the film censors. Though made with a largely British cast, it was set in New York, with the actors often struggling with their American accents.Motion Picture Exhibitor review; March 14, 1951, page 3042 (Ironically, the one American in the cast, LaRue, affected a slight Italian accent.)
No Orchids for Miss Blandish received strong criticism for its treatment of violence and sexuality. Cliff Goodwin says that it was "unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made'" by British reviewers.  The Monthly Film Bulletin called it "the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen". The Observer reviewer, C. A. Lejeune, described the film as "this repellent piece of work" that "scraped up all the droppings of the nastier type of Hollywood movie"."Outrage: No Orchids for Miss Blandish" by Brian McFarlane in British Crime Cinema, edited by Steve Chibnall, Robert Murphy. Routledge, 1999. ISBN 0-415-16870-8 (pg. 37-50). The Sunday Express film reviewer called No Orchids for Miss Blandish "the worst film I have ever seen".Halliwell's Film Guide, HarperPerennial, 1994, ISBN 978-0-06-273318-4 (pg. 781).  The Australian newspaper The Age also gave a harsh review: "No Orchids for Miss Blandish is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole...the entire production is unpardonable"."The Chiel's Film Review". The Age, November 27, 1948 (p. 5). The film was also denounced by the Bishop of London, William Wand, and several UK politicians, including Edith Summerskill.The British Board of Film Censors: film censorship in Britain, 1896-1950. James Crighton Robertson. Taylor & Francis, 1985, ISBN 0-7099-2270-1 (p.174-5) Despite this condemnation, the film was commercially successful.
More recent critics have been equally dismissive, though for different reasons. Leslie Halliwell would later describe No Orchids for Miss Blandish as a "hilariously awful gangster film...one of the worst films ever made".  Leonard Maltin in Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide states No Orchids for Miss Blandish "aspires to be a Hollywood film noir and misses by a mile".Maltin, Leonard (2011), Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide: From The Silent Era Through 1965 (Second Edition). Penguin, ISBN 0452295777 (pg. 474).
