CATEGORIES: Free text editors, JavaScript-based HTML editors

YUI Rich Text Editor is a project developed by Yahoo! as a part of the YUI Library for an online rich-text editor that replaces a standard HTML textarea. It allows for drag and drop inclusion and sizing of images, text coloring, realignment, fonts, italic and bold text. The YUI rich text editor uses a plug in architecture and it is skinnable along with the rest of the YUI.http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/

==Components==

The YUI Rich Text Editor (RTE), contains the following components: Editor, SimpleEditor, ToolbarButton, and ToolbarButtonAdvanced. Some differences in the SimpleEditor and the Editor control are that the SimpleEditor uses JavaScript prompts and select elements rather than YUI defined elements. http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/#choosing

This component was designed and implemented by the Yahoo! developer Dav Glass in order to add a rich text editor component to the YUI.
