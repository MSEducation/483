The untitled fourth album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, was released on 8 November 1971 on Atlantic Records. Produced by guitarist Jimmy Page, it was recorded between December 1970 and March 1971 at several locations, most prominently the Victorian house Headley Grange.
After the group's 1970 album Led Zeppelin III received lukewarm reviews from critics, Page decided their fourth album would officially be untitled. This, along with the inner sleeve's design featuring four symbols that represented each band member, led to the album being referred to variously as 55px|the Four Symbols logo, Four Symbols, The Fourth Album, Untitled, Runes, The Hermit, and ZoSo (which was derived from Page's symbol).Davis, Stephen (2008). "Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga". p.234. HarperCollins, 2008 In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press.[tpl]Sfn|Wall|2008|pp=269–270[/tpl]
Led Zeppelin IV was a commercial and critical success, producing many of the band's most well-known songs, including "Black Dog", "Rock and Roll", "Going to California", and the band's signature song, "Stairway to Heaven". The album is one of the best-selling albums worldwide at 37 million units,[tpl]sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=128[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Brown|2001|p=480[/tpl] and with a 23-times platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, it is the third-best-selling album in the United States.[tpl]cite web| title = Top 100 Albums| publisher = RIAA| url = http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums| accessdate =22 November 2012[/tpl] Writers and critics have regularly cited it on lists of rock's greatest albums.

==Recording sessions==

The album was initially recorded at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, at the same time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970.[ref]
[tpl]Cite news| title = Their Time is Gonna Come| newspaper = Classic Rock Magazine|date=December 2007| postscript = [/tpl][/ref] Upon the suggestion of Fleetwood Mac,Michael Leonard, "Heaven Sent", Q Led Zeppelin Special Edition, 2003. the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: "We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks the album were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then."
Once the basic tracks had been recorded, the band later added overdubs at Island Studios, then took the completed master tapes to Sunset Sound in Los Angeles for mixing. However, the mix ultimately proved to be less than satisfactory, creating an unwanted delay in the album's release. Further mixing had to be undertaken in London, pushing the final release date back by some months.
Three other songs from the sessions, "Down by the Seaside", "Night Flight" and "Boogie with Stu" (featuring Rolling Stones cofounder/collaborator Ian Stewart on piano), did not appear on the album, but were included four years later on the double album Physical Graffiti.

==Album title==

After the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive, critical reaction Led Zeppelin III had received in late 1970, Page decided that the next Led Zeppelin album would not have a title, but would instead feature four hand-drawn symbols on the inner sleeve and record label, each one chosen by the band member it represents. "We decided that on the fourth album, we would deliberately play down the group name, and there wouldn't be any information whatsoever on the outer jacket", Page explained. "Names, titles and things like that do not mean a thing."[ref]

Page has also stated that the decision to release the album without any written information on the album sleeve was contrary to strong advice given to him by a press agent, who said that after a year's absence from both records and touring, the move would be akin to "professional suicide". In his words: "We just happened to have a lot of faith in what we were doing." In an interview he gave to The Times in 2010, he elaborated:
Releasing the album without an official title has made it difficult to consistently identify. While most commonly called Led Zeppelin IV, Atlantic Records catalogues have used the names Four Symbols and The Fourth Album. It has also been referred to as ZoSo (which Page's symbol appears to spell), Untitled and Runes.Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9. Page frequently refers to the album in interviews as "the fourth album" and "Led Zeppelin IV",Dave Schulps, Interview with Jimmy Page, Trouser Press, October 1977.Interview with Jimmy Page, Guitar World magazine, 1993[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/reference/index.php?m=assorted3|title=Led Zeppelin Assorted Info|author=Led-Zeppelin.org|accessdate=15 March 2011[/tpl] and Plant thinks of it as "the fourth album, that's it".Austin Scaggs, Q&A: Robert Plant[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl], Rolling Stone, 5 May 2005. Not only does the album have no title, but there is no printing anywhere on the front or back cover, or even a catalogue number on the spine (at least on the original LP release).

==The four symbols==

The idea for each member of the band to choose a personal emblem for the cover was Page's. In an interview he gave in 1977, he recalled:
 "After all this crap that we'd had with the critics, I put it to everybody else that it'd be a good idea to put out something totally anonymous. At first I wanted just one symbol on it, but then it was decided that since it was our fourth album and there were four of us, we could each choose our own symbol. I designed mine and everyone else had their own reasons for using the symbols that they used." 
Page stated that he designed his own symbol and has never publicly disclosed any reasoning behind it. However, it has been argued that his symbol appeared as early as 1557 to represent Saturn.[tpl]cite web| title = Zoso Jimmy Page's symbol| url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120222124002/http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm| archivedate=22 February 2012| accessdate =5 March 2013[/tpl]
The symbol is sometimes referred to as "ZoSo", though Page has explained that it was not in fact intended to be a word at all.
Bassist John Paul Jones' symbol, which he chose from Rudolf Koch's Book of Signs, is a single circle intersecting three vesica pisces (a triquetra). It is intended to symbolise a person who possesses both confidence and competence.
Drummer John Bonham's symbol, the three interlocking (Borromean) rings, was picked by the drummer from the same book. It represents the triad of mother, father and child,In the 1990 Bonham tribute radio special, "It's Been a Long Time", son Jason Bonham confirmed that the symbol was chosen as a representation of man, woman and child- but, inverted, it also happens to be the logo for Ballantine beer.
Singer Robert Plant's symbol of a feather within a circle was his own design, being based on the sign of the supposed Mu civilisation.
There is also a fifth, smaller symbol chosen by guest vocalist Sandy Denny representing her contribution to the track "The Battle of Evermore"; it appears in the credits list on the inner sleeve of the LP, serving as an asterisk and is shaped like three triangles touching at their points. Ironically, inverted this symbol is used by the British Ministry of Transport (MOT, now called Department of Transport) to show that the automobile service establishment outside of which it is displayed, is licensed to carry out the mandatory test all British vehicles over 3 years old, have to pass to remain road legal.
During Led Zeppelin's tour of the United Kingdom in winter 1971, which took place shortly following the release of the album, the band visually projected the four symbols on their stage equipment. Page's symbol was put onto one of his Marshall amplifiers, Bonham's three interlinked circles adorned the outer skin of his bass drum, Jones had his symbol stencilled onto material which was draped across his Fender Rhodes keyboard, and Plant's feather symbol was painted onto a side speaker PA cabinet. Only Page's and Bonham's symbols were retained for subsequent Led Zeppelin concert tours.[tpl]cite book| last = Lewis| first = Dave| coauthors = Pallett, Simon| title = Led Zeppelin: The Concert File| year = 2007| publisher = Omnibus Press| location = London| isbn = 0-7119-5307-4| page = 72[/tpl]

==Album cover and inside sleeve==

The 19th-century rustic oil painting on the front of the album was purchased from an antique shop in Reading, Berkshire by Plant. The painting was then juxtaposed and affixed to the internal, papered wall of the partly demolished suburban house for the photograph to be taken.
Page has explained that the cover of the fourth album was intended to bring out a city/country dichotomy that had initially surfaced on Led Zeppelin III:
 It represented the change in the balance which was going on. There was the old countryman and the blocks of flats being knocked down. It was just a way of saying that we should look after the earth, not rape and pillage it. 
However, regarding the meaning of the album cover, he has also stated:
 The cover was supposed to be something that was for other people to savour rather than for me to actually spell everything out, which would make the whole thing rather disappointing on that level of your own personal adventure into the music.James Jackson, Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's good times, bad times and reunion rumours, The Times, 8 January 2010 . 
The album cover was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of "Classic Album Cover" postage stamps issued in January 2010.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jan/08/coldplay-album-stamp-approval | title=Coldplay album gets stamp of approval from Royal Mail |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=8 January 2010| accessdate=8 January 2010 | first=Sean | last=Michaels[/tpl]
The inside illustration, entitled "The Hermit" and credited to Barrington Colby MOM, was influenced by the design of the card of the same name in the Rider-Waite tarot deck. This character was later portrayed by Page himself in Led Zeppelin's concert film, The Song Remains the Same (1976). The inner painting is also referred to as View in Half or Varying Light and was sold at auction under that name in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oldbuckeye.com/ifmtl3.html |title=The Infrequently Murmured Led Zeppelin Trivia List |publisher=Oldbuckeye.com |accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl]
Varied versions of the artwork within the album exist. Some versions depict a longhaired and bearded supplicant climbing at the base of the mountain, while some others do not show the six pointed star within the hermit's lantern. If the inside cover of the album is held vertically against a mirror, a man's face can be seen hidden in the rocks below the hermit. Speculation exists that the face is actually that of a black dog.
The typeface for the lyrics to "Stairway to Heaven", printed on the inside sleeve of the album, was Page's contribution. He found it in an old arts and crafts magazine called The Studio which dated from the late 19th century. He thought the lettering was interesting and arranged for someone to create a whole alphabet.[tpl]Cite news | last = Tolinski | first = Brad | last2 = Di Bendetto | first2 = Greg | title = Light and Shade | newspaper = Guitar World |date=January 1998 | postscript = [/tpl]

==Release and reception==

In the lead-up to the album's release, a series of teaser advertisements depicting each symbol was placed in the music press. The album was a massive instant seller. It entered the UK chart at No. 10, rising to No.1 the following week and stayed on the chart for 77 weeks. In the US it stayed on the charts longer than any other Led Zeppelin album and became the biggest selling album in the US not to top the charts (peaking at #2). "Ultimately," writes Lewis, "the fourth Zeppelin album would be the most durable seller in their catalogue and the most impressive critical and commercial success of their career". At one point, it was ranked as one of the top five best-selling albums of all time.
Led Zeppelin IV received overwhelming praise from critics.[tpl]cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|year=2006|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|volume=5|page=140|isbn=0195313739|edition=4th|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye called it the band's "most consistently good" album yet and praised the diversity of the songs: "out of eight cuts, there isn't one that steps on another's toes, that tries to do too much all at once."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/led-zeppelin-iv-19711223 |title=Rolling Stone Review |work=Rolling Stone |date=23 December 1971 |accessdate=20 May 2011[/tpl] Billboard magazine called it a "powerhouse album" that has the commercial potential of the band's previous three albums.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70|accessdate=31 January 2014|page=70|title=Album Reviews|journal=Billboard|date=20 November 1971[/tpl]
