[[Thomas Hopper (architect)]]

CATEGORIES: 19th-century English architects, 1776 births, 1856 deaths

Thomas Hopper (1776â€“1856) was an English architect of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, much favoured by King George IV, and particularly notable for his work on country houses across southern England, with occasional forays further afield, into Wales and Northern Ireland. He was involved with improvements to the Shire Hall in Monmouth under "Royal assent" where he and Edward Haycock made the building extend down Agincourt Street creating room for a new staircase and larger courts. Hopper took up residence in Monnow Street in Monmouth whilst this was happening.
In 1840 he exhibited designs for Butterton Hall in Staffordshire. This gothic building lasted until the first World War when it was demolished due to misuse during the war.[tpl]cite web|title=Butterton Hall|url=http://lh.matthewbeckett.com/houses/lh_staffordshire_buttertonhall.html|publisher=lost country houses of England[/tpl]
Hopper died in 1856.
