[[70 BC]]

CATEGORIES: 70 BC

Year 70 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Magnus and Dives (or, less frequently, year 684 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 70 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
