John Gudenus (born 23 November 1940 in Vienna) is an Austrian retired member of the Federal Council of AustriaArt 2006, p. 140 on a free mandate (formerly as a member of the Freedom Party of Austria), and colonel of the Austrian Bundesheer.
In 2006, Gudenus received a one-year suspended sentence for breaking the Verbotsgesetz, Austria's laws against denying or diminishing the Holocaust.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4949254.stm | title = Holocaust denier | work = European press review | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-04-27 [/tpl]  Gudenus had suggested that it was necessary to verify the existence of gas chambers in the Third Reich and later remarked that there had been gas chambers in Poland but not in the Third Reich.
Austria's Der Standard newspaper argued that these two remarks were "cynical and humiliating", and show contempt for the Verbotsgesetz.
