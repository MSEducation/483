The park was constructed in the 1930s as WPA project and is noted for its unique network of stone walls and stone seating above the softball fields. Built on land donated by prominent Charlotte developer E. C. Griffith, it was one of the first projects of the Charlotte Park and Recreation Commission.Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission: Survey and Research Report on Bryant Park
In the 1960s and 1970s, when the Charlotte Parks Commission was underfunded and mostly powerless, intense industrial development on West Morehead Street forced Bryant Park to give up much of its original space. Today the park is less than half its original size. Bryant Park remains the only public green space in Charlotteâ€™s West Morehead Street industrial sector.
