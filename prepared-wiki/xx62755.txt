Sean Christopher McMullen (born midnight 21 December 1948 in Sale, Victoria) is an award-winning Australian science fiction and fantasy author.

==Biography==

McMullen is one of Australia's leading science-fiction and fantasy authors, and has written over seventy stories and seventeen books. In 2011, his novelette "Eight Miles" was the runner-up in the Hugo Awards, and has won the Analog Reader's Award twice, for "Ninety Thousand Horses" in 2013 and "Tower of Wings" in 2002. 
His first novel was originally published in Australia as two separate books, Voices In The Light (1994) and Mirrorsun Rising (1995). His first internationally published novel was "The Centurion's Empire" (1998), which featured a time machine built during the Roman Empire. After the success of "The Centurion's Empire", his first two novels were rewritten and combined for a publication in the US as Souls In The Great Machine (1999), which, in turn, became the first volume of the Greatwinter trilogy, a unique mix of the generally anti-genres Steampunk and Cyberpunk. This was followed by the "Moonworlds" series, which saw McMullen blend science and romance in a fantasy setting. His most recent series is the "Century War" series for young adult readers, set in Melbourne in 1901. 
Sean's non-fiction work includes the non-fiction Strange Constellations: A History of Australian Science Fiction, a history of Australian science fiction jointly written with Van Ikin and Russell Blackford. He also co-wrote the first histories of Australian fantasy and horror with Steven Paulsen.
McMullen has a degree in physics and history from Melbourne University (1974), a postgraduate degree in library and information science, and a PhD in Medieval Literature. He was a professional musician in the 1970s, concentrating on singing and guitar playing. He currently works full-time in scientific computing, and he is a third dan black belt in karate, teaching at the Melbourne University Karate club. He is the father of C. S. McMullen, an Australian speculative fiction author.
