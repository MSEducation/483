[[Pruflas]]

CATEGORIES: Demons

In demonology, and according to Johann Weyer and his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, Pruflas is a Great Prince and Duke of Hell that has twenty-six legions of demons under his command. He causes men to commit quarrels, discord, and falsehood, and should be never admitted into any place, but if conjured, he gives truthful, generous answers to the conjurer's questions.
He is depicted as a flame outside the Tower of Babel, where he uses to reside, and sometimes his head is seen as that of a hawk.
This demon is not listed in the Ars Goetia of The Lesser Key of Solomon.
Other spelling: Bufas.
