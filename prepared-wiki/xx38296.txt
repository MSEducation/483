The Cheshire Cat ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|ʃ|ər[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|ʃ|ɪər[/tpl]) is a fictional cat popularised by Lewis Carroll in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and known for its distinctive mischievous grin.

==Origins==

A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue (1788) by Francis Grose (The Second Edition, Corrected and Enlarged, London) contains the following entry: "CHESHIRE CAT. He grins like a Cheshire cat; said of any one who shows his teeth and gums in laughing."
The phrase appears again in print in John Wolcot's pseudonymous Peter Pindar's Pair of Lyric Epistles (1792): "Lo, like a Cheshire cat our court will grin." 

===Dairy farming===

A possible origin of the phrase "Grinning like a Cheshire Cat" is one favoured by the people of Cheshire, which boasts numerous dairy farms; hence the cats grin because of the abundance of milk and cream.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheshire%20cat |title=Cheshire cat – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |work=merriam-webster.com |year=2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl]

===Cheese moulds===

Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable says grinning like a Cheshire cat is "an old simile, popularised by Lewis Carroll". According to Brewer's Dictionary, "The phrase has never been satisfactorily accounted for, but it has been said that cheese was formerly sold in Cheshire moulded like a cat that looked as though it was grinning".As stated in the Annotated Alice The cheese was cut from the tail end, so that the last part eaten was the head of the smiling cat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

===Church carvings===

There are many reports that Carroll found inspiration for the name and expression of the Cheshire Cat in the 16th century sandstone carving of a grinning cat, on the west face of St. Wilfrid's Church tower in Grappenhall, a village adjacent to his birthplace in Daresbury, Cheshire.[tpl]cn|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Lewis Carroll's father, Reverend Charles Dodgson, was Rector of Croft and Archdeacon of Richmond in North Yorkshire, England, from 1843 to 1868; Carroll lived here from 1843 to 1850.[tpl]cite book | last=Clark | first=Ann | year=1979 | title=Lewis Carroll: A Biography | place=London | publisher=J.

In 1992, members of the Lewis Carroll Society attributed it to a gargoyle found on a pillar in St. Nicolas Church, Cranleigh, where Carroll used to travel frequently when he lived in Guildford (though this is doubtful as he moved to Guildford some three years after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland had been published) and a carving in a church in the village of Croft-on-Tees, in the north east of England, where his father had been rector.[tpl]cite news|title=Cheshire Cat found by fans of Lewis Carroll|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=8 July 1992|agency=Reuters|location=Toronto ON|page=C24[/tpl]

==Alice's Adventures in Wonderland==

Alice first encounters the Cheshire Cat at the Duchess' house in her kitchen, and then later outside on the branches of a tree, where it appears and disappears at will, engaging Alice in amusing but sometimes vexing conversation. The cat sometimes raises philosophical points that annoy or baffle Alice. It does, however, appear to cheer her up when it turns up suddenly at the Queen of Hearts' croquet field, and when sentenced to death baffles everyone by having made its head appear without its body, sparking a massive argument between the executioner and the King and Queen of Hearts about whether something that does not have a body can indeed be beheaded.
At one point, the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin, prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.Annotated Alice; the statement "a grin without a cat" is a reference to mathematics dissociating itself completely from the natural world.

==Cultural uses==

The Cheshire Cat is one of many iconic characters depicted in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that have become enmeshed in popular culture,[tpl]cite book| last = Silvey| first = Anita| title = The essential guide to children's books and their creators| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year = 2002| page = 78| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8GUNHGutszEC| id =| isbn = 0-618-19082-1[/tpl] appearing in various forms of media, from political cartoons to television.Joan L.

===Adaptations of the Alice books in film and other media===

====Disney film====

In the 1951 Disney animated film, Alice in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat is depicted as an intelligent yet mischievous character that sometimes helps Alice and sometimes gets her into trouble. He frequently sings the first verse of the Jabberwocky poem. The Disney interpretation of the Cheshire Cat is able to separate his body parts and rearrange them as he pleases.

====1999 TV film====

In the 1999 television adaptation of the books, the Cheshire Cat is portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg. She fully acts as an ally and friend to Alice, the latter defending the cat when she is threatened with execution.

====2010 film====

The Cheshire Cat appears in Walt Disney's 2010 Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton. In the movie, Cheshire (as he is referred to by other Wonderland characters) first appears to Alice as she is walking alone in the forest. He helps her by binding the wound she suffered earlier by the Bandersnatch and taking her to the Hatter and the March Hare. He is later blamed by the Hatter for deserting during the Red Queen's attack where the White Queen's throne was usurped. It should be noted that the Cheshire Cat defends himself by saying that he did not leave, but merely turned invisible. However, as the plot moves along, he redeems himself by changing his form to resemble the Hatter during his execution and then evaporates as the axe is about to make contact, thus fooling everyone as the Hatter's hat floats up to the Queen's seat and Cheshire appears and winks. The character was voiced by Stephen Fry. In the video game adaptation of the movie, Cheshire is a playable character who can not only turn himself invisible, but other objects around him as well.

===Other major appearances and cultural references===

Prior to the release of the 1951 Walt Disney animated adaptation of the story, scholars observed few specific allusions to this character. Martin Gardner, author of The Annotated Alice, wondered if T. S. Eliot had the Cheshire Cat in mind when writing Morning at the Window but notes no other significant allusions in the pre-war period.[ref]
