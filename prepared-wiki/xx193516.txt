==Career==

Bohl started to play football with TuS Wachenheim, where he stayed until 1997. At the age of 14, he joined VfL Neustadt/Weinstraße and later SV Weingarten. As an important player in Weingarten he had the opportunity to go to the reserve squad of 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the third-tier Regionalliga, where he scored six times in 23 games during the 2005–06 season. He played in two of the final three games of the first squad in the Bundesliga, but had to see his club going down to the 2. Bundesliga. 
There he became a frequent starter and scored six times during the 2006–07 season. He demonstrated his prowess during the game against TuS Koblenz, when he scored two times after a 0–2 and lead his squad to a 4–3 victory.
After the 2007–08 season, Bohl left Kaiserslautern and joined 3. Liga club VfR Aalen. On 2 June 2009, he signed a contract with SV Wehen Wiesbaden and transferred to Eintracht Braunschweig in January 2011. With Braunschweig, Bohl won promotion twice – from the 3. Liga to the 2. Bundesliga in 2011, and from the 2. Bundesliga to the Bundesliga in 2013. However, his contract in Braunschweig was not renewed after the 2012–13 season.[tpl]cite news | title = Verträge mit Kessel und Vrancic verlängert  | url = http://www.eintracht.com/eintracht/aktuelles/news/mannschaft/einzelansicht.html?news=10607&cHash=56b4acf7e4f8309b376dced9a788f54c | accessdate = 17 May 2013 | publisher = Eintracht Braunschweig  | date = 17 May 2013 | language = German[/tpl]
