CATEGORIES: Anti-patterns, Computer jargon

In software development, Small Matter of Programming (SMOP) or Simple Matter of Programming is a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change would in fact require a great deal of effort; it often implies that the person proposing the feature underestimates its cost. Such underestimated costs are common during cost estimation, particularly near the beginning of a project. The Jargon File describes an SMOPSimple Matter of Programming (Jargon File, version 4.4.7) as:
SMOP was among the "games" described in an article  as paralleling the Games People Play identified by Dr. Eric Berne in the field of self-help psychology.
