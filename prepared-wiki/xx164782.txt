==Plot==

Jung Mu-young (Park Hae-jin) was the love child borne of an affair his father Kim Tae-shik (Jung Han-yong) once had. Tae-shik and his wife Park Myung-ja (Jung Ae-ri) raised Mu-young together with his half-brother Kim Sang-hyun (Lee Joo-hyun). Despite a lack of money, Myung-ja has managed to keep the family together; moreover, she never once treated Mu-young any differently than her biological son. Still, Mu-young is outwardly rebellious, unforgiving, and in constant conflict with his family; he keeps an emotional distance from them, for fear of getting hurt one day. Then he meets the cheerful and kindhearted Seok Ji-soo (Han Hyo-joo), who not only values her family greatly, but goes out of her way to help others. As he sees Ji-soo putting a lot of effort into making her family relationships happy and harmonious, Mu-young's heart mellows and she brings out the best in him. 
But in a twist of fate, Ji-soo begins working for Myung-ja's stepsister Park Myung-joo (Yoon Hae-young), and learns that she and her single father Seok Jong-hoon (Hong Yo-seob) are in love. Though Ji-soo fully supports her father's newfound romance, she's conflicted because if her father ends up marrying Myung-joo, then she and her own boyfriend Mu-young will become step-cousins. 
Like Land and Sky tackles the issues the modern family faces, such as the difficulties faced by stepparents and stepchildren; conflicts between biological and adoptive parents; the aftermath of a remarriage; and the high divorce rate among the younger generation, and resulting involuntary childcare from their grandparents.
