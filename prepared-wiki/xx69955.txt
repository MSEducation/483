[tpl]nihongo|Sonic Adventure 2|ソニックアドベンチャー2|Sonikku Adobenchā Tsū|lead=yes[/tpl] is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team USA and published by Sega for the Dreamcast console and the last Sonic game to be released for a Sega console and is a sequel to 1998's Sonic Adventure. It was released in North America, Europe, and Japan in June 2001 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game was ported to the Nintendo GameCube and re-titled [tpl]nihongo|Sonic Adventure 2: Battle|ソニックアドベンチャー2 バトル|Sonikku Adobenchā Tsū: Batoru[/tpl], with brand-new features as well as minor changes in the level design. The original game and content from Battle was released in high-definition on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in October 2012. A version for Microsoft Windows was released in November 2012.
The game takes place after the events of its predecessing game: Sonic Adventure. The series antagonist Doctor Eggman releases Shadow the Hedgehog, who joins Eggman and treasure hunter Rouge the Bat to steal the seven Chaos Emeralds. The game's story focuses on the protagonists Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna and Miles "Tails" Prower as they attempt to stop Eggman and Shadow from collecting the Chaos Emeralds.
The game was a commercial success, and received positive reviews; however, criticism was directed towards its camera system and side characters. Sonic Adventure 2: Battle was less positively received than the original release, but it was a commercial success, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide and becoming the tenth best-selling Nintendo GameCube game.

==Gameplay==

Sonic Adventure 2 is a platform game in which the player controls several characters such as Sonic and Shadow the Hedgehog. The game follows the same basic principles of previous games in the series. However, the Tails and Doctor Eggman stages use a health bar which is reloaded by gathering rings. Item capsules are also located within the stages, which provide the player bonuses. Each character has obtainable power-ups which grant them new abilities, such as the ability to destroy metal boxes or play mystical melodies. The player is given a set of lives, which are lost when the character is attacked by an enemy or falls into water or a pit. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game is over.
The game can be played between two parallel story lines, the "Hero" story mode and the "Dark" story mode. The player has the option of advancing in either story at any time. The "Hero" story features Sonic, Knuckles the Echidna, and Miles "Tails" Prower, while the "Dark" story features Shadow, Rouge the Bat, and Doctor Eggman. Each dark character plays similarly to its corresponding hero character, respectively. Levels advance in the same order for both story lines. Levels featuring Sonic or Shadow are regular platform levels, designed in much the same way as Sonic's levels in Sonic Adventure.[tpl]cite web|author=Chau, Anthony|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/164/164855p1.html|title=Sonic Adventure 2 review|accessdate=2009-11-03[/tpl] The player's primary objective is to reach the end of the level. Levels with Tails or Dr. Eggman are based on shooting, allowing the player to control a mechanized robot walker and shoot their way to the end, reminiscent of E-102 Gamma's stages in Sonic Adventure. The Knuckles and Rouge levels are based on hunting and exploring, with the characters scouring the levels for three keys, usually shards of the Master Emerald, much like Knuckles' levels in Sonic Adventure. Interspersed among the levels are various bosses, which one specific character must fight. The main story line can only be completed by finishing both the "Hero" and "Dark" story lines. When the main story line is completed, an extra "Last" story mode is introduced in which the player must use all 6 characters back-to-back followed by the final boss with Super Sonic and Super Shadow to achieve the true ending.
If the player can complete an entire level, the player is informed of how well they have done and which letter grade rank is awarded. If the player completes any score-ranked mission with all of the level's rings, an A Rank is automatically awarded.
In Action Stages, players must collect rings and defeat enemies, with a timer counting the time spent within the level. Five missions are assigned to each Action Stage; to access the next mission, the player must successfully complete each previous mission. In order from first to last, the missions are to complete the level, collect 100 rings, find a "lost Chao" using the Mystic Melody, finish within a time limit, and complete a "Hard mode" version of the Action Stage. Special powers are acquired by collecting a certain number of rings; these moves are also seen in the final bosses of the Hero and Dark stories.
Emblems can be collected for each mission. There are 180 in total. Players must complete mission and achieve an A rank in all stages and missions. After collecting all 180 Emblems the player unlocks the 3D Green Hill level, a remake of Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic the Hedgehog game.
In the game's two-player mode, the corresponding characters from the "Hero" and "Dark" stories are able to play against one another in racing levels, shooting levels, and treasure-hunting levels. Stages from the main one-player game are available in this mode, slightly altered for competitive play. The goals for each stage are to defeat the other player by completing a task first: racing levels require the player to reach the Goal ring, shooting levels end when one Walker runs out of energy either by being destroyed by the competitor or falling off the stage, and the treasure hunting levels are won when one character gets two of the three Emerald shards.
Special features in this two-player mode are unlocked by meeting certain conditions in the single player mode. Additional characters include familiar characters from previous games, but they must be unlocked in the original Dreamcast version: Amy Rose and Metal Sonic complement Sonic and Shadow, Chao Walker and either Big or Dark Chao Walker complement Tails and Eggman, and Tikal and Chaos Zero complement Knuckles and Rouge. Alternative costumes are usable only in two player mode and vary in each version of the game, as do the conditions required to unlock the costumes. The costumes are only for the 6 story mode characters Sonic, Shadow, Tails, Dr. Eggman, Rogue and Knuckles.[tpl]Citation Needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Chao minigame===

Chao exist in an area held separate from the rest of the game called Chao World, and are to be raised by the player. Chao World incorporates three main areas: the Chao Garden, the Chao Kindergarten, and the Chao Race Lobby.
The player finds and raises Chao in the Chao Garden. When Chao hatch, they crawl and are unable to swim. When a Chao begins to grow up, it will eventually go into a cocoon stage in which it will transform. Depending on how each Chao in the garden was raised and treated during childhood, it can become a "light", "dark", or generic Chao. Cylinder-shaped items called "chaos drives" and hidden animals can be found in the action stages and can be given to Chao during childhood to boost the Chao's stats and physical attributes.
The Chao Kindergarten is where the player can take the Chao to have it named, have its health and stats checked, and have it learn new skills. Also, in the GameCube adaptation only, rare items can be purchased at the Black Market using the Rings collected during normal gameplay. The Black Market is also available in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut; in that version, with more game Emblems earned, rarer merchandise becomes available in the Market.

==Plot==

Following from where Sonic Adventure left off, Sonic defeats Perfect Chaos and saves Earth from destruction. After discovering the existence of a secret weapon mentioned in the diary of his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility in search of it. This "weapon," a black hedgehog named Shadow who claims that he is the "Ultimate Life Form," offers to help Eggman take over the world, telling the scientist to rendezvous with him at the abandoned Space Colony ARK with more Chaos Emeralds. Shadow proceeds in stealing one of the Emeralds. During the event, Shadow has a flashback to the final moments of a young girl named "Maria," begging him to complete an unspecified task—which he interprets as a request for revenge. Because Shadow makes a hasty retreat and no one is able to get a good look at him, G.U.N. officials mistake Shadow for Sonic. After escaping from the military, Sonic is arrested again shortly after a confrontation with Shadow, who demonstrates to Sonic the Chaos Control technique.
Meanwhile, Knuckles confronts both Rouge the Bat and Eggman, who each attempt to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles shatters the Master Emerald to prevent this, and proceeds to search for the scattered shards and restore the Emerald. While Rouge intends to collect the shards for personal benefit, she must also accomplish a mission for the government to spy on Eggman. This mission causes her to infiltrate Dr. Eggman's base, which also leads her to the ARK, where Shadow relays to Eggman his plan to use the Chaos Emeralds to charge a "super weapon" on the ARK called the Eclipse Cannon to take over the world. To accomplish this, Shadow and Eggman recruit Rouge to assist in the search of the Chaos Emeralds.
Tails and Amy infiltrate Prison Island and rescue Sonic from G.U.N., while Eggman, Shadow, and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island, they then destroy it. Eggman then broadcasts his threats across the planet and demonstrates the cannon's level of power by destroying half of the moon. Sonic and company use the final Emerald within their possession to track down the other six, with Knuckles coming along as well. Together, the group infiltrates Eggman's base, narrowly boarding Eggman's shuttle as it launches into space. Along the ride into space, Knuckles' Master Emerald shards are spilled, and he leaves the group to collect them, encountering Rouge again. During the fight, Knuckles saves Rouge from certain death, and Rouge surrenders her collected shards, finally allowing Knuckles to restore the Master Emerald.
On board the ARK, Tails reveals that he has created a counterfeit Chaos Emerald designed to reverse the energy fields of the real ones, although it is less powerful. Sonic goes to place the fake Chaos Emerald into the Cannon when Eggman announces that he has captured Tails and Amy. Sonic tries to trick Eggman by giving him the fake Chaos Emerald, but at the last second, Eggman, suspecting such a trick, traps and jettisons Sonic in an escape pod rigged with explosives. Using the fake Chaos Emerald, Sonic manages to perform Chaos Control and escape the pod before it explodes, but Tails, thinking Sonic is dead, fights Eggman. Shadow is sent to intercept Sonic before he destroys the Eclipse Cannon, but Sonic succeeds.
Once Eggman collects all seven Chaos Emeralds and attempts to fire the Eclipse Cannon at full power, a failsafe activates, the ARK begins to fall toward Earth, and a recorded message from the late Gerald Robotnik is broadcast around the world. It explains that he arranged for the ARK to collide with Earth and destroy it, as revenge against humanity. Reading his diary, the two teams on the ARK discover that Gerald Robotnik's hatred for all humans is because they condemned him and his research and killed numerous colleagues, including his granddaughter (and Eggman's cousin) Maria, on board the ARK. Eggman determines the energy of the Chaos Emeralds is causing the ARK to fall toward Earth, and everyone agrees to work together to intercept the energy at the Eclipse Cannon's core and neutralize the energy using the repaired Master Emerald to stop the collision. Shadow initially does not participate, due to his apathy toward humankind; however, Amy pleads for Shadow to help, reminding him of Maria's true request, not for revenge, but to serve as a benefit for society. He catches up with Sonic and Knuckles after they make their way to the cannon core.
After disabling the various security features guarding the core, Sonic and Knuckles encounter the Biolizard, a prototype of the Ultimate Life Form, and Shadow's "biological" brother, who had been awoken from stasis to ensure that the Emeralds would not be tampered with. Shadow defeats the Biolizard, allowing Knuckles to neutralize the Chaos energy and deactivate the Chaos Emeralds using the Master Emerald. However, the injured Biolizard uses Chaos Control to fuse with the Eclipse Cannon, becoming the Finalhazard and continuing the ARK's collision course by physically dragging it along. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic and Shadow transform into Super Sonic and Super Shadow and defeat the Biolizard (as the Finalhazard), which is fused to the ARK. They then use Chaos Control to teleport the ARK back into a stable orbit around Earth. The process, however, depletes Shadow's energy, and he is rendered unable to remain in orbit. He plummets to Earth, and to his apparent death, content that he has fulfilled his promise to Maria. As humanity celebrates openly, the two teams reflect on both the events that have transpired, concerning Shadow's sacrifice and Gerald Robotnik's intent to destroy Earth, and their new plans from there. As they leave the station, Sonic bids a final farewell to Shadow.

==Development==

Sonic Adventure 2 was developed by Sega Studio USA, the now-defunct United States division of Sonic Team, and published by Sega. The game was directed by longtime series contributor Takashi Iizuka, and was developed over the course of a year and a half. Its development took place during a hectic time for Sega and Sega Studio USA; they knew before the game's completion that the Dreamcast was failing economically and would be Sega's last console for the foreseeable future. They were also working on the intensive Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2 and other titles for the GameCube and Game Boy Advance.
The game was designed to be action-oriented as opposed to the slower-paced, more story-based Sonic Adventure. To that end, Sega Studio USA prioritized making the game run at 60 frames per second and effecting a "tempo" by giving Sonic a variety of actions rather than focusing only on speed. The levels were set up to further this flow and make Sonic seem faster than he really was. From an aesthetic perspective, Sega Studio USA took inspiration for the levels and environments from San Francisco—the location of their headquarters—and from other American locations such as Yosemite National Park where they vacationed during development of the game.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview With Sonic Adventure 2 Director Takashi Iizuka|publisher=IGN|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095406p1.html|date=June 4, 2001|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=February 19, 2010[/tpl] The level design process involved redesigns to prioritize the framerate, but was more streamlined than Adventure[tpl]'[/tpl]s as a result of the team's experience with the Dreamcast hardware.
While the Chao were—as Iizuka has described—a "relative neutral entity" in Sonic Adventure, Sega Studio USA decided to expand the creatures' presence in its sequel, and added the ability to raise "Hero" and "Dark" Chao to artistically complement the game's inherent good–evil dichotomy. The developers made sure to give all six playable characters roughly equal gameplay time for the same reason, unlike in Adventure where Big the Cat's and E-102 Gamma's stories were short. Unlike in Adventure, Chao were given the ability to socialize so that they would resemble a "real artificial life form."
Sega announced a follow-up to Sonic Adventure, as well as a spinoff title (which would become Sonic Shuffle), in October 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/05/sega-speaks-out-on-sonic-adventure-follow-up|publisher=IGN|author=IGN Staff|title=Sega Speaks Out on Sonic Adventure Follow-up|date=October 4, 1999|accessdate=February 26, 2014[/tpl] The newly named Sonic Adventure 2 was shown off at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2000, and Sonic Team shortly placed the footage shown there on their website in late June of 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/01/first-direct-feed-footage-of-sonic-adventure-2|publisher=IGN|date=June 30, 2000|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|title=First Direct Feed Footage of Sonic Adventure 2|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl] Sonic Team later posted a trailer and numerous screenshots in late May of 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/31/new-sonic-adventure-2-trailer-and-screens|author=IGN Staff|date=May 31, 2001|publisher=IGN|title=New Sonic Adventure 2 Trailer and Screens|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl] Sega promoted Sonic Adventure 2 both as the final Sonic game for the Dreamcast, and as marking the tenth anniversary of the original Sonic the Hedgehog.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Official Dreamcast Magazine|issue=23|page=p. 26|title=Forecast: Sonic Adventure 2[/tpl] Sega also held a 10-year anniversary party for Sonic in June 2001; attendees could compete in a battle tournament whose winner played against Iizuka.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-turns-10/1100-2782086/|publisher=GameSpot|date=July 2, 2001|last=Torres|first=Ricardo|title=Sonic the Hedgehog turns 10|accessdate=February 16, 2014[/tpl]
The GameCube—rather than the competing Xbox or PlayStation 2—was chosen to receive a port of Sonic Adventure 2 because of its "56k" technology. Sega and Sega Studio USA were unconcerned with the fact that the Xbox would feature Broadband Internet connectivity upon its release while the GameCube would not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/05/22/chatting-with-sega-developers|publisher=IGN|date=May 22, 2001|last=Chau|first=Anthony|title=Chatting with SEGA Developers|accessdate=February 15, 2014[/tpl]

===Music===

Jun Senoue returned as head composer for this game with assistance from Kenichi Tokoi, Fumie Kumatani, and Tomoya Ohtani.

Sonic Adventure 2 Vocals Collection: Cuts Unleashed was produced by Jun Senoue and released on August 21, 2001 by MMV. It contains musical tracks from the game composed by Jun Senoue and Kenichi Tokoi.

Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the first Sonic game, Sonic Adventure 2 Original Soundtrack 20th Anniversary Edition was released in June 2011 featuring a selection of fan-favorite songs from the game.

==Alternative versions and releases==

===GameCube port===

The Nintendo GameCube adaption of Sonic Adventure 2, called Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, was released on December 20, 2001 in Japan, February 11, 2002 in North America, and on the GameCube's launch (May 3, 2002) in Europe, making it the first in the series to be released for the Nintendo system. This game changed a large portion of raising Chao. A Chao's stats can be viewed from within the game.[tpl]cite book|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Instruction Booklet|pages=50–55[/tpl] The player can transfer one Chao from Sonic Adventure 2 Battle to the "Tiny Chao Garden" section in Sonic Advance, Sonic Advance 2, and Sonic Pinball Party with the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable. If a Game Boy Advance is connected without a GBA game inserted, a version of the Tiny Chao Garden can be copied temporarily into the Game Boy Advance's memory. Chao Karate was also introduced in this version. The Chao's stats are used against a computer-controlled opponent to fight in a fighting game style, but with minimal influence from the player and very little in terms of actual karate.[tpl]cite book|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Instruction Booklet|page=46[/tpl] The layouts of all three Chao Gardens were also changed slightly, with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle's Chao Gardens significantly smaller than those of the original Dreamcast version.
The "Battle" multiplayer options were expanded in the GameCube version, including the addition of new characteristics to the multiplayer-exclusive characters, while removing all online play.[tpl]cite book|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Instruction Booklet|pages=18–23[/tpl] Also, the additional features for the kart mode are not required to be unlocked in the GameCube version.
There are several aesthetic changes, as well. In the GameCube version, minor special effects were changed such as rain in the "White Jungle" level. Also, when playing as Knuckles or Rouge, an exclamation (!) will appear above his or her head when directly nearby their targets. Some cutscenes were also redone slightly, with different character animations and camera angles. Some rankings had their requirements changed. Big the Cat's cameos did not remain in the stages or Hero cutscenes, but he can still be viewed in some Dark and Final story sequences by rapidly pressing the A or B buttons throughout the scenes. A Dark Chao (with Dark Chao Walker) replaces Big the Cat in two-player mode.

==Reception==

The game's original release on the Dreamcast received very positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the game an 89% rating, based on 18 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews." The game received praise for its fast-paced Sonic/Shadow levels, high-quality graphics, remodeled and enhanced Chao Garden and improved gameplay mechanics from the original. IGN's Anthony Chau praised the "astounding level design": "Whether it's the levels of speed for Sonic and Shadow, the shooting blast-a-thon of Tails and Eggman, or even the scavenger hunts of Knuckles and Rouge, the stages are both very large and wonderfully designed." GamePro wrote that "The game is sweet music to all of your senses, combining visual and audio splendor to a degree that few adventures have achieved." Famitsu magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 33 out of 40.
Like its predecessor, however, the game was subject to criticism concerning the game's camera system. Although sites like GameSpot admitted that the camera flaws in the original Sonic Adventure were "infinitely more frustrating by comparison" the sequel was still noted to "retain some of the quirky camera work". The game was also criticized for having a lack of challenging boss fights.
Despite these issues, the game was still a critical and commercial success with many reviewers agreeing that the game was one of the last great Dreamcast releases. IGN concluded that "If this is the last Sonic game in these declining Dreamcast years, it's satisfying to know that the DC didn't go out with a bang, but with a sonic boom."
The GameCube version, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, fared considerably worse in terms of reviews,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/sonic-adventure-2-battle|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on Metacritic for GameCube[/tpl] despite having few single-player gameplay changes from the Dreamcast version, and only an 8-month gap between their releases. Even in spite of the mixed reviews, the game sold 1.44 million units in the United States alone [tpl]as of|lc=y|2007|12[/tpl], making it one of the GameCube's highest selling games.[tpl]cite web|title=US Platinum Videogame Chart|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|work=The Magic Box|date=2007-12-27|accessdate=2008-12-05[/tpl] The game also sold well enough to be re-released as a Player's Choice title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/sonic-adventure-2-battle/related/release/platform/gamecube/|title=Release Summary: Sonic Adventure 2 Battle|work=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=2010-12-31[/tpl] In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the GameCube version of the game a 33 out of 40.ニンテンドーゲームキューブ - ソニックアドベンチャー2 バトル. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.97. 30 June 2006.
Sonic Adventure 2 has also won several awards: IGN's and GamePro's Editors' Choice Awards and GameSpy's "Best of 2001: Best Dreamcast Action/Adventure game". ScrewAttack also rated Sonic Adventure 2 as the fifth best Dreamcast game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.screwattack.com/shows/originals/screwattack-top-10s/top-10-dreamcast-games |title=Top 10 Dreamcast Games |publisher=ScrewAttack.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22[/tpl] GamesRadar rated Sonic Adventure 2 as the 10th best Dreamcast game out of a list of 25, stating that "Despite trailing off significantly in recent years, the 3D side of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise had a surprisingly stellar start with the Sonic Adventure entries, and the 2001 sequel really amped up the action".

==Legacy==

Sonic Adventure 2 introduced two new characters to the Sonic series: Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat. They have since frequently appeared in other Sonic series games, with Shadow even receiving a starring role in his own self-titled game.
For the series' 20th anniversary, Sonic Generations contained gameplay elements and levels from various Sonic series games. Elements from Sonic Adventure 2 included a remake of the City Escape stage in the console versions and a remake of the Radical Highway stage in the Nintendo 3DS version. Shadow also appears in a recreation of his boss battle, and the Biolizard boss is recreated exclusively in the 3DS version.
