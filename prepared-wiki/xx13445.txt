[[74]]

CATEGORIES: 74

Year 74 (LXXIV) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Vespasianus (or, less frequently, year 827 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 74 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
