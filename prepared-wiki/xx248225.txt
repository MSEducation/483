In September 2011, the original authors published a "Partial Retraction" of their 2009 findings, in which they acknowledged that "some of the CFS peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA preparations are contaminated with XMRV plasmid DNA."[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1212182 | title = Partial Retraction | year = 2011 | last1 = Silverman | first1 = R. | journal = Science | last2 = Das Gupta | first2 = J | last3 = Lombardi | first3 = VC | last4 = Ruscetti | first4 = FW | last5 = Pfost | first5 = MA | last6 = Hagen | first6 = KS | last7 = Peterson | first7 = DL | last8 = Ruscetti | first8 = SK | last9 = Bagni | first9 = RK | last10 = Petrow-Sadowski | first10 = C. | last11 = Gold | first11 = B. | last12 = Dean | first12 = M. | last13 = Mikovits | first13 = J.

The first follow-up study was published in PLoS ONE in 2010; it was conducted in the UK and found no evidence of XMRV in CFS patients.[tpl]cite journal |author=Erlwein, O |title=Failure to Detect the Novel Retrovirus XMRV in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome |journal=PLoS ONE |volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= e8519|year=2010 |pmid=20066031 |pmc= 2795199|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008519 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008519 |editor1-last=Nixon |editor1-first=Douglas F. |display-authors=1 |last2=Kaye |first2=S |last3=McClure |first3=MO |last4=Weber |first4=J |last5=Wills |first5=G |last6=Collier |first6=D |last7=Wessely |first7=S |last8=Cleare |first8=A|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.8519E [/tpl] The publication sparked what The Economist dubbed a transatlantic "fight".[ref]
