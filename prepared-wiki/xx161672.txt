Louis Archinard (11 February 1850 – 8 May 1932) was a French Army general at the time of the Third Republic, who contributed to the colonial conquest of French West Africa. He was traditionally presented in French histories as the conqueror and "Pacifier" of French Soudan (today Mali). Archinard's campaigns brought about the end of the Tukulor Empire.  He also spent a large amount of energy fighting Samory Toure. In 1897 Archinard was reassigned to French Indochina.
