The civilisation is primarily located in modern-day India (Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan provinces) and Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan provinces). Historically part of Ancient India, it is one of the world's earliest urban civilisations, along with Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.incredibleindia.org/newsite/cms_page.asp?pageid=759 |title=History |publisher=Incredible India |accessdate=2010-05-16[/tpl] Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley, the Harappans, developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving), and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin.
The Mature Indus civilisation flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the beginning of urban civilisation on the subcontinent. The civilisation included urban centres such as Dholavira, Kalibangan, Ropar,  Rakhigarhi, and Lothal in modern-day India, and Harappa, Ganeriwala, and Mohenjo-daro in modern-day Pakistan. The civilisation is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses.

==Vedic period (1750 BCE - 500 BCE)==

The Vedic period is characterised by Indo-Aryan culture associated with the texts of Vedas, sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India.G. Bongard-Levin, A History of India: Part 1 (Progressive Books: Moscow, 1979) p. 51. The Vedic period lasted from about 1750 to 500 BCE,[tpl]cite book|title=Non-Western Art: A Brief Guide|page=151|author=Lynn MacKenzie|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1995[/tpl]Romila Thapar, A History of India: Part 1, pp. 29-30. contributed the foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of Indian subcontinent. In terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.[tpl]citation|last=Singh|first=U.|author-link=Upinder Singh|title=A History of Ancient and Mediaeval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|year=2009|publisher=Longman|page=255|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-317-1677-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC[/tpl]

===Vedic society===

Historians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[tpl]citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|editor-last=Arnold|editor-first=D.|date=27 April 2010|title=A History of India|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-9509-6|page=47|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QY4zdTDwMAQC[/tpl][tpl]citation|last1=Kulke|first1=H.|last2=Rothermund|first2=D.|author1-link=Hermann Kulke|date=1 August 2004|title=A History of India|series=4th|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|page=31|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V73N8js5ZgAC[/tpl] Vedic people believed in the transmigration of the soul, and the peepul tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda.Singhal, K. C; Gupta, Roshan. The Ancient History of India, Vedic Period: A New Interpretation. Atlantic Publishers and Distributors. ISBN 8126902868. P. 150-151. Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later like Dharma, Karma etc. trace their root to the Vedas.*Day, Terence P. (1982). The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature.

Early Vedic society consisted of largely pastoral groups, distinct to Harappan urbanisation having been abandoned.India: Reemergence of Urbanisation. Retrieved on 12 May 2007. After the time of the Rigveda, Aryan society became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the four varnas, or social classes. In addition to the Vedas, the principal texts of Hinduism, the core themes of the Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are said to have their ultimate origins during this period.[ref]
