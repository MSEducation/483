===Theatre criticism===

Rich served as chief theatre critic of the New York Times from 1980 to 1993, earning the nickname "Butcher of Broadway" for his power over the prospects of Broadway shows.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998353,00.html|title=Books: Stages of Development|date=October 30, 2000|work=Time|accessdate=March 13, 2011[/tpl] He first won attention from theatre-goers with an essay for The Harvard Crimson about the theatre musical Follies (1971), by Stephen Sondheim, during its pre-Broadway tryout run in Boston. In his study of the work, Rich was "the first person to predict the legendary status the show eventually would achieve". The article "fascinated" Harold Prince, the musical's co-director, and "absolutely intrigued" Sondheim, who invited the undergraduate to lunch to further discuss his feelings about the production.Chapin, Ted (2003). Everything Was Possible — The Birth of the Musical Follies. New York: Knopf.  pp. 116, 193–195.  ISBN 0-375-41328-6.
A collection of Rich's theatre reviews was published in a book, Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980–1993 (1998).  He also wrote The Theatre Art of Boris Aronson, with Lisa Aronson, in 1987.

===Media and political criticism===

In 1994, Rich became an op-ed columnist for the New York Times; from 2003 to 2011, he wrote regularly for the Times on mass media and public relations, particularly its coverage of U.S. national politics. His columns, now appearing in New York Magazine, make regular references to a broad range of popular culture—including television, movies, theatre and literature—and draw connections to politics and current events. His columns are published in the International Herald Tribune, the international edition of the Times. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
As a political commentator, Rich has been criticized by Bill O'Reilly, host of The O'Reilly Factor, a talk show on the Fox News Channel.  Rich is critical of Fox News, accusing it in 2004 of having a politically conservative media bias.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/arts/19RICH.html?ex=1253332800&en=5460390faa6f11da&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland|title=This Time Bill O'Reilly Got It Right|accessdate=April 5, 2007|author=Rich, Frank (essay)|date= September 19, 2004|work= The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]Registration required[/tpl]
In a January 2006 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, a syndicated weekday talk show, commenting on the James Frey memoir scandal, Rich expanded on his usage in his column of the term truthiness to summarize a variety of ills in culture and politics.Transcript of interview (January 26, 2006).

His book, The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina (2006), criticized the American media for what he perceived as its support of George W. Bush's administration's policies following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Rich dismissed the historical-drama film The Passion of the Christ (2004), directed by Mel Gibson, as "nothing so much as a porn movie, replete with slo-mo climaxes and pounding music for the money shots", and praised Christopher Hitchens's description of it as "a homoerotic 'exercise in lurid sadomasochism' for those who 'like seeing handsome young men stripped and flayed alive over a long period of time'".Rich, Frank (essay) (March 7, 2004).

He wrote that death threats and a brick thrown through a congressman's window were a "small-scale mimicry of "Kristallnacht" (or "night of broken glass", the November 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany and Austria).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/opinion/28rich.html|title=The Rage is Not about Health Care|accessdate=April 2010 |author=Rich, Frank (essay)|date= March 27, 2010|work= The New York Times[/tpl]
