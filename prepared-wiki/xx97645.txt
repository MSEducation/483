[[Allotransplantation]]

CATEGORIES: Transplantation medicine, Immunology

Allotransplantation (allo- from the Greek meaning "other") is the transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs, to a recipient from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species.Surgery For ACL Tears The transplant is called an allograft, allogeneic transplant, or homograft. Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts. A xenograft is a graft from a different species, such as when animal tissue is grafted to help humans.
It is not uncommon for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Homografts may be called "homostatic" if they are biologically inert when transplanted, such as bone and cartilage.(W. P. Longmire, J. National Cancer Institute 14, 669: The term homostatic graft might be applied to inert tissues such as bone and cartilage when transferred from one individual to another of the same species; and the term homovital graft might be used in reference to grafts whose cells must continue to grow and reproduce for the graft to be effective after similar transplantation; H. Conway, The Bulletin of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association 13, 43: ''These grafts persist however as homostatic grafts and are completely replaced by host tissues in time.)
An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is termed rejection. An allogenic bone marrow transplant can result in an immune attack, called Graft-versus-host disease.

==Procedure==

Informed consent is required before tissue is harvested from a donor, alive or dead.  Proper screening for pathology and risk factors for communicable diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C is then conducted.
In the US, donor tissue must be harvested and processed adhering to the Current Good Tissue Practices rule. In most cases it is sent to tissue banks for processing and distribution. Each year, Food and Drug Administration regulated and American Association of Tissue Banks-accredited tissue banks distribute 1.5 million bone and tissue allografts.

==Transplantable organs and tissues==

A variety of organs and tissues can be used for allografts, including:

==Laws & regulations==

In the US, the Federal government Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated human tissue intended for transplants since 1993. In order to ensure the quality of donor tissue and reduce contamination and disease transmission risks three regulations addressing manufacturing activities associated with human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) were promulgated in May 2005: The first requires companies producing and distributing HCT/Ps to register with the FDA. The second, called the “Donor Eligibility” rule, proscribes criteria for donor eligibility. The third, the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule, oversees overall processing and distribution practices of each company.
