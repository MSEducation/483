[[Silabenzene]]

CATEGORIES: Silicon heterocycles

A silabenzene is a heteroaromatic compound containing one or more silicon atoms instead of carbon atoms in benzene. A single substitution gives silabenzene proper; additional substitutions give a disilabenzene (3 theoretical isomers), trisilabenzene (3 isomers), etc.
Silabenzenes have been the targets of many theoretical and synthetic studies by organic chemists interested in the question of whether analogs of benzene with Group IV elements heavier than carbon, e.g., silabenzene, stannabenzene and germabenzene -- so-called "heavy benzenes" -- exhibit aromaticity.
Although several heteroaromatic compounds bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms have been known since the early stages of organic chemistry, silabenzene had been considered to be a transient, un-isolable compound and was detected only in low-temperature matrices or as its Diels-Alder adduct for a long time. In recent years, however, a kinetically stabilized silabenzene and other heavy aromatic compounds with silicon or germanium atoms have been reported.

==Synthesis==

Several attempts to synthesize stable silabenzenes have been reported from the late 1970s using well-known bulky substituents such as a tert-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl) or a TMS (trimethylsilyl) group, but such silabenzenes readily react with themselves to give the corresponding dimer even at low temperature (below -100°C) due to the high reactivity of silicon-carbon π bonds. In 1978 Barton and Burns reported that flow pyrolysis of 1-methyl-1-allyl-1-silacyclohexa-2,4-diene through a quartz tube heated to 428 °C using either ethyne or perfluoro-2-butyne as both a reactant and a carrier gas afforded the methyl-1-silylbenzene Diel-Alder adducts, 1-methyl-1-silabicyclo2.2.2octatriene or 1-methyl-2,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1-silabicyclo2.2.2octatriene, respectively, by way of a retro-ene reaction.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja00484a075[/tpl]
Following the synthesis of the naphthalene analog 2-silanaphthalene,[tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja9710924[/tpl][tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja992024f[/tpl] the first sila-aromatic compound, by Norihiro Tokitoh and Renji Okazaki in 1997, the same group reported thermally stable silabenzene in 2000 taking advantage of a new steric protective group.

A 1,4-disilabenzene was reported in 2002.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja9930061[/tpl] In 2007, 1,2-disilabenzene was synthesized via formal 2+2+2 cyclotrimerization of a disilyne (Si-Si triple bonded species) and phenylacetylene.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja072759h[/tpl]
Some theoretical studies suggest that the symmetric 1,3,5-trisilabenzene may be more stable than 1,2-disilabenzene.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/om9903745[/tpl]

==Properties and reactions==

Isolated silabenzene reacts with various reagents at 1,2- or 1,4-positions to give diene-type products, so the aromaticity of the silabenzene is destroyed. It is different from benzene, which reacts with electrophiles to give not dienes but substituted benzenes, so benzene sustains its aromaticity. Silicon is a semi-metal element, so the Si-C π bond in the silabenzene is highly polarized and easily broken. The silabenzene is also light-sensitive; UV irradiation gives the valence isomer, a silabenzvalene. The theoretical calculations and the NMR chemical shifts of silabenzenes, though, show that silabenzene is an aromatic compound in spite of the different reactivity from benzene and other classical aromatic compounds.

==Hexasilabenzene==

In calculations the all-silicon hexasilabenzene Si6H6 is predicted to have 6-fold symmetry [tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja00839a005[/tpl] or a chair conformation.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1063/1.452726[/tpl] A stable hexasilaprismane has been known since 1993 [tpl]cite DOI|10.1021/ja00066a075[/tpl] A compound isomeric with hexasilabenzene was first reported in 2010.[tpl]cite DOI|10.1126/science.1181771[/tpl] This compound is reported as stable and with according to X-ray crystallography a chairlike tricyclic silicon frame.
