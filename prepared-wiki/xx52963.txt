[tpl]nihongo|Nagoya Grampus|名古屋グランパス|Nagoya Guranpasu[/tpl] (formerly known as [tpl]nihongo|Nagoya Grampus Eight|名古屋グランパスエイト|Nagoya Guranpasu Eito[/tpl]) are a Japanese association football club that play in the J. League. Based in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture and originally founded as the company team of the Toyota Motor Corp. in 1939, the club shares its home games between Mizuho Athletic Stadium (capacity 27,000 and the J.League's oldest-serving stadium) and the much larger Toyota Stadium (capacity 45,000).
Grampus are one of only four teams to have competed in Japan's top flight of football every year since its inception in 1993. The team previously had its most successful season in 1995 when it was managed by current Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, winning the prestigious Emperor's Cup and finishing runners-up in the J.League, and which featured, among others, Dragan Stojković and Gary Lineker on the team, until it was eclipsed on November 20, 2010, when the club won their first ever J. League trophy, under the management of Wenger protégé and former Grampus player Dragan Stojković.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=839046&cc=5901|title=Stojkovic doing things the Wenger way|author=John Duerden|work=ESPNsoccernet|date=2010-11-05|accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl]
The team's name was derived from the two most prominent symbols of Nagoya: the two golden grampus dolphins on the top of Nagoya Castle (which can be more accurately described as shachihoko, a mythological creature part of the local folklore), and the Maru-Hachi (Circle eight), the city's official symbol. The use of an orca in the team's logo is likely a reference to the fact that the kanji for shachichoko (鯱) can be pronounced "shachichoko" (the aforemention mythical creature) or "shachi" (orca).

==History==

===JSL era===

Toyota Motor S.C. was initially overshadowed by its colleague Toyota Automated Loom Works F.C. (founded in 1946 and which was one of the founding members of the JSL) but when Toyota ALW were relegated to regional leagues in 1968, Toyota Motor saw an opportunity to rise at their expense. 
In 1972 Toyota Motors were founding members of the JSL's Second Division and its inaugural champions. They remained in the JSL until the J. League's founding in 1993. They were relegated to the JSL Division 2 in 1977. After a brief return in 1987-88, they were promoted for good in 1989-90 and remain in the top flight ever since with the like of Billy Mortimer and Mark Cooper showing great passion for the club. 

===J. League era===

In 1996, Arsene Wenger led Grampus to the 1996 Emperor's Cup and a runners-up finish in the J.League, the club's best ever finish. The team's name "Nagoya Grampus Eight" was changed to just "Nagoya Grampus" at the start of the 2008 season. In 2008, Nagoya appointed former player Dragan Stojković as manager. They finished in 3rd place and qualified for the AFC Champions League for the first time. Stojković has since led the club to winning the J.League in the 2010 season, featuring a squad consisting of Marcus Tulio Tanaka, Mu Kanazaki, Seigo Narazaki, Yoshizumi Ogawa, Keiji Tamada and Joshua Kennedy.

==Episodes==

===Kashima Soccer Stadium Curse===

Since Nagoya were dealt a 0 - 5 defeat to the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium on 16 May in the 1993 J. League season opener, Nagoya suffered an incredible losing streak of 22 consecutive games to the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium which included Emperor's Cup and J. League Cup games. Nagoya finally got their first victory over the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium on 23 August of the 2008 J. League season, some 15 years later.
