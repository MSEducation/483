Never Say Die (1951–1975) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. After winning only once from his first nine races, he demonstrated much improved form in the summer of 1954 to win the Epsom Derby, becoming the first American colt to win the race for seventy-three years. Later that year he added a second British Classic when winning the St. Leger Stakes by a record margin of twelve lengths. He was later retired to a successful stud career.

==Background==

Never Say Die was a chestnut colt with a white blaze and three white feet, bred and raced by the American philanthropist and art collector Robert Sterling Clark. At the time of his Derby win, the horse stood 15.3 ½ hands high.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bJcbd-7pYlkC&pg=PA395&lpg=PA395&dq=%22Joe+Lawson%22+trainer&source=bl&ots=pD7ffQSj61&sig=rFvlXz2pzsafLDNzEwcM4CfIM64&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KqViUNH8Fqal0AXH24CICA&sqi=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Joe%20Lawson%22%20trainer&f=false |title=The Story of Your Life: A History of the Sporting Life Newspaper (1859-1998) |author=James Lambie |publisher=Matador |year=2010 |accessdate=2013-02-02[/tpl] He was conceived in Ireland but foaled at Jonabell Farm in Kentucky.

==Racing career==

===1953:two-year-old season===

In six races as a two-year-old, Never Say Die showed some good form but appeared to be somewhat below the best of his generation. He won the six furlong Rosslyn Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in July and fimished third in both the Richmond Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the year's best British juveniles, Never Say Die was allotted a weight of 115 pounds, eighteen pounds below the top-rated The Pie King.

===1954:three-year-old season===

Never Say Die made good physical progress over the winter, but showed little improvement in his first two starts. He finished second in the Union Jack Stakes at Aintree Racecourse and then finished unplaced in the Free Handicap at Newmarket in April. On his final trial race for the Epsom Derby, Never Say Die returned to Newmarket and was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs. Ridden by Manny Mercer, he took the lead a furlong out but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third to Elopement and Golden God.[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/49634430?|title=SIR GORDON'S WINNER |publisher=The West Australian |date=13 May 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl]
On a dull, chilly day[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/52946622?|title=Derby Outsider, Never Say Die, Wins At Epsom |publisher=The West Australian |date=3 Jun 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl] at Epsom, Never Say Die started a 33/1 outsider in a field of twenty-two runners for the Derby. According to some accounts, he would have started at even longer odds if his memorable name and the publicity attracted by his eighteen-year-old jockey Lester Piggott had not made him a popular choice with many members of the public. The colt was always well-placed and was sent into the lead early in the straight by Piggott. He won comfortably by two lengths from Arabian Night and Darius.[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/52946522?|title=NEVER SAY DIE WINS THE DERBY |publisher=The West Australian |date=3 Jun 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl] Clark was ill in New York hospital[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_i4rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QpoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2879,3816192&dq=never-say-die+horse&hl=en |title=Never Say Die wins St Leger turf classic |publisher=Reading Eagle |date=12 September 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl] and unable to attend the race, which saw Never Say Die becoming the first American-bred Derby winner since Iroquois in 1881.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fulOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gQAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7300,393740&dq=never-say-die+horse&hl=en |title=Never Say Die Epsom Winner |publisher=Toledo Blade |date=2 June 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl]  Never Say Die next contested the King Edward VII Stakes at Ascot Racecourse.

Piggott was immediately suspended by the racecourse stewards for his riding of Never Say Die and was reported to the Jockey Club who extended the riding ban to six months.[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/49955572?|title=IXMONTHS SUSPENSION |publisher=Barrier Miner |date=19 Jun 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl]
The suspended Piggott was replaced by Charlie Smirke for Never Say Die's run in the St Leger at Doncaster in September. The colt started 100/30 favourite in a field of sixteen. He won very easily by twelve lengths,[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/27245884?|title=English St. Leger To Never Say Die |publisher=The Mercury |date=13 Sep 1954 |accessdate=2012-06-05[/tpl] the biggest winning margin officially recorded in the race's history.

==Stud record==

On retirement, Clark, gave him to the British National Stud. He was champion sire in 1962, thanks to Larkspur's Derby victory. He also sired the Epsom Oaks and 1,000 Guineas winner Never Too Late and other good winners in Die Hard and Sostenuto, stayers who both won the Ebor Handicap.
Never say Die was put down in 1975, by when his stock had won 309 races worth more than £400,000 in Great Britain. He is buried in The National Stud's horse cemetery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/Graves/cem/GraveMattersNationalStud.html |title=Grave Matters National Stud |publisher=Tbheritage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02[/tpl]
