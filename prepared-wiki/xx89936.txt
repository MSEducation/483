Grandtully rapids on the River Tay is a site for canoeing and rafting in Scotland.
Grandtully rapids is made of a top fall, the island (a large rock in the middle of the rapids where many canoeists not used to rapids often break their boats), and the bottom fall.
There is a nearby campsite, a converted train goods yard, owned by the Scottish Canoe Association.  The forestry commission have an access point a few miles upstream giving a good entry for Whitewater Racing.  The banks of the river at the rapid site were owned by Lyle Estates (of Tate and Lyle) and are now owned by a former employee of that company who allows slalom gates to be kept permanently.  
The new Jack Cuthill Building on the campsite, built in 2003, offers toilets, changing rooms, showers and a meeting room.
