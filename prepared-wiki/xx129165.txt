Michael Chack (born August 1971) is an American figure skater. He won gold medals at four senior international events, Nebelhorn Trophy, Karl Schäfer Memorial, Piruetten, and Winter Universiade, and one bronze, at the Trophée de France. Chack also won one senior national medal, bronze at the 1993 U.S. Championships. After his performance was skipped by the broadcaster, his surname entered colloquial figure skating vocabulary as a verb meaning to be omitted from television. 
Chack withdrew from the 1994 U.S. Championships due to a groin pull and a stress fracture in his right leg. He was coached by Peter Burrows for 14 years and by Frank Carroll for five years. After retiring from competition in 1999, he began touring with Holiday on Ice.
