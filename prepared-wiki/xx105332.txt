==Overview==

The Guden River (Gudenå), Denmark's longest river runs from Randers Fjord in Nørhald municipality to the east, through the city of Randers, and splits in two ca. 5 kilometers west of the central city.  The northern tributary is called Nørreå ("Northern River"), and it continues westward, defining part of the boundary between Århus and Viborg Counties, and terminates at Vedsø ("Lake Ved") near the town of Rindsholm in Viborg municipality.  The 160 kilometer long Guden River continues to Tinnet Krat in Vejle County.
The city's nearly 3 kilometer long Guden River Park (Gudenåparken) stretches along the river's banks in the center of the town.
