==Background==

Notre Dame is a secondary school originally founded in 1956 by the Most Reverend Charles F. Buddy, Bishop of the Diocese of San Diego, as a Diocesan secondary school for boys. The first Principal was Reverend J.V. Sullivan, A Diocesan priest. In 1957 the administration of the school was taken over by the Holy Ghost Fathers, who staffed Notre Dame until 1970, at which time plans were drawn up to merge Notre Dame with St. Francis de Sales Girls High School. Notre Dame became a co-ed school at the start of the school year, in September 1972, under the direction of the Most Reverend Leo T. Maher, Bishop of the Diocese of San Diego.
In 1978, the Diocese of San Diego was divided and the new Diocese of San Bernardino was created with the Most Reverend Philip F. Straling as its first Bishop.  Since the formation of the new Diocese, Notre Dame has become a self-sufficient high school with an enrollment of approximately 600 students with many alumni returning to work and/or teach at the school.
