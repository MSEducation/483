The Twelve Apostles is a collection of limestone stacks off the shore of the Port Campbell National Park, by the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia. Their proximity to one another has made the site a popular tourist attraction.

==Formation and history==

The apostles were formed by erosion: the harsh and extreme weather conditions from the Southern Ocean gradually eroded the soft limestone to form caves in the cliffs, which then became arches, which in turn collapsed; leaving rock stacks up to 45 metres high.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayobject.cfm/objectid.000B0BDC-CFBC-1A5C-BC6180C476A90000/|title=Twelve Apostles|accessdate=27 May 2010|work=Visit Victoria|publisher=Tourism Victoria[/tpl]  The site was known as the Sow and Piglets until 1922 (Muttonbird Island, near Loch Ard Gorge, was the Sow, and the smaller rock stacks were the Piglets);Twelve Apostles Sign. after which it was renamed to  The Apostles for tourism purposes.  The formation eventually became known as the Twelve Apostles, despite only ever having nine stacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/07/03/1120329326001.html|title=Ninth Apostle crumbles|author=La Canna, Xavier and Murphy, Mathew|date=4 July 2005|work=The Age[/tpl]
In 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermens Association unsuccessfully attempted to block the creation of a proposed marine national park at the Twelve Apostles location,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200204/s531471.htm|title=Port Campbell bid to block marine national park|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=15 April 2002|work=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] but were satisfied with the later Victorian Government decision not to allow seismic exploration at the same site by Benaris Energy;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200310/s969092.htm|title=Fishermen welcome decision against national park seismic exploration|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=17 October 2003|work=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] believing it would harm marine life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200310/s971651.htm|title=Otway Basin seismic survey work set to start|accessdate=17 June 2010|date=21 October 2003|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=www.abc.net.au[/tpl]
The stacks are susceptible to further erosion from the waves.  On 3 July 2005, a 50 metre tall stack collapsed, leaving eight remaining.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/07/04/australia.apostles/|title=Apostles lose one of their own|work=CNN|date=4 July 2005[/tpl] (compare the two pictures from 2002 and 2012). On 25 September 2009, it was thought that another of the stacks had fallen, but this was actually one of the smaller stacks of the Three Sisters formation.Hunter, Thomas (28 September 2009). Sister, not apostle, crumbles into sea. The Age.  The rate of erosion at the base of the limestone pillars is approximately 2 cm per year.(At a destructive rate of 2-3 cm per year) Due to wave action eroding the cliff face existing headlands are expected to become new limestone stacks in the future.Porter, Geoff (2006).
