Some cities also elect their councilors by districts which may also be provided in its charter. In general, cities which are composed of at least two legislative districts, equally divide its elected council seats among its districts.
Of all the cities, Manila has the most number of elected councilors with 36, followed by Davao and Quezon City with 24 each.
Similar to the Sangguniang Bayan of municipalities in the Philippines, the Sangguniang Panlungsod also allocates a council seat to the city chapter presidents of the Liga ng mga Barangay and  Pederasyon ng mga Sangguniang Kabataan.
