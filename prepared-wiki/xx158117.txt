G. Collingwood's novel Thorstein of the Mere, A Saga of the Northmen in Lakeland. Ransome, at the age of eight, first met the Collingwoods at a family picnic on Peel Island: a chance meeting that would prove to have important consequences in Ransome's later life, with Collingwood's grandchildren providing a model for significant characters in Swallows and Amazons.[tpl]cite book|last=Brogan|first=Hugh|authorlink=Hugh Brogan|title=The Life of Arthur Ransome|publisher=Cape|location=London|year=1984|pages=4; 44; 311|isbn=0-224-02010-2[/tpl]
