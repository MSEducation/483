Xylamidine is a drug which acts as an antagonist at the 5HT2A receptor, and to a lesser extent at the 5HT1A receptor. It does not cross the blood brain barrier which makes it useful for blocking peripheral serotonergic responses like cardiovascular[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = RW | last2 = Kurz | first2 = KD | last3 = Mason | first3 = NR | last4 = Cohen | first4 = ML | title = Antagonism of a peripheral vascular but not an apparently central serotonergic response by xylamidine and BW 501C67 | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–7 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3732393 | doi=10.1016/0014-2999(86)90084-1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Dedeoğlu | first1 = A | last2 = Fisher | first2 = LA | title = Central and peripheral injections of the 5-HT2 agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane, modify cardiovascular function through different mechanisms | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 259 | issue = 3 | pages = 1027–34 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1762059 [/tpl] and gastrointestinal effects,[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = BJ | last2 = Duggan | first2 = JP | last3 = Barber | first3 = DJ | last4 = Booth | first4 = DA | title = Effects of dl-fenfluramine and xylamidine on gastric emptying of maintenance diet in freely feeding rats | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 150 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 137–42 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3402534 | doi=10.1016/0014-2999(88)90759-5[/tpl] without producing the central effects of 5HT2A blockade such as sedation, or interfering with the central actions of 5HT2A agonists.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Dave | first1 = KD | last2 = Quinn | first2 = JL | last3 = Harvey | first3 = JA | last4 = Aloyo | first4 = VJ | title = Role of central 5-HT2 receptors in mediating head bobs and body shakes in the rabbit | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 623–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15006475 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2003.12.017 [/tpl]
