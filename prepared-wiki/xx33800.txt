[[Mygdon of Bebryces]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Mythological kings

King Mygdon of the Bebryces was killed by Heracles on the way to Pontus to complete his ninth labour, which was to fetch the belt of Queen Hippolyte of the Amazons.  After Heracles killed Mygdon, he gave his former lands to Lycus, who renamed the place Heraclea in honour of Heracles.  His parentage is given as Poseidon by the nymph Melia, and he had a brother named Amycus, also a Bebrycian king. Heracles fathered a son named Berecynthus by Mygdon's daughter Astydameia after he had killed her father. It is not clear whether this Mygdon, or his Phrygian namesake, was the father of Coroebus
