Once he had made that step up though he made swifter progress. One of his early games was between Manchester City and Huddersfield at Maine Road on 7 November 1987, when the home side won 10–1, the Yorkshire team's only goal being a penalty.Recalling the 10–1 win by Manchester City over Huddersfield: BBC.co.uk website feature.
