Indianapolis International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|IND|KIND|IND[/tpl] is a public airport seven miles (11 km) southwest of downtown Indianapolis, in Marion County, Indiana, United States. It is owned and operated by the Indianapolis Airport Authority. The airport is the largest in Indiana, occupying about [tpl]convert|7700|acre|ha|0[/tpl] in Wayne and Decatur Townships of Marion County, all within the city of Indianapolis.  It is near interstate highways I-65, I-69, I-70, and I-74, all of which connect to the city's I-465 beltway. The passenger terminal was the first designed and built in the United States since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.huntconstructiongroup.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=336&Itemid=175|title=New Terminal at Indianapolis International Airport Now Boarding|accessdate=January 4, 2009|publisher=Hunt Construction Group[/tpl]

IND is the eighth largest cargo center in the U.S., the 22nd busiest airport in the world by cargo traffic. More than 2.2 billion pounds (1.0 billion kg) of cargo were managed at IND in 2010.

==History==

Indianapolis Municipal Airport opened in 1931; in 1944 it was renamed Weir-Cook Municipal Airport, after Col. Harvey Weir-Cook
of Wilkinson, Indiana, who was a US Army Air Forces pilot in World War I and World War II, where he was killed flying a P-39 over New Caledonia.  He became a flying ace during WWI, with seven victories.  Since 1962 it has been owned and operated by the Indianapolis Airport Authority (IAA), an eight-member board with members appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, Hendricks and Hamilton counties in central Indiana. The present name was bestowed by the IAA in 1976.  In summer of 2008 the IAA's board approved a resolution retaining the current airport name but designating the new main passenger facility as the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal. The new entrance road was given the name of Col. H. Weir Cook Memorial Drive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080718/BUSINESS/80718004|title=Airport keeps name, but will honor Weir Cook|date=July 18, 2008|publisher=6 News Indianapolis|accessdate=July 18, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
From 1957 to 2008 the passenger terminal was on the east side of the airfield off High School Road. This now-closed facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A & B), 1972 (Concourse D), and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached Parking Garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008. The Indianapolis Airport Authority maintains some offices in the old structure, but most of the old terminal is expected to eventually be demolished.
The April 1957 OAG shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and one Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to La Guardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. (Westward nonstops didn't reach beyond St Louis until 1967; TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX 707 that year.) The first jets were TWA 880s in 1961.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s USAir (now US Airways) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the west coast, east coast, and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the Midwest. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In the late 1990s and early 2000s Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based ATA Airlines and its regional affiliate, Chicago Express/ATA Connection. After that airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2004 operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006.[tpl]cite news|title=ATA Expects to Stop Flights From Its Hometown in January |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/business/02air.html?ref=ataairlines|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 2, 2005[/tpl]
ATA's demise gave Northwest Airlines an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city. (Northwest became a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines in late 2008.)
In 1994 BAA was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA. Private management ended on December 31, 2007 and control reverted to IAA.BAA Limited and Indianapolis Airport Authority Agree To Conclude Management Contract EarlyCase Study: United States
In the same year (1994) United Airlines finished building Indianapolis Maintenance Center,[tpl]cite web|title=Facility Facts & Statistics: Indianapolis Maintenance Center|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/files/contribute/07.16.09IMCFacts.pdf|publisher=Indianapolis Airport Authority|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] at a cost of $USD 600 million.[tpl]cite web|last=Bybee |first=Roger |url=http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/5072/con_air_the_safe_off-shoring_of_airline_repair/ |title=Con Air: The ‘Safe’ Offshoring of Airline Repair - Working In These Times |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] United later moved their maintenance operations to its sole maintenance hub located at San Francisco International Airport.
In 2009 Republic Airways announced they would retain their maintenance hub and HQ in Indianapolis even though they acquired the much larger Frontier Airlines in Denver.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

==Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal==

A new [tpl]convert|1200000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] midfield passenger terminal opened between Indianapolis International Airport's two parallel runways, southwest of the previous terminal and the crosswind runway in 2008. A new FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) building, 3rd tallest in the United States, opened in April 2006, the first component of the long-planned midfield complex. The Weir Cook Terminal itself opened for arriving flights on the evening of November 11, 2008 and for departures the following morning. HOK was its master designer, with AeroDesign Group (a joint venture among CSO Architects, SchenkelShultz Architecture and ARCHonsortium) serving as architect of record.  Aviation Capital Management (Indianapolis), a subsidiary of BSA LifeStructures, is the airport's program manager. Hunt/Smoot Midfield Builders, a joint venture of Hunt Construction Group and Smoot Construction was the construction manager.  Thornton Tomasetti was the terminal's structural engineer along with Fink, Roberts and Petrie.[tpl]cite web |title=Hoosier Upgrade|first=Debra|last=Wood|url=http://constructoragc.construction.com/mag/2008_3-4/features/0803-72_AGC.asp|work=Construction Magazine|date=March 1, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2013[/tpl] Syska Hennessy was the mechanical, electrical, & plumbing engineer.
The new terminal, named in honor of Col. Harvey Weir-Cook, has room for 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates (which can function as domestic gates).[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Not all gate positions were used upon opening of the facility, to allow for future expansion by the airlines. The two gate concourse structures were built to allow for future expansion on their southwestern ends (which is why gates A1-A2 and B1-B2 do not yet exist).
For the first time at Indianapolis, international arrivals can be processed through customs in the main passenger terminal. Passengers arriving at gates A4 and A5 go to the U.S. Customs and Federal Inspection Station on the arrivals level via a dedicated and secured stairway, escalator, or elevator. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] After clearing customs, they exit into the south end of the main terminal's domestic baggage claim area.
The A concourse has a Delta Sky Club, the first airline lounge at Indianapolis International Airport since US Air closed their lounge after the closure of their hub.  The opening date was November 15, 2010.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Eight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as IndyGo bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies' remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers [tpl]convert|11|acre|ha[/tpl] on each of its levels. It features a light-filled center atrium complete with a piece of suspended artwork and contains moving sidewalks to speed pedestrians into and out of the terminal building itself.[tpl]cite web |title=Indianapolis International Airport - Community Days brochure, October 11–12, 2008|date=August 4, 2008|url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com/admin/uploads/224/08.04.08CommunityDays.pdf[/tpl]
The airport's master plan calls for a fourth (third parallel) runway to be built southeast of I-70 sometime in the future.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  Between 2002 and 2004 the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) rebuilt a portion of this Interstate highway running through the south end of the airport's property.  The realigned freeway allows a future taxiway bridge to the proposed fourth runway to cross overhead, and has a new traffic interchange for the midfield terminal complex. This I-70 exit (#68) is now the airport's main entrance, replacing the entrance at Sam Jones (née Airport) Expressway[tpl]cite web |title=Mayor renames Airport Expressway to honor dedicated public servant|date=June 20, 2007|url=http://www.indygov.org/eGov/Mayor/PR/2007/6/2007620d.htm[/tpl] and High School Road. Provision has been made for future Light Rail Transit (LRT) access to the Weir Cook terminal complex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newindianapolisairport.com/faq.shtm |title=newindianapolisairport.com |publisher=newindianapolisairport.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl]

==Based aircraft==

The Airport has 61 based aircraft.  Of these 61, eleven of them are single engine aircraft, 18 of them are multi engine aircraft, and 32 are jets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  The airport also has three helicopters and one military aircraft based on site.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  These numbers have been decreasing significantly since 2005.  In 2005, the Airport had roughly 81 based aircraft and because of encouragement by other more “general aviation friendly” airports in the area, aircraft have been moving out of Indianapolis International.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Public transportation==

GO Express Travel operates the Green Line Downtown/Airport Express daily from 8am to 11pm with shuttle service picking up passengers every 30 minutes.  The express service costs $10 per passenger one-way.[tpl]cite web|title=Downtown Indy Express GO Green Line Airport Shuttle|url=http://goexpresstravel.com/indy_express|publisher=GO Express Travel|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl] The boarding/debarking point for this service at the airport is located at the northwest end of the Ground Transportation Center, which is found on level 1 of the parking garage. The terminal was built with a Light Rail System in mind that in the future could serve this airport.
IndyGo's Route 8 also connects the airport with downtown Indianapolis. Unlike the Green Line Express, Route 8 bus is a slower and cheaper bus route that makes frequent stops along Washington Street. The fare for Route 8 is currently $1.75 for single ride, same as other IndyGo buses.[tpl]cite web|title=Transit Service Between Airport/Downtown Indy|url=http://www.indygo.net/pages/transit-service-between-airportdowntown-indy|publisher=IndyGo|accessdate=December 27, 2013[/tpl]
