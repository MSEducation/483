According to D.L. Bradley, Kirtley's locomotives were “well designed, robustly constructed, easily maintained, and capable of high mileages between general repairs. For the period their coal, water and old consumption was moderate while all perfored their daily tasks well.”Bradley (1979) pp. 10-14 His classes included 0-4-4 suburban tanks of the A, A1, A2, R,  and R1 classes; Six coupled goods classes B, B1, and B2 classes; six coupled tanks of the T class; and 4-4-0 express passenger locomotives of the M, M1, M2 and M3 classes.
Whilst working as a consultant for the Hull and Barnsley Railway he also designed twelve six coupled tank locomotives and twenty tender locomotives to similar designs and ten 2-4-0s.Bradley (1979) pp.9
