[[Just Say Yes (Punchline album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 albums, Punchline albums

Just Say Yes is an album by the pop punk band Punchline, first announced in April 2008 with a release date of September 16, 2008. It is the follow-up to 37 Everywhere, released in 2006. Tracks 1-5, 7, 9 and 10 of the album were recorded at Room Sound Studios in Tempe, Arizona, with the producer Jamie Woolford (formerly of The Stereo, now a member of the band Let Go). The remaining tracks were recorded at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe, who previously produced Punchline's Action album.
As an incentive to the first 500 who pre-ordered Just Say Yes, a four song disc titled Just Say Maybe was shipped with their order. Just Say Maybe has different versions of album songs as well as songs that were not included on the album. On November 1, Punchline gave away the album for free with some limited bonus tracks for Steve Soboslai's 28th birthday and Halloween.
Just Say Yes was the first release on the independent label Modern Short Stories, founded by Soboslai.
