[[Hyperboloid]]

CATEGORIES: Geometric shapes, Surfaces, Quadrics

In mathematics, a hyperboloid is a quadric – a type of surface in three dimensions – described by the equation
or
Both of these surfaces asymptote to the same conical surface as x or y become large:
These are also called elliptical hyperboloids. If and only if a = b, it is a hyperboloid of revolution, and is also called a circular hyperboloid.

==Cartesian coordinates==

Cartesian coordinates for the hyperboloids can be defined, similar to spherical coordinates, keeping the azimuth angle [tpl]nowrap|θ ∈ [tpl]closed-open|0, 2π[/tpl][/tpl], but changing inclination v into hyperbolic trigonometric functions: 
One-surface hyperboloid: [tpl]nowrap|v ∈ [tpl]closed-closed|-∞, ∞[/tpl][/tpl]
Two-surface hyperboloid: [tpl]nowrap|v ∈ [tpl]closed-closed|0, ∞[/tpl][/tpl]

==Generalised equations==

More generally, an arbitrarily oriented hyperboloid, centered at v, is defined by the equation
where A is a matrix and x, v are vectors. 

==Properties==

A hyperboloid of revolution of one sheet can be obtained by revolving a hyperbola around its semi-minor axis. Alternatively, a hyperboloid of two sheets of axis AB is obtained as the set of points P such that AP−BP is a constant, AP being the distance between A and P. Points A and B are then called the foci of the hyperboloid. A hyperboloid of revolution of two sheets can be obtained by revolving a hyperbola around its semi-major axis.  
A hyperboloid of one sheet is a doubly ruled surface; if it is a hyperboloid of revolution, it can also be obtained by revolving a line about a skew line.
Whereas the Gaussian curvature of a hyperboloid of one sheet is negative, that of a two-sheet hyperboloid is positive. In spite of its positive curvature, the hyperboloid of two sheets with another suitably chosen metric can also be used as a model for hyperbolic geometry.

==In more than three dimensions==

Imaginary hyperboloids are frequently found in mathematics of higher dimensions. For example, in a pseudo-Euclidean space one has the use of a quadratic form:
When c is any constant, then the part of the space given by
is called a hyperboloid. The degenerate case corresponds to c = 0.
As an example, consider the following passage from Hawkins (2000):
However, the term quasi-sphere is also used in this context since the sphere and hyperboloid have some commonality (See the section "Relation to the sphere" below).

==Hyperboloid structures==

One-sheeted hyperboloids are used in construction, with the structures called hyperboloid structures. A hyperboloid is a doubly ruled surface; thus, it can be built with straight steel beams, producing a strong structure at a lower cost than other methods. Examples include cooling towers, especially of power stations, and many other structures.

==Relation to the sphere==

In 1853 William Rowan Hamilton published his Lectures on Quaternions which included presentation of biquaternions.  The following passage from page 673 shows how Hamilton uses biquaternion algebra and vectors from quaternions to produce hyperboloids from the equation of a sphere:
In this passage S is the operator giving the scalar part of a quaternion, and T is the "tensor", now called norm, of a quaternion.
In the theory of quadratic forms, a unit quasi-sphere is the subset of a quadratic space X consisting of the x ∈ X such that the quadratic norm of x is one. See Porteous (1995) where this term includes both hyperboloid and sphere.
