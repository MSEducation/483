Playboy is an American pornographic magazine for men that features photographs of nude women as well as journalism and fiction. It was founded in Chicago in 1953 by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article5310203.ece |title=Hefner's Daughter Christie Walks Away from Playboy Enterprises |work=The Times | location=London | first=Christine | last=Seib | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] The magazine has grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc., with a presence in nearly every medium.

==History==

===1950s===

By spring 1953, Hugh Hefner - a 1949 University of Illinois psychology graduate who had worked in Chicago for Esquire magazine writing promotional copy; Publisher's Development Corporation in sales and marketing; and Children's Activities magazine as circulation promotions manager—had planned out the elements of his own magazine, that he would call Stag Party.Watts, p. 62 He formed HMH Publishing Corporation, and recruited his friend Eldon Sellers to find investors. Hefner eventually raised just over $8,000, including from his brother and mother.Watts, p. 63 However, the publisher of an unrelated men's adventure magazine, Stag, contacted Hefner and informed him it would file suit to protect their trademark if he were to launch his magazine with that name.[tpl]cite book|title=The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900|first=David E. |last=Sumner|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year= 2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0493-0|page= 134[/tpl]Watts, p. 64 Hefner, his wife Millie, and Sellers met to seek a new name, considering "Top Hat", "Gentleman", "Sir'", "Satyr", "Pan" and "Bachelor" before Sellers suggested "Playboy".
The first issue, in December 1953, was undated, as Hefner was unsure there would be a second. He produced it in his Hyde Park kitchen. The first centerfold was Marilyn Monroe, although the picture used originally was taken for a calendar rather than for Playboy.Summers, p. 59. Hefner chose what he deemed the "sexiest" image, a previously unused nude study of Marilyn stretched with an upraised arm on a red velvet background with closed eyes and mouth open.[tpl]Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rvwH7euUccIC&lpg=PA75&dq=marilyn%20playboy&hl=en&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=playboy&f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon[/tpl] The heavy promotion centered around Marilyn's nudity on the already famous calendar, together with the teasers in marketing, made the new Playboy magazine a success.[tpl]Cite book|url = http://books.google.es/books?id=xL0cGu1ISVEC&lpg=PA16&dq=marilyn+playboy&hl=en&pg=PA16&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=marilyn%20playboy&f=false |page = 16 |author =  Susan Gunelius |title = Building Brand Value the Playboy Way[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=7SUqJZXVWLsC&lpg=PA157&dq=marilyn+playboy&hl=en&pg=PA157 |page = 157 |author = Gordon Jensen |title = Marilyn: A Great Woman's Struggles: Who Killed Her and Why [/tpl]
The first issue sold out in weeks. Known circulation was 53,991.Playboy Collector's Association Playboy Magazine Price Guide The cover price was 50¢. Copies of the first issue in mint to near mint condition sold for over $5,000 in 2002.
The novel Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, was serialized in the March, April and May 1954 issues of Playboy.
An urban legend started about Hefner and the Playmate of the Month because of markings on the front covers of the magazine. From 1955 to 1979 (except for a six-month gap in 1976), the "P" in Playboy had stars printed in or around the letter. The legend stated that this was either a rating that Hefner gave to the Playmate according to how attractive she was, the number of times that Hefner had slept with her, or how good she was in bed. The stars, between zero and 12, actually indicated the domestic or international advertising region for that printing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/risque/celebrities/hefner.asp |title=Stars Upon Thars |publisher=Snopes.com |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2009[/tpl]

====Rabbit logo====

Playboy's iconic and enduring mascot, a stylized silhouette of a rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie, was created by Playboy art director Art Paul for the second issue as an endnote, but was adopted as the official logo and has appeared ever since.[tpl]cite web|last=Faye |first=Marcia |url=http://www.iit.edu/magazine/spring_2009/article_2.shtml |title=Art Paul: The art of designing Playboy |publisher= iitmagazine |date= Spring 2009|accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h9PZI10IuIoC&printsec=frontcover&vq=Art+Paul |title=Heller, Steven and Vienne, Véronique, The Education of an Art Director Allworth Communications, Inc., (2005)ISBN 1581154356, ISBN 978-1-58115-435-1 pp. 174–180 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl] A running joke in the magazine involves hiding the logo somewhere in the cover art or photograph. Hefner said he chose the rabbit for its "humorous sexual connotation", and because the image was "frisky and playful".
In an interview Hefner explained his choice of a rabbit as Playboy's logo to the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci:
[tpl]cquote| The rabbit, the bunny, in America has a sexual meaning; and I chose it because it's a fresh animal, shy, vivacious, jumping - sexy. First it smells you then it escapes, then it comes back, and you feel like caressing it, playing with it. A girl resembles a bunny. Joyful, joking. Consider the girl we made popular: the Playmate of the Month. She is never sophisticated, a girl you cannot really have. She is a young, healthy, simple girl - the girl next  door . . . we are not interested in the mysterious, difficult woman, the femme fatale, who wears elegant underwear, with lace, and she is sad, and somehow mentally filthy. The Playboy girl has no lace, no underwear, she is naked, well-washed with soap and water, and she is happy.[/tpl] [tpl]in5|30[/tpl]"Hugh Hefner: 'I am in the center of the world,'" by Oriana Fallaci, LOOK Magazine, January 10, 1967
The jaunty rabbit was quickly a popular symbol of extroverted male culture, becoming a lucrative source of merchandizing revenue for Playboy. In the 1950s, it was adopted as military aircraft insignia for the Navy's VX-4 fighter-evaluation squadron.

During this period the magazine published fiction by Saul Bellow, Sean O'Faolain, John Updike, James Dickey, John Cheever, Doris Lessing, Joyce Carol Oates, Vladimir Nabokov, Michael Crichton, John LeCarre, Irwin Shaw, Jean Shepherd, Arthur Koestler, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, John Irving, Anne Sexton, Nadine Gordimer, Kurt Vonnegut and J.

Since reaching its peak in the 1970s, Playboy saw a decline in circulation and cultural relevance due to competition in the field it founded—first from Penthouse, then Oui (which was published as a spin-off of Playboy) and Gallery in the 1970s; later from pornographic videos; and more recently from lad mags such as Maxim, FHM, and Stuff. In response, Playboy has attempted to re-assert its hold on the 18–35 male demographic through slight changes to content and focusing on issues and personalities more appropriate to its audience—such as hip-hop artists being featured in the "Playboy Interview".
Christie Hefner, daughter of the founder Hugh Hefner, joined Playboy in 1975 and became head of the company in 1988. She announced in December 2008 that she would be stepping down from leading the company, effective in January 2009, and said that the election of Barack Obama as the next President had inspired her to give more time to charitable work, and that the decision to step down was her own. “Just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well,” she said.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article5310203.ece|title=Hefner's daughter Christie walks away from Playboy Enterprises |work=The Times | location=London | first=Christine | last=Seib | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]

===2000s–2010s===

The magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the January 2004 issue. Celebrations were held at Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, and Moscow during the year to commemorate this event.
The magazine runs several annual features and ratings. One of the most popular is its annual ranking of the top "party schools" among all U.S. universities and colleges. For 2009, the magazine used five considerations: bikini, brains, campus, sex and sports in the development of its list. The top ranked party school by Playboy for 2009 was the University of Miami.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/party-schools-2009-the-stats/index.html|title="Top Party Schools 2009," Playboy magazine, May 2009.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509091054/http://www.playboy.com/articles/party-schools-2009-the-stats/index.html|archivedate=May 9, 2009|accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl]
In June 2009, the magazine reduced its publication schedule to 11 issues per year, with a combined July/August issue and on August 11, 2009. London's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that Hugh Hefner had sold his English Manor house (next door to the famous Playboy Mansion) for $18 m ($10 m less than the reported asking price) to another American Daren Metropoulos the President and coowner of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Also that due to significant losses in the company's value (down from $1 billion in 2000 to $84 million in 2009) the Playboy publishing empire is up for sale for $300 m.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/6007514/Hugh-Hefner-sells-LA-property-as-financial-crisis-hits-Playboy.html|title=www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/6007514/Hugh-Hefner-sells-LA-property-as-financial-crisis-hits-Playboy.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=August 11, 2009 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] In December 2009, they further reduced the publication schedule to 10 issues per year, with a combined January/February issue.
On July 12, 2010, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced Hefner's $5.50 per share offer ($122.5 million based on shares outstanding on April 30 and the closing price on July 9) to buy the portion of the company he did not already own and take the company private with the help of Rizvi Traverse Management LLC.

==The Playboy Interview==

Besides its centerfold, a major part of Playboy for much of its existence has been the Playboy Interview, an extensive (usually several thousand-word) discussion between a notable individual and an interviewer (historian Alex Haley, for example, served as a Playboy interviewer on a few occasions; one of his interviews was with Martin Luther King Jr.; he also interviewed Malcolm X, then coauthored his autobiography). One of the magazine's most notable interviews was a discussion with then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter in the November 1976 issue in which he stated "I've committed adultery in my heart many times."Playboy Interview with Jimmy Carter, Playboy, November 1976[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/history/faculty/TROYWEB/Courseweb/JimmyCarterThePlayboyInterview.htm|title=McGill University website excerpt[/tpl] David Sheff's interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono appeared in the January 1981 issue, which was on newsstands at the time of Lennon's murder; the interview was later published in book format.
Another interview type section, entitled "20Q" (a play on the game of Twenty Questions), was added in October 1978.  Cheryl Tiegs was the first interviewee for the section.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/trivia.html#5|title=playboy.com / world of playboy / events|accessdate=December 16, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110607094500/http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/trivia.html#5|archivedate=June 7, 2011[/tpl]

==Circulation==

The best-selling Playboy edition was the November 1972 edition, which sold 7,161,561 copies. One-quarter of all American college men were buying the magazine every month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/20/060320crbo_books|title=The Girls Next Door: The New Yorker|accessdate=December 16, 2012[/tpl] On the cover was model Pam Rawlings, photographed by Rowland Scherman.
Perhaps coincidentally, a cropped image of the issue's centerfold (which featured Lena Söderberg) became a de facto standard image for testing image processing algorithms. It is known simply as the "Lenna" (also "Lena") image in that field.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml |title=The Rest of the Lenna Story |publisher=2.cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl]

==Bans on the sale of Playboy==

Many in the American religious community opposed the publication of Playboy. The Louisiana pastor and author L. L. Clover wrote in his 1974 treatise Evil Spirits Intellectualism and Logic that Playboy encouraged young men to view themselves as "pleasure-seeking individuals for whom sex is fun and women are play things."L. L. Clover, Evil Spirits, Intellectualism and Logic (Minden, Louisiana: Louisiana Missionary Baptist Institute and Seminary, 1974), pp. 18–19
In many parts of Asia, including India, mainland China, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei, sale and distribution of Playboy is banned. In addition, sale and distribution is banned in most Muslim countries (except Lebanon[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-03-30/entertainment/18232125_1_arabic-version-arab-world-al-jazeera-satellite-channel | location=New York | work=Daily News | title= Foreign Web sites offer alternate perspectives on the conflict in Iraq| first=Michelle | last=Megna | date=March 30, 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=244050&lang=e&dir=news |title=Middle East and Arab World Headline News |publisher=Al Bawaba |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] and Turkey) in Asia and Africa, including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Despite the ban on the magazine in these countries, the official Playboy brand itself can still appear on various merchandise such as perfume and deodorants.
While banned in mainland China, the magazine is sold in Hong Kong. In Japan, where genitals of models cannot be shown, a separate edition is published under license by Shueisha.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] An Indonesian edition was launched in April 2006, but controversy started before the first issue hit the stands. Though the publisher said the content of the Indonesian edition will be different from the original edition, the government tried to ban it by using anti-pornography rules.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] A Muslim organization, the Islamic Defenders Front (IDF), opposed Playboy on the grounds of pornography. On April 12, about 150 IDF members clashed with police and stoned the editorial offices. Despite this, the edition quickly sold out. On April 6, 2007 the chief judge of the case dismissed the charges because they had been incorrectly filed.[tpl]cite news|title='Playboy' charges thrown out of court|author=Thompson, G.|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-04-05/playboy-charges-thrown-out-of-court/2235604|newspaper=ABC News|date=April 5, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2013[/tpl]
In 1986, the American convenience store chain 7-Eleven removed the magazine. The store returned Playboy to its shelves in late 2003. 7-Eleven had also been selling Penthouse and other similar magazines before the ban.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In 1995 Playboy was returned to shelves in Republic of Ireland after a 36-year ban, despite staunch opposition from many women's groups.Sun Journal – Google News Archive Search
Playboy was not sold in the state of Queensland, Australia during 2004 and 2005 but returned as of 2006. Due to declining sales, the last Australia-wide edition of Playboy was the January 2000 issue.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

==Depictions of children==

A study lead by Judith Reisman and funded by the United States Department of Justice found that Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler cartoons frequently contain sexual depictions of children. This content was introduced into Playboy one year after its founding, and frequently features incestuous themes.Media, children, and the family: social scientific, psychodynamic, and clinical perspectives, edited by Dolf Zillmann, Jennings Bryant, Aletha C.

==Litigation==

On January 14, 2004, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s (PEI) trademark terms "Playboy" and "Playmate" should be protected in the situation where a user typing "Playboy" or "Playmate" in a browser search was instead shown advertisements of companies that competed with PEI. (The decision reversed an earlier district court ruling.) The suit started on April 15, 1999, when Playboy sued Excite Inc. and Netscape for trademark infringement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1024-5146502.html |title=Netscape, Playboy settle search trademark case - CNET News.com |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=2011-12-07[/tpl]
