3552 Don Quixote is an Amor, Mars-crossing, Jupiter-crossing asteroid. It has a highly inclined comet-like orbit that leads to frequent perturbations by Jupiter,[tpl]cite web |date=2009-05-02 last obs |title=JPL Close-Approach Data: 3552 Don Quixote (1983 SA) |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=3552;cad=1#cad |accessdate=2009-05-06[/tpl] measures 18.4 km in diameter and has a rotation period of 7.7 hours. Don Quixote was discovered by Paul Wild in 1983, and is named after the comic knight who is the eponymous hero of Cervantes' Spanish novel Don Quixote (1605).
Due to its comet-like orbit and albedo, Don Quixote has ever been suspected to be an extinct comet.[tpl]cite journal|title = What the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids tell us about sources of their origin?|author = D.F.

The cometary activity is interpreted as [tpl]CO2[/tpl] molecular band emission. It is not clear if the observed activity is persistent or an outburst, resulting from the excavation of sub-surface [tpl]CO2[/tpl] ice due to a recent impact of a smaller body.
