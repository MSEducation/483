CATEGORIES: Korean soups and stews, Potato dishes

Gamja ongsimi is a variety of sujebi (a dumpling soup) in Korean cuisine, consisting of dumplings made from ground potato and chopped vegetables in a clear broth. It is a local specialty of Gangwon province, South Korea, where a lot of potatoes are cultivated and harvested due to the cold weather. It has a relatively bland taste with a broth usually made from anchovies. The name is a combination of two words; gamja (감자), meaning potato in Korean; and ongsimi (옹심이), the Gangwon dialect term for saeyal (새알), a small ball made of grain flour served in soups or porridge.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/News/Total/newsRead.asp?sub_cd=DH31&newsid=02243526589823400&MLvl=2&clkcode=00102 |title=불붙은 단풍… 불타는 식욕 |trans_title=Burning maple trees...burning appetite|publisher=The Chosun Ilbo / Edaily|language=Korean |date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]메밀의 고장 평창에 가을 바람이 분다
