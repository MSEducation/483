Agnes of Antioch, (1154 – c. 1184), Queen Consort of Hungary.
Agnes was the daughter of Raynald of Châtillon, Prince of Antioch by right of his wife, and his first wife, Constance of Antioch. Her father was captured by the Muslims in Nov 1160 and was confined in Aleppo for the next fifteen years.
In 1170, Ágnes went to Constantinople, where her sister Maria had been living as the wife of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus. She received the name Anna in the imperial court. On the Emperor's request, Agnes was married to kaiszar Alexius, who had been engaged to the Emperor's daughter, Maria Comnena until the birth of Manuel's son, Alexius in 1166.
The new couple went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem where they made a donation for the Knights Hospitaller. In the summer, after the death of King Stephen III of Hungary, her husband ascended the throne as King Béla III, and they moved to Hungary. Here the queen was known as Anna, as the name Agnes was rare at that time.
Agnes died in 1184, aged around thirty. She was buried in Székesfehérvár. Her remains were confidently identified by archeologists during late 19th century excavations at the ruined cathedral of Székesfehérvár. Her remains were afterwards reinterred at the Mathias Church in Budapest, with those of her husband.
