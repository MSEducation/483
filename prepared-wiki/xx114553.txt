[[John Barrowman]] noted that in many ways Martha entered Torchwood as their superior as being employed with UNIT placed her in a higher authority. In the same episode, Martha notes that an "impeccable source" recommended her employment to UNIT, implying the Doctor holds the highest level of faith in Martha's capability. Her Torchwood outfit was specifically designed to reflect her development, with Costume designer Ray Holman stating: "We wanted to give her that air of authority, with some professional-looking and quite classy fitted suits".<ref name="TWM">[tpl]cite journal  | last = Holman  | first = Ray  | title = Doctor Fox  | journal = [[Torchwood Magazine]]  | issue = 5  | pages = 29  | publisher = [[Panini Comics]]  | date = 16 May 2008 (Cover Date) [/tpl]</ref>
Martha is first seen in action with UNIT in "The Sontaran Stratagem", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively if the Doctor turns all of his companions into "soldiers". The Doctor also appears to disapprove over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not carry a gun, and stating that she is trying to make UNIT "better" from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun-toting: "I never felt any danger of that happening. At the end of Series Three, she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still has this caring side to her".[tpl]cite journal  | last = Cook | first = Benjamin  | title = Freema Agyeman  | journal = Doctor Who Magazine  | issue = 398  | pages = 22–23  | publisher = Panini Comics  | date = 20 August 2008 | title = She moves in Her Own Way [/tpl]
Martha tells Owen in the Torchwood episode "Reset", that she has a boyfriend, who is revealed to be paediatric doctor Thomas Milligan in "The Sontaran Stratagem", by which time the two are engaged — indicating that Martha has gotten over her love for the Doctor. In "The Poison Sky" she cites her relationship with Thomas Milligan as a reason to stay on Earth, rather than join Donna and Doctor in the TARDIS - saying that she's now got a great big adventure of her own to enjoy. Agyeman feels that Martha's relationship with Tom has "helped cement where she is in life". Agyeman also feels that it was important for Martha's mother Francine to re-appear in "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", as closure for what happened to the Jones family in Series Three: "It's great for the audience to know that all this talk of Martha wanting to stay on earth because of her family is for real. It's great to see Adjoa there, representing the Jones clan, even though it's a fleeting appearance. She's still very much in Martha's life".
Director Euros Lyn comments that the production team had intended for Agyeman and Clarke to join Torchwood for its third series, but their careers led them elsewhere.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b14762_exclusive_eve_myles_director_euros_lyn.html|title=Exclusive: Eve Myles and Director Euros Lyn Talk 'Torchwood' Season 3!|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|date=19 February 2009|accessdate=22 February 2009|work=Fearnet.com[/tpl] When the characters interact with UNIT officers in Children of Earth, Martha's absence is explained by her being on honeymoon. Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies explains that Agyeman was cast in Law & Order: UK before Children of Earth had been officially commissioned. Because Law & Order offered her 13 episodes a year, she went with that over Torchwood which had been reduced to 5. In response, Davies created the character of Lois Habiba, played by Cush Jumbo, to be a "kind of a Martha figure", one with added innocence who is out of her depth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/06/russell_t_davies_talks_doctor.html|title=Russell T.
