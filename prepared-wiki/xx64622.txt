The Convair 990 Coronado was a narrow-body four-jet airliner produced by the Convair division of General Dynamics, a "stretched" version of their earlier Convair 880 produced in response to a request from American Airlines. The 990 was lengthened by [tpl]convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], which increased the number of passengers from between 88 and 110 in the 880, to between 96 and 121. This was still fewer than the contemporary Boeing 707 (110 to 189) or Douglas DC-8 (105 to 173), although the 990 was claimed to be [tpl]convert|25|-|35|mph|kph|abbr=on[/tpl] faster than either in cruise.

==Design and development==

American Airlines asked Convair to design an aircraft for coast-to-coast flights, able to fly nonstop from New York to Los Angeles against the wind. They wanted a somewhat larger passenger capacity than the 880, which was the smallest of the first-generation U.S. jet airliners. The 990 entered production in 1961.
One change from the 880 was the large anti-shock body on the upper wings to increase the critical Mach and reduce transonic drag. Originally, there were plans to use the bulges as fuel tanks, but during test flights the extra weight caused the tanks to vibrate excessively. Instead, the inner set of bumps also served a secondary role as fuel dump for the fuel tanks in the fuselage.
The engines were also changed to the uprated General Electric CJ-805-23s, which were unique in that they used a fan stage at the rear of the engines, compared to the fan stage at the front of the engine found on the Pratt & Whitney JT3D that powered the 990's competitors. The engine was a simplified, non afterburning civil version of the J79, used in military fighters. Like the J79, the CJ805 was smoky.
Like the 880, 990s were later modified with a dorsal "raceway" added to the top of fuselage to hold wiring for additional instrumentation.

==Operational history==

The 990 did not meet the specifications promised and American Airlines reduced their order as a result. The 990A was developed by adding fairings to the engine nacelles, with pylons at the lower surface of the wing. Convair and GE aerodynamicists designed these modifications using a local area rule to delay the high-speed drag rise.Kutney, John T. and Stanley P. Piszkin. "Reduction of Drag Rise on the Convair 990 Airplane". AIAA Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 1 No. 1, January–February 1964, pp. 8–12.  Despite the modifications, the aircraft never lived up to its promise of coast-to-coast nonstop capability from JFK to LAX. American Airlines timetables show little or no difference in scheduled times between 707 and 990A flights; AA began to dispose of their 990As in 1967.
In 1963 the 990A was reported to burn 11,750 lb/hour at Mach 0.84 (483 knots) at 35,000 ft at a weight of 200,000 lb.Flight 31 Jan 1963 p150
Swissair bought eight 990As from 1962 onwards, operating them on long-distance routes to South America, West Africa, the Middle and Far East, as well as on European routes with heavy traffic. Their fleet was withdrawn from service in 1975. Scandinavian Airlines also operated Coronados on their long-haul schedules to Tokyo and other destinations in the Far East.
The 990's market niche was soon captured entirely by the Boeing 727 and 720, a derivative of the 707. By the time the assembly line was shut down in 1963, only 37 990s had been produced, bringing General Dynamics' entire production of commercial jet airliners to 102 airframes. The failure of airlines to accept the Convair 880 and 990 led Convair to suffer what at the time were the largest corporate losses in history.
When the major airlines retired their Convair 990s, they found a second life operating for charter airlines. Spantax of Spain had a large fleet until they were gradually retired in the mid-1980s.

==Aircraft on display==

Several 990s have survived. A former Swissair Convair 990 is on display in the Swiss transportation museum, the Verkehrshaus in Luzern, while two are owned by the Mojave Spaceport. Of these, one is on display at the airport's entrance, and the other is used for movie and television filming projects.
