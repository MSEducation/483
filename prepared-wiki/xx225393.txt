==Synopsis==

Fletcher has been informed that Godber is to become his new cellmate. Understandably, Fletcher is not too happy because he had just been given a single cell. Godber explains its not is fault, because there was a riot on his block, and his cellmate Banksy set fire to his own bed as well as Godber's. Godber soon finds out that Fletcher has rather strict rules about his cell.
After lock-up that night, Godber soon tells Fletcher that he is depressed and is finding prison life hard to adjust to. Fletcher tells Godber the best way to think of it, is to see it as just a "quiet night in". The trouble is that Godber has 698 to go.
During the night, Fletcher tells Godber about his daughter Ingrid being conceived on the tomb of Karl Marx. Also, Fletcher says how his three children were born five years apart because he kept going away for five years. Fletcher advises Godber not to have any carnal thoughts about women, because this would only depress him. Before he goes to sleep, Godber prays out loud much to Fletcher's chagrin.
The next morning, the cells are opened again for the day. Godber swaps his Liquorice allsorts for a squeeze of Fletcher's special toothpaste. Godber thanks Fletcher for helping me to get through the night. Fletcher replies that they could have another quiet night in that evening. The episode ends with the prisoners going out onto the landing to start their day.
