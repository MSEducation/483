In May 2009, the management instituted its Parental Involvement Program (derisively known in the community as the "anti-teenager policy"), whereby anyone under age 18 must be accompanied by an adult after a 4pm "curfew" on weekends, or be forced to leave by mall security.  This was in response to several notable incidences of violence and mayhem perpetrated primarily by teenagers.http://crossroadsnews.com/view/full_story/2174776/article-Stonecrest-placing-limits-on-unaccompanied-youth
