HD 36960 is a B-type main-sequence star in the constellation Orion. At an apparent magnitude of +4.78 it is visible to the naked eye in many areas, though in most urban areas it cannot be seen due to light pollution. The star is also massive along with many other stars of Orion. At over 15 solar masses, it shines with nearly 40,000 times the Sun's luminosity due to its high surface temperature (29,000K). Due to its high mass, the star will expand into a blue supergiant in the next few million years and eventually a red supergiant after that. During this phase, the star will probably be a second or third magnitude star and easily viable to the naked eye (probably about as bright as Kappa Orionis (Saiph) is today). The ultimate fate of the star is most likely a Type II supernova. When it has fully exhausted its fuel, the core will produce heavier elements like Iron. Then, its core will become unstable and collapse with the rest of the star expanding outward in a luminous explosion. Such an event from this distance would shine brightly in Earth's sky. Assuming this event is identical to SN 1054, it would shine with an apparent magnitude of -8.71, about 1/40 as bright as the full moon despite its distance of over 1,800 light years.
