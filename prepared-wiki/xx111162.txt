[[Zilog Z16C01]]

CATEGORIES: Microcontrollers

The Zilog Z16C01 SCC was introduced in the early 1980s and provided the ability to do both standard UART style serial communications along with the HDLC protocol for a reasonable price.  It was a descendant of the earlier Zilog SIO, and its main enhancement was the inclusion of a built-in baud rate generator.
It was part of the Zilog Z8000 chip set.
