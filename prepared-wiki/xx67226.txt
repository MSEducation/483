Joe's Garage is a 1979 rock opera by Frank Zappa.  Zappa self-deprecatingly describes the album as a "stupid little story about how the government is going to do away with music."  Originally released as two separate studio albums on Zappa Records, the project was later remastered and reissued as a triple album box set, Joe's Garage, Acts I, II & III, in 1987.   The story is told by a character identified as the "Central Scrutinizer" narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.
The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes guitar solos from older live recordings and overdubs them onto new studio recordings.  All of the guitar solos on the album are xenochronous except for "Crew Slut" and "Watermelon in Easter Hay", a signature song that Zappa has described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played.
The album initially received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative and original music, but criticizing the scatological, sexual and profane nature of the lyrics.  Since its original release, Joe's Garage has been reappraised as one of Zappa's best works.

==Background==

After being released from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc..  He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working on a series of songs for a follow-up album.[tpl]rp|370|date=December 2012[/tpl] The songs "Joe's Garage" and "Catholic Girls" were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release them as a single.[tpl]cite news|last=Swenson|first=John|date=13 December 1979|title=Frank Zappa: The Myth Of 'Joe's Garage'|publisher=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Throughout the development of Joe's Garage, Zappa's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album.[tpl]cite book|last=Courrier|first=Kevin|year=2002|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QjkUAQAAIAAJ |title=Dangerous Kitchen: The Subversive World of Zappa|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1550224476[/tpl][tpl]rp|331|date=December 2012[/tpl]  The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa first featured on One Size Fits All (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings,[tpl]cite book|last=Gulla|first=Bob|year=2008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC&pg=PA254 |title=Guitar Gods: The 25 Players Who Made Rock History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0313358060[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound/ |title=We are the Mothers...and This Is What We Sound Like! |author=Michie, Chris |date=January 1, 2003 |publisher=Mix |accessdate=21 February 2012[/tpl] or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece.
Midway through recording the new album, Zappa decided that the songs connected coherently and wrote a story, changing the new album into a rock opera.[tpl]cite book|last=Lowe|first=Kelly Fisher|year=2007|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6005-4[/tpl][tpl]rp|149|date=December 2012[/tpl] Joe's Garage was the final album Zappa recorded at a commercial studio. Zappa's own studio, the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, built as an addition to Zappa's home, and completed in late 1979, was used to record and mix all of his subsequent releases.

==Style and influences==

===Lyrics and story themes===

The lyrical themes of Joe's Garage involve individualism, sexuality, the danger of large government, and "the foolishness of white males", according to Kelly Fisher Lowe in The Words and Music of Frank Zappa.[tpl]rp|149|date=December 2012[/tpl] The album is narrated by a government employee identifying himself as The Central Scrutinizer, who delivers a cautionary tale about Joe, a typical adolescent male who forms a band as the government prepares to criminalize music.[tpl]rp|150|date=December 2012[/tpl] The Central Scrutinizer explains that music leads to a "slippery slope" of drug use, disease, unusual sexual practices, prison, and eventually, insanity.[tpl]rp|150|date=December 2012[/tpl]  According to Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, Zappa's narrative of censorship reflected the censorship of music during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, where rock music was made illegal.[tpl]cite book|last=Schinder|first=Scott|coauthor=Andy Schwartz|year=2008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CzWE_J3ZZfoC&pg=PA370 |title=Icons of Rock|volume=2|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313338477[/tpl][tpl]rp|370|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The title track is noted as having an autobiographical aspect, as the character of Larry (as performed by Zappa himself) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because "it sounded good to me".[tpl]rp|150|date=December 2012[/tpl] In real life, Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself, his sole intended audience.[tpl]rp|150|date=December 2012[/tpl] The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had, and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past.[tpl]rp|150|date=December 2012[/tpl] In "Joe's Garage", Joe finds that the music industry is "not everything it is cracked up to be".[tpl]rp|151|date=December 2012[/tpl] The song refers to a number of music fads, including new wave, heavy metal, disco and glitter rock, and is critical of the music industry of the late 1970s.[tpl]rp|151|date=December 2012[/tpl]
"Catholic Girls" is critical of the Catholic Church, and satirizes "the hypocrisy of the myth of the good Catholic girl."[tpl]rp|151|date=December 2012[/tpl] While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating  "American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex is really all about, they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up."[tpl]cite book |last=Miles|first=Barry|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2pPgG9AXjN4C&pg=PA284 |title=Zappa|year=2004 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=080211783X|pages=284–285[/tpl]  This view inspired the lyrical content of "Crew Slut", in which Mary, Joe's girlfriend, falls into the groupie lifestyle, going on to participate in a wet T-shirt contest in the following track, "Wet T-Shirt Nite."
"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?" was written in the summer of 1978.[tpl]cite web|author=François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/why-does-it-hurt-when-i-pee-t3004204 |title=Why Does It Hurt When I Pee? |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl] Zappa's road manager, Phil Kaufman, alleged, that the song was written after Kaufman had asked that very question; within the context of the album's storyline, it is sung by Joe after he receives a sexually transmitted disease from Lucille, "a girl, who works at the Jack in the Box". The Central Scrutinizer continues to express the hypothesis that "girls, music, disease, heartbreak ... all go together."[tpl]rp|155|date=December 2012[/tpl] Halfway through the album's libretto, Zappa expressed the belief, that governments believe, that people are inherently criminals, and continue to invent laws, which gives states the legal grounds to arrest people, leading to the fictional criminalization of music, which occurs towards the end of the album's storyline.[tpl]rp|155|date=December 2012[/tpl]
"A Token of My Extreme" satirizes Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as new age beliefs and the sexual revolution.[tpl]rp|155|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|editor=Bould, Mark; Butler, Andrew M|year=2009|chapter=L.

===Music and performance===

The music of Joe's Garage encompassed a variety of styles, including blues, jazz, doo wop, lounge, orchestral, rock, pop and reggae. "Catholic Girls" makes musical reference to Zappa's controversial song "Jewish Princess", as a sitar plays the melody of the earlier song during the fadeout of "Catholic Girls". "Crew Slut" is performed as a slow blues song, with slide guitar riffs and a harmonica solo.[tpl]rp|152–153|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]rp|333|date=December 2012[/tpl] According to Kelly Fisher Lowe, the song is "more Rolling Stones or Aerosmith than it is Gatemouth Brown or Guitar Watson".[tpl]rp|152–153|date=December 2012[/tpl] The extended three and a half minute, two-part guitar solo in "Toad-O-Line" is taken from Zappa's earlier song, "Inca Roads.""Inca Roads: FZ album(s) in which song has appeared" at globalia.net
"A Token Of My Extreme" originated as an instrumental song played during improvised conversations by saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock and George Duke on keyboards. It typically opened Zappa's concerts in 1974; a recording of this version of the piece was released under the title "Tush Tush Tush (A Token of My Extreme)" on You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2.[tpl]rp|155|date=December 2012[/tpl]
"Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up" first appeared on Jeff Simmons' album of the same name, on which its writing is credited to "La Marr Bruister", one of Zappa's pseudonyms.[tpl]cite web|author=François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/lucille-has-messed-my-mind-up-t3004205 |title=Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl] The Joe's Garage arrangement is radically different, and is played as a reggae song. "Stick It Out" originated as part of the Mothers of Invention's "Sofa" routine in the early 1970s.[tpl]rp|120|date=December 2012[/tpl] The Joe's Garage version is musically influenced by funk and disco, with its lyrics performed first in German, and then in English.[tpl]rp|156|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Watson|first=Ben|year=1996|title=Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312141240[/tpl][tpl]rp|270|date=December 2012[/tpl] "Sy Borg" derives from funk, reggae and R&B.[tpl]rp|154, 156|date=December 2012[/tpl]
"Keep It Greasy" had been performed by Zappa since 1975; the Joe's Garage album version features a guitar solo from a March 1979 live performance of the song "City of Tiny Lights". Another March 1979 guitar solo from "City of Tiny Lights" is incorporated into the song "Outside Now" using the same recording technique. "Packard Goose" also uses xenochrony, with its guitar solo taken from a March 1979 performance of "Easy Meat".
The album concludes with a long guitar instrumental, "Watermelon in Easter Hay", the only guitar solo recorded for the album, in 9/4 time; every other guitar solo on the album was xenochronous—overdubbed from older live recordings.[tpl]rp|154|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]rp|381|date=December 2012[/tpl]  In their review of the album, Down Beat magazine criticized the song,[tpl]rp|376|date=December 2012[/tpl] but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa's masterpiece.  Lowe called it the "crowning achievement of the album" and "one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced".[tpl]rp|159|date=December 2012[/tpl]  Zappa told Neil Slaven that he thought it was "the best song on the album".[tpl]rp|376|date=December 2012[/tpl] The songs' title is thought to have come from a saying used by Zappa while recording the album: "Playing a guitar solo with this band is like trying to grow watermelon in Easter hay". After Zappa died, "Watermelon in Easter Hay" became known as one of his signature songs, and his son, Dweezil Zappa, later referred to it as "the best solo Zappa ever played".[tpl]cite book|last=Drenching|first=T.H.F.|year=2005|chapter='Watermelon In Easter Hay': The Function of the Reverb Unit & the Poverty of the Individual Spirit|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology|editors=Watson, Ben; Leslie, Esther|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719792[/tpl][tpl]rp|90–91|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The song is followed by "A Little Green Rosetta", a song that was originally intended to appear on Zappa's shelved Läther album, but rerecorded with different lyrics for Joe's Garage.[tpl]rp|159|date=December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=by François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/a-little-green-rosetta-t3004216 |title=A Little Green Rosetta |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl]

==Release==

Joe's Garage was initially released in separate units, beginning with the single LP Act I in September 1979. For the album artwork, Zappa was photographed in blackface, holding a mop.[tpl]cite book|last=Slaven|first=Niel|year=1997|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa|publisher=Music Sales Group|isbn=0857120433[/tpl][tpl]rp|381|date=December 2012[/tpl] This image was originally intended to be the cover for an unreleased album entitled "Läther" which did not materialize as planned.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The gatefold sleeve of Act I was designed by John Williams, and featured a collage, which included a naked Maya, vague technical drawings, pyramids and fingers on the fret of a guitar.[tpl]rp|381|date=December 2012[/tpl] The lyric insert featured similar illustrations, which related to the content of the songs and storyline. The title track was released as a single, with "The Central Scrutinizer" as its B-side. It did not chart.[tpl]cite web|author=François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/joes-garage-t3004199 |title=Joe's Garage |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl]
Act I peaked at #27 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. It was followed by the double album Acts II & III in November. The gatefold of Acts II & III featured collages taken from a medical journal, while the cover for Acts II & III featured a makeup artist applying blackface makeup to Zappa's face.[tpl]rp|381|date=December 2012[/tpl] Acts II & III peaked at #53 on the Pop Albums chart.
Joe's Garage was reissued in 1987 as a triple album, combining Acts I, II & III into a single box set, and as a double album on compact disc. The song "Wet T-Shirt Nite" received two alternate titles, when the album was released on CD: the libretto referred to the song as "The Wet T-Shirt Contest", while the back cover referred to the song as "Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt".[tpl]cite web|author=François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/wet-t-shirt-night-t650622 |title=Wet T-Shirt Night |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl] In an interview, Zappa explained that the "fembot" was the name given to a female robot in an episode of the TV series The Six Million Dollar Man. Additionally, the instrumental "Toad-O Line" was renamed "On the Bus".[tpl]cite web|author=François Couture |url=http://allmusic.com/song/toad-o-line-t650623 |title=Toad O Line |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl]  The Central Scrutinizer monologue at the end of "Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up", which concludes the story's first act, was indexed as its own track on the CD reissue, under the title "Scrutinizer Postlude".

==Reception and legacy==

Joe's Garage received mixed to positive reviews upon release, with criticisms aimed at its profane lyrical content, but has since been reappraised as a landmark album. Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann gave 3 out of 5 stars for the individual releases Act I and Acts II & III. Ruhlmann wrote of Act I, "although his concern with government censorship would see a later flowering in his battles with the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), here he wasn't able to use it to fulfill a satisfying dramatic function." Ruhlmann also felt that Acts II & III "seems so thin and thrown together, musically and dramatically".
Don Shewey of Rolling Stone magazine wrote, "If the surface of this opera is cluttered with cheap gags and musical mishmash, its soul is located in profound existential sorrow. The guitar solos that Zappa plays in Joe's imagination burn with a desolate, devastating beauty. Flaws and all, Joe's Garage is Frank Zappa's Apocalypse Now." The collected Acts I, II & III release received 4.5 out of 5 stars from Allmusic's Steve Huey, who wrote "in spite of its flaws, Joe's Garage has enough substance to make it one of Zappa's most important '70s works and overall political statements, even if it's not focused enough to rank with his earliest Mothers of Invention masterpieces."
For his performance on Joe's Garage, Vinnie Colaiuta was named "the most technically advanced drummer ever" by Modern Drummer, which ranked the album as one of the top 25 greatest drumming performances of all time.[tpl]cite book|last=Lackowski|first=Rich|year=2008|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJGsMxYZf3MC&pg=PA58|title=On the Beaten Path, Progressive Rock: The Drummer's Guide to the Genre and the Legends Who Defined It|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=0739056719[/tpl][tpl]rp|58|date=December 2012[/tpl] On September 26, 2008, Joe's Garage was staged by the Open Fist Theatre Company in Los Angeles, in a production authorized by the Zappa Family Trust.Morris, Stephen Leigh (2008), "Frank Zappa's Joe's Garage Gets Its Premiere 29 Years On", LA Weekly.
