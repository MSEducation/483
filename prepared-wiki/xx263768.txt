CATEGORIES: Children's charities

SunnyKids is an Australian children's charitable organisation. Established in 1999 as a domestic and family violence service on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia, the service initially partnered with government and the community to build and purchase a series of properties in the region to accommodate women and children escaping domestic violence and family violence.
By 2003, SunnyKids was providing 7000 nights accommodation per year with 75% of this provided to children, many of whom represented the third and sometimes fourth generation of their family to live in refuge. Even though in Australia 75% of people living in refuges are children,Najidah 2006 government practice has been to fund the parent in the service, and to only view the child as "accompanying" the parent. The logic behind this is the idea that if the parent is helped the child automatically benefits, and therefore does not require a direct service.QLD Department of Communities Homelessness Funding Performance Measures
In 2003, SunnyKids observed that many people using crisis accommodation services, including SunnyKids' own services, did so in a somewhat cyclical manner. Young people requiring youth refuge accommodation often required crisis accommodation as adults, and children who entered services as an "accompanying" child with their parent frequently returned to such services again as adults, often with their own children now "accompanying" them. In an effort to break such cycles, the Board of SunnyKids determined to develop their practice into child-focussed interventions aiming to break intergenerational cycles of poverty and disadvantage.
Between 2003 and 2009, SunnyKids developed integrated support systems and child-focussed programs. During this time accommodation provision grew to 10,000 nights per yearSunnyKids Annual Report View annual report. At this time, the organisation also began to gain national profile as its services and programs won national recognition in multiple awards programs.
In 2009, the organisation received multiple requests to establish similar programs in communities across Australia so the SunnyKids partners program, and SunnyKids children's charity were established. Today SunnyKids is establishing:
