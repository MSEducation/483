Duala (also spelled Douala, Diwala, Dwela, Dualla, and Dwala)  is a dialect cluster spoken by the Duala and Mungo peoples of Cameroon. The song "Soul Makossa", as well as pop songs that repeated its lyrics, internationally popularized the Duala word for "(I) dance", "makossa".http://www.inst.at/trans/13Nr/echu13.htm The song Alane by artist Wes Madiko is sung in Duala and reached #1 position in over 9 European countries.
Duala belongs to the Bantu language family, in a subgroup called Sawabantu. Maho (2009) treats Duala as a cluster of five languages: Duala proper, Bodiman, Oli (Ewodi, Wuri), Pongo, and Mongo.  He also notes a Duala-based pidgin named Jo.
