[[Neurotensin]]

CATEGORIES: Neuropeptides

Neurotensin is a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that is implicated in the regulation of luteinizing hormone and prolactin release and has significant interaction with the dopaminergic system.  Neurotensin was first isolated from extracts of bovine hypothalamus based on its ability to cause a visible vasodilation in the exposed cutaneous regions of anesthetized rats.[tpl]cite journal | author = Carraway R, Leeman SE | title = The isolation of a new hypotensive peptide, neurotensin, from bovine hypothalami | journal = J.

Neurotensin is distributed throughout the central nervous system, with highest levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. It induces a variety of effects, including: analgesia, hypothermia and increased locomotor activity. It is also involved in regulation of dopamine pathways. In the periphery, neurotensin is found in endocrine cells of the small intestine, where it leads to secretion and smooth muscle contraction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Friry C, Feliciangeli S, Richard F, Kitabgi P, Rovere C | title = Production of recombinant large proneurotensin/neuromedin N-derived peptides and characterization of their binding and biological activity | journal = Biochem.

==Sequence and biosynthesis==

Neurotensin shares significant sequence similarity in its 6 C-terminal amino acid residues with several other neuropeptides, including neuromedin N (which is derived from the same precursor). This C-terminal region is responsible for the full biological activity, the N-terminal portion having a modulatory role. The neurotensin/neuromedin N precursor can also be processed to produce large 125-138 amino acid peptides with the neurotensin or neuromedin N sequence at their C-terminus. These large peptides appear to be less potent than their smaller counterparts, but are also less sensitive to degradation and may represent endogenous, long-lasting activators in a number of pathophysiological situations.
The sequence of bovine neurotensin was determined to be pyroGlu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH.[tpl]cite journal | author = Carraway R, Leeman SE | title = The amino acid sequence of a hypothalamic peptide, neurotensin | journal = J.

Neurotensin has been implicated in the modulation of dopamine signaling, and produces a spectrum of pharmacological effects resembling those of antipsychotic drugs, leading to the suggestion that neurotensin may be an endogenous neuroleptic.  Neurotensin-deficient mice display defects in responses to several antipsychotic drugs consistent with the idea that neurotensin signaling is a key component underlying at least some antipsychotic drug actions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kinkead, B, Dobner PR, Egnatashvili, V, Murray, T, Deitemeyer, N, Nemeroff, CB | title = Neurotensin-deficient mice have deficits in prepulse inhibition: restoration by clozapine but no haloperidol, olanzapine, or quetiapine | journal = J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | volume = 315 | issue = 1 | pages = 256–264 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15987829 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.105.087437| url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/315/1/256[/tpl]  These mice exhibit modest defects in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, a model that has been widely used to investigate antipsychotic drug action in animals.  Antipsychotic drug administration augments PPI under certain conditions.  Comparisons between normal and neurotensin-deficient mice revealed striking differences in the ability of different antipsychotic drugs to augment PPI.  While the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine augmented PPI normally in neurotensin-deficient mice, the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol and the newer atypical antipsychotic quetiapine were ineffective in these mice, in contrast to normal mice where these drugs significantly augmented PPI.  These results suggest that certain antipsychotic drugs require neurotensin for at least some of their effects.  Neurotensin-deficient mice also display defects in striatal activation following haloperidol, but not clozapine administration in comparison to normal wild type mice, indicating that striatal neurotensin is required for the full spectrum of neuronal responses to a subset of antipsychotic drugs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dobner, PR, Fadel, J, Deitemeyer, N, Carraway, RE, Deutch, AY | title = Neurotensin-deficient mice show altered responses to antipsychotic drugs | journal = Proc.
