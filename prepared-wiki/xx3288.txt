Hawaii  ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Hawaii.ogg|h|ə|ˈ|w|aɪ|.|iː[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|h|ə|ˈ|w|aɪ|ʔ|iː[/tpl]; Hawaiian: Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i [tpl]IPA-haw|hɐˈvɐiʔi|pron-haw[/tpl]) is the most recent of the 50 U.S. states (joined the Union on August 21, 1959), and is the only U.S. state made up entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.
Hawaii’s diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, (wind) surfers, biologists, and volcanologists alike. Due to its mid-Pacific location, Hawaii has many North American and Asian influences along with its own vibrant native culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is Honolulu on the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.
The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic Hawaiian Island chain, which comprises hundreds of islands spread over [tpl]convert|1500|mi[/tpl]. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight "main islands" are (from the northwest to southeast) Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau, Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Lāna[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe, Maui and the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. The last is the largest and is often called "The Big Island" to avoid confusing the name of the island with the name of the state as a whole. The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.
Hawaii is the 8th smallest, the 11th least populous, but the 13th most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states.  Hawaii's ocean coastline is approximately [tpl]convert|750|mi|km[/tpl] long, which is fourth in the United States after those of Alaska, Florida and California.
Hawaii is one of two states that do not observe daylight saving time, the other being Arizona. It is also one of two states that are not in the contiguous United States; the other is Alaska. Additionally, Hawaii is the only U.S. state not to be located in the Americas. Hawaii is also the only state with an Asian plurality.

==Etymology==

The Hawaiian language word Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i derives from Proto-Polynesian *Sawaiki, with the reconstructed meaning "homeland";Pollex—a reconstruction of the Proto-Polynesian lexicon, Biggs and Clark, 1994. The asterisk preceding the word signifies that it is a reconstructed word form. Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i cognates are found in other Polynesian languages, including Māori (Hawaiki), Rarotongan (ʻAvaiki), and Samoan (Savai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i). (See also Hawaiki). According to Pukui and Elbert,[tpl]Cite book | last1 = Pukui | first1 = Mary Kawena | first2 = Samuel H. | last2 = Elbert | title = Hawaiian Dictionary | location = Honolulu | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-8248-0703-0|page=62[/tpl] "Elsewhere in Polynesia, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, the name has no meaning."Pukui, Elbert, and Mookini 1974.

===Spelling of state name===

A somewhat divisive political issue arose when the constitution of the state of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language: the exact spelling of the state's name, which in the islands' language is Hawaiʻi (the ʻokina marking a Hawaiian consonant, a cut-off of breath before the final i). In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized Hawaii to be the official state name. Official government publications, as well as department and office titles, use the traditional Hawaiian spelling, with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wowpolynesia.com/hawaiian-language/ |title=Hawaiian language |publisher=Wow Polynesia |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] In contrast, the National and State Parks Services, the University of Hawaiʻi, and some private entities, including a local newspaper, do use such symbols.
The title of the state constitution is "The Constitution of the State of Hawaii". In Article XV, Section 1 uses "The State of Hawaii", Section 2 "the island of Oahu", Section 3 "The Hawaiian flag", and Section 5 specifies the state motto as "Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono". Since these documents predate the modern use of the ʻokina and the kahakō in Hawaiian orthography, the diacritics were not used.

==Geography and environment==

The main Hawaiian Islands are:

===Topography===

An archipelago situated some [tpl]unit length|mi|2000|-2[/tpl] southwest of the North American mainland,[tpl]cite web |url = http://interactive2.er.usgs.gov/faq/list_faq_by_category/get_answer.asp?id=795 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041021120319/http://interactive2.er.usgs.gov/faq/list_faq_by_category/get_answer.asp?id=795 |archivedate = October 21, 2004 |title = What constitutes the United States, what are the official definitions? |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate = July 3, 2007[/tpl] Hawaii is the southernmost state of the United States and the second westernmost state after Alaska.  Hawaii, along with Alaska, does not border any other U.S. state.
Hawaii is the only state of the United States that is not geographically located in North America, grows coffee, is completely surrounded by water, is entirely an archipelago, has royal palaces, and does not have a straight line in its state boundary.

The eight main islands, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Maui, O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe, Lana[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau are accompanied by many others. Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]ula is a small island near Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau that is often overlooked. The Northwest Hawaiian Islands are a series of nine small, older masses northwest of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i that extend from Nihoa to Kure that are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. There are also more than 100 small rocks and islets, such as Molokini, that are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin, totaling 130 or so across the archipelago.

===Geology===

The Hawaiian islands were (and continue to be) continuously formed from volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called a hotspot. As the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves to the northwest, the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Due to the hotspot’s location, the only active volcanoes are located around the southern half of the Big Island. The newest volcano, Lō[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihi Seamount, is located south of the Big Island’s coast.
The last volcanic eruption outside the Big Island occurred at Haleakalā on Maui before the late 18th century, though it could have been hundreds of years earlier.[tpl]cite web |url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |title = Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |publisher=United States Geological Survey |date = September 9, 1999 |accessdate = October 4, 1999[/tpl] In 1790, Kīlauea exploded with the deadliest eruption (of the modern era) known to have occurred in what is now the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |title=Living on Active Volcanoes—The Island of Hawaii, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97 |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] As many as 5,405 warriors and their families marching on Kīlauea were killed by that eruption.Swanson, D.

Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features.

(2003) Susceptibility of mid-ocean ridge volcanic islands and seamounts to large scale landsliding. Journal of Geophysical Research, 108, 1-23.

===Flora and fauna===

Because the islands are so far from other land habitats, life before human activity is said to have arrived by the “3 W’s”: wind (carried through the air), waves (brought by ocean currents), and wings (birds, insects, and whatever they brought with them). This isolation, and the wide range of environments (extreme altitude, tropical climate) produced a vast array of endemic flora and fauna (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.[tpl]cite web| url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/1995/1/hawaiisforestbirds.cfm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070318100849/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/1995/1/hawaiisforestbirds.cfm| archivedate=2007-03-18| title=Hawaii's Forest Birds Sing the Blues| author=Howard Youth  | accessdate=October 31, 2008[/tpl] One endemic plant, Brighamia, now requires hand-pollination - its natural pollinator is presumed to be extinct.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/hawnprop/plants/bri-insi.htm| title=Hawaiian Native Plant Propagation Database| accessdate=December 15, 2013[/tpl] The two species of Brighamia - B. rockii and B. insignis - are represented in the wild by perhaps 120 individual plants.

The relatively short time that the existing main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean (less than 10 million years) is only a fraction of time span over which biological colonization and evolution have occurred in the archipelago.
The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. On a single island, the climate can differ around the coast from dry tropical ( 200 in or 5000 mm per year) through a temperate climate into alpine conditions of cold and dry climate. The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, which affects the distribution of streams, wetlands, and wet places.

===Protected areas===

Several areas in Hawaii are under the protection of the National Park Service.[tpl]cite web | title = Hawaii | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate = July 15, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/HI[/tpl] Hawaii has two national parks: Haleakala National Park near Kula, on Maui, includes Haleakalā, the dormant volcano that formed east Maui; and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in the southeast region of the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, which includes the active volcano Kīlauea and its various rift zones.
There are three national historical parks: Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Kalaupapa, Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, the site of a former Hansen’s disease colony; Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park in Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i; and Pu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park, an ancient place of refuge. Other areas under the control of the National Park Service include Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on the Big Island and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.
The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument was proclaimed by President George W. Bush on June 15, 2006. The monument covers roughly [tpl]convert|140000|mi2|km2[/tpl] of reefs, atolls and shallow and deep sea out to [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|-1[/tpl] offshore in the Pacific Ocean, larger than all of America’s National Parks combined.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/ideas/ideas_item.cfm?content_item_id=3417&content_type_id=15&issue_name=Protecting%20ocean%20life&issue=16&page=15&name=Op-eds%20%28Pew%29| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060930183659/http://www.pewtrusts.org/ideas/ideas_item.cfm?content_item_id=3417&content_type_id=15&issue_name=Protecting%20ocean%20life&issue=16&page=15&name=Op-eds%20%28Pew%29| archivedate=2006-09-30| title=Treasure Islands| author=Joshua Reichert and Theodore Roosevelt IV  | date=June 15, 2006[/tpl]

===Climate===

Hawaii’s climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be a bit less extreme due to near-constant trade winds from the east. Summer highs are usually in the upper 80s °F, (around 31 °C) during the day and mid 70s, (around 24 °C) at night. Winter day temperatures are usually in the low to mid 80s, (around 28 °C) and (at low elevation) seldom dipping below the mid 60s (18 °C) at night. Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at [tpl]convert|4205|m[/tpl] on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on Haleakala. Mount Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale, on Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about [tpl]convert|460|in|mm|1[/tpl]. Most of Hawaii has only two seasons: the dry season from May to October, and the wet season from October to April.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/climate_summary.php |title=Climate of Hawaii |publisher=Prh.noaa.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]
The warmest temperature recorded in the state is [tpl]convert|100|°F[/tpl] (making it tied with Alaska as the lowest high temperature recorded in a U.S. state) in Pahala on April 27, 1931. Hawaii's all-time record low temperature is [tpl]convert|12|°F[/tpl] observed in May 1979 on the summit of Mauna Kea. Hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures.
Local climates vary considerably on each island, grossly divisible into windward (Ko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olau) and leeward (Kona) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face cloud cover, so resorts concentrate on sunny leeward coasts.

===Antipodes===

Hawaii is the only US state that is antipodal to inhabited land. Most of the state lies opposite Botswana, though Niʻihau aligns with Namibia and Kauai straddles the border. This area of Africa, near Maun and Ghanzi, includes nature reserves and small settlements near the Okavango Delta.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pri.org/theworld/node/7751 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121103112951/http://www.pri.org/theworld/node/7751 |archivedate= 2012-11-03 |title=Today's Geo Quiz: Antipodes |work=The World |quote=So name Hawaii's antipode if you can... |publisher=Public Radio International |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/antipode-map/#.UFvhkK4q5yV |title=Antipode Map (AKA Tunnel Map) |work=findlatitudeandlongitude.com |accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

Hawaii is one of four states, besides the original thirteen, that were independent prior to becoming part of the United States, along with the Vermont Republic (1791), the Republic of Texas (1845), and the California Republic (1846), and one of two, along with Texas, that had formal diplomatic recognition internationally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode20/usc_sec_20_00007512----000-.html |title=United States Code: Title 20,7512. Findings | LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] The Kingdom of Hawaii was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American (and some European) businessmen. It was an independent republic from 1894 until 1898, when it was annexed by the United States as a territory, becoming a state in 1959.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/hi_government.htm |title=Hawaii State Government |publisher=Netstate.com|accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl]
Hawaii was the target of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japan on December 7, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military and naval installations on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, carried out by aircraft and by midget submarines, brought the United States into World War II.

===First human settlement — Ancient Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i (800–1778)===

The earliest habitation supported by archaeological evidence dates to as early as 300 CE, probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas, followed by a second wave of migration from Raiatea and Bora Bora in the 11th century.
Polynesians from the Marquesas and possibly the Society Islands may have first populated the Hawaiian Islands between 300 and 500 CE. There is a great deal of debate regarding these dates.[ref]

</ref>
Some archaeologists and historians believe that an early settlement from the Marquesas and a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti, c. 1000, introduced a new line of high chiefs, the Kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice and the building of heiaus. This later immigration is detailed in folk tales about Pa[tpl]okina[/tpl]ao. Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers, and that Pa[tpl]okina[/tpl]ao must be regarded as a myth.
Regardless of the question of Pa[tpl]okina[/tpl]ao, historians agree that the history of the islands was marked by a slow but steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms, which grew to encompass whole islands. Local chiefs, called ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their sway and defend their communities from predatory rivals. Ancient Hawaii was a caste-based society much like that of the Hindus in India.[tpl]cite book | first = Barbara A. | last = West | year = 2009 | url = http://books.google.cz/books?id=pCiNqFj3MQsC&pg=PA270&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f= | title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania | publisher = Infobase Publishing | page = 270 | isbn = 1438119135 [/tpl]

===European arrival and the Kingdom of Hawaii===

There are questions whether Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century, two centuries before Captain James Cook's first documented visit in 1778.  Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 bound for the Philippines, with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seemed to describe the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands.[tpl]cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| authorlink = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl] Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = University of Hawaii Press| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25–32| isbn = 0-8248-1829-6[/tpl]  If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been the first European to find the islands. Some scholars have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.By Oliver, Douglas L. (1989). The Pacific Islands. University of Hawaii Press. p. 45. ISBN 0-8248-1233-6Coulter, John Wesley. (Jun 1964) "Great Britain in Hawaii: The Captain Cook Monument". The Geographical Journal, Vol. 130, No. 2. [tpl]DOI|10.2307/1794586[/tpl] However, Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands. In this manuscript, the Island of Maui is named "La Desgraciada" (the unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of Hawaii is named "La Mesa" (the table).  Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named "Los Monjes" (the monks).Hawaii National Park. (June 1959). "Hawaii Nature Notes". The Publication of the Naturalist Division, Hawaii National Park, and the Hawaii Natural History Association. For two and a half centuries Spanish galleons crossed the Pacific along a route that passed south of Hawaii on their way to Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers.
The 1778 arrival of British explorer James Cook was Hawaii’s first documented contact with European explorers. Cook named the islands the "Sandwich Islands" in honor of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He published the islands' location and reported the native name as Owyhee. This spelling lives on in Owyhee County, Idaho, after three Hawaiian members of a trapping party that went missing in that area.
Cook visited the islands twice. Upon his departure during his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued, involving Cook's taking of temple idols and fencing as "firewood",Stanley D. Porteus, Calabashes and Kings: An Introduction to Hawaii. Kessinger Publishing, 2005; p.17 and the taking of a ship's boat by a minor chief and his men.  Cook then abducted the King of the Big Island of Hawaii, Kalani[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u, and held him as ransom aboard his ship for the return of the boat, a tactic that had worked for Cook in Tahiti and other islands.Kuykendall, "The Hawaiian Kingdom Volume I: Foundation and Transformation", p18 "Cook's plan was to get the king on board the Resolution and keep him there until the stolen boat was returned—a plan that had been effective under similar circumstances in the south Pacific". Kalani[tpl]okina[/tpl]ōpu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u's supporters fought back and Cook and four Marines were killed as Cook's party retreated to the beach and launched their boats.
After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian islands received many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers who found the islands a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawaii which has the British Union Flag in the corner.
These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands and the Hawaiian population plunged precipitously[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/257332/Hawaii |title=Hawaii (state, United States) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] because native Hawaiians had no resistance to influenza, smallpox, and measles, among others. By 1820, Eurasian diseases, famine, and wars among the chiefs killed more than half of the Native Hawaiian population.To express the policy of the United States regarding the United States' relationship with Native Hawaiians, and for other purposes: report (to accompany S. 2899). p.7.

Historical records indicated that the earliest immigration of the Chinese came from Guangdong province: a few sailors in 1778 with Captain Cook's journey, more in 1788 with Kaina, and some in 1789 with an American trader who settled in Hawaii in the late 18th century.

====House of Kamehameha====

During the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795 and forced cession of the island of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in 1810, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as King Kamehameha the Great. He established the House of Kamehameha, a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.
After Kamehameha II inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity. Their influence ended many ancient practices, and Kamehameha III was the first Christian king. One prominent Protestant missionary, Hiram Bingham I, was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period. Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to future conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects.
Missionaries from other Christian denominations (such as Catholics, Mormons, and Episcopalians) were active, but never converted more than a minority of the Native Hawaiian population. Ezra T. Benson appeared to have been the earliest Mormon missionary to the islands.
The death of the bachelor King Kamehameha V—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of Lunalilo over Kalākaua. Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir. Perhaps "the People's King" (Lunalilo) wanted the people to choose his successor as they had chosen him. In 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between Kalākaua and Emma. This led to riots and the landing of U.S. and British troops, and governance passed to the House of Kalākaua.

====1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations====

In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which stripped the king of much of his authority. There was a property qualification for voting, which disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers, and favored the wealthier white community. Resident whites were allowed to vote, but resident Asians were excluded. Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the "Bayonet Constitution". King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, succeeded him on the throne. She was the last monarch of Hawaii.
In 1893, Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani announced plans for a new constitution. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed a Committee of Safety to overthrow the Kingdom and seek annexation by the United States. United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a company of U.S. Marines. As one historian noted, the presence of these troops effectively made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.[tpl]cite book | last = Russ | first = William Adam | title = The Hawaiian Revolution (1893–94) | publisher=Associated University Presses | year = 1992 | page = 350 | isbn = 0-945636-43-1 [/tpl]

===Overthrow of 1893—the Republic of Hawaii (1894–1898)===

In January 1893, Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani was overthrown and replaced by a Provisional Government composed of members of the Committee of Safety. American lawyer Sanford B. Dole became President of the Republic in 1894. Controversy filled the following years as the queen tried to regain her throne. The administration of President Grover Cleveland commissioned the Blount Report, which concluded that the removal of Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani was illegal. The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused. Congress followed with another investigation, and submitted the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which found all parties (including Minister Stevens) with the exception of the queen "not guilty" from any responsibility for the overthrow.Kuykendall, R.S.

In 1993, a joint Apology Resolution regarding the overthrow was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton, apologizing for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. thumb|The [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace in Honolulu, formerly the residence of the Hawaiian monarch, was the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii.The Provisional Government of Hawaii ended on July 4, 1894, replaced by the Republic of Hawaii. The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii in 1885 as contract laborers for the sugar cane and pineapple plantations.

===Annexation—the Territory of Hawaii (1898–1959)===

After William McKinley won the presidential election in 1896, Hawaii's annexation to the U.S. was again discussed. The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawaii. He met with three annexationists from Hawaii: Lorrin Thurston, Francis March Hatch and William Ansel Kinney. After negotiations, in June 1897, Secretary of State John Sherman agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii.[tpl]cite web |work=The Morgan Report  |url= http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1897_Annexation_Treaty |title= 1897 Hawaii Annexation Treaty |accessdate= August 14, 2010 [/tpl]
The treaty was never ratified by the U.S. Senate. Instead, despite the opposition of a majority of Native Hawaiians,[tpl]cite web|url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/pet-intro.html |title=Anti-annexation petitions - Page 1 |publisher=Libweb.hawaii.edu|accessdate=March 9, 2012[/tpl] the Newlands Resolution was used to annex the Republic to the United States and it became the Territory of Hawaii. The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House June 15, 1898, by a vote of 209 to 91, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898, by a vote of 42 to 21.
Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a world-wide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Hawaiian sugar plantation owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. Two distinct waves of Korean immigration to Hawaii have occurred in the last century. The first arrived in between 1903 and 1924; the second wave began in 1965.
In 1900, Hawaii was granted self-governance and retained [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years. Plantation owners and key capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions, or "factors", known as the "Big Five", found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor; such immigration was prohibited in various states.

===Political changes of 1954—the State of Hawaii (1959–present)===

In the 1950s the power of the plantation owners was finally broken by descendants of immigrant laborers. Because they were born in a U.S. territory, they were legal U.S. citizens. The Hawaii Republican Party, strongly supported by plantation owners, was voted out of office. The Democratic Party of Hawaii dominated politics for 40 years. Eager to gain full voting rights, Hawaii's residents actively campaigned for statehood.
thumb|Certification of the Hawaii vote for StatehoodIn March 1959, Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act and U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law. (The act excluded Palmyra Atoll, part of the Kingdom and Territory of Hawaii, from the new state.) On June 27 of that year, a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill. The Hawaii electorate voted 94.3% "yes for statehood" to 5.7% "no".[tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.lingle.hawaii.gov/govgallery/news/files/2009/march/celebrating-50-years-of-statehood |title=Commemorating 50 Years of Statehood |work=archive.lingle.hawaii.gov |publisher=State of Hawaii |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2014-03-21 |quote=On June 27, 1959, a plebiscite was held to allow Hawai`i residents to ratify the congressional vote for statehood. The 'yes for statehood' garnered 94.3 percent (132,773 votes) while the 'no' ballots totaled 5.7 percent (7,971 votes).[/tpl] The choices were to accept the Act or to remain a territory, without the option of independence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moolelo.com/human-rights.html |title=Human Rights differs from Equal Rights |publisher=Moolelo.com |date=January 21, 2005 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://hawaii-nation.org/pleb.html |title=Support For The Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council |publisher=Hawaii-nation.org |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization later removed Hawaii from the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.
After statehood, Hawaii quickly modernized via construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy. Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture. The Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978 incorporated programs such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to promote indigenous language and culture.

===Population===

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Hawaii was 1,404,054 on July 1, 2013, a 3.2% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2013/tables/NST-EST2013-01.csv|title=Table 1.

As of 2005, Hawaii has an estimated population of 1,275,194, an increase of 13,070, or 1.0%, from the prior year and an increase of 63,657, or 5.3%, since 2000. This includes a natural increase of 48,111 people (that is 96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people.

===Race and ethnicity===

According to the 2010 United States Census, Hawaii had a population of 1,360,301. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 38.6% Asian, 24.7% White (22.7% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 23.6% from Two or More Races, 10.0% Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 8.9% Hispanics and Latinos of any race, 1.6% Black or African American, 1.2% from Some Other race, and 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native.[tpl]cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/15000.html |title=Hawaii QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |location=Washington, DC, USA  |work=State and County QuickFacts |date=January 17, 2012 update |accessdate=June 2, 2012[/tpl]

Over 120,000 (8.8%) Hispanic and Latino Americans make Hawaii their home. Mexicans number over 35,000 (2.6%); Puerto Ricans exceed 44,000 (3.2%). Multiracial Americans form almost one-quarter of Hawaii's population, exceeding 320,000 people. Eurasian Americans are a prominent mixed-race group; there are roughly 66,000 (4.9%) Eurasian Americans in Hawaii. The Non-Hispanic White population numbers at 310,000 and forms just over one-fifth of the population. The multiracial population outnumbers the non-Hispanic white population by about 10,000 people. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Hawaii's population as 38.8% white and 57.7% Asian and Pacific Islander.[tpl]cite web|title=Hawaii - Race and Hispanic Origin: 1900 to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html[/tpl]
The five largest European ancestries in Hawaii are German (7.4%), Irish (5.2%), English (4.6%), Portuguese (4.3%), and Italian (2.7%). Approximately 82.2% of Hawaii's residents were born in the United States. Roughly 75.0% of the foreign-born residents hail from Asia. Hawaii is a majority-minority state, and is expected to be one of three states that will not have a white plurality in 2014, the other two being California and New Mexico."California's Hispanic population projected to outnumber white in 2014" from Reuters (January 31, 2013)

===Ancestry groups===

The largest ancestry groups in Hawaii as of 2008 are in the table at right.
The third group of foreigners to arrive upon Hawaii's shores, after those from Polynesia and Europe, was from China. Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820 the first American missionaries came to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways.[tpl]cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Charles |title=The missionary gazetteer: comprising a geographical and statistical account ... |others=B B Edwards |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V6YNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA424&lpg=PA424&dq=human+sacrifice+missionaries+hawaii#v=onepage&q=human%20sacrifices%20missionaries%20hawaii&f=false |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |edition=America |series=CIHM/ICMH microfiche series, no. 35042 (also ATLA monograph preservation program ; ATLA fiche 1988-3226) |year=1832 |origyear=1828 |publisher=W.

A large proportion of Hawaii's population is now of Asian ancestry (especially Chinese, Japanese and Filipino.) Many are descendants of those immigrants brought to work on the sugar plantations in the 1850s and after. The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on June 19, 1868. They were not "legally" approved by the Japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the Tokugawa shogunate, by then replaced by the Meiji Restoration. The first Japanese government-approved immigrants arrived on February 9, 1885 after Kalākaua's petition to Emperor Meiji when Kalākaua visited Japan in 1881.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/05/10/000016406_20070510133229/Rendered/PDF/wps4203.pdf |title=Latin Americans of Japanese Origin (Nikkeijin) Working in Japan – A Survey |first=Junichi |last=Goto |date=April 2007 |work=Documents & Reports - All Documents | The World Bank |publisher=World Bank |location=Washington, DC, USA |pages=5, 48 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hawaiialive.org/realms.php?sub=Wao+Lani&treasure=369&offset=0 |title=+ Hawaii Alive | Realms: Wao Lani + |work=Hawaii Alive |location=Honolulu, HI, US |publisher=Bishop Museum|accessdate=May 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Languages===

The state of Hawaii has two official languages recognized in its 1978 constitution: English and Hawaiian. Article XV, Section 4, specifies that "Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law" added. Hawaii Creole English (locally referred to as 'Pidgin') is the native language of many born-and-raised residents and is a second language for many other residents.

====English====

As of the 2000 Census, 73.44% of Hawaii residents age 5 and older speak only English at home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=15&mode=state_tops |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2011[/tpl] According to the 2008 American Community Survey, 74.6% of Hawaii's residents over the age of five speak only English at home.

====Minority languages====

In addition, 2.6% of the state's residents speak Spanish; 1.6% speak other Indo-European languages; 21.0% speak an Asian language; and 0.2% speak a different language at home.
After English, other popular languages are Tagalog, Japanese, and Ilokano. Significant European immigrants and descendants also speak their native languages; the most numerous are Spanish, German, Portuguese and French.
Tagalog speakers make up 5.37% (which includes non-native speakers of Filipino language, the national co-official Tagalog-based language), followed by Japanese at 4.96%, Ilokano at 4.05%, Chinese at 1.92%, Hawaiian at 1.68%, Spanish at 1.66%, Korean at 1.61%, and Samoan at 1.01%.

====Hawaiian====

The Hawaiian language has about 2000 native speakers, less than 0.1% of the total population. According to the United States Census, there were over 24,000 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2006-2008.[ref]
