==Judge and educationalist==

Windeyer was appointed as acting judge of the Supreme Court in August 1879. In August 1881 he became a puisne judge of the supreme court, and held this position for almost 15 years.  He believed strongly in the enforement of the criminal law, particularly where the victims were women.  In the Mount Rennie rape case, he sentenced nine young men to death for pack rape, and four were in fact hanged in 1887.[ref]
</ref>   In 1895 Windeyer caused controversy by imposing the death penalty on George Dean for attempting to poisoning his wife.  There was a strong belief that Dean was innocent and that his wife and her mother (who was a woman of ill repute) had conspired against him.  Although, Dean was very likely guilty, his death sentence was commuted and he was later released on a free pardon.  He was subsequently convicted of perjury and spent nine years in jail.<ref>
</ref>  Windeyer resigned on 31 August 1896, prior to his trip to Europe.  
Windeyer took much interest in education, was a trustee of the Sydney Grammar School, president of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, and a trustee of the public library. He was Vice-Chancellor of the university from 1883 to 1887 and Chancellor from 1895 to 1896.  He was also first chairman of the council of the women's college at the university. 
On his way to Europe Windeyer  accepted a temporary judicial appointment in Newfoundland, but died suddenly while at Bologna, Italy.  Of Windeyer's sons, Richard Windeyer, born in 1868, followed his father's profession, became a KC and for a time was an acting-judge of the supreme court of New South Wales; William Archibald Windeyer, born in 1871, was also well known in Sydney as a solicitor and public man.  His daughter Margaret was a librarian and women's rights campaigner.

==Honours==

He was given the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of Cambridge, and was knighted in 1891.
