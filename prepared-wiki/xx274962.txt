==History==

Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent were historically and ethnically linked in earlier times. An edict of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka has been found in Kandahar, marking the western extent of his dominion.[tpl]cite book|last1=Aśoka (King of Magadha)|first1=|last2=Nikam|first2=Narayanrao Appurao|title=The Edicts of Asoka|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=02_uHimEXwQC&pg=PA20|accessdate=13 January 2012|date=15 October 1978|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-58611-3|pages=20–21[/tpl] The mahajanapada of Gandhara extended from the Kabul river to the Punjab, comprising Hindu and Buddhist dynasties, and lasted a thousand years till the 11th Century AD when it was overthrown by the Ghaznavids.Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v.

Migration of  Hindu community to Afghanistan was mainly from the neighbouring kingdom of Punjab, later a province of British India.The Indian Diaspora (Chapter 2) – Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran By the nineteenth century a large Hindu community, comprising ethnic groups such as Lohanis and Shikarpuri Khatris, was widespread throughout the region and tribes and concerned primarily with commerce. A city peopled by Khatri Hindus, Shikarpur, was established in the 1800s and rose to be one of Afghanistan's main centres of commerce – primarily a money market and banking centre, which had outlying partnerships with places as widely apart as "Bombay, Punjab, Sindh, Khorasan, parts of Persia and Russia". They eventually developed control of the banking throughout Central Asia ranging from "Astrakhan to Meshid to Calcutta" (vide Alexander Burnes). Known by the local epithet of Hindkis, they spoke a variant of Punjabi, gained employment in financial and clerical posts throughout the region, were shopkeepers, grain merchants, money-lenders and goldsmiths, forming a vital part of the economy of the region. Shah Shuja employed as his finance minister, Lalla Jeth Mall, a Khatri Hindu from Shikarpur. Barnes records that the population of Hindkis in Afghanistan at that time to be about 300,000.
The Khilafat movement of 1920 saw a spontaneous migration of Indian Muslims to be free of perceived British bondage of Islam by emigrating to neighbouring Afghanistan. Encouraged by their religious leaders, thousands of peoples sold their belongings and migrated to Afghanistan choking the Khyber Pass with their possessions on bullock cart, camel and cycles. Overwhelmed by the migration, the Amir of Afghanistan blocked the emigration. Large numbers of muhajirin were robbed by Afghan tribes, and died of heat, thirst and hunger. Thousands returned home destitute.[tpl]cite book|last=Minault|first=Gail|title=The Khilafat movement: religious symbolism and political mobilization in India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAW8GreFqjkC&pg=PA106|accessdate=11 January 2012|year=1982|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-05072-2|pages=105–106[/tpl]
As of 1990, the population of Afghans of Indian origin was estimated at 45,000, mostly descended from migrants from the Punjab region. They settled down in various parts of Afghanistan, particularly Jalalabad and Kabul. Many left Afghanistan after the Taliban came to power in 1996, mainly due to harsh restrictions imposed on them, leaving a population of approximately 1,000, mainly based in Kabul and Jalalabad. India did not have any official representation in Afghanistan while the Taliban were in power. The small Hindu and Sikh communities suffered harsh discrimination during that period. In April 2001, the Taliban issued an edict requiring Hindu males to wear marks of red dots (tilak) on their forehead, were barred from wearing salwar kameez or white turban and forced to wear black caps as identification when leaving their homes. Hindu women were forced to drape themselves in yellow dress and wear iron necklace. Hindus also were ordered to display a yellow flag on their houses and were not allowed to reside in the same houses as Muslims.

In the construction sector, an important work constructed by Indians is the 217 kilometre Delaram–Zaranj Highway, or Route 606 by Indian construction agencies in Southern Afghanistan, the completion of which in August 2009 has given a viable alternative route for duty-free movement of goods through the Chahabar port in Iran to Afghanistan.[tpl]cite book|author1=Adam Bennett|author2=International Monetary Fund|title=Reconstructing Afghanistan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sydnz-ZrTrUC&pg=PA18|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=15 April 2005|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-1-58906-324-2|page=18[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Ibp Usa|title=Global Logistics Assessments Reports Handbook: Strategic Transportation and Customs Information for Selected Countries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0x3TrjmWAsMC&pg=PA17|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=15 February 2008|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-0-7397-6603-3|page=17[/tpl] Road building has been a prominent component of India reconstruction aid – over 700 kilometres of roads have been built in the preceding eight years.

According to Foreign Policy, which analysed perceptions about India especially among Pashtuns from Kabul to Kandahar, "the widespread support in the Pashtun heartland for an even greater Indian role in rebuilding the Afghan economy and society" is "striking".
