The 2006–07 FA Cup Qualifying Rounds opened the 126th season of competition in England for 'The Football Association Challenge Cup' (FA Cup), the world's oldest association football single knockout competition.  A total of 687 clubs were accepted for the competition, up 13 from the previous season’s 674.
The large number of clubs entering the tournament from lower down (Levels 5 through 10) in the English football pyramid meant that the competition started with six rounds of preliminary (2) and qualifying (4) knockouts for these non-League teams.  The 32 winning teams from Fourth Round Qualifying progressed to the First Round Proper, where League teams tiered at Levels 3 and 4 entered the competition.
