Students from North and East were given the opportunity to transfer to the new high school if they lived within the boundaries of the new high school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] Since then, it has been remodeled several times. Additions have also been made to the school, the most famous of which is "the bridge," an actual bridge between halves of the school that later had classrooms added beneath it.
