The city of Seattle has multiple bridges that are significant due to their function, engineering, or historical status. Downtown Seattle was built on an isthmus between Lake Washington and Elliott Bay. Another body of water, Lake Union, is just north of the downtown area. The lakes are connected to Puget Sound by the canals and locks that make up the Lake Washington Ship Canal.[tpl]cite book|title=Insiders' Guide to Seattle|year=2010|publisher=Insiders Guides|isbn=978-0-7627-5544-8|page=17[/tpl]
Along with the freeway spans of Interstate 5 and State Route 99, four double-leaf bascule bridges cross the ship canal. These four bridges were opened between 1917 and 1930. The easternmost—the Montlake and University bridges—connect neighborhoods south of the canal to the University District. The Fremont Bridge is one of the most raised bridges in the world due to its clearance over the water of only [tpl]convert|30|ft[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|last=Posada|first=Janice|title=The People Who Operate Seattle's Movable Bridges Can Attest to the Ups and Downs of Solitary Work Tender Times|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1995/9508210054.asp|accessdate=February 27, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=August 21, 1995[/tpl]  The westernmost span crossing the ship canal is the Ballard Bridge.[tpl]cite book|last=Ohlsen|first=Becky|title=Seattle|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-834-7|page=44[/tpl]

Murrow Memorial Bridge was already replaced after the original span sunk in 1990 when water filled an open maintenance hatch during refurbishing. Age and the 2001 Nisqually earthquake have damaged several other spans. The risk of future earthquakes has increased the need to replace already deteriorated bridges in the city, such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the Magnolia Bridge.[tpl]cite news|title=Demolition of the Alaskan Way Viaduct begins|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/transportation/2011/02/18/demolition-of-the-alaskan-way-viaduct-starts-tonight/|accessdate=February 27, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 18, 2011[/tpl]  
The neighborhoods that make up West Seattle are on a peninsula separated from downtown by the Duwamish River. In the 1970s, residents grew wary of congestion that made the previous connection the second busiest road in the state. The bridge was left inoperable after being hit by a freighter in 1978, and it was replaced in 1984 by the West Seattle Bridge.[tpl]cite book|title=Images of America West Seattle|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-8133-0|author=Southwest Seattle Historical Society, Log House Museum|page=20[/tpl] The area is also serviced by the Spokane Street Bridge. Built in 1991, it is the world's first and only hydraulically operated concrete double-leaf swing bridge.[tpl]cite book|last=Holstine|first=Craig|title=Spanning Washington: Historic Highway Bridges of the Evergreen State|year=2005|publisher=Washington State University Press|isbn=978-0-87422-281-4|coauthors=Hobbs, Richard[/tpl]
