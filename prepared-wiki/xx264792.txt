According to Markar Melkonian, the fighters from Arabo and Aramo units gathered thirty-eight Azerbaijani captives, including several women and other noncombatants, in a ditch on the outskirts of the village. One of the captives in the ditch tossed a grenade, injuring one of the captors. The Arabo and Aramo fighters who had already wished to ""avenge" the death of another comrade the day before", "began stabbing and shooting their captives", until they all were dead. One of the Armenian fighters doused several wounded Azerbaijani soldiers with gasoline and burned them alive. In the words of Melkonian, the ditch became a "butcher's scrap heap". According to Melkonian, "a total of fifty-three Azeris were killed in and around Karadaghlu within two days, compared to three killed on the Armenian side, including a sixty-year-old villager" who was hit by a stray bullet.[tpl]cite book|last=Melkonian|first=Markar|title=My brother's road: an American's fateful journey to Armenia|year=2005|publisher=I.B.
