David After Dentist is an Internet phenomenon which started when David DeVore Jr.'s father posted a video on the Internet of his reaction to anesthesia after he had been given oral surgery. As of September 6, 2013, it has been viewed over 120 million times on YouTube.

==Video origins and publication==

In May 2008, 7-year old David DeVore Jr. was taken to the dentist to have an extra tooth removed, due to a hereditary condition called hyperdontia. Because this was David's first surgery and his mother could not be there, his father decided to video tape the experience to share with her and their family.
After the surgery, David was feeling confused from the anaesthesia he was given.  While in the car, he was asking his father questions like "Is this real life?" and "Is this going to be forever?" and also telling him that he had two fingers. At one point he even attempted to push himself up from his seat (while still buckled in) and began screaming before sinking back in exhaustion.
Seven months later, David's father uploaded the video on Facebook. Being overwhelmed with people wanting to see the video, he decided to upload it to YouTube, but did not notice there was a private option.  Just 3 days after the upload, it had been seen over 3 million times.
The DeVore family were soon made YouTube Partners. This gives YouTube the right to run ads over the videos they post, and in exchange, are given a share of the revenue.  They also sell "David After Dentist" t-shirts and donate a portion of the revenue they earn to dental charities. However have made very little money on it so far, and are currently in process of filming a similar video to the original.YouTube.com: David After Dentist VideoDavid on the Today showDavid Sr. on Bill O'ReillyThe Story of David After DentistKnow Your Meme: David After Dentist[tpl]cite news |last=Miller|first=Claire|date=26 Oct 2011|title=Cashing In on Your Hit YouTube Video|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/technology/personaltech/cashing-in-on-your-hit-youtube-video.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]

David DeVore Sr. has received criticism for exploiting his son. DeVore has stated that he appreciates the concern, but feels that it was innocent and has been a very positive experience for his family.David on the Today showDavid Sr. on Bill O'Reilly

==Medical explanation==

In the video, David states that he sees four fingers when looking at his two index fingers. He later adds, "I don't see anything", after which he tells his father: "you have four eyes". David may have experienced well-known, and extraordinarily disturbing, side-effects (blurred and double vision) of the dental anaesthesia. In the medical literature, several ocular complications such as diplopia (blurred and double vision) and dizziness have been reported as a consequence of improperly administered local intraoral anaesthesia.Steenen et al., 2012. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol. 2012 Jun;113(6):e1-5. It is estimated that ophthalmologic complications occur in approximately 1 in 1,000 local intraoral anesthetic injections; the majority of documented symptomatic response arise within 5 minutes and may last for several minutes to hours.Steenen et al., 2012. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol. 2012 Jun;113(6):e1-5.
