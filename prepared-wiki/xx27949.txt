This article concerns the systems of telecommunication in Austria. Austria has a highly developed and efficient telephone network, and has a number of radio and television broadcast stations.

==Infrastructure==

The telephone system is highly developed and efficient. Fibre-optic coverage is extensive, although it remains very expensive. A full range of telephone and Internet services are available via the network."Austria Communications", World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Retrieved 30 October 2013.
Austria has 15 satellite earth stations, two Intelsat (one Atlantic Ocean and one Indian Ocean) and one Eutelsat.  Additionally, there are around 600 very-small-aperture terminals (VSATs) (2007).

==Telephones==

===Fixed line phones===

The majority of fixed lines are analogue, with Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines for the remainder.
Fixed-line subscribership has been in decline since the mid-1990s and was eclipsed by mobile-cellular in the late 1990s.

===Mobile phones===

The Austrian mobile phone market is highly competitive, with some of the lowest rates in Europe."Austria - Mobile Market Insights, Statistics and Forecasts", BuddeComm, Paul Budde Communication Pty Ltd. Retrieved 30 October 2013. Due to the geographical structures of Austria (mountains, flat lands, lakes) many providers use it as a "testing range" for new services. Mobile number portability was introduced in 2008, allowing users to retain their mobile phone numbers when switching between network operators. The original area codes allocated to each operator can no longer be used to determine the network with which a subscriber is registered.
There are three nationwide GSM networks which also support additional brands and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs).

==Internet==

The country code for Austria is "AT", the country code top level domain (ccTLD) is ".at". ".wien" is a proposed top level domain for sites with a connection to the Austrian capital WIEN (Vienna, Austria).
The Austrian broadband market is dominated by the DSL providers, which rapidly overtook cable as the preferred access method."Austria - Broadband Market Insights, Analysis and Forecasts", BuddeComm, Paul Budde Communication Pty Ltd. Retrieved 30 October 2013. However, mobile services employing UMTS/HSDPA and LTE are rapidly gaining ground due to fierce market competition. SDSL and optical fiber access is also available.
The main ISP's in Austria are: 
Typical speeds are up to 30Mbit/s download and 5Mbit/s upload over DSL (up to 50Mbit/s download over VDSL), and up to 100Mbit/s download and 10Mbit/s upload over cable.
There are also a number of smaller locally centered ISPs typically providing services in a city, district, or state over their own infrastructure. Most are also able to deliver services Austria wide by using resold Telekom Austria lines/capacity with value added services such as static IP addresses and IPv6. Notable are: 
Some ISPs offer up to 100Mbit speed over DOCSIS 3.0 or FTTH: 
Flat rate plans are the most common for fixed broadband service. Some cable and DSL contracts offer price reductions for university students.http://www.upc.at/internet/fiberpower_student/ [tpl]Dead link |date=October 2013[/tpl] A data transfer limit does not apply for most plans.
Some ISPs offer flat rates for mobile access. Data transfer limits apply to most mobile broadband access which is usually shaped to a certain speed after the data transfer limit is reached.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. Individuals and groups engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Authorities work to restrict access to Web sites containing information that violates the law, such as neo-Nazi and child pornography sites. Authorities restrict access to banned Web sites by trying to shut such sites and forbidding the country’s Internet service providers to carry them."Austria", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013. Retrieved 30 October 2013.
The Austrian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press. The independent media are active and express a wide variety of views with few restrictions. Individuals generally criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.
The law prohibits incitement, insult, or contempt against a group because of its members’ race, nationality, or ethnicity if the statement violates human dignity and the government strictly enforces these laws. The law prohibits public denial, belittlement, approval, or justification of the Nazi genocide or other Nazi crimes against humanity in a print publication, a broadcast, or other media and the government strictly enforces these laws. Strict libel and slander laws discourage reporting of governmental abuse. For example, many observers believed that the ability and willingness of the police to sue for libel or slander discourages individuals from reporting abuse by police.
On 31 July 2012, a 26-year-old man received an 18-month sentence, of which 12 months were to be served, for posting that his favorite book was Hitler’s Mein Kampf and linking to Nazi material on his Facebook page.
In February 2007 Austrian authorities were able to uncover a "child-pornography ring" involving seventy-seven countries, based on a report by a man working for a Vienna-based Internet file-hosting service."Internet Filtering in Europe 2006-2007", OpenNet Initiative. Retrieved 30 October 2013.
