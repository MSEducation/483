CATEGORIES: Aylesbury, Housing estates in Buckinghamshire

Bedgrove is one of the housing estates of the modern town of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, though it takes its name from a farm and hamlet that stood in the area until the area was cleared for building in the late 1950s.  At the time it was built it was the largest housing estate of its kind in the country.The Bucks Herald (2002) Memory Lane Aylesbury: Into The Seventies. Derby: Breedon Books  The housing estate is on the south side of the town.  The farm (and associated cottages) was where Pevensey Close now stands.
In the 2001 census the population of Bedgrove was 9,171 people.
Also the ancient village of Caldicot (mentioned in the Domesday Book) was thought to be situated approximately where Caldicot Close is today, hence the name of the new road.
