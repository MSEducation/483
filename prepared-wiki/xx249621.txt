[[Oligophagy]]

CATEGORIES: Eating behaviors, Insect ecology

Oligophagy refers to the eating of only a few specific foods. The term is usually associated with insect dietary behaviour.[ref]
Oligophagy on Dictionary.com. Accessed on 09 Jan 2010.[/ref] Organisms may exhibit narrow or specific oligophagy where the diet is restricted to a very few foods or broad oligophagy where the organism feeds on a wide variety of specific foods but none other.Huffaker & Gutierrez Ecological Entomology, pg 201.
Polyphagy, on the contrary, refers to eating a broad spectrum of foods. In the insect world it refers usually to insects that feed on plants belonging to different families. 

==Examples==

The diet of the Yucca moths is restricted to the developing fruits of species of Yucca while the sea hare, Aplysia juliana (Quoy & Gaimard), is found on and feeds only on a single alga, Ulva lactuca (Linnaeus) in East Australian waters.Rogers et al (1995). These are both narrow oligophages. Conversely the migratory locust may be said to be broadly oligophagous or even polyphagous.
