Nicky Mehta is a mezzo singer-songwriter, and member of Canadian folk trio The Wailin' Jennys.
Before fully entering into a life of music, Mehta attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario where she attained an honours degree in Media Studies. She also has a certificate in photography.  Mehta began her career in music as a backing vocalist for several touring bands.  Since 1995 she has also fronted several groups, including the five-piece folk/rock band Good Blind Soul, as well as a jazz ensemble, a folk duo known as Wellspring, and Electric Lunchbox, an R&B group from Manitoba.
Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s Mehta worked on her own material as well as these collaborations, and in 2002 released Weather Vane, a full length solo album that was nominated for a 2002 Canadian Independent Music Award.  This was also the year that she joined with Cara Luft and Ruth Moody to form The Wailin' Jennys.  As well as providing vocals for the trio, Mehta plays guitar, harmonica and percussion on several tracks.  Since 2002 she has mostly concentrated on working with the Jennys, and has released an EP and two full length albums with them.
