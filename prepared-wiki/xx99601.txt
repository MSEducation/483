Murray Tyrrell had a small but pivotal role to play in the establishment of the Australian Conservation Foundation.  The ACF began in the second half of 1964, after a suggestion was made to Tyrrell by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh while visiting Australia in 1963. He voiced an idea that Australia could become involved in conservation by establishing a branch of the World Wildlife Fund. Tyrrell convened a meeting that came to the conclusion that, if a conservation body was to exist, its efforts should be directed at conserving Australia's own heritage. From this the ACF emerged.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms9429 |title=Records of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Head Office Melbourne - MS 9429 |publisher=Nla.gov.au |date=2003-11-13 |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl]
