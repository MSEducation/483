==Rules appeal in 2008==

In the 2008 Women's World Championship she was involved in a game which resulted in a dispute about the interpretation of the FIDE rules of chess.  In an Armageddon game she needed a win to advance to the next round.  The position got down to each player having only a king and a knight in which a checkmate position is possible but cannot be forced.  Her opponent ran out of time under time control.  Since checkmate cannot be forced with this material, the arbiter initially ruled that the game was a draw, therefore her opponent advanced to the next round.  Soćko appealed, pointed out that the rules state that what matters is not whether or not checkmate can be forced, but rather it is possible. (see rules of chess#Timing.)  The arbiter compared the possible checkmate position to a helpmate, in which the defender has to cooperate in order to get to the checkmate. Soćko won the appeal and advanced to the next round.[tpl]cite web|last=Loeb |first=Dylan |url=http://gambit.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/womens-world-championship-whittles-field-to-16-but-not-without-surprises/#more-227 |title=NY Times |publisher=Gambit.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2008-09-03 |accessdate=2011-10-20[/tpl]
