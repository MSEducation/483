==Distribution and Ecology==

This species occurs throughout the tropics (Duyfjes 1996) exclusively in coastal areas: along the sea-shore in littoral forest and in coastal swamps. Fujita (1991) lists H.nymphaeifolia as being seed dispersed by the Marianas flying fox in the Mariana Islands.http://batplants.co.uk/lantern.htm

==Uses==

H. nymphaeifolia has a light, perishable wood. It has been used in South Pacific islands for fishing rods, fish net floats, wooden sandals, fan handles, drawing boards, canoe accessories, furniture and firewood, etc. A woody layer surrounds the seed of the lantern tree fruit. The Tahaitians polish the round brown seeds to a high gloss and fashion them into necklaces. The Marshallese bathe children in a healing bath made from H. nymphaeifolia leaves and relieve headaches with a preparation from other tree parts. The effect of lignanes from this species on Ca2+ signaling in human neutrophils has been studied.[ref]Novel action of lignans isolated from Hernandia nymphaeifoliaon . Archives of Toxicology
