[[Von Neumann bicommutant theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Operator theory, Von Neumann algebras, Articles containing proofs, Theorems in functional analysis

In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.
The formal statement of the theorem is as follows. Let M be an algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, containing the identity operator and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures of M in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant M′′ of M.[tpl]clarify|Algebra of all bounded operators is undefined|date=February 2013[/tpl] This algebra is the von Neumann algebra generated by M.
There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If M is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are still von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies.
It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.

==Proof==

Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H) the bounded operators on H. Consider a self-adjoint subalgebra M of L(H). Suppose also, M contains the identity operator on H.
As stated above, the theorem claims the following are equivalent:
The adjoint map T → T* is continuous in the weak operator topology. In this topology, for any vectors x and y in H the map T →  is also continuous. Therefore, for any operator O, so is the map T →  - . It follows that the commutant S’ of any subset S of L(H) is weakly closed: for any operator T not in S’,  -  is nonzero for some O in S, and so is nonzero for an open neighborhood of T, so that this open neighborhood is also not in S’.
This gives i) ⇒ ii).
Since the weak operator topology is weaker than the strong operator topology, it is immediate that ii) ⇒ iii).
What remains to be shown is iii) ⇒ i). It is true in general that S ⊂ S′′ for any set S, and that any commutant S′ is strongly closed. So the problem reduces to showing M′′ lies in the strong closure of M.
For h in H, consider the closure cl(Mh) of Mh = {Mh| M ∈ M}. Also consider the orthogonal projection P corresponding to cl(Mh).
For every x in H: Px ∈ cl(Mh) so that there is a series Onh convering towards it with On in M for all n, hence for all T in M,
TOnh is also in Mh and thus its limit is in cl(Mh). By continuity of T (since it is in L(H) and thus Lipschitz continuous), this limit is TPx. Since TPx is in cl(Mh), PTPx = TPx.
From this it follows that PTP = TP for all T in M. 
Closure of M under the adjoint further implies that P lies in M′: For every T in M and every x, y in H, |x, TPy> = |x, PTPy> = |Px, TPy> = |T^*Px, Py> = 
|PT^*Px, y> = |T^*Px, y> = 
|Px, Ty> = |x, PTy>, thus TP = PT.
Therefore for any operator X in M′′, one has XP = PX. Since M is unital, h ∈ Mh, hence Xh = XPh = PXh ∈ cl(Mh) and for all ε > 0, there exists T in M with ||Xh - Th|| Given a finite collection of vectors h1,...hn, consider the direct sum 
The algebra N defined by
is self-adjoint, closed in the strong operator topology, and contains the identity operator. Given a X in M′′, the operator
lies in N′′, and the argument above shows that,  all ε > 0, there exists T in M with ||Xh1 - Th1||,...,||Xhn - Thn|| 
===Non-unital case===

The algebra M is said to be non-degenerate if for all h in H, Mh = {0} implies h = 0. If M is non-degenerate and a sub C*-algebra of L(H), it can be shown using an approximate identity in M that the identity operator I lies in the strong closure of M. Therefore the bicommutant theorem still holds.
