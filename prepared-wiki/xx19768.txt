A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a "fortune" wrapped inside.  A "fortune" is a piece of paper with words of wisdom, an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers, some of which have become actual winning numbers."Fortune Cookie Fortune". snopes .com
Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States and some other countries, but are absent in China. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century, basing their recipe on a traditional Japanese cracker. Fortune cookies have been summarized as being "introduced by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese, but ultimately ... consumed by Americans."[tpl]cite news|last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=January 16, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/16fort.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|title=Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie|accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl]

==Origin==

As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called o-mikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called [tpl]Nihongo||辻占煎餅|tsujiura senbei[/tpl] and are still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa as the lucky items to start Happy New Year. Some said that it's sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto.[tpl]cite web | title = Fortune Cookies are really from Japan. | url = http://www.fortunecookiechronicles.com/2008/01/16/fortune-cookies-are-really-from-japan/ | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110725122139/http://www.fortunecookiechronicles.com/2008/01/16/fortune-cookies-are-really-from-japan/ | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | authorlink = Jennifer 8.

Most of the people who claim to have introduced the cookie to the United States are Japanese, so the theory is that these bakers were modifying a cookie design which they were aware of from their days in Japan.
Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the USA to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.[tpl]cite web | last = Nagata | first = Erik | title= A Brief History of The Fortune Cookie |url=http://www.hanascape.com/aboutus/fortunecookie/index.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Ono | first = Gary | title=Japanese American Fortune Cookie: A Taste of Fame or Fortune -- Part II|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/1935| date=2007-10-31[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Martin|2004[/tpl]
David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918.[tpl]Harv|Brunner|2005[/tpl].  San Francisco's mock Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a key piece of evidence with a message reading, "S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco.  Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.
Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie.A History of Fugetsu-Do, www.fugetsu-do.com Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan.  According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas.  Thus Kito's main claim is that he is responsible for the cookie being so strongly associated with Chinese restaurants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as "fortune tea cakes"—likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.
Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.
Fortune cookies before the early 20th century, however, were all made by hand. The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Shuck Yee from Oakland, California.Oaklandish[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today.

===Chinese legend===

Rumors that fortune cookies were invented in China are seen as false.Barbara Mikkelson. Incsrutable Cookie. Snopes.com.  In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as "genuine American fortune cookies".  Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered "too American".

==Manufacturers==

There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year around the world, the vast majority of them used for consumption in the United States. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Another large manufacturer is Peking Noodle in the Los Angeles area. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis and Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes.

==Around the world==

Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, United Kingdom, as well as other countries.

==Asian stereotype==

Fortune cookies are sometimes viewed as a stereotype of East Asians by Westerners.[tpl]Cite news | title = Yo, Yao!

==Translations of name==

Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin.
There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English "fortune cookie". Examples include: 幸运籤饼 xìngyùn qiān bǐng "good luck lot cookie", 籤语饼 qiān yǔ bǐng "fortune words cookie", 幸运饼 xìngyùn bǐng "good luck cookie", 幸运籤语饼 xìngyùn qiān yǔ bǐng "lucky fortune words cookie", 幸运甜饼 xìngyùn tián bǐng "good luck sweet cookie", 幸福饼干 xìngfú bǐnggān "good luck biscuit", or 占卜饼 zhānbǔ bǐng "divining cookie".

==In popular culture==

The non-Chinese origin of the fortune cookie is humorously illustrated in Amy Tan's 1989 novel The Joy Luck Club, in which a pair of immigrant women from China find jobs at a fortune cookie factory in America. They are amused by the unfamiliar concept of a fortune cookie but, after several hilarious attempts at translating the fortunes into Chinese, come to the conclusion that the cookies contain not wisdom but "bad instruction."
Fortune cookies have become an iconic symbol in American culture, inspiring many products. There are fortune cookie-shaped jewelry, a fortune cookie-shaped Magic 8 Ball, and silver-plated fortune cookies. Fortune cookie toilet paper, with words of wisdom that appear when the paper is moistened, has become popular amongst university students in Italy and Greece.  
There is a common joke in the United States involving fortune cookies that involves appending "between the sheets" or "except in bed" to the end of the fortune, usually creating a sexual innuendo or other bizarre messages (e.g., "Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall bed"). A gallows humor variation to this joke involves appending the phrase "in jail" to the end of the fortune.
In Iron Man 3, the Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley, mentions the cookie's origin, stating: "True story about fortune cookies—they look Chinese, they sound Chinese. But they're actually an American invention, which is why they're hollow, full of lies and leave a bad taste in the mouth." Later his character says "Did you know fortune cookies aren't even Chinese? They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe." Quotes from Film: Iron Man 3 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1300854/
"Creating a takeout menu for Lunar New Year" by Phil Vettel, Chicago Tribune, January 21, 2005, "Friday" section, page 19.  (Describing "the 'in bed' game.")  Also, "'To know is nothing; to imagine is everything' - social ritual and meaning in the consumption of fortune cookies," by Ellen R Foxman; Mary Stanfield Bradley. American Marketing Association. Conference Proceedings. 2002; Vol.13; page 98 (at page 101).
In the video game Animal Crossing New Leaf, the player can purchase fortune cookies, which allows them to win Nintendo-themed items.
In 2013, Japanese pop group AKB48 released a single titled "Koisuru Fortune Cookie" which sold 1,095,894 copies on its first day of release, and reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts with over 1.33 million copies. AKB48's Indonesian sister group JKT48 released their own version of the song titled "Fortune Cookie Yang Mencinta" as did the Chinese sister group SNH48 as "Ài de xìngyùn qū qí".
