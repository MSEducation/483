The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitalia, testicular volume and development of pubic and axillary hair. This scale was first identified by James Tanner, a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.[tpl]WhoNamedIt|synd|3082[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to natural variation, individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of puberty. In HIV treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent, or pediatric).

==Criticism==

The scale has been criticized by the pornography industry for its potential to lead to false child pornography convictions, such as in the case when government experts used it to assert that pornographic actress Lupe Fuentes was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.[tpl]cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010[/tpl] The author of the classification system himself has argued that age classification utilizing the Tanner stages represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age but rather maturity stages and thus are non-diagnostic for age estimation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|coauthors=Tanner, JM|title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230[/tpl]
