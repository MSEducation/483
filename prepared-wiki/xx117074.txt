The Schmidt Memorial Field House is an on-campus arena at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It was built in 1927 and opened on March 7, 1928 with a win against archrival Cincinnati.  It is named for Walter Schmidt, Class of 1905, a benefactor to then-St. Xavier College who also donated money for Schmidt Hall (formerly the library, now the President's office) on campus.
It was the first on-campus arena for the university, and was in use from the last game of the 1928 season to 1983, when the team moved to the off-campus Cincinnati Gardens full-time.  (The team had played a few big games a year there, as well as Riverfront Coliseum, prior to that.)  Since 1983, the team has only returned once to the arena, for a game against Florida International University in January 1988.  
Currently the fieldhouse is used for the school's recreational sports program.  It has also hosted World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) events, and a speech by President Bill Clinton in 1996.
