The Indo-European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 439 languages and dialects, according to the 2009 Ethnologue estimate, about half (221) belonging to the Indo-Aryan subbranch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=2-16|title=Ethnologue report for Indo-European|publisher=Ethnologue.com[/tpl] It includes most major current languages of Europe, the Iranian plateau, and the Indian Subcontinent, and was also predominant in ancient Anatolia. With written attestations appearing since the Bronze Age in the form of the Anatolian languages and Mycenaean Greek, the Indo-European family is significant to the field of historical linguistics as possessing the second-longest recorded history, after the Afro-Asiatic family.
Indo-European languages are spoken by almost 3 billion native speakers,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=family |title=Ethnologue list of language families |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07[/tpl] the largest number by far for any recognised language family. Of the 20 languages with the largest numbers of native speakers according to SIL Ethnologue, 12 are Indo-European: Spanish, English, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, German, Punjabi, Marathi, French, Urdu, and Italian, accounting for over 1.7 billion native speakers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size |title=Ethnologue list of languages by number of speakers |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07[/tpl] Several disputed proposals link Indo-European to other major language families.

==Etymology==

The term "Indo-European" was coined in 1813 by Sir Thomas Young, from Indo- + European, after the geographical extremes, from Western Europe to India.[tpl]cite book | author=Robinson, Andrew | title=The Last Man Who Knew Everything: Thomas Young, the Anonymous Genius who Proved Newton Wrong and Deciphered the Rosetta Stone, among Other Surprising Feats | publisher=Penguin | year=2007 | isbn=0-13-134304-1[/tpl]

==History of Indo-European linguistics==

In the 16th century, European visitors to India began to suggest similarities between Indian, Iranian and European languages. In 1583, Thomas Stephens, an English Jesuit missionary in Goa, in a letter to his brother that was not published until the 20th century,[tpl]cite book|first=Sylvain|last=Auroux|title=History of the Language Sciences|page=1156|isbn=3-11-016735-2|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin, New York|year=2000|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yasNy365EywC&pg=PA1156&vq=stephens+sassetti&dq=3110167352[/tpl] noted similarities between Indian languages, specifically Sanskrit, and Greek and Latin.
Another account to mention the ancient language Sanskrit came from Filippo Sassetti (born in Florence in 1540), a merchant who travelled to the Indian subcontinent. Writing in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian (these included devaḥ/dio "God", sarpaḥ/serpe "serpent", sapta/sette "seven", aṣṭa/otto "eight", nava/nove "nine"). However, neither Stephens's nor Sassetti's observations led to further scholarly inquiry.
In 1647, Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among Indo-European languages, and supposed that they derived from a primitive common language he called Scythian. He included in his hypothesis Dutch, Albanian, Greek, Latin, Persian, and German, later adding Slavic, Celtic, and Baltic languages. However, Van Boxhorn's suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research.
Gaston Coeurdoux and others made observations of the same type. Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship between them. Similarly, Mikhail Lomonosov compared different language groups of the world including Slavic, Baltic ("Kurlandic"), Iranian ("Medic"), Finnish, Chinese, "Hottentot", and others. He emphatically expressed the antiquity of the linguistic stages accessible to comparative method in the drafts for his Russian Grammar (published 1755).[ref]M. V. Lomonosov. In: Complete Edition, Moscow, 1952, vol. 7, pp 652–659:
Представимъ долготу времени, которою сіи языки раздѣлились. ... Польской и россійской языкъ коль давно раздѣлились! Подумай же, когда курляндской! Подумай же, когда латинской, греч., нѣм., росс. О глубокая древность! the depth of time when these languages separated! ... Polish and Russian separated so long ago! Now think how long ago happened to Kurlandic! Think when happened to Latin, Greek, German, and Russian! Oh, great antiquity![/ref]
The hypothesis reappeared in 1786 when Sir William Jones first lectured on the striking similarities between three of the oldest languages known in his time: Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, to which he tentatively added Gothic, Celtic, and Persian,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billposer.org/Papers/iephm.pdf |title=cited on page 14-15. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07[/tpl] though his classification contained some inaccuracies and omissions.Roger Blench [tpl]Wayback |date=20060517091902 |url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology%20data/CH4-BLENCH.pdf |title=Archaeology and Language: methods and issues [/tpl].

It was Thomas Young who in 1813In London Quarterly Review X/2 1813.; cf. Szemerényi 1999:12, footnote 6 first used the term Indo-European, which became the standard scientific term through the work of Franz Bopp, whose systematic comparison of these and other old languages supported the theory. A synonym for "Indo-European" is Indo-Germanic (Idg. or IdG.), which defines the family by indicating its southeasternmost and northwesternmost branches. In most languages this term is dated or less common, whereas in German it is still the standard scientific term.In German the scientific term is indogermanisch (Indo-Germanic) indicating the east-west extension. That term  first appeared in French as indo-germanique, in 1810, in the writing of Conrad Malte-Brun, a French geographer of Danish descent. In other languages—Dutch, for instance—the general population uses the term Indo-Germaans. Advocates of Indo-Germanic often claim that "Indo-European" is misleading because many historic and several living European language (the unrelated Uralic languages, as well as several others, are also spoken in Europe) do not belong to this family. Advocates of Indo-European counter that Indo-Germanic is misleading because many of the European languages included are not in fact Germanic.
Franz Bopp's Comparative Grammar, which appeared between 1833 and 1852, is the beginning of Indo-European studies as an academic discipline. The classical phase of Indo-European comparative linguistics leads from this work to August Schleicher's 1861 Compendium and up to Karl Brugmann's Grundriss, published in the 1880s. Brugmann's junggrammatische reevaluation of the field and Ferdinand de Saussure's development of the laryngeal theory may be considered the beginning of "modern" Indo-European studies. The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century (such as Calvert Watkins, Jochem Schindler and Helmut Rix) developed a better understanding of morphology and, in the wake of Kuryłowicz's 1956 Apophonie, understanding of the ablaut.
