Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Jr. (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional basketball player who played point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 13 seasons. After winning championships in high school and college, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA Draft by the Lakers. He won a championship and an NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.
Johnson's career achievements include three NBA MVP Awards, nine NBA Finals appearances, twelve All-Star games, and ten All-NBA First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2.[tpl]cite web|title=All Time Leaders: Assists Per Game|work=www.nba.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersAPGQuery.html?topic=4&stat=10|accessdate=2008-05-08[/tpl] Johnson was a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold medal in 1992. After leaving the NBA in 1992, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that travelled around the world playing exhibition games."Magic Johnson." www.entertainment.howstuffworks.com.

Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as a member of the "Dream Team".

===Early years===

Earvin Johnson Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan to Earvin Sr., a General Motors assembly worker, and Christine, a school custodian.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/careers/profile42.htm|title=Rebounding from basketball court to boardroom|last=Eldridge|first=Earle|date=November 8, 2004|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-23[/tpl] Johnson, who had six siblings,Johnson, Earvin "Magic", and William Novak.

Johnson's mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors. Earvin Jr. would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him "Garbage Man."Danois, Alejandro. "The Meaning of Magic." www.coachgeorgeraveling.com, August 20, 2012. Retrieved May 23, 2013
Johnson grew up in Lansing, and came to love basketball as a youngster. His favorite basketball player was Bill Russell, whom he admired more for his many championships than his athletic ability.Roselius, Chris J. Magic Johnson: Basketball Star and Entrepreneur. ISBN 1617149454 Google Books. Retrieved May 26, 2013. He also idolized players such as Earl Monroe and Marques Haynes,[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Earvin "Magic"|coauthor=William Novak|title=My Life|page=14|isbn=1-902799-01-1[/tpl] and practiced "all day."

Johnson's mother, originally from North Carolina, had also played basketball as a child, and he grew up watching his brothers play the game.
By the time he had reached the eighth grade, Johnson had begun to think about a future in basketball. He had become a dominant junior high player, once scoring 48 points in a game.Johnson, Earvin "Magic", and William Novak. My Life. ISBN 0-449-22254-3. Google Books. Retrieved May 27, 2013. Johnson looked forward to playing at Sexton High School a school with a very successful basketball team and a great tradition that also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be bused to all-white Everett High School, instead of going to Sexton, which was all-black."Detroit Board's Busing Decision Termed 'Unwise.'" The Argus-Press Arbor, Michigan, July 12, 1973. Google News Archives. Retrieved May 27, 2013 Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students, and white parents refusing to send their children to school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg Earvin not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually Johnson accepted his situation, and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader. When recalling the events in his autobiography, My Life, he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him:
 As I look back on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett turned to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them. 
Johnson was first dubbed "Magic" as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Everett High School, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds and 16 assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker[tpl]cite news|first=Jeff|last=Zillgitt|title=Magic Memories of a Real Star|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/zillgitt/2002-09-27-zillgitt_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co.

Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan and was also named to the 1977 McDonald's All-American team."McDonald's All-American Alumni." www.mcdonaldsallamerican.com.

===Michigan State University===

Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home.[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Earvin "Magic"|coauthor=William Novak|title=My Life|page=45|isbn=1-902799-01-1[/tpl] His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing.

The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.
During the 1978–79 season, Michigan State again qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they advanced to the championship game and faced Indiana State, which was led by senior Larry Bird.

==Professional career==

===Rookie season in the NBA (1979–80)===

Johnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Johnson said that what was "most amazing" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Earvin "Magic"|coauthor=William Novak|title=My Life|page=113|isbn=1-902799-01-1[/tpl] the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_points.html|title=Regular Season Records: Points|publisher=www.nba.com|accessdate=2009-02-28[/tpl] Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal.[tpl]cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Rookie Makes the Lakers Believe in Magic|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19791980.html|accessdate=2008-05-07[/tpl] Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html|title=Larry Bird Statistics|publisher=www.basketball-reference.com|accessdate=2009-03-16[/tpl]

===Battles against the Celtics (1983–87)===

===Post-Olympics and later life===

Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. In an August, 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, "If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired.""Magic Johnson wishes he didn't retire so early." August 2, 2011 Interview with Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke. www.lakersblog.latimes.com. Retrieved April 13, 2013. Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he "didn't want to hurt the game."
During his retirement, Johnson has written a book on safer sex, run several businesses, worked for NBC as a commentator, and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team of former college and NBA players. In 1985, Johnson created "A Midsummer Night's Magic", a yearly charity event which included a celebrity basketball game and a black tie dinner. The proceeds went to the United Negro College Fund, and Johnson held this event for twenty years, ending in 2005.

====Return to the Lakers as coach and player (1994, 1996)====

Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation. The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season. The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5-11. Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994.
At the age of 36, Johnson attempted another comeback as a player when he re-joined the Lakers during the 1995–96 NBA season. During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds.

====Magic Johnson All-Stars====

Determined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players.

===Media figure and business interests===

In 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the Fox network called The Magic Hour, but the show was canceled after two months because of low ratings.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EFD8103BF93BA3575BC0A96E958260|title='Magic Hour' Canceled|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1998-08-08|accessdate=2008-05-08[/tpl] Shortly after the cancellation of his talk show, Magic Johnson started a record label.

Johnson began thinking of life after basketball while still playing with the Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he had a meeting with Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency.

Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips."Magic Touch: Magic Johnson's Fast Break Into Business." www.success.com.

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals, but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to "help educate all people about what HIV is about" and teach others not to "discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS". Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.
To prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a daily combination of drugs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-30-magic-aids_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson combats AIDS misperceptions|last=Sternberg|first=Steve|date=November 30, 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-16[/tpl] He has advertised GlaxoSmithKline's drugs,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2003-01-20-magic-glaxo_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson assists drugmaker to advertise HIV treatment|date=January 20, 2003|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl] and partnered with Abbott Laboratories to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.

Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called "Showtime", described as a mix of "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, "There have been times when Johnson has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous triple-double threats of all time; his 138 triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181.[tpl]cite web|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|title=Making triple trouble|date=2006-11-18|publisher=Yahoo!

===Rivalry with Larry Bird===

Johnson and Larry Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning.
Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites.[tpl]cite book|last=Bork|first=Gunter|title=Basketball Sternstunden|year=1995|pages=49–55[/tpl] ISBN 376790456X.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1057184/1/index.htm|title=The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of|last=Halberstam|first=David|date=1987-06-29|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12[/tpl] The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA.

==Relationship with Jerry Buss==

Magic Johnson had an extremely close relationship with Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he saw as a mentor and a father figure."Report: Johnson to become part owner of Lakers." Ocala Florida Star-Banner, June 27, 1994. Google News Archives. Retrieved May 22, 2013. Calling Buss his "second father" and "one of his best friends", Johnson spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his death from cancer. Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, "Without Dr. Jerry Buss, there is no Magic."Plaschke, Bill. "To Magic Johnson, Jerry Buss was friend, mentor, and 'second father.'" Los Angeles Times, February 19, 2013. Retrieved May 21, 2013. Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA Draft. In addition to playing 13 seasons for the Lakers and coaching the team briefly in 1994, Johnson also had an ownership stake in the team for nearly twenty years. Buss took a special interest in Johnson, introducing him to important Los Angeles business contacts and showing him how the Lakers organization was run, before eventually selling Johnson a stake in the team in 1994. Johnson credits Buss with giving him the business knowledge that enabled him to become part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers."Magic Johnson says Jerry Buss made him man he is today." www.msn.foxsports.com, February 20, 2013. Retrieved May 22, 2013.
Buss supported Johnson as he revealed his diagnosis of HIV in 1991, and he never hesitated to keep Johnson close to the organization, bringing him in as part-owner, and even as a coach.
Johnson had never seriously considered coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching position with the Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years he was not the league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.
