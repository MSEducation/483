The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland Cumann Uiscebhealaigh Intíre na hÉireann (IWAI) is a registered charity and a limited company in the Republic of Ireland and also operates in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1954 to campaign for the conservation and development of the waterways and their preservation as working navigations. The association has approximately 4,400 members which are organised in twenty branches.
IWAI has strong links with the Scottish Inland Waterways Association (SIWA), with an annual exchange. In 2008, SIWA visited Lough Erne, and in 2009, IWAI is due to visit the Crinan Canal.
