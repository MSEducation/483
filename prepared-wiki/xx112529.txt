The grapheme Ć (minuscule: [tpl]unicode|ć[/tpl]), formed from C with the addition of an acute accent, is used in various languages. It usually denotes [tpl]IPA|t͡ɕ[/tpl], the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate, including in phonetic transcription. Its Unicode codepoints are U+0106 for Ć and U+0107 for ć.
The symbol originated in the Polish alphabet (where, in its modern usage, it appears most often at the ends of words) and was adopted by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj into South Slavic languages in the 19th century. It is the fifth letter of the Polish, Sorbian, and Gaj's Latin alphabet of Standard Croatian, Standard Bosnian, and, when written the Latin script, Standard Serbian and Standard Montenegrin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:53UAP67AS7QJ:www.eurozine.com/articles/article_2006-02-10-longinovic-mk.html+%22vra%C4%87anjeto%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk |title=Eurozine - BALKANOT VO PREVOD - Tomislav Longinovic |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20[/tpl] It is fourth in the Belarusian Łacinka alphabet. 
The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet equivalent is [tpl]angle bracket|Ћ[/tpl]. Macedonian uses [tpl]angle bracket|Ќ[/tpl] as a partial equivalent. Other languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet usually represent this sound by the character combination ЧЬ.
