Following this success, the song was released internationally and peaked at No.1 in eight other countries across Europe, including Germany and Italy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Alexandra+Stan&titel=Mr.+Saxobeat&cat=s|title=Hitparade.ch: Alexandra Stan (Mr. Saxobeat)|publisher=Schweizer Hitparade|accessdate=22 September 2012[/tpl] while reaching the top 10 in the other countries, including a No.3 peak in the UK Singles Chart.
