[[GM C platform (1936)]]

CATEGORIES: General Motors platforms

The C Platform designation had been introduced as early as 1936 and was used until 1984. From at least 1941, when the B-body followed suit in adopting the C-body's pioneering lower and wider runningboardless bodystyle, it may be viewed as a stretched version of the GM B platform. After 1984, the platform was renamed the GM D platform and continued in production to 1996. 
Generally the C-Body was for the top-of-the-line models of multiple General Motors divisions including the Oldsmobile 98 and the Buick Electra, and the base model for multiple Cadillac's including the Series 6200 Calais, the Series 6300 de Ville, the Series 6400 Eldorado,  the Series 6000 Fleetwood Sixty Special and the Fleetwood Brougham.
This platform was the basis for the following vehicles:
