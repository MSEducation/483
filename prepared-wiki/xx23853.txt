[[Strong club system]]

CATEGORIES: Bridge systems

The Strong Club System is a set of bidding conventions and agreements used in the game of contract bridge and is based upon an opening bid of 1[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] as being an artificial forcing bid promising a strong hand.[tpl]cite web|last=Martel|first=Claire|title=Claire Bridge - About Bridge systems|url=http://www.clairebridge.com/encheresetsystemes.htm[/tpl] Unlike Standard American which typically opens with 2[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] to show a strong hand of 21 (or 22) or more points, the strong 1[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] opening is assigned a lower minimum strength promising 16 or more high card points. All other bids would therefore be limited to a maximum of 15 high card points. There are several variants of the strong club system and all are classified as artificial because the bids are highly codified.

==Strengths and weaknesses==

There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems: 
The generally acknowledged weakness of such systems is the fact that the opponents can aggressively overcall the 1[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] bid to deprive the stronger opponents of their bidding room, and that the loss of the 1[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] opening bid often causes strain on other opening bids, most often 1[tpl]Diams[/tpl] and 2[tpl]Clubs[/tpl].

==Variants==

There are several types of strong club systems

==History==

The original strong club system was the Vanderbilt Club, invented in the 1920s by Harold Vanderbilt.[tpl]cite book |last = Goren |first = Charles |authorlink = Charles Goren | editor-last  = Ewen| editor-first = Robert B| editor-link  = |title = The Precision System of Bidding  |edition =  |publisher = Robert Hale & Company  |location = London  |page = Foreword  |series =  |year = 1971  |doi =  |lccn =  |oclc =  |isbn = 0-7091-3163-1[/tpl][tpl]OEB|7|364[/tpl] For many years, the most popular strong club systems were the Schenken Club in the US and the Neapolitan and Blue Team Club systems in Europe. Both are four-card major systems. The former is patterned closely after the Standard American bidding of the time and the latter is characterized by canap√© (bidding the second-longer suit) in many situations.
