==History==

Historically, Toyama Prefecture was Etchū Province.Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780[/tpl]. Following the abolition of the han system in 1871, Etchū Province was renamed Niikawa Prefecture, but Imizu District was given to Nanao Prefecture. In 1872 Imizu District was returned by the new Ishikawa Prefecture. 
In 1876, Niikawa Prefecture was merged into Ishikawa Prefecture but the merger was void in 1881 and the area was re-established as Toyama Prefecture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The Itai-itai disease occurred in Toyama around 1950.
