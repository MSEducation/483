[[Gorenstein ring]]

CATEGORIES: Commutative algebra

In commutative algebra, a Gorenstein local ring is a Noetherian commutative local ring R with finite injective dimension, as an R-module. There are many equivalent conditions, some of them listed below, most dealing with some sort of duality condition. 
Gorenstein rings were introduced by Grothendieck, who named them because of their relation to a duality property of singular plane curves studied by [tpl]harvs|txt|last=Gorenstein|authorlink=Daniel Gorenstein|year=1952[/tpl] (who was fond of claiming that he did not understand the definition of a Gorenstein ring). The zero-dimensional case had been studied by [tpl]harvtxt|Macaulay|1934[/tpl]. [tpl]harvtxt|Serre|1961[/tpl] and [tpl]harvtxt|Bass|1963[/tpl] publicized the concept of Gorenstein rings. 
Noncommutative analogues of 0-dimensional Gorenstein rings are called Frobenius rings. 

==Definitions==

A Gorenstein ring is a commutative ring such that each localization at a prime ideal is a Gorenstein local ring. The Gorenstein ring concept is a special case of the more general Cohen–Macaulay ring.
The classical definition reads:
A local Cohen–Macaulay ring R is called Gorenstein if there is a maximal R-regular sequence in the maximal ideal generating an irreducible ideal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
A (not necessarily commutative) ring R is called Gorenstein if R has finite injective dimension both as a left R-module and as a right R-module. If R is a local ring, we say R is a local Gorenstein ring.

==Properties==

A noetherian commutative local ring is Gorenstein if and only if its completion is Gorenstein.[tpl]harvnb|Matsumura|1986|nb=Theorem 18.3[/tpl]
