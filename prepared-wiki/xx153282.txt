Stefan Weinerhall, born 1976 in Mjölby, Sweden, is a heavy metal guitarist, presently playing with Falconer, the band he started in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p478168/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Falconer|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo |publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl]
Stefan played in the Viking metal band Mithotyn from their formation until their eventual split in 1999. He and his Mithotyn band mate Karl Beckman also made two albums with the black/thrash metal band Indungeon. Stefan played bass on the first album before switching to his more accustomed role as guitarist for their second album, The Misanthropocalypse.
After Mithotyn split Stefan decided to form a new band that would retain his old act's folk-influenced melodies but to use clean vocals and be based in a more traditional Metal sound. He enlisted his former Mithotyn band mate Karsten Larsson to play drums and, in a surprise move, stage singer Mathias Blad to perform vocals.
Stefan has written nearly all Falconer's music and lyrics and also played bass guitar on the first two albums.
Stefan's equipment includes a Kramer Baretta, a limited edition ESP 400NT and a POD 2.3 amplifier.
