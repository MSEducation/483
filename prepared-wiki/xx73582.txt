Flintshire ([tpl]lang-cy|Sir y Fflint[/tpl]) is a the most north-easterly county in Wales bordering the English county of Cheshire to the east, Denbighshire to the west and Wrexham County Borough to the south. It is named after the historic county of Flintshire which had notably different borders. The county is governed by Flintshire County Council.

==History==

Flintshire takes its name from the former county of Flintshire established in 1536 which existed until 1974 when it was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972. Its re-establishment in 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 does not follow those original boundaries but covers a smaller area.

===Early History===

At the time of the Roman invasion, the area of present day Flintshire was inhabited by the Deceangli, one of the (Irish) celtic tribes in ancient Britain. They appeared to have surrendered to Roman rule with little resistance. Following Roman Britain, and the emergence of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, the region had been divided into the Hundred ([tpl]lang-cy|Cantref[/tpl]) of Tegeingl. thumb|left|The Domesday Hundreds of Atiscross and Exestan later forming the principal area of Flintshire are shown in pink.  It became part of the Kingdom of Mercia in the 8th century until the Norman conquest in 1066 under the control of Edwin of Tegeingl, the Lordship from which the Flintshire coat of arms is derived. Edwin's mother is believed to have been Ethelfleda or Aldgyth, daughter of Eadwine of Mercia. At the time of the establishment of the Earldom of Chester, the region forms two of the then twelve Hundreds of Cheshire for which it remains a part for several hundred years.
Flintshire approximately resembles the boundaries of the Hundreds of Atiscross and Exestan as they existed at the time of the Domesday book.http://domesdaymap.co.uk/search/?geo=atis%27s+cross These two Hundreds were transferred from the Earldom of Chester to the Kingdom of Gwynedd[tpl]Harvtxt|Harris|Thacker|1987|pp=340–341[/tpl] in the 13th century following dispute settlements. These regions, as well as an exclave formed from part of the Hundred of Dudestan (known as Maelor Saesneg), would form the principal areas of Flintshire, established by the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284.  It was administered with the Palatinate of Cheshire by the Justiciar of Chester. The county was consolidated in 1536 by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 under the Tudor King Henry VIII, when it was incorporated into the Kingdom of England. 
Flintshire remained in existance until 1974 when it was merged with Denbighshire and the Rural district of Edeyrnion to form the administrative county of Clwyd. Clwyd was abolished only 22 years later and Flintshire re-established in its present form in 1996. However, some parts of the historic country are are not included within the present boundaries of Flintshire, significantly English Maelor was incorporated into Wrexham County Borough, and St Asaph, Prestatyn and Rhyl into Denbighshire.

===Modern History===

The current administrative area of Flintshire (a unitary authority) came into existence in 1996, when the former administrative county of Clwyd was split into three smaller areas.  The principal area was formed by the merger of the Alyn and Deeside and Delyn districts.  In terms of pre-1974 divisions, the area comprises
The district of Rhuddlan, which was also formed entirely from the administrative county of Flintshire was included in the new Denbighshire instead.  Other parts of the pre-1974 administrative Flintshire to be excluded from the principal area are the Maelor Rural District and the parish of Marford and Hoseley, which became part of the Wrexham Maelor district in 1974 and are now part of Wrexham County Borough.

==Geography==

Flintshire is a maritime county bounded to the north by the Dee estuary, to the east by Cheshire, to the west by Denbighshire and to the south by Wrexham County Borough. The coast along the Dee estuary is heavily developed by industry and the north coast much developed for tourism. The Clwydian Mountains occupy much of the west of the county. The highest point is Moel Fammau (1,820 feet / 554 metres). The chief towns are Buckley, Connah's Quay, Flint, Hawarden, Holywell, Mold, Queensferry, and Shotton. The main rivers are the Dee (the estuary of which forms much of the coast) and the Clwyd.
