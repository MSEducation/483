[[Shebel Berenta]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Shebel Berenta is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia, named after two older districts which occupy the area this woreda currently covers: Berenta which is north of the Mecha river, and Shebel which is south of that stream. Part of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Shebel Berenta is bordered on the southwest by Dejen, on the northwest by Enemay, on the north by Enarj Enawga, and on the east by the Abay River which separates it from the Oromia Region. The major town in Shebel Berenta is Yed Wuha.
In 2002, Shebel Berenta was judged to be one of four chronically food insecure woredas in this part of the Amhara Region, due to much of their farmland being "extremely depleted, deforested and eroded".Hugo RÃ¤mi, "Fewer surpluses in Gojam and Awi and Severe shortages in lowland areas of Abaye River Gorge", UN-OCHA Assessment Mission, October 2002 (accessed 23 April 2009)

This is a considerable difference from when C.T. Beke passed through the district in November 1841, when he found the inhabitants were "Mietta Gallas, nominally subject to the ruler of Gojam, whose hold on them would, however, appear to be not very strong."Beke, "Route from Ankober to Dima", Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, 12 (1842), p. 256 The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 93.82% reporting that as their religion, while 6.1% were Muslim.
