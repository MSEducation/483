==Later years==

Banks was voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, his first year of eligibility.[tpl]cite web|title=Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient - Ernie Banks|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/11/22/2013-medal-freedom-recipient-ernie-banks|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=April 14, 2014[/tpl] He received votes on 321 of the 383 ballots. Though several players were selected through the Veterans Committee and the Committee on Negro Baseball Leagues that year, Banks was the only player elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He was inducted on August 8 of that year. During his induction speech, Banks said, "We've got the setting - sunshine, fresh air, the team behind us. So let's play two!"[tpl]cite news|title=Banks Enshrined in Hall of Fame|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dFlNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7294,2132310|accessdate=August 13, 2013|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger|date=August 9, 1977[/tpl]

Banks has served as a team ambassador since his retirement, though author Phil Rogers points out that the team has never placed Banks in a position of authority or significant influence. In 1983, shortly after Wrigley sold the team to the Tribune Company, Banks and the Cubs briefly severed ties. Rogers wrote that Banks was viewed as "something of a crazy uncle who hung around the house for no apparent reason" after the sale. Rogers says that team officials anonymously told the press that Banks was fired because he was unreliable. Soon Banks and the Cubs reconciled and the former shortstop began making appearances on behalf of the Cubs again.Rogers, p. 232.
When the 1984 Cubs won the NL East division, the club named Banks an honorary team member.[tpl]cite news|title=Cubs Bring Back Banks as Honorary Member|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a5NSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UhIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1837,5176574|accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=September 28, 1984[/tpl] At the 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first one held at Wrigley Field since Banks' playing days, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch to starting catcher Mike Scioscia.[tpl]cite web|title=1990 All-Star Game|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1990as.shtml|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=January 5, 2014[/tpl]  He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.[tpl]cite web|title=The All-Century Team|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl] In the same year, the Society for American Baseball Research listed him 27th on a list of the 100 greatest baseball players.[tpl]cite web|title=100 Greatest Baseball Players|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisab100.shtml|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=April 14, 2014[/tpl]

Banks remains close to the Cubs and makes frequent appearances at the team's spring training grounds, HoHoKam Stadium in Arizona. Author Harry Strong wrote in 2013 that "the Chicago Cubs do not have a mascot, but they hardly need one when the face of the franchise is still so visible."[ref]
