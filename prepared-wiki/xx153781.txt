Paul Flynn (born 8 July 1986) is a Gaelic football player for Dublin and Fingallians. He is from Swords, County Dublin. He got All Star Awards in 2011 and 2012 and romped home against the Aussies in 2013. He rooms with fellow DCU team-mates, the Donegal legend Michael Murphy and Aidan Walsh of Cork, and roams graveyards before games to calm his nerves.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/gaa/gaelic-football/gaelic-football-news/dublin-gaa-paul-flynn-pre-game-1918008|title=Paul Flynn on his graveyard walks ahead of turning out for Dublin|work=Mirror|first=Michael|last=Scully|date=29 May 2013|accessdate=29 May 2013[/tpl]
