Stark Brothers Nurseries were the marketers of the Red Delicious and the Golden Delicious apple.

==History==

In 1816, James Hart Stark moved from Kentucky to Louisiana, Missouri. He brought with him a bundle of apple scions. From his bundle he started a nursery business. They bought the rights to the Red Delicious apple in 1893. 
In 1914, the Stark Golden Delicious apple was discovered and developed. The original tree was found on the Mullins' family farm in Clay County, West Virginia and was locally known as Mullin's Yellow Seedling and Annit apple. Anderson Mullins sold the tree and propagation rights to Stark Brothers Nurseries, which first marketed it as a companion to their Red Delicious in 1914.[tpl]cite news |first= Adrian|last= Higgins|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why the Red Delicious No Longer Is.

In June 2001 the possibility of closure to Stark Brothers Nurseries, Louisiana, Missouri's oldest and largest employer, famous worldwide for the fruit trees it grew and sold was a reality. "Louisiana, Mo., Survives by Adapting to Change". (April 2008). Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:  http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/articles/?id=13 However, the alarm was short-lived.   By fall of that year, Stark Bro's was back as two separate business Stark Bro's Fulfillment Services and Stark Brothers Nurseries and Orchards.
