He sang and played guitar on all of the band's four albums. Fandango toured with numerous artists including The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, The Beach Boys and Billy Joel.
After Fandango split, He received a phone call from British guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. This resulted in an audition and Turner was immediately enlisted in Rainbow. The band, while popular in Europe and Japan, had not reached the same level of success in the US before Turner joined. With his contributions (largely considered more pop oriented), the group was catapulted to a new level of American success. Several tracks from albums with Turner reached the Top 20 on rock radio charts in the early- to mid-80's. "Stone Cold" became Rainbow's first Top 40 hit and the band's videos were played on heavy rotation on MTV.  Turner recorded three studio albums with Rainbow: Difficult to Cure, Straight Between the Eyes, and Bent Out of Shape, which featured the single "Street of Dreams".  Rainbow disbanded in 1984.
In 1985, after the break-up of Rainbow, Turner released a solo album, Rescue You, produced by Roy Thomas Baker, known for his work with Queen and The Cars. He co-wrote most of the songs with keyboardist Al Greenwood (Foreigner). The first single, "Endlessly," received extensive airplay on radio and MTV. Tours with Night Ranger and Pat Benatar and an acting role in the TV movie Blue Deville followed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090757/ |title=Blue de Ville (TV Movie 1986) |work=IMDb |accessdate=2013-10-12[/tpl] 
In 1987 Turner also supplied backing vocals to the Michael Bolton album The Hunger. He appeared on the tracks "Hot Love" and "Gina". 
In 1988, he joined Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force and recorded the album Odyssey. The brief tour that followed the release of the album included a concert in Leningrad which was recorded and then released as Trial by Fire (1989). In 1989 he left the band to join Deep Purple. Turner recorded just one album, Slaves & Masters (1990). The album peaked at No. 87 on the Billboard Charts, and a relatively successful tour followed in 1991, but Turner left the band in late 1992.[tpl]cite news |title=Can Happen Here – Joe Lynn Turner |author=Marybeth Mitchell |work=Higher Rock Music |url=http://www.higherrockmusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1826:can-happen-here-joe-lynn-turner-&catid=63:other-genre-news&Itemid=94 |accessdate=2013-10-14[/tpl]  He has also put out three albums for the progressive rock band[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.joelynnturner.com |title=Biography |accessdate=2014-02-23 |work=Joe Lynn Turner official website[/tpl] Mother's Army, featuring Jeff Watson, Bob Daisley and Carmine Appice.
