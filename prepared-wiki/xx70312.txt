==History==

Lynbrook High School opened on September 13, 1965, with an enrollment of 1,026 students. Because Cupertino High School had grown very large by that time, a new school in the West San Jose area was constructed. The District Board nominated Kendall Stanger as the first principal of the school. The school was technologically advanced around the time it was built and had closed-circuit television and air conditioning. During the first year, there was no gymnasium, locker room, or swimming pool. There were sophomores and freshman attending that year. By the second school year the gymnasium, locker room, and 'Olympic sized' swimming pool were complete.

==Campus==

Many of Lynbrook's buildings and facilities are in their original state and have not been significantly renovated. However, the bleachers in the main Gym were replaced between the years 2003 and 2006. Most of Lynbrook's buildings are constructed of old brick exteriors. New structures and facilities built since 1990 include the library, swimming pool, field house, and Voyager buildings. During the summer in 2009, the parking lot was renovated and solar panels were added.
Lynbrook has a football field with a rubber track around, a baseball field, and a field hockey/soccer field also known as Stober field. Lynbrook's Olympic-sized swimming pool is in excellent condition. During water polo season, Lynbrook's nine lane swimming pool devotes about half of its area to non-lane-divided deep-water areas. The deep-water area is used mainly for water polo competitions. The pool was renovated in the summer of 2009. The softball and field hockey areas were also renovated in 2006-2007. Also, on September 12, 2011, construction for a new rubber track, football field, and new baseball field began.
The classroom wings are on the back (east) side of the school and are numbered from 101-615. The 100 and 200 wings are on the north side, and the 500 and 600 wings are on the south side. The gymnasium, swimming pool, and tennis and basketball courts are situated on the southwest side of Lynbrook's campus. The western third of the campus consists of the Stober field (a large green lawn used primarily for field hockey practice and student events) and a football field. The visual and performing arts center is the school's easternmost building. The school's mural of the Viking, which faces the main parking lot, is painted on the building that houses the girls' locker rooms and the weight training room.
The rally court or quad is the hub of student life at Lynbrook and is surrounded by the cafeteria, classroom wings, auditorium, and the Associated Student Body den. School-wide homecoming skits are performed in the rally court. Other student activities also take place in the quad, including "Club Day." On Club Day, participating clubs set up tables in the quad and fundraise by selling food and drinks. Spirit Weeks, week-long events put on by the Associated Student Body (ASB), are also held in the quad. Spirit weeks culminate in a school-wide rally at the end of the week, located in the main gym. While the bleachers in the main gym were being replaced, rallies were held outdoors in the quad.
