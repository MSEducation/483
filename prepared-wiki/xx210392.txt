==Music video==

A music video was made for the song and released on October 3, 2008. Limppu Lindberg, who has worked with Lordi as a graphic designer, directed the video. Lead vocalist Mr Lordi said that the aim of the video was to move away from previous videos by Lordi, and showcase the band's new, more 'grotesque' look. He also said it features a more complex storyline than previous Lordi videos.LORDI: 'Bite It Like A Bulldog' Video Posted Online - October 3, 2008 - Obtained October 4, 2008.
While the storyline to the video is far more obscure than that of the previous videos, it appears to revolve around a police detective searching a slaughterhouse for evidence, presumably due to something Lordi has done. As a result Lordi tortures him with a painful sound emitted from a record, and a television screen showing numerous home videos invaded by the monsters, attacking. The detective finds Lordi, in pure fear and shock, and Lordi leans over him. Awa is holding a video camera, and the video ends with a shot of it.
