Sliver of a Sun is the debut album by IZZ, released in 1998. The tracks range from the progressive rock styles of groups such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, Yes, and King Crimson to Beatles-esque pop to ambient. One interesting aspect of the band is its use of two drummers on most tracks.
The title of the album appears in the lyrics of the song "Razor."
