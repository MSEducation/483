Indecent exposure is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of his or her body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from prohibition of exposure of genital areas, buttocks and female breasts. In some conservative countries[tpl]which|date=November 2012[/tpl] the exposure of any part of the female body is considered indecent. Not all countries have indecent exposure laws.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The applicable standard of decency is generally that of the local community, which is sometimes codified in law, but may also be based in religion, morality, or, in some justifications, on the basis of "necessary to public order".[tpl]cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 [/tpl] Indecent exposure sometimes refers to exhibitionism or to nudity in public and does not require a sexual act to be performed. If sexual acts are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered public indecency, which may be a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably, and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Overview==

What constitutes indecent exposure depends on the standards of decency of the community where the exposure takes place. These standards can vary from the very strict standards of modesty in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the Pirahã or Mursi where full nakedness is the norm.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Even within a community, what will be seen as indecent will also depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. For example, it would be a reasonable expectation to see a naked person on a designated nude beach. However, even on a nude beach it may not be expected to witness explicit sexual activity.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The standards of decency have varied over time. During the Victorian era, for example, exposure of a woman's legs was considered indecent in much of the Western world. As late as the 1930s, both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s. Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Although the phenomenon widely known as flashing, involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and bra, may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/state_statutes2.html#criminal_code |title=Criminal Code |author= |date= |work=Topical Index: State Statutes 2 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl]

The motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, sexually arousing, or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include mooning.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Breastfeeding in public does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland.[tpl]cite web| authorlink = Queen's Printer for Scotland | title = Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005. | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/20050001.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-22 [/tpl] In the United States, the federal government and the majority of states have enacted laws specifically protecting nursing mothers from harassment by others. Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Europe==

In Scandinavia, people generally have a relaxed attitude towards nudity, and genitals and nipples are usually not considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed.[tpl]cite book |title=Modern Welfare States: Scandinavian Politics and Policy in the Global Age |page=309 |first=Eric S. |last=Einhorn |first2=John |last2=Logue |year=2003 |location=Oxford |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=0-275-95044-1 [/tpl]
In Barcelona, public nudity is a recognised right. Working with the associations Addan (which defends the right to nudity) and Aleteia, the Barcelona Council published the "Tríptic de Barcelona", which codifies the right.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.addan.com/ |title=Addan.

===United Kingdom===

In England and Wales, the offence of "indecent exposure" and other sexual offences were replaced by the more specific and explicit Sexual Offences Act 2003. The Act does not mention nudity as such and is worded so as not to apply to skinny dipping, nude sunbathing, and similar activities. Current laws apply only to genital  exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, but this is extremely rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_5#pt1-pb18-l1g66 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 |author=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl]The National Archives (2010). Equality Act 2010. Retrieved on 2012-01-26 from http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents.  Public nudity can also be punished as "disorderly behaviour" under the Public Order Act 1986.http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/
The situation in Northern Ireland is complex as some parts of this Act apply but others do not and the Assembly is considering new legislation.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Canada==

In Canada, s.173 of the Criminal Code[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html |title=Criminal Code of Canada, 1985, Part V, Sexual Offences |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] prohibits "indecent acts".Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part - Indecent acts - 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age, so the decision of what state of undress are "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that nude sunbathing is not indecent.R. v. Beaupré, 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "mere nude sunbathing is not of sufficient moral turpitude to support a charge for doing an indecent act." Also, streaking is similarly not regarded as indecent.R v Springer, 1975, Saskatchewan District CourtR v Niman, 1974, Ontario Provincial Court Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order" and in view of the public.  The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.R v Benolkin, 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "this offence is not aimed at conduct such as swimming nude at an isolated beach, even where the accused misjudges the loneliness of the beach".
Toplessness is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in Guelph, Ontario while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.[tpl]Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = [/tpl] The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.District of Maple Ridge v. Meyer, 2000 BCSC 902 (CanLII). See esp. para 49 and 55. Since then it is legal for a female to walk topless in public anywhere in Ontario, Canada.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Australia==

In Australia, it is a summary or criminal offence in some States and Territories to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person')Regina v Eyles Matter No 60305/97 (1997) NSWSC 452 (1 October 1997) in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, obscenity, intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state Acts, are as follows:

===Definition of person===

It has been noted that a term such as "exposing one's person" relates back to the United Kingdom Vagrancy Act 1824 and Evans v Ewels (1972)Evans v Ewels 1972 1 WLR 671. where it was said that the word "person" was a genteel synonym for "penis" or "vagina". However, the word "person" in s5 of the (NSW) Summary Offences Act is not limited to "penis" or "vagina". This term is used in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. In the other States the exposure refers to one's genital area. In a sense, therefore, the term "person" can be wider than "genitalia". In Regina v Eyles Matter No 60305/97 (1997) NSWSC 452 (1 October 1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with Obscene Exposure under the Summary Offences Act 1988 - Section 5.

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is often used to charge sex workers with vague crimes such as "public indecency" or being a "public nuisance" without explicitly defining what these consist of.See Prostitution in India
