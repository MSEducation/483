[[Airsoft]]

CATEGORIES: Leisure activities, Airsoft, Japanese inventions

Airsoft is a sport in which participants eliminate opponents by hitting each other with spherical non-metallic pellets launched via replica firearms called Airsoft guns.
Gameplay varies in style and composition but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, C.Q.B., field, military simulations (MilSim), or historical reenactments and speedball. Combat situations on the battlefield may involve the use of military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations.

==History==

Airsoft originated in Japan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airsoft-guns-gas-electric-spring.com/airsoft-history-background-of-air-soft-guns.html |title=soft dik History and Its Background | Where did Air Soft Come From? |publisher=Airsoft-guns-gas-electric-spring.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03[/tpl] then spread to Hong Kong and China[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prcguns.co |title=天朝狩猎论坛 PRCguns |publisher=PRCguns.co |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13[/tpl]  in the late 1970s. Airsoft guns spread to the UK in the 1980s with a company called LS. The guns were sold in pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of  firing pellets. Airsoft equipment was designed to closely emulate real guns. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft guns have been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the hobby is enjoyed by all ages. One of the first airsoft fields was Firefight Airsoft Games [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firefight.co.uk/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991128054201/http://www.firefight.co.uk/ |archivedate=1999-11-28 |title=Firefight Airsoft Games[/tpl] which was set up in 1996 in the United Kingdom,at Mapledurham Estate Reading. Airsoft replicas are produced globally, with the majority being manufactured in Asia.

==Ballistics and velocity==

On impact, the pain an airsoft pellet causes is directly related with the kinetic energy it has. This energy is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity. It is important to note that doubling the velocity of a pellet will quadruple its kinetic energy. As a reference value, a 0.20 gram pellet traveling at [tpl]convert|100|m/s|ft/s[/tpl] has one joule of kinetic energy.
A typical set of velocity for sanctioned fields in the United States on guns may be [tpl]convert|350|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl] for Close Quarters Battle (CQB), [tpl]convert|400|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl] for outdoor play with fully automatic AEG's, [tpl]convert|450|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl] for semi-auto "DMR" style AEG's, and [tpl]convert|550|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl] for bolt action sniper rifles, for a 0.20 g pellet.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
The maximum effective range of field-legal airsoft weapons is around [tpl]convert|90|m|yd|abbr=on[/tpl] with a highly upgraded sniper rifle replica.[tpl]cite web|title=Airsoft GI - G700F Sniper Rifle Accuracy And 250 Feet Range Test|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSyWYj5CK8|accessdate=10 January 2014[/tpl]
Most airsoft guns used for field play will have an effective range of around 43–67 metres, depending on the intended role of the weapon.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Most Airsoft guns are capable of shooting from [tpl]convert|50|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|125|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on[/tpl], although it is also possible to purchase upgraded internals for some Airsoft guns that will enable the gun to shoot up to [tpl]convert|76|m|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|90|m|abbr=on[/tpl]
In California a common limit for CQB is [tpl]convert|350|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl].[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Airsoft guns that have high muzzle velocities tend to have a longer range and better accuracy.
On the other hand, a lower muzzle velocity means that the pellet will glide more, which is a good thing for indoor skirmishes. Outside however, the wind may change its trajectory. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
In Ireland, Italy, and Japan the energy limit for Airsoft guns is one joule regardless of the type of game play.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Some UK sites allow semi-automatic-only weapons up to [tpl]convert|120|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl] and bolt action rifles up to [tpl]convert|500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Northern Ireland has a maximum velocity of [tpl]convert|100|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl] with 0.20 g pellets, without regard to the type of weapon.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
The ballistics of spring or electric powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy.
In spring/electric airsoft weapons, barrel length does not have a significant effect on accuracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
The "sweet spot" for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around 400–500 mm.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Past that length, added barrel length will not improve accuracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length.
For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel (ceteris paribus).[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500 mm, if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer inner barrel in an AEG or spring powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter.
Gas powered replicas function more like real firearms. In gas powered guns, added barrel length (to an appropriate degree) will result in significantly increased velocity, and increased accuracy to a degree.
Tighter bore barrels will increase velocity because there will be less space between the pellet and the barrel for the air to escape through. Most stock airsoft guns have 6.05-6.08 mm bore barrels, but best performance is usually seen with "tightbore" barrels, which are 6.01 to 6.04 in diameter. However, the tighter the bore, the more likely the chance of a pellet jam, and subsequently, tightbores need to be cleaned regularly. It is generally agreed upon that a good quality 6.01-6.02 mm barrel will provide the highest muzzle velocity, while a good quality 6.03 mm barrel will provide the best compromise between power, accuracy, and ease of maintenance. The actual accuracy difference between a 6.01 mm barrel and a 6.03 mm barrel is debatable.

==Safety==

===Eye and face protection===

The minimum safe level of gear required to participate in most games includes a pair of ANSI Z87.1 (impact-rated) goggles to protect participants' eyes. Traditional prescription glasses and sunglasses, or goggles not designed specifically for use with airsoft or paintball guns, may break or shatter upon being struck causing injury to the eye. 
Full-face masks (similar to, and often including paintball masks) cover the rest of the face, protecting vulnerable parts such as teeth. Some airsoft masks are made with mesh screens, though theoretically, a pellet could shatter on impact, and its fragments could pass through the mesh and into the eye.[tpl]cite web|title=Durability Test - Mesh Masks.|url=http://www.ampair.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.102|publisher=Amplified Airsoft|accessdate=4 November 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101119095244/http://ampair.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.102| archivedate= 19 November 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Masks with mesh screens are often preferred by players who wear prescription eyeglasses as they increase ventilation and reduce the amount of condensation on the lenses, while the lenses provide additional protection against possible fragments that might penetrate the mesh.
While masks offer superior protection, they can interfere with the use of scopes, and in lesser quality masks, condensation inside the goggles can reduce visibility. During very hot days the masks can also cause the player to overheat more quickly due to the lack of air circulation. Some players have mounted small battery-powered fans (designed for computer circuit boards) on the masks to improve ventilation and reduce or avoid condensation.[tpl]cite web|title=Air Cooled Paintball Mask|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Air-Cooled-Paintball-Mask/|accessdate=September 2013[/tpl]

===Community safety precautions===

Rules such as a maximum muzzle velocity and engagement distance guidelines are used by different groups. Some organizations have created common safety rules and guidelines.[tpl]cite web|author=09:45 AM |url=http://www.texasairsoft.org |title=Texas Airsoft Organization |publisher=Texasairsoft.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13[/tpl]
When not actively playing, some fields require "barrel bags", also known as barrel "socks" or barrel "condoms", to be placed over the muzzle of the gun. The magazine is usually removed as well, and the gun fired to clear the chamber. Most fields also require players to leave their guns set to the safety position when they are not shooting, a practice common when using real firearms. In certain countries, such as the Philippines, additional special rules have been adopted.Filipino Airsoft Players (FAP) Standard Rules and Regulations: http://www.filairsoft.com/forum/showthread.php?t=821

==Legal restrictions==

thumb|right|Classic Army M15A4 (M4 replica) Automatic Electric Gun. Airsoft is legal in most parts of the world. Some countries have specific restrictions,Complete list of Airsoft legal requirements in the world such as maximum muzzle velocity and "unrealistic" colouring to distinguish them from actual firearms. They are legal throughout the U.S, but restrictions do exist in certain cities such as Chicago, Illinois and Detroit, Michigan. The states of New Mexico, New Jersey, and Michigan, however, do not allow airsoft guns to be used or handled publicly because of the resemblance to real firearms. They may be used on private property with the consent of the owner. The Customs and Border Protection FAQ page states that Airsoft guns are considered look-alike firearms which require the special blaze orange marking.[tpl]cite web | url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/809 | title=CBP FAQ | accessdate=1 August 2010 |work= [/tpl] In October 2013, a 13-year-old boy carrying an Airsoft replica assault rifle was shot and killed by deputies in Santa Rosa, California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20131022/articles/131029886?title=Deputies-shoot,-kill-13-year-old-boy-in-Santa-Rosa |title=Authorities investigate fatal deputy-involving shooting of 13-year-old Santa Rosa boy |publisher=The Press Democrat |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom, some Airsoft guns are classified as realistic imitation firearms or RIFs. The sale, manufacture, or importation of these is restricted to activities that are exempted or have been granted a defense by the Home Office under the Violent Criminal Reduction Act (VCRA). Airsoft skirmishing has been granted a specific defense against the requirements of the act, and a skirmisher as defined under British law is allowed to sell, import and manufacture airsoft replicas, and convert them into RIFs. Purchase from other vendors is not illegal, but the sale is - the crime is committed by the vendor. All are still however crimes under British law that can be defended successfully (in theory - this has never been tried to date) by fulfilling criteria suggested in the guidelines accompanying the VCRA. The most accepted method of proving entitlement to the defense is to be a member of a site that holds public liability insurance. An association set up by UK retailers, called the United Kingdom Airsoft Retailers Association (UKARA), in line with the Home Office documentation accompanying the VCRA, recommends that an airsoft site only give membership to a player who has played at least three games over a period of no less than two months. It is also possible for a member of an insured reenactment society or the film or television industry to purchase an Airsoft replica (this is a full exemption from, and not a defense against, the VCRA).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=0&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=0&activetextdocid=2922622&versionNumber=1 | title=Specific defences applying to the offence under s. 36 | accessdate= 20 January 2011[/tpl] The right to buy a RIF (or IF) is still reserved for individuals age 18 and over.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/18 | title=UKARA Q&A | accessdate=13 March 2008 |work= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080307184716/http://www.ukara.org.uk/node/18| archivedate= 7 March 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Many retailers are part of the UKARA scheme and will only sell to players who are registered to a skirmish site that fulfills the desired requirements for the VCRA Defense. Retailers must renew their membership annually. The Association has a database of registered players from approved airsoft sites that is updated on a regular basis by the sites themselves. Retailers who are members of UKARA have access to the database and can check for proof of eligibility for purchasing access to the player's site membership number before selling any RIFs to private individuals.
Other schemes have been attempted to allow Airsoft players to comply with the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, but none have been successfully implemented. The use or possession of any kind of replica weapon—loaded or otherwise—in a public place without valid reason is an offense under UK law and can carry heavy penalties.BASC - Airguns and Replicas[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
As an alternative to RIFs, IFs (Imitation Firearms, including 'two tones') are available. These are RIFs which have been painted a bright colour (excluding white/silver/gold) over 51% of the item. No specific defense is required for purchase of IFs. They cannot be bought by those under the age of 18, and offer an entry to those unable to claim a defence under the VCRA.
In Canada, there are laws pertaining to airsoft importing. All airsoft guns that are bought in Canada are legal, but when importing it, the gun has to have between 366FPS and 500FPS to pass inspection at customs, otherwise the gun will be shipped back or destroyed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/air_gun-arme_air-eng.htm |title=Air Guns - Royal Canadian Mounted Police |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2013-10-24[/tpl]

===Orange-tipped airsoft gun muzzles===

Although airsoft guns in the United States are generally sold with a 6mm (0.24in.) or longer orange tip on the barrel in order to distinguish them from real firearms, this is not in fact required by federal law. Manufacturers and importers may cite Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which stipulates that "no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm" without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction (part 272.2, formerly part 1150.2). However, section 272.1 (formerly 1150.1) clearly indicates that these restrictions shall not apply to "traditional B-B, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of compressed air, compressed gas or mechanical spring action, or any combination thereof." [tpl]cite web|title=Title 15 Part 272 Marking of toy, look-alike and imitation firearms|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=c7b9dfa1176c8b46b470823f9207f044&ty=HTML&h=L&n=15y1.2.2.8.9&r=PART|work=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=3/8/13[/tpl] This language clearly exempts airsoft guns from these requirements, placing them in the same category as bb-guns, pellet, air, and paintball, none of which are conventionally sold or used with an orange tip, and many of which bear as much resemblance to real firearms as airsoft guns do.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Another difficulty the airsoft-playing community has with a legal or mandatory requirement for any orange-tipped or bright-colored paint on all airsoft guns is that lawless elements could deliberately paint real guns to have orange-tips or make them look like airsoft guns and thus cause more harm or alarm for the public.

===Lasers===

In certain countries use of lasers of any kind is illegal, thus it is very important to note prior to buying any laser pointers or scopes with integrated lasers, one should always check the country/state laws and ensure that they are not breaking the law.[tpl]cite web | url=http://airsoft-supplies.com/blog/illegal-airsoft-items.html | title=Tactical Airsoft Supplies - Illegal Items [/tpl]

==Airsoft guns==

The guns used in airsoft are typically imitation firearms. They have a mechanism for shooting projectiles 6 mm or 8 mm in diameter.
Airsoft guns are classified according to their operating principle, which can be spring loaded, electric (battery powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or "AEG's"), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as "GBBs"). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart grenade launchers which fire a projectile spray of 6mm pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed gas propellant (i.e. green gas, propane, or CO2). There is also a type of airsoft gun known as a "PolarStar" or P* for short. They are powered by a single high-pressure air tank and a battery pack to power the internal "fire control unit". These guns are often known for their high and adjustable ROF or "rate of fire".
Newer guns, especially those made in Taiwan and China, have metal internal and external parts. Japan has specific rules about producing airsoft guns with metal parts. A typical airsoft gun is noticeably lighter than its "real steel" counterpart due to the use of aluminum, alloy, and plastic, though some have weights in them for a more realistic feel. Smoke caps, as well as noise amplifiers, are available for certain airsoft guns to add realism.
Gas handgun magazines usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in a standard capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the feeding chute. Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have an battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.
It is common for owners to "tech" or modify their guns. The standard gearboxes are made to Tokyo Marui specs[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013[/tpl] and have upgrade parts available. It is also possible to perform DIY modifications.

===Hop-Up===

The "Hop-Up" system, which is installed in most stock airsoft rifles and in some pistols, is used to add extra range by putting backspin on the pellets, causing them to rise upward as they are fired. A small rubber nub protrudes into the top of the barrel through a small hole, and it catches the top of the pellet as it flies past. Adjusting the Hop-Up makes the nub protrude lower or higher into the barrel, so that backspin is increased or reduced. Ideally, the Hop-Up should be adjusted so that the pellets fly as far as possible in a straight line without curving upward too far, or dropping to the ground too quickly. Hop-Up does decrease the velocity of the projectile (a gun firing [tpl]convert|340|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl] with the hop fully unwound can drop as low as [tpl]convert|300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl]). However, players looking for the highest level of power should keep hop-up at normal settings as with the hop up working, the BB spin helps to reduce latent surface area, which, in turn, reduces drag on the projectile. Ease and location of adjustment varies by gun design; some weapons provide controls that can be adjusted quickly during gameplay, while others may require partial dis-assembly.

===Airsoft projectiles===

Most airsoft guns fire round plastic pellets, usually white, but black "invisible" or phosphorescent are common as well. The pellets mostly range from 0.12 to 0.48 g. However, the most popular weights for AEGs (automatic electric guns) and GBB* (Gas Blow-Back guns) are 0.20 g and 0.25 g (*These weights are generally specified for pistols whose muzzle velocity ranges from approximately [tpl]convert|250|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on[/tpl]). Heavier rounds (0.30–0.43 g) are typically used in long range and sniper applications since they are more stable in flight and less easily deflected by wind. They are usually bought in bags or bottles of 2,000 to 5,000, but other sizes are available, such as a 250,000 round (65 kg) package of tournament grade pellets. Pellets are typically 6 mm in diameter, though 8 mm pellets do exist. Pellets vary by diameter depending on the brand (e.g. Matrix pellets are 5.95 mm in diameter and let less air slip past it during travel through the barrel, whereas Crosman pellets are 5.93 mm in diameter and allow more air to slip past during travel through the barrel and allow for less velocity). Mid to high end AEGs use 0.20–0.30 g pellets, while sniper rifles work best with 0.30 g or higher. Pellets are used for the majority of play, although foam balls may be used to represent M203 styled grenade launcher shells.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arniesairsoft.co.uk/news2/14826 |title=New S-Thunder CO2 powered foam ball 40 mm grenade |publisher=Arniesairsoft.co.uk |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-03[/tpl]

==Terminology==

===Basic Terms===

AEG = Automatic Electric gun - Electric-powered airsoft replicas that typically use a rechargeable battery to drive an electric motor, which cycles an internal piston/spring assembly in order to launch pellets. Automatic and semi-automatic operation is possible which gives these replicas the popular name "automatic electric guns" or AEGs. These replicas often attain muzzle velocities between 150 and 500 ft/s (60 to 150 m/s) and rates of fire of between 100 and 2000 rounds per minute. They are the most commonly used and widely available type of airsoft gun.
Gearbox - The mechanical workings of AEGs/AEPs. The gearbox houses the necessary components used to operate airsoft replicas (Gears, Trigger Assembly, Piston, Spring, etc.). Gearboxes can be made of either metal or plastic, with quality and durability in direct proportion to materials used.
AEP = Automatic Electric Pistols - AEPs where first introduced by Tokyo Marui in 2005 with their Glock 18C (followed later by a Beretta 93R model). They were the first handguns to incorporate an electric powered system, similar to an AEG, that is capable of fully automatic operation.
In cold weather, AEPs are often considered as a better sidearm than a gas powered pistol, due to gases like CO2 and propane requiring heat in order to vaporize. 
CQB = Close Quarters Battle - This is normally used for indoor environments games such as old warehouses, specified playing fields, training facilities, etc. The weapons are usually in their carbine, or smaller, form to remain maneuverable in tight-quarters environments such as a staircase or hallway.
EBB = Electric Blowback - An AEG that incorporates a faux-recoil system, which works in tandem with an AEG's gearbox. This system simulates the kick of the bolt in a real firearm. Quality of performance differs from manufacturer to manufacturer.
GBB = Gas blow back -  Usually in the form of handguns, gas blow back guns are powered by Green Gas, Co2, or Propane. These airsoft replicas are named due to their unique effect of realistic recoil, using the gas to propel the piston forward, instead of using gears, as a traditional system would.
MOUT = Military Operations in Urban Terrain - The United States military term for urban warfare is UO an abbreviation for Urban Operations. "MOUT" has been replaced by "UO" although the term "MOUT" is still in use in some areas of the world.
NBB = Non-Blow Back - Usually in the form of handguns, non-blow back guns are normally run by Co2 capsules, and are very gas efficient. As the name implies, these models do not have a realistic recoil effect, but are more cost effective, by utilizing less gas to operate.
Operation - Usually a very large event consisting 30 or more people with a planned scenario and occurrence of events. These can cost from a basic operation of $25 or a large military simulation operation costing about $230.
Skirmish - "Skirmish" or "Skim" is a small airsoft event usually with a small entrance fee of $20 or less. People in attendance usually range from 4 to 20 people in total for skirmishes or pickup games.
LPEG = Low Power/Price Electric Gun - Lower quality replicas, usually containing plastic gears and/or gearboxes. Internal and External quality is usually very poor.
MPEG = Medium Priced Electric Gun - Medium quality replicas, usually containing metal gears and/or gearboxes. Internal and External quality differs from manufacturer to manufacturer.
TB = Tight Bore - A special inner barrel, designed to further increase outwards airflow, thus increasing FPS.
DMR = Designated Marksman's Rifle.
mAh = Milliamp Hours - How long a battery can supply 1 milli Amp at the rated voltage per second.
Lipo = Lithium-ion polymer battery - Almost perfect charge/discharge efficiency ~ 99.8%
Cheapsoft/Chinasoft = Chinese made airsoft replicas.
ACM = All China Made -Same meaning as Cheapsoft.

===Gear Terms===

BDU (Battle dress uniform) - This Often referred to as "BDUs", "Camouflage", "Cammies", etc. Basically the clothing that you wear to designate your nationality, country that you are representing, or team color.
Hi-Cap (High Capacity Magazine)- A "Hi-Cap" is a magazine with a wheel on the bottom that can hold about 400-600 rounds and when the wheel is spun, more BBs can be loaded into the magazine. Usually not intended for Mil-Sim events and they are normally not allowed.
Mid-Cap (Mid-Capacity Magazine) - A "Mid-Cap" Magazine can normally hold from 70-150 BBs, and must be loaded with a speed loader, or specialized loading rod. These magazines are most commonly used, as they are allowed at most large airsoft events and operations, and provide a slight more realistic experience than high capacity magazines.
Low-Cap (Low-Capacity Magazine)- "Low-Caps" or "Real-Caps" usually only hold the same amount of ammunition as a real firearm. These are most commonly used in high-profile airsoft events where military simulation is at the top of their lists of priorities.
Mil-Sim (Military simulation) -  A "Mil-sim" is a style of airsoft where the simulation of the military simulation aspect of the recreational sport is highly demanded of you, with the proper attire, weapon setup, and gear.
Magazine - The magazine commonly referred to as a "mag". A magazine is an often metal, sometimes plastic, device that holds the BBs needed to fire the airsoft replica.
