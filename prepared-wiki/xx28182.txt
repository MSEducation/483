[[Sisera]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people, Book of Judges

Sisera (Hebrew: סיסרא) was commander of the Canaanite army of King Jabin of Hazor mentioned in the [tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:2-3|NIV[/tpl] of the Hebrew Bible. After being defeated by Barak, Sisera was killed by Jael, who hammered a tent peg into his temple.
During the period of the Israelite Judges, Sisera commanded nine hundred iron chariots and oppressed the Israelites for twenty years from Harosheth Haggoyim, a fortified cavalry base.[tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:2|NIV[/tpl] After the prophetess Deborah persuaded Barak to face Sisera in battle, Barak, with an Israelite force of ten thousand, defeated Sisera at the Battle of Mount Tabor on the plain of Esdraelon. Judges 5: 20 says that "the stars in their courses fought against Sisera," and the following verse implies that the army was swept away by the river Kishon.[tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:10-13|NIV[/tpl] After the battle, there was peace for forty years.[tpl]bibleverse||Judges|5:31|NIV[/tpl]
After losing the battle, Sisera fled to the settlement of Heber the Kenite in the plain of Zaanaim, where he was received by  Jael, Heber's wife.  Jael received him into her tent with apparent hospitality and "gave him milk...in a lordly dish."  Jael promised to hide Sisera and covered him with a rug, but after he fell asleep, Jael drove a tent peg through his temple with a mallet.  The blow was so forceful that the peg pinned his head to the ground. [tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:18-21|NIV[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Judges|5:25-27|NIV[/tpl] 
Sisera's name has been considered Philistine, Hittite, Hurrian, or Egyptian (Ses-Ra, "servant of Ra"). The Israeli scholar Adam Zertal identifies Sisera with the sea people called Shardana (or Sherden), arguing that Sisera came from the island of Sardinia.http://www.jpost.com/ChristianInIsrael/Features/Article.aspx?id=180213" Long time archaeological riddle solved, Canaanite general was based in Wadi Ara, Judy Siegel-Itzkovich, 07/02/2010, Jerusalem Pot.

==Sisera in later legend==

According to Jewish legend, because Sisera's mother cried a hundred cries when he did not return home, a hundred blasts are blown on the shofar on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.The Complete Artscroll Machzor for Rosh Hashanah, page 584.  The Talmud states that the descendants of Sisera studied Torah in Jerusalem and even taught children there.Sanhedrin 96b, Gittin 57b.
According to the Midrash, Sisera engaged in sexual intercourse with Jael seven times, but because she was attempting to exhaust him in order to kill him, her sin was for Heaven's sake and therefore praiseworthy.Tamar Kadari, "Jael Wife of Heber The Kenite: Midrash and Aggadah," Jewish Women
Also according to the Midrash,Yalḳuṭ Shim'oni on [tpl]bibleverse||Judges|4:3|NIV[/tpl] Sisera had previously conquered every country against which he had fought.  His voice was so strong that, when he called loudly, the most solid wall would shake and the wildest animal would fall dead. Deborah was the only one who could withstand his voice and not be stirred from her place. Sisera caught fish enough in his beard when bathing in the Kishon to provision his whole army, and thirty-one kings followed Sisera merely for the opportunity of drinking, or otherwise using, the waters of Israel. According to B.Gittin, the descendants of Sisera were teachers of the young in Jerusalem.Jewish Encyclopedia
