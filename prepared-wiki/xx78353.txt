[[Flag of Zambia]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Zambia, Flags of Africa

The flag of Zambia, adopted on October 24, 1964, is green with an orange coloured eagle in flight over a rectangular block of three vertical stripes, colored, from left to right: red, black and orange.  The placement of the eagle and block of stripes at the flag's fly is notable as most emblems and devices on flags are placed at center or at the hoist.  The colors used in the flag of Zambia are rich in symbolism.  Green stands for the nation's lush flora, red for the nation's struggle for freedom, black for the Zambian people, and orange for the land's natural resources and mineral wealth. Additionally, the eagle flying above the colored stripes is intended to represent the people's ability to rise above the nation's problems.Zambia at Flags of the World
The Zambian flag was slightly modified in 1996.  The shade of green used in the 1964 flag was replaced with a brighter and lighter green and the eagle was slightly altered so as to be more like the one used in the Zambian coat of arms.
The flag was designed by Mrs Gabriel Ellison, OGDS, MBE, who also designed the national coat of arms and many of Zambia's stamps.
