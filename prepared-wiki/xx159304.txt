William's Doll is a 1972 children's picture book by Charlotte Zolotow about a boy who wants a doll even though dolls typically are considered a toy only for girls. His father, uncomfortable with William's request, tries giving William toys the father considers more gender-appropriate, such as a basketball and a train set; while William enjoys these toys, he continues to ask for a doll. Eventually, the boy's grandmother fulfills the request, explaining to the father that William will use the doll to practice being a good father.
Zolotow has explained that although she is a feminist and appreciates that many feminists enjoyed the book's message, her inspiration was more from personal observations about her husband's early attempts to bond with the couple's son, Stephen, and about how men of the time period missed out on some of the pleasures of being closely involved with their children's development. She observed, for example, that by always exiting the room during diaper changes, her husband missed their son's first smile.Charlotte Zolotow on the origins of William's Doll, charlottezolotow.com (retrieved June 1, 2007)
The book often is used in the United States for lessons on gender roles, stereotypes, or general anti-bias education. For example, the journal article "'William's Doll' Revisited" was on a study comparing reactions of fourth-grade students in 1975 and in 2000.[tpl]cite journal |last=Greever |first=Ellen A. |last2=Austin |first2=Patricia |last3=Welhousen |first3=Karyn |date=March 2000 |title='William's Doll' Revisited |journal=Language Arts |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=324â€“30 |format=PDF |issn=0360-9170 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |url=http://www.csun.edu/~bashforth/305_PDF/305_ME2/305_Language&Gender/WilliamsDollRevisitedAcross20Years_LA2000.pdf |laysource=Education Resources Information Center |laysummary=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ603237&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ603237 |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= [/tpl]
