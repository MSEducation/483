CATEGORIES: Football in the Philippines, Sports in the Philippines

Association football is an emerging sport in the Philippines, played by amateur and professional Filipino football clubs. The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body of international football in the country.
Football is a popular sport among the country's Southeast Asian neighbors, yet it is overshadowed by basketball, which is the most popular sport in the Philippines.  However, football has a long history in the archipelago, dating back to more than 100 years ago when Paulino Alcántara became the first Filipino and Asian player to play for a European club.  He made his debut as a striker at the age of 15 at Barcelona, which made him the club's youngest and second highest goalscorer behind Lionel Messi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/3/16/5514714/lionel-messi-barcelona-goal-scoring-record-video|title=Lionel Messi becomes Barcelona's all-time leading scorer|author=Woosley, Zach|publisher=SB Nation|date=16 March 2014|accessdate=26 March 2014|quote=Lionel Messi is officially the greatest goal scorer in FC Barcelona history.

To promote and revive the sport, some international and local football clubs helped the Philippines. FIFA also assisted the country by building and upgrading facilities including the creation of the PFF headquarters in 2009. As well, the establishment of the United Football League (UFL) and the National Men's Club Championship to provide more local competitions.
The Philippines national football team is the representative of men's international football for the Philippines. They won the Far Eastern Games once (in 1913) and became a two-time Philippine Peace Cup champion (in 2012 and 2013). The Philippines women's national football team, representing women's international football in the Philippines, achieved a third-place (bronze) finish at the 1985 Southeast Asian Games.
There are many stadiums that can be found in the Philippines like the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila which is the national stadium of the country. It is also the home stadium of the Philippine football team. Meanwhile, the Panaad Stadium in Bacolod is the secondary venue for the Philippines.

==History==

===Introduction===

Around 1895,[tpl]refn|Three years before the Americans fought the Spaniards in Manila Bay.|group="nb"|name="american"[/tpl] football was introduced in the Philippines by English sportsmen.  In addition, some Filipinos sent to college in Hong Kong and China returned home and taught their friends a little bit about the game of football.  Within a year, there were two or three football clubs established in Manila. In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers,[tpl]cite book|last=Trask|first=David|year=1996|title=The War with Spain in 1898|url=http://books.google.co.id/books?id=2f0Gf0DQfmUC&redir_esc=y|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9429-5|page=24|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl] and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties,[tpl]cite book|last=Offner|first=John|year=2004|title=McKinley and the Spanish–American War|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|volume=34|issue=1|pages=50–61|issn=0360-4918|doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2004.00034.x|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl] the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War.[tpl]cite book|last=Beede|first=Benjamin|year=1994|title=The War of 1898, and U.S. Interventions, 1898-1934: An Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.co.id/books?id=48g116X9IIwC&hl=fil|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140219151741/http://books.google.co.id/books?id=48g116X9IIwC&hl=fil|archivedate=19 February 2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-5624-7|page=120|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl] They damaged every ship in Manila Bay, This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans.[tpl]cite journal|title=Historic Ships on a Lee Shore|journal=Sea History|date=August 2013|issue=144|pages=12–13|publisher=National Maritime Historical Society[/tpl] When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any moment, or to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits.  After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909).
On 15 October 1907, the first official football match was held in Manila, with the celebration of the opening of the Philippine Assembly. The trophy, a silver cup donated by 27th President of the United States William Howard Taft, was won by the Sandow Athletic Club.  Soon, more clubs were formed.  In 1910, the Bohemian Sporting Club was organized and began to train football players. In 1920, the Circulo Social Deportivo was established and produced a football team. To further propagate the love of the sport and to regulate soccer championship contests, all football teams within the city banded themselves together and organized the Philippine Amateur Football Association in 1907 (now the Philippine Football Federation), and held its first championship in 1921 with Bohemian Sporting Club as champions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/philchamp.html|title=Philippines - List of Champions|author=Schöggl, Hans|publisher=RSSSF|date=23 December 2013|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]
On 25 February 1912, Paulino Alcántara was the first Filipino and Asian footballer to play for a European club. Alcántara made his debut for Barcelona at the age of 15 against Català Sporting Club, where he scored his first hat-trick.[tpl]refn|The term "hat-trick" is used when a player scored three goals in a game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lawsofthegameen.pdf|title=Laws of the Game 2009/2010|author=IFAB|publisher=FIFA|format=PDF|page=130|date=July 2009|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]|group="nb"|name="hat-trick"[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/centenary-of-paulino-alcantaras-debut|title=Centenary of Paulino Alcántara’s debut|author= Tomàs, Manel|publisher=Futbol Club Barcelona|date=24 February 2012|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] Alcántara remains the youngest player to play or score for the club.

Alcántara only played once for the Philippines that finished second in the tournament.[tpl]refn|The second match was abandoned after China converted a penalty kick that marked the score 4–0 which later the Philippines goalkeeper punched the Chinese scorer and fighting ensued, lead in to the withdrawal of the Philippines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/fareastgames17.html|title=Third Far Eastern Games 1917 (Tokyo)|author=Jovanovic, Bojan|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]|group="nb"|name="far"[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/86874/paulino-alcantara-barcelonas-timeless-wonder/|title=Paulino Alcántara – Barcelona’s Timeless Wonder|author=Simolo, Gemma|publisher=Inside Spanish Football|date=16 November 2013|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100711-280353/Paulino-Alcantara-RP-legend-in-world-football|title=Paulino Alcantara: RP legend in world football|author=Burgos, Nestor|publisher=Philippine Inquirer|date=11 July 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100712193026/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100711-280353/Paulino-Alcantara-RP-legend-in-world-football|archivedate=12 July 2010|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl] He also made some appearances in other national teams, including Catalonia and Spain.

===Revival===

====Help from foreign countries and clubs====

There have been four projects accepted by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),[tpl]refn|In English, International Federation of Association Football.|group="nb"|name="fifa"[/tpl] to build and upgrade football facilities in the Philippines.  In the first project, approved in August 2000, FIFA built six technical centers on Iloilo, Laguna, Negros Occidental, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga, and Agusan del Sur, with a total budget of ₱ [tpl]nts|458046[/tpl] (~€ [tpl]nts|7500[/tpl] or ~$ [tpl]nts|10000[/tpl]).  The next project, in December 2006, constructed the headquarters of the PFF in Pasig.  Its third project was to upgrade the pitch in the Rizal Memorial Stadium to an artificial turf from August to September 2012, but it was discontinued because Philippine Football Federation President Mariano Araneta said that conducting the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup in Manila would lessen the expenses of the PFF in the event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/rizal-stadium-to-host-inaugural-paulino-alcantara-peace-cup|title=Rizal Stadium to host inaugural Paulino Alcantara Peace Cup|author=Decena, Karl|publisher=InterAKTV/TV5|date=31 August 2013|accessdate=23 December 2013[/tpl] FIFA's final project was to build a technical center in Bukidnon, which includes a natural grass pitch, dormitories, changing rooms, lecture rooms and offices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=phi/development-activities/goal/index.html|title=Goal Programme - Philippine Football Federation - 2001 |work=FIFA.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|accessdate=23 December 2013[/tpl]
A number of foreign countries and clubs have offered to help promote and popularise the sport within the country. In 2010, the German Football Association (DFB) recommended the services of former Rwanda U-17 coach Michael Weiß as coach of the "Azkals", a nickname for the national team, after Dan Palami's three-day visit in Frankfurt. The DFB gave the Philippine Football Federation a grant of € [tpl]nts|500000[/tpl] (~₱ 31 million or ~$ [tpl]nts|11000[/tpl]).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.inquirer.net/sports/articles/New-Azkals-coach-gets-PFF-nod.html |title=New Azkals coach gets PFF nod |author=Tupas, Cedelf|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2013 [/tpl] However, after three years as a head coach, Weiß was no longer part of the Azkals after the PFF's year-end evaluation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/pff-officially-parts-ways-with-former-azkals-coach-hans-michael-weiss|title=PFF officially parts ways with former Azkals coach Hans Michael Weiss|author=Decena, Karl|publisher=InterAKTV/TV5|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/sports/football/news/homegrown-azkals-chieffy-caligdong-sacapano-stunned-by-weiss-departure|title=Homegrown Azkals Chieffy Caligdong, Sacapano stunned by Weiss departure|author=Sacamos, Karlo|author=Sports Interactive Network Philippines|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]

====Development of international and local competitions====

In 2008, the Filipino Premier League (FPL) was established as the top-flight competition in the Philippines. It featured eight clubs from the National Capital Region. The PFF also planned a Visayas and Mindanao FPL tournament in 2009, which never materialized. The first and only champion of the league, which was cancelled at the season's conclusion, was the Philippine Army.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/phil09.html|title=Philippines 2008/09|author=Hans Schöggl|publisher=RSSSF|date= |accessdate=25 December 2013[/tpl]
Shortly after the dissolution of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the interest of Filipinos in football. The Alliance entered into discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/the-football-alliance-philippine-footballs-miracle-workers|title=The Football Alliance: Philippine football’s miracle workers|author=Jamlang, Josue|publisher=InterAKTV/TV5|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ufl.ph/about-us/|title=About United Football League|author= |publisher=UFL Philippines|date= |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱ 150 million (~$ 3.3 million or ~€ 2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/entertainment/2011/09/20/football-matches-air-aktv-starting-october-180415|title=Football matches air on AKTV starting October|author=Jarloc, Glaiza|publisher=Sun Star Philippines|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=25 December 2013[/tpl] The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/remaining-ufl-matches-in-june-to-air-live-over-aksyontv|title=Remaining UFL matches in June to air live over AksyonTV|author=Decena, Karl|publisher=InterAKTV/TV5|date=31 May 2013|accessdate=25 December 2013[/tpl]
By 2015 or 2016, the PFF seeks to establish a professional national football league, which would be supported by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and FIFA. It was proposed that the league will have at least 10 clubs—four clubs in Luzon, four in Visayas, and two in Mindanao. The United Football League is currently the de facto top tier national league in the country. As the league is under the National Capital Region Football Association, the league cannot be officially defined as a national league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ph.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/thepassionatefan/pff-announces-national-football-league-launch-2015-2016-094223380.html|title=PFF announces national football league to launch in 2015 or 2016|author=Guerrero, Bob|publisher=Yahoo!

The Philippine Football Federation has not been able to organize a national tournament since 2007, when they staged the PFF Centennial Men's Open Championship due to "variety of reasons".

==United Football League==

In the 2014 season, the United Football League is divided into two divisions, with nine teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. The 2009 UFL Cup was created to determine the composition of teams that will be playing in the league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/514590/six-matches-kick-lbc-ufl-cup|title=Six matches kick off LBC-UFL Cup|author= |publisher=Philippine Star|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=1 February 2014[/tpl] However, new teams that did not participate in the 2009 UFL Cup will automatically join Division II.[tpl]refn|New teams that joined the 2014 season are Ceres and Manila Jeepney which are both in Division II.|group="nb"|name="ufl"[/tpl]
Division I clubs will face their opponents three times (formerly twice) for league play, which it will run a month longer than the previous year's league. Meanwhile, the rule will not apply for Division II teams, as they retain the double round robin format.  After the home and away fixtures are concluded, a league table will be used to determine which teams will be champions, relegated, or promoted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ufl.ph/upcoming-2014-league-brings-exciting-additions-to-ufl/|title=Upcoming 2014 League Brings Exciting Additions To UFL|author= |publisher=UFL Philippines|date=4 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/ufl-introduces-longer-format-for-upcoming-league-competition|title=UFL introduces longer format for upcoming League competition|author=Decena, Karl|publisher=InterAKTV/TV5|date=5 January 2014|accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
When a club places first in the standings in Division I, they will become champions. However, if they rank first in the standings in Division II, they will be the winners and will receive promotion to Division I.  If the team places last in the table in Division I, they will be automatically relegated to Division II.  Every season, the UFL regularly organizes a promotion-relegation playoff match, in which the second rank team in Division II and the eighth-placed team in Division I will face off in a two legged match. The winning team will be determined by an aggregate score.  If the Division I team wins the series, they will retain their place in Division I. If the Division II team wins, they will receive a promotion to Division I and the losing team will be relegated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ph.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/thepassionatefan/ufl-league-kicking-off-big-changes-163016594.html|title=UFL League kicking off with big changes|author=Guerrero, Bob|publisher=Yahoo!
