Leonard Carey (25 February 1887 â€“ 11 September 1977) was a British-born character actor who very often played butlers in Hollywood films of the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. He was also active in television during the 1950s. He is perhaps best known for his role as "Dusty" in the film, Moon Over Her Shoulder (1941).
Carey is also remembered for his role as the beach hermit, Ben, in Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940). Other memorable appearances included roles in The Awful Truth (1937), Heaven Can Wait (1943), Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951), Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952), and Thunder in the East (1953).
Carey retired from acting in the late 1950s. He died at the age of 90 in Woodland Hills, California, USA.
