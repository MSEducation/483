==Behavior system==

GameSalad provides a graphical user interface for describing the rules and the behavior of game objects, called Actors, without knowledge of programming or scripting languages.[tpl]cite web | url=http://matthewdavid.sys-con.com/node/1177016 | title=Using Game Salad for Rapid Game Development for the iPhone | publisher=SYS-CON Media[/tpl] Behaviors are components of an actor that can either instantaneously or persistently affect the actor depending on rules that compose them. The application comes with a library of behaviors (for movement, changing attribute states, affecting collision, saving, etc.) that can be inserted into rules and other behavior groups to create new behavior.
