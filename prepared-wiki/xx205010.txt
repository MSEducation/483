On 15 May 2011, the Hammers were finally relegated from the Premier League after a 3–2 defeat at Wigan Athletic. As Wigan equalised at 2–2, a light aircraft flew above Wigan's ground, the DW Stadium, trailing a banner which read "Avram Grant – Millwall Legend".[tpl]Cite news|title=Legend picture|url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/15/article-1387348-0C149C2400000578-29_634x286_popup.jpg|newspaper=Mail Online|location=London|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=16 May 2011[/tpl] Grant was sacked after the game. The plane had been hired by Millwall supporters from the fans' website House of Fun, celebrating Grant's failure to prevent West Ham's relegation. Their relegation meant they met the Lions in the 2011–12 Football League Championship. On 17 September 2011, their first league meeting for seven years ended in a 0–0 draw at The Den. The return fixture and most recent game between the two sides was on 4 February 2012. West Ham beat Millwall 2–1 at Upton Park, despite having their captain Kevin Nolan sent off after only nine minutes for serious foul play. West Ham's goal scorers were Carlton Cole and Winston Reid. Millwall's goal was by Liam Trotter.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16778942 | title=West Ham 2–1 Millwall | work=BBC Sport | date=4 February 2012|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl]
