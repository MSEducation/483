Shawme-Crowell State Forest is a Massachusetts state park located in Sandwich in Barnstable County. The park is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-south/shawme-crowell-state-forest.html |title=Shawme-Crowell State Forest |work=MassParks |publisher=Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs |accessdate=July 15, 2013[/tpl] Originally the forest was much larger but the creation of Camp Edwards made the forest the small size that it is today. For a good comparison of size, the modern-day Massachusetts Military Reservation takes up the land that was once part of the forest.
