Air Belgium was a charter airline that operated from Brussels, Belgium, in the 1980s and 1990s. The airline flew international services on jet aircraft.

==History==

In May 1979, the tour operator Sun International, the charter airline Abelag AVIATION and HERFURTH combined as one company. They began flight operations with leased aircraft, a Boeing 707 and a Boeing 737-200, flying out from Brussels to destinations around the Mediterranean.
The following year, in 1980 after the withdrawal of one of their business partners, the company was renamed AIR BELGIUM, in the hope that the company would receive more passengers from neighbouring countries.
The original livery of Air Belgium's later B757 / B737-400 / B737-300 aircraft consisted of black AIR BELGIUM titles and yellow and red striping (on the white upper and side fuselage / tail), Black-Yellow-Red being the colours of Belgium's national flag.
In 1998, Air Belgium was sold to Airtours. By the end of October 2000, Air Belgium had ceased all flight operations.

==Goals==

In 1990, in addition to European/Mediterranean destinations, destinations such as Fort Lauderdale, the United States and Mexico were made possible. From November 1991, flights to Palma de Mallorca were added. Soon after, scheduled flights were chartered to locations such as Alicante, Faro, Funchal, Malaga, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Tenerife.
