Chulym ([tpl]lang-ru|Чулым[/tpl]) is a river in the endorheic drainage basin of Lake Chany in the southeastern part of the West Siberian Plain in Russia. The river is 392 km in length, with a drainage basin of 17 900 km². 
The Chulym is formed by several tributaries in the Toyskoye Zaymishche (Russian: Тойское Займище) and Troshinskoye Zaymishche (Russian: Трошинское Займище) swamps north of Baraba Steppe, some 100 km northwest of Novosibirsk, at an elevation of 150 meters. The river flows over the Baraba Steppe in a southwesterly direction, and flows through the lakes of Sargul (Russian: Саргуль, 34,6 km²) and Uryum (Russian: Урюм, 84,1 km²), before it finally terminates, at 106 meters elevation, in Malyye Chany Lake (Russian: Малые Чаны – Little Chany), which is connected to Lake Chany through a short strait.
In its lower reaches the river is some 30 m wide and 5 m deep. Its main tributaries are the Suma River (left), and the Kargat River (right).
In its upper course is the town of Chulym, named after the river. Here the river is crossed by the Trans-Siberian Railway and the M51 highway.
The Chulym is frozen over from November to April/May.
