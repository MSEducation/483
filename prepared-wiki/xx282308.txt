==Artwork==

Burguieres owns Gallery Burguieres, a single-artist gallery located at 736 Royal Street in the New Orleans French Quarter founded in 2011 with her mother Janice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/directory/location.php?locationID=1595|title=New Orleans Online|accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl] She has stated the gallery was made possible by the response to her work when she had solo shows in various galleries. She has also cited the Gallery as a place to share her vision and connect with others. In addition to seeing success from her paintings, Burguieres also creates clothing under the label Cocoally and holds the patent on a smoking wish-granting trinket called a Wish Dog.Â 
In November 2013, Burguieres opened a second New Orleans-based shop, called Cocoally. It is located at 630 St. Ann Street in the New Orleans French Quarter.
Burguieres paints almost exclusively animals, citing a reverence for animals' beauty and innocence as a key inspiration in life and painting. In interviews she has been outspoken about her passion for the vegan lifestyle and a commitment to animals, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.
Starting in 2011, she has gained increasing popularity for her Notebook Series collection of paintings, which are done on large canvases painted to look like looseleaf paper. She still produces new works in this series, as well as continuing a series of intricate, colorful works she calls Chromatic. These two distinct series and styles are tied together by the subject matter of animals, and Burguieres's signature attention to line, detail, and expressive form remains identifiable throughout.[tpl]cite web|url=http://artsneworleans.org/events_framed/for_artist/11125|title=Arts New Orleans|accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl]
