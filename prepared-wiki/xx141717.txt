==Plot details==

An American woman, Patricia Carroll (Powers), arrives in London to get married to her lover Alan Glentower (Kaufmann). Before she gets married, Patricia wants to pay her respects to Mrs. Trefoile (Bankhead), the mother of her deceased fianc√© Stephen (who died in an automobile accident several years ago) at a secluded house on the edge of an English village. Mrs. Trefoile is fanatically religious, and it soon becomes apparent she blames Patricia for her son's death. Patricia reveals to her that she wasn't actually going to marry Stephen, who, it turns out, committed suicide. With the help of her two married servants Harry (Vaughn) and Anna (Joyce), Mrs Trefoile holds Patricia captive in an attempt to cleanse her soul. After Mrs. Trefoile kills Harry, she then tries to kill Patricia. Patricia is rescued by Alan. Anna finds Harry's body, and finally Mrs Trefoile falls dead with a knife in her back - presumably put there by Anna.
