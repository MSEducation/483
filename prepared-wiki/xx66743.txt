Edward Burleson (December 15, 1798 – December 26, 1851) was a soldier, general, and statesman in the state of Missouri, the Republic of Texas, and later the U.S. state of Texas.

==Early life==

Known as the "Old Indian Fighter", Burleson was a veteran of the War of 1812 and had served in the Missouri and Texas militias.  In October 1835 he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Texas army and served under Stephen F. Austin in the opening stages of the Texas Revolution.  During the Siege of Béxar, Burleson served as the second-in-command to Gen. Austin, and in November, 1835 he was elected Major General of Texas Volunteers and took command of the Volunteer army besieging San Antonio de Béxar and received the surrender of Mexican general Martín Perfecto de Cos.  In March, he was appointed a Colonel of Texas Regulars and led the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Runaway Scrape and at the Battle of San Jacinto.
Burleson continued to serve in the army after the war and was eventually promoted Brigadier General of Texas Regulars.

==Political service==

He served as vice president of the Republic of Texas in President Sam Houston's second term from 1841 to 1844.  He was  a Presidential candidate in the Texas Presidential Election of 1844, but was defeated by Anson Jones. Although he served under Sam Houston, the two despised each other.
Burleson was also involved in the Mexican-American War after Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846.
The location of his grave in Austin is in what later became the Texas State Cemetery.
