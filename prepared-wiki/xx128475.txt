==History==

Initially named North Eastern Penitentiary, USP Lewisburg was one of four federal prisons to open in 1932.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/marsh/lewisburg_tour/preindustrial_lewsiburg.htm |title=Learning from Lewisburg: 4.

USP Lewisburg had a prison riot in November 1995. Although started by only 10 prisoners, more than 20 visited the hospital that November 1, with one prisoner recording multiple broken bones and missing teeth. Many were sentenced to the "hole" and over 400 were transferred.[tpl]cite web|title=Update about what happened at Lewisburg Penitentiary|url=http://www.prisonactivist.org/pipermail/prisonact-list/1995-November/000083.html|accessdate=2009-07-21|author=prisondesk@igc.apc.org |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926232919/http://www.prisonactivist.org/pipermail/prisonact-list/1995-November/000083.html|archivedate=2007-09-26[/tpl] This incident thrust the Penitentiary into the national spotlight, where it gained much of its current notoriety.

USP Lewisburg was the focus of the 1991 Academy Award-nominated documentary Doing Time: Life Inside the Big House by filmmakers Alan and Susan Raymond. The one hour long film described conditions inside the prison and focused specifically on the abolition of parole within the federal system and the fears held by many prisoners about re-integrating into society upon their eventual release from prison.Doing Time: Life Inside The Big House (1991).
As of 2009, USP Lewisburg was designated as a Special Management Unit intended to house the most violent and disruptive inmates in the Bureau of Prisons.  Although most USP Lewisburg inmates are housed in the SMU, there remains a work cadre of approximately 200 inmates in the USP's general population.

==Funding Issues==

In July 2008, correction officers at USP Lewisburg expressed concerns about underfunding. Over the past four years, union leaders and other officials had been lobbying in an attempt to quell staff reductions and cutting costs. The Federal Bureau of Prisons had proposed $143 million in possible spending cuts, including not replacing vehicles and equipment, eliminating overtime, reducing corrections officer training, and a possible cut in officer staff positions.[tpl]cite web|last=Morton |first=Gina |url=http://dailyitem.com/0100_news/x691294718/Prison-workers-say-theyre-at-risk |title=Prison workers say they're at risk |publisher=Dailyitem.com |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2009-07-21[/tpl] Under such conditions, many of the Correctional Officers expressed concerns about their own safety.
