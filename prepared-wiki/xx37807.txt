Their two derivatives, assuming they exist, are reciprocal, as the Leibniz notation suggests; that is:
This is a direct consequence of the chain rule, since
Geometrically, a function and inverse function have graphs that are reflections, in the line [tpl]nowrap|1=y = x[/tpl]. This reflection operation turns the gradient of any line into its reciprocal.

==Examples==

At [tpl]nowrap|1=x = 0[/tpl], however, there is a problem: the graph of the square root function becomes vertical, corresponding to a horizontal tangent for the square function.

==Additional properties==

==Higher derivatives==

The chain rule given above is obtained by differentiating the identity [tpl]nowrap|1=x = f −1(f(x))[/tpl] with respect to x. One can continue the same process for higher derivatives. Twice differentiating the identity with respect to x obtains,
or replacing the first derivative using the formula above,
Similarly for the third derivative:
or using the formula for the second derivative,
These formulas are generalized by the Faà di Bruno's formula.
These formulas can also be written using Lagrange's notation.  If f and g are inverses, then

==Example==

so that
which agrees with the direct calculation.
