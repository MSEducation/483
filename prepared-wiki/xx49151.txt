A profound influence in contemporary Malayalam literature, Kadammanitta had played a vital role in reviving interest in poetry by holding thousands of recital sessions in every nook and corner of Kerala in the 1970s and 80s. His work has been widely appreciated for its force, energy and folk touch and gave a mass appeal and popularity making poetry enjoyable even to commonman. Ramakrishnan’s close association with literary and cultural luminaries, which included M. Govindan, Ayyappa Paniker, M. V. Devan, P. K. Balakrishnan, O. N. V. Kurup, Kavalam Narayana Panicker and K. V. Thampi, helped him in the endeavour to give a popular image to Malayalam poetry recital. He had recited his fiery works at thousands of venues all over the state, besides editing a poetry journal Kerala Kavitha that attempted to take the essence of poetry from the academic cloisters to the realms of everyday life.[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=xnZLAQAAIAAJ |title=Indian Literature, Volume 50 |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |year=2006 |pages=14-15[/tpl]
