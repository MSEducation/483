The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established in c. 79 CE on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Historically, Manchester was in Lancashire, although areas of Cheshire, south of the River Mersey were incorporated into the city during the 20th century.The first to be included, Wythenshawe, was added to the city in 1931. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century.
Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution,[tpl]cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3[/tpl] and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.[tpl]cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|publisher=Carnegie Publishing| location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5[/tpl] • [tpl]cite book|title=Tradition in Action.

In 1877, Manchester Town Hall was built and in 1894 the Manchester Ship Canal opened; which at the time was the longest river navigation canal in the world, which in turn created the Port of Manchester linking the city to sea. Manchester's fortunes decreased in the subsequent years after WW2 due to deindustrialisation. However, investment in the last two decades, spurred by the 1996 Manchester bombing – which was the largest bomb ever detonated in peacetime Britain – spearheaded extensive regeneration of Manchester, particularly in the city centre.
The city is notable for its architecture, culture, music scene, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. Known through time as a hotbed for radical ideas, Manchester was the site of the world's first railway station and is where scientists first split the atom, and developed the first stored-program computer. Manchester is also regarded as the birthplace of Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom, and both capitalism and communism.http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/04/mainsection.stuartjeffries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels began to write the Communist Manifesto at Chetham Library, the oldest public library in the English-speaking world.http://www.chethams.org.uk/

==History==

===Etymology===

The name Manchester originates from the Ancient Roman name Mamucium, the name of the Roman fort and settlement, generally thought to be a Latinisation of an original Celtic name (possibly meaning "breast-like hill" from mamm- = "breast"), with later added Old English ceaster = "town" (which is derived from Latin castra = "camp" or "forts").[tpl]cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199609086.001.0001/acref-9780199609086|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-852758-6|accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl] An alternative theory suggests that the origin is Brythonic mamma = "mother", where the "mother" was a river-goddess of the River Medlock which flows below the fort. Mam means "female breast" in Irish Gaelic and "mother" in Welsh.The Antiquaries Journal (ISSN 0003-5815) 2004, vol. 84, pp. 353–357

===Early history===

The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite the banks of the River Irwell.[tpl]cite book |first=Glynis |last=Cooper |title=Salford: An Illustrated History |publisher=The Breedon Books Publishing Company |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-455-8|page=19[/tpl] Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, General Agricola ordered the construction of a Roman fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) were protected from the Brigantes. Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.[tpl]cite book | title=Halloween: from Pagan Ritual to Party Night| url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195168969.do#.UmOl33CVPp8| last=Rogers| first=Nicholas| year=2003| page=18| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-516896-8| accessdate=7 November 2013[/tpl] A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in Castlefield. The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; the vicus, or civilian settlement, appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century.[tpl]cite book |last=Gregory |first=Richard (ed) |title=Roman Manchester: The University of Manchester's Excavations within the Vicus 2001–5 |page=190 |publisher=Oxbow Books |year=2007 |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84217-271-1[/tpl] By the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, the focus of settlement had shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and Irk.[tpl]cite book|title=Manchester: A History| last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|pages= 12, 15–24, 224|publisher=Carnegie Publishing|location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5[/tpl] Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent Harrying of the North.[tpl]cite book|title=A History of Manchester|last=Hylton|first=Stuart|year=2003|pages=1–10, 22, 25, 42, 63–67, 69|publisher=Phillimore & Co|isbn=1-86077-240-4[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Stockport: a History|last=Arrowsmith|first=Peter|year=1997|page=30|publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council|isbn=0-905164-99-7[/tpl]

Manchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282.[tpl]Cite book | title = Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40422&strquery=lancashire | last = Letters | first = Samantha | year = 2005 | page = 19 | publisher=British History Online | accessdate =5 May 2009[/tpl] Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the region's textile industry.[tpl]cite book | title=Lancashire, The Industrial and Commercial South| last=Pevsner| first=Nikolaus| year=1969| page=265| publisher=Penguin Books| location=London| isbn=0-14-071036-1[/tpl] Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen, and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in John Leland's words, "The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire." The cathedral and Chetham's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland's Manchester.
During the English Civil War, Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long lasting, Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals. He was a diligent puritan, turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.[tpl]cite book | title= Cromwell's major generals: godly government during the English Revolution | series= Politics, culture, and society in early modern Britain | author=Durston, Christopher | year= 2001 | publisher=Manchester University Press | location= Manchester | isbn= 0-7190-6065-6 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=Hw622QZHTcYC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22charles+worsley%22 | accessdate=5 May 2009[/tpl]
Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce.
In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill.

===Industrial Revolution===

Manchester's history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of Greater Manchester, south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,[tpl]cite book|author=McNeil, Robina|coauthors=Michael Nevell|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester|publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology|year=2000|isbn=0-9528930-3-7[/tpl] and later the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.[tpl]cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilisation | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760–1830[/tpl] Manchester was dubbed "Cottonopolis" and "Warehouse City" during the Victorian era. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term "manchester" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Manchester, n | encyclopaedia=Oxford English Dictionary |date=March 2009 | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Manchester | accessdate=4 May 2009 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's population.
Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.timelines.tv/index.php?t=0&e=12# | title = Timelines.tv Urban Slums | publisher=Timelines.tv|accessdate=2 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/03/031007_migrant_history_manchester_feature.shtml|title=Manchester: migrant city|last=Schofield|first=Jonathan|work=BBC Manchester:New Kids From The Bloc|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications|location=Aylesbury|year=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=3[/tpl] It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world." Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance.
 Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the world's first intercity passenger railway—the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down. In 1878 the GPO (the forerunner of British Telecom) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/1851to1880/1878.htm|title=Events in Telecommunications History|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=BT Archives|year=1878[/tpl]
The Manchester Ship Canal was built in 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running [tpl]convert|58|km|mi|0[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.aina.org.uk/aina_members/Directory-MSC.htm|title= Directory – MSC[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled ocean going ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canal's banks, just outside the borough, the world's first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park. Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.
A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819. The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 onward.
Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left-wing politics; being the subject of Friedrich Engels' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/bio/engels/en-1893.htm|title=Marx-Engels Internet Archive – Biography of Engels|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Marx/Engels Biography Archive|year=1893[/tpl] and when Karl Marx visited Manchester, they met at Chetham's Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.[tpl]cite book|title=Manchester: A history|last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|chapter=Chapter 9 England Arise!

At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: "What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow."[tpl]cite book|editor=Speake, Jennifer|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199539536.001.0001/acref-9780199539536-e-1383?rskey=viR3Pw&result=2376|accessdate=6 July 2007|year=2003|edition=4th|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-860524-2|quote=What Manchester says today, the rest of England says tomorrow[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web |url = http://archive.is/9H8B |title = Osborne: Our vision to make Manchester the creative capital of Europe |accessdate =4 May 2009 |last = Osborne |first = George |authorlink = George Osborne |date = 7 March 2007 |work=Conservative Party Website |publisher=Conservative Party |quote = The saying goes that what Manchester does today the rest of the world does tomorrow.[/tpl] •[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mmu.ac.uk/studyatmmu/manchesterlife/|title=Manchester Life|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University|year=2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080411200443/http://www.mmu.ac.uk/studyatmmu/manchesterlife/|archivedate=8 November 2007| quote= What Manchester does today, the world does tomorrow[/tpl] Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.
Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that "Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke". An American visitor taken to Manchester’s blackspots saw "wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments".[tpl]cite episode |title=Victoria and Her Sisters |series= A History of Britain |serieslink= A History of Britain (TV series) |credits= Simon Schama (presenter) |network= BBC One |airdate= 4 June 2002 |number=13[/tpl]
The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.

===Manchester Blitz===

Like most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the Second World War. For example, casting and machining expertise at Beyer, Peacock and Company's locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making; Dunlop's rubber works in Chorlton-on-Medlock made barrage balloons; and just outside the city in Trafford Park, engineers Metropolitan-Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe, and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the "Christmas Blitz" on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated [tpl]convert|467|long ton|t[/tpl] of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.[tpl]cite book | last= Hardy | first= Clive | title= Manchester at War | edition= 2nd | year= 2005 | location= Altrincham| isbn= 1-84547-096-6 | pages=75–99 | chapter= The blitz | publisher=First Edition Limited [/tpl] Manchester Cathedral was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.manchestercathedral.org/history/timeline | title= Timeline | accessdate=5 May 2009 | publisher=Manchester Cathedral Online | year= 2008[/tpl]

===Post-Second World War===

Cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime, and the exchange closed in 1968. By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK's third largest,[tpl]cite book|title=Manchester: an Architectural History|last=Parkinson-Bailey|first=John J|year=2000|page=127|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-5606-3[/tpl] • [tpl]cite book|title=Lancashire, The Industrial and Commercial South|last=Pevsner| first=Nikolaus|year=1969|page=267|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-071036-1[/tpl] and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.salford.gov.uk/milestones_v2.pdf |format=PDF| title= Salford Quays milestones: the story of Salford Quays | accessdate=5 May 2009 | publisher=Salford City Council | year=2005[/tpl] Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher's government after 1979. Manchester lost 150,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983.
Regeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the Metrolink, the Bridgewater Concert Hall, the Phones 4u Arena, and (in Salford) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays. Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city.
Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the Manchester Martyrs of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992. On Saturday 15 June 1996, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) carried out the 1996 Manchester bombing, the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows half a mile away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50 million, but this was quickly revised upwards.[tpl]cite book | title= A History of Manchester| first= Stuart | last=Hylton| year= 2003| pages=227–230 | publisher=Phillimore & Co | location= Chichester | isbn= 1-86077-240-4[/tpl] The final insurance payout was over £400 million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/3704943.stm | title= Panorama – The cost of terrorism | accessdate=5 May 2009 |publisher=BBC  | date= 15 May 2004[/tpl]

Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel.

==Government==

The City of Manchester is governed by the Manchester City Council. The earlier Greater Manchester County Council was abolished in 1986 so it is effectively a unitary authority. Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html|title=About the Core Cities Group|accessdate=9 July 2007|publisher=English Core Cities Group|year=2004 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070919035621/http://www.corecities.com/dev07/Introduction/about.html |archivedate = 19 September 2007[/tpl]
The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century, local government was largely provided by manorial courts, the last of which ended in 1846.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110211203737/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzm2n.htm|archivedate=11 February 2011|title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=9 July 2007|at=Places names – M to N[/tpl]
From a very early time, the township of Manchester lay within the historic or ceremonial county boundaries of Lancashire. Pevsner wrote "That neighbouring Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England". A stroke of a Norman baron's pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, it was Manchester, with its humbler line of lords, that was separated from Salford.[tpl]cite book|title=Tradition in Action. The historical evolution of the Greater Manchester County|last=Frangopulo|first=Nicholas|year=1977|publisher=EP Publishing|location=Wakefield|isbn=0-7158-1203-3[/tpl] It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of Salfordshire, which included the ancient parish of Manchester. Manchester later formed its own Poor Law Union using the name "Manchester". In 1792, Commissioners—usually known as "Police Commissioners"—were established for the social improvement of Manchester. Manchester regained its borough status in 1838, and comprised the townships of Beswick, Cheetham Hill, Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme. By 1846, with increasing population and greater industrialization, the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the "Police Commissioners". In 1853, Manchester was granted "city status" in the United Kingdom.
In 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became the county borough of Manchester, separate from the administrative/ceremonial county of Lancashire, and thus not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city from Lancashire, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the town where the Manchester Airport is located, was added to the City.

==Geography==

At [tpl]Coord|53|28|0|N|2|14|0|W|type:city[/tpl], [tpl]convert|160|mi|km|0[/tpl] northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines, a mountain chain that runs the length of northern England, and to the south by the Cheshire Plain. The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell, near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk, and is relatively low-lying, being between [tpl]convert|115|to|138|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite book|title=Manchester: A History|last=Kidd|first=Alan|year=2006|page=11|publisher=Carnegie Publishing|location=Lancaster|isbn=1-85936-128-5[/tpl] The River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchester's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world's first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool, the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/159631/the%20manchester%20coalfields.pdf|title=The Manchester Coalfields|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester|year=2001|format=PDF[/tpl]
The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The "Manchester City Zone", "Manchester post town" and the "Manchester Congestion Charge" are all examples of this.
For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. There is a mixture of high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around [tpl]convert|260|ha|acre|0[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|url= http://m2002.thecgf.com/venues/HPK/|title= Heaton Park|accessdate =20 July 2009|publisher=thecgf.com[/tpl] is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.

===Climate===

Manchester experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with warm summers and cold winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. The city's average annual rainfall is [tpl]convert|806.6|mm|in|2[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/manchester_airport.html|title=Manchester Airport 1971–2000 weather averages |accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Met Office|year=2001[/tpl] compared to the UK average of [tpl]convert|1125.0|mm|in|2[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html|title=UK 1971–2000 averages|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Met Office|year=2001[/tpl] and its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum, compared to the UK average of 154.4. Manchester however has a relatively high humidity level and this, along with the abundant supply of soft water, was one of the factors that led to the localisation of the textile industry in the area.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Wilfred|title=An Economic Geography of Great Britain|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1959|page=470|chapter=II[/tpl] Snowfalls are not common in the city, due to the urban warming effect. However, the Pennine and Rossendale Forest hills that surround the city to its east and north receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/roads-chaos-as-snow-sweeps-in-1058608|title=Roads chaos as snow sweeps in Manchester|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=Manchester Evening News|date=24 February 2005[/tpl] notably the A62 road via Oldham and Standedge, the A57 (Snake Pass) towards Sheffield,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highpeak.co.uk/hp/h_snakbd.htm|title=Peak District sightseer's guide – Snake Pass|accessdate=5 May 2009|publisher=High Peak|year=2002[/tpl] and the M62 over Saddleworth Moor.

==Demography==

Historically the population of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then the population began to decrease rapidly, due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.[tpl]cite journal | last = Shapely | first = Peter | year = 2002–3 | title = The press and the system built developments of inner-city Manchester | journal=Manchester Region History Review | volume = 16 | pages = 30–39 | publisher=Manchester Centre for Regional History | location = Manchester | issn = 0952-4320 | url = http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_16_shapely.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =22 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120210182610/http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_16_shapely.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2012 [/tpl]

Between the beginning of July 2011 and end of June 2012 (Mid-Year Estimate date), births exceeded deaths by 4,800. Migration (internal and international) and other changes accounted for a net increase of 3,100 people between July 2011 and June 2012.

==Economy==

The Office for National Statistics does not produce economic data for the City of Manchester alone, but includes four other metropolitan boroughs, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, in an area named Greater Manchester South, which had a GVA of £34.8bn. The economy grew relatively strongly between 2002 and 2012, where growth was 2.3% above the national average.http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/LEH%2004%20Leeds%20Economy.pdf Leeds.gov.uk With a GDP of $88.3bn (2012 est., PPP) the wider metropolitan economy is the third-largest in the United Kingdom. It is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
As the UK economy continues to recover from the downturn experienced in 2008-10, Manchester compares favourably to other geographies according to the latest figures. In 2012 it is showed the strongest annual growth in business stock (5%) of all the Core Cities.http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-329345 The city experienced a relatively sharp increase in the number of business deaths, the largest increase of all the Core Cities, however this was offset by strong growth in new businesses which resulted in a strong net growth.

==Landmarks==

Manchester's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city. Much of the architecture in the city harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England.Robinson (1986), The Architecture of Northern England, p. 153
Manchester also has a number of skyscrapers built during the 1960s and 1970s, the tallest of which was the CIS Tower located near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006; it is an example of the new surge in high-rise building and includes a Hilton hotel, a restaurant, and apartments. On its completion, it was the tallest building in the UK outside London, although an even taller building, the Piccadilly Tower, began construction behind Manchester Piccadilly station in early 2008 (a project in abeyance).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/Eastgate-Tower-sold|title=Inacity step out as Ballymore stride in with plans for Eastgate Tower|accessdate=3 February 2012|publisher=Manchester Confidential|year=2007[/tpl] The Green Building, opposite Oxford Road station, is a pioneering eco-friendly housing project, while the recently completed One Angel Square, is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world.[tpl]cite web |title=One Angel Square, Co-operative Group HQ |url=http://www.breeam.org/page.jsp?id=598 |work=breeam.org |accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl] The award-winning Heaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe, covering [tpl]convert|610|acre|ha[/tpl] of parkland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200073heaton/&documentID=1422|title=About Heaton Park|accessdate=23 November 2007|publisher=Manchester City Council|year=2005|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080315081308/http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=200073heaton/&documentID=1422 |archivedate = 15 March 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The city has 135 parks, gardens, and open spaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents.php?categoryID=200073|title=Manchester's parks and open spaces|accessdate=23 November 2007|publisher=Manchester City Council|year=2005[/tpl]
Two large squares hold many of Manchester's public monuments. Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert, Bishop James Fraser, Oliver Heywood, William Ewart Gladstone,and John Bright. Piccadilly Gardens has monuments dedicated to Queen Victoria, Robert Peel, James Watt and the Duke of Wellington.
