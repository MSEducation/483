[[Saturated fat]]

CATEGORIES: Fatty acids, Lipids, Nutrition

Saturated fat is fat that consists of triglycerides containing only saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between the individual carbon atoms of the fatty acid chain. That is, the chain of carbon atoms is fully "saturated" with hydrogen atoms. There are many kinds of naturally occurring saturated fatty acids, which differ mainly in number of carbon atoms, from 3 carbons (propionic acid) to 36 (hexatriacontanoic acid). 
Various fats contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, ghee, suet, tallow, lard, and fatty meats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/fat/saturatedfat.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Health and Human Services|title=Saturated fat|date=2014|accessdate=March 2014[/tpl] Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil and chocolate. Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, bacon and sausage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/top-food-sources-of-saturated-fat-in-the-us/|title=Top food sources of saturated fat in the US|date=2014|publisher=Harvard University School of Public Health|accessdate=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/FatsAndOils/Fats101/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp|title=Saturated fats|publisher=American Heart Association|date=2014|accessdate=March 2014[/tpl]

==Fat profiles==

While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups.  Lauric and myristic acids are most commonly found in "tropical" oils (e.g., palm kernel, coconut) and dairy products.  The saturated fat in meat, eggs, chocolate, and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids.
 
 

==Examples of saturated fatty acids==

Some common examples of fatty acids:

==Association with diseases==

Since the 1950s, it has been commonly believed that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, safflower, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fat/NU00262 | title = Dietary fats: Know which types to choose | publisher = Mayo Clinic | date = 2011-02-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-02 [/tpl]

===Cardiovascular disease===

A meta-analysis of 21 studies considered the effects of saturated fat intake and found that "Intake of saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of CHD (coronary heart disease), stroke, or CVD (cardiovascular disease).[tpl]cite pmid|20071648[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=Rajiv|coauthors=Warnakula, Samantha; Kunutsor, Setor; Crowe, Francesca; Ward, Heather A.; Johnson, Laura; Franco, Oscar H.; Butterworth, Adam S.; Forouhi, Nita G.; Thompson, Simon G.; Khaw, Kay-Tee; Mozaffarian, Dariush; Danesh, John; Di Angelantonio, Emanuele|title=Association of Dietary, Circulating, and Supplement Fatty Acids With Coronary Risk|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=18 March 2014|volume=160|issue=6|pages=398–406|doi=10.7326/M13-1788[/tpl]

Numerous systematic reviews have examined the relationship between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease:
While many studies have found that including polyunsaturated fats in the diet in place of saturated fats produces more beneficial CVD outcomes, the effects of substituting monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates are unclear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Astrup A, Dyerberg J, Elwood P, et al. |title=The role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: where does the evidence stand in 2010? |journal=Am.

===Cancer===

====Breast cancer====

A meta-analysis published in 2003 found a significant positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boyd NF, Stone J, Vogt KN, Connelly BS, Martin LJ, Minkin S |title=Dietary fat and breast cancer risk revisited: a meta-analysis of the published literature |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1672–1685 |date=November 2003|pmid=14583769 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6601314 |pmc=2394401[/tpl]  However two subsequent reviews have found weak or insignificant associations of saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hanf V, Gonder U |title=Nutrition and primary prevention of breast cancer: foods, nutrients and breast cancer risk. |journal=European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology |volume=123 |issue=2 |pages=139–149 |date=2005-12-01 |pmid=16316809 |doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2005.05.011 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lof M, Weiderpass E |title=Impact of diet on breast cancer risk. |journal=Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=80–85 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19125007 |doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e32831d7f22 [/tpl] and note the prevalence of confounding factors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Freedman LS, Kipnis V, Schatzkin A, Potischman N |title=Methods of Epidemiology: Evaluating the Fat–Breast Cancer Hypothesis – Comparing Dietary Instruments and Other Developments |journal=Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.) |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=69–74 |date=Mar–Apr 2008 |pmid=18391610 |pmc=2496993 |doi=10.1097/PPO.0b013e31816a5e02 [/tpl]

A systematic literature review published by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research in 2007 found limited but consistent evidence for a positive relationship between animal fat and colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite book | pages = 139 | title = Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective | chapter = 4- Food and Drinks | chapterurl = http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/downloads/chapters/chapter_04.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = World Cancer Research Fund | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-9722522-2-5 [/tpl]

====Ovarian cancer====

A meta-analysis of eight observational studies published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327914NC402_2 |author=Huncharek M, Kupelnick B |title=Dietary fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of 6,689 subjects from 8 observational studies |journal=Nutrition and Cancer |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=87–91 |year=2001 |pmid=11962260[/tpl]
However, a 2013 study found that a pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies observed no association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer risk.    Further analysis revealed that omega-3 fatty acids were protective against ovarian cancer and that trans fats were a risk factor.http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/73/8_MeetingAbstracts/148 This study revealed that histological subtypes should be examined in determining the impact of dietary fat on ovarian cancer, rather than an oversimplified focus on total fat intake.

====Prostate cancer====

Some researchers have indicated that serum myristic acid[tpl]cite journal |author=Männistö S, Pietinen P, Virtanen MJ, et al. |title=Fatty acids and risk of prostate cancer in a nested case-control study in male smokers |journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1422–8 |date=December 2003|pmid=14693732 |url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14693732[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Crowe FL, Allen NE, Appleby PN, et al. |title=Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and risk of prostate cancer in a case-control analysis nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=1353–63 |date=November 2008|pmid=18996872 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18996872[/tpl] and palmitic acid  and dietary myristic and palmitic[tpl]cite journal |author=Kurahashi N, Inoue M, Iwasaki M, Sasazuki S, Tsugane AS |title=Dairy product, saturated fatty acid, and calcium intake and prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of Japanese men |journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=930–7 |date=April 2008|pmid=18398033 |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2681[/tpl] saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.

===Bones===

Mounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.[tpl]cite pmid | 16365076[/tpl]

In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that "intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk. The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI 2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements.  Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH_docs/who_fao_expert_report.pdf | title = Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (WHO technical report series 916) | publisher = World Health Organization | author = Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation | year = 2003 | pages=81–94 | isbn = 92-4-120916-X | accessdate = 2011-03-11[/tpl]
Dr. German and Dr. Dillard of University of California and Nestle Research Center in Switzerland, in their 2004 review, pointed out that "no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/80/3/550.full | title = Saturated fats: what dietary intake? | last1 = German | first1 = J Bruce | last2 = Dillard | first2 = Cora J | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 550–559 |date=September 2004 | accessdate = 2010-12-27 | pmid = 15321792[/tpl]
Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.  Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits.  None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.[tpl]cite pmid | 21515106 [/tpl]

==Molecular description==

thumb|left|500px|A space-filling model of the saturated fatty acid myristic acid  It should be noted, as this is the defining factor of saturated fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogens bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the myristic acid molecule (there are 13 carbons in the tail, 14 carbons in the entire molecule).
Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are  portrayed as intersections between two straight lines.  "Saturated," in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogens bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the Octet Rule.  This also means that only single bonds (sigma bonds) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.
