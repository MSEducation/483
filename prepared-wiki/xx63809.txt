==History==

===1935–1950===

The Reserve Bank of India was founded on 1 April 1935 to respond to economic troubles after the First World War.Cecil Kisch: Review "The Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank of India" by K. N. Raj. In: The Economic Journal. Vol. 59, No. 235 (Sep., 1949), PP. 436–438, p. 436.It began according to the guidelines laid down by Dr. Ambedkar. The bank was set up based on the recommendations of the 1926 Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, also known as the Hilton–Young Commission."Reserve Bank of India: Platinum Jubilee (PDF)". RBI.org.in. 2010. Retrieved on 15 April 2012. The original choice for the seal of RBI was The East India Company Double Mohur, with the sketch of the Lion and Palm Tree. However it was decided to replace the lion with the tiger, the national animal of India.  The Preamble of the RBI describes its basic functions to regulate the issue of bank notes, keep reserves to secure monetary stability in India, and generally to operate the currency and credit system in the best interests of the country. The Central Office of the RBI  initially established in Calcutta (now Kolkata), but was permanently moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1937. The RBI also acted as Burma's central bank, except during the years of the Japanese occupation of Burma (1942–45), until April 1947, even though Burma seceded from the Indian Union in 1937. After the Partition of India in 1947, the Bank served as the central bank for Pakistan until June 1948 when the State Bank of Pakistan commenced operations. Though originally set up as a shareholders’ bank, the RBI has been fully owned by the Government of India since its nationalization in 1949.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/briefhistory.aspx |title=History |publisher=RBI |date=1935-04-01 |accessdate=2010-08-20[/tpl]

===1950–1960===

In the 1950s the Indian government, under its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, developed a centrally planned economic policy that focused on the agricultural sector. The administration nationalized commercial banksBeth Anne Wilson und Geoffrey N. Keim: India and the Global Economy in Business Economics, January 2006, S.29. and established, based on the Banking Companies Act of 1949 (later called the Banking Regulation Act), a central bank regulation as part of the RBI. Furthermore, the central bank was ordered to support the economic plan with loans.Narenda Jadhav, Partha Ray, Dhritidyuti Bose, Indranil Sen Gupta: The Reserve Bank of India’s Balance Sheet: Analytics and Dynamics of Evolution, November 2004, S.. 16.

===1960–1969===

As a result of bank crashes, the RBI was requested to establish and monitor a deposit insurance system. It should restore the trust in the national bank system and was initialized on 7 December 1961. The Indian government founded funds to promote the economy and used the slogan "Developing Banking". The government of India restructured the national bank market and nationalized a lot of institutes. As a result, the RBI had to play the central part of control and support of this public banking sector.

===1969–1985===

In 1969, the Indira Gandhi-headed government nationalized 14 major commercial banks. Upon Gandhi's return to power in 1980, a further six banks were nationalized. The regulation of the economy and especially the financial sector was reinforced by the Government of India in the 1970s and 1980s.Ananya Mukherjee Reed: Corporate Governance Reforms in India in Journal of Business Ethics, Volume 37, Number 3 / May, 2002, p. 253. The central bank became the central player and increased its policies for a lot of tasks like interests, reserve ratio and visible deposits.Sunil Kumar, Rachita Gulati: Did efficiency of Indian public sector banks converge with banking reforms? in Int Rev Econ (2009) 56:47–84, p. 47-48. These measures aimed at better economic development and had a huge effect on the company policy of the institutes. The banks lent money in selected sectors, like agri-business and small trade companies.Panicos O. Demetriades, Kul B. Luintel: Financial Development, Economic Growth and Banking Sector Controls: Evidence from India. in The Economic Journal. Vol. 106, No. 435 (March 1996), pp. 359–374, p. 360.

===1985–1991===

A lot of committees analysed the Indian economy between 1985 and 1991. Their results had an effect on the RBI. The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research and the Security & Exchange Board of India investigated the national economy as a whole, and the security and exchange board proposed better methods for more effective markets and the protection of investor interests. The Indian financial market was a leading example for so-called "financial repression" (Mackinnon and Shaw).Sunil Kumar, Rachita Gulati: Did efficiency of Indian public sector banks converge with banking reforms? in Int Rev Econ (2009) 56:47–84, p. 48.

New guidelines were published in 1993 to establish a private banking sector. This turning point should reinforce the market and was often    called neo-liberal.Ananya Mukherjee Reed: Corporate Governance Reforms in India in Journal of Business Ethics, Volume 37, Number 3 / May, 2002, p. 257. The central bank deregulated bank interests and some sectors of the financial market like the trust and property markets.Raghbendra Jha, Ibotombi S. Longjam: Structure of financial savings during Indian economic reforms in Empirical Economics (2006) 31:861–869, p.862. This first phase was a success and the central government forced a diversity liberalisation to diversify owner structures in 1998.Sunil Kumar, Rachita Gulati: Did efficiency of Indian public sector banks converge with banking reforms?'' in Int Rev Econ (2009) 56:47–84, p. 49,
The National Stock Exchange of India took the trade on in June 1994 and the RBI allowed nationalized banks in July to interact with the capital market to reinforce their capital base.

In order to curb the fake currency menace, RBI has launched a website to raise awareness among masses about fake notes in the market.www.paisaboltahai.rbi.org.in provides information about identifying fake currency.[tpl]cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/RBI-launches-website-to-explain-detection-of-fake-currency/articleshow/14742791.cms | title=RBI launches website to explain detection of fake currency | date=8 July 2012 | agency=Times of India[/tpl]
On January 22, 2014; RBI gave a press release stating that after March 31, 2014, it will completely withdraw from circulation all banknotes issued prior to 2005. From April 1, 2014, the public will be required to approach banks for exchanging these notes. Banks will provide exchange facility for these notes until further communication. The Reserve Bank has also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers. From July 1, 2014, however, to exchange more than 10 pieces of `500 and `1000 notes, non-customers will have to furnish proof of identity and residence to the bank branch in which she/he wants to exchange the notes.
This move from the Reserve Bank is expected to unearth black money held in cash. As the new currency notes have added security features, they would help in curbing the menace of fake currency.

===Developmental role===

The central bank has to perform a wide range of promotional functions to support national objectives and industries. The RBI faces a lot of inter-sectoral and local inflation-related problems. Some of this problems are results of the dominant part of the public sector.Samarjit Das, Kaushik Bhattacharya: Price convergence across regions in India in Empirical Economics (2008) 34:299–313, S. 312.

==Policy rates and reserve ratios==

===Bank Rate===

RBI lends (against approved securities) to the commercial banks through its discount window to help the banks meet depositor’s demands and reserve requirements for long term. The Interest rate the RBI charges the banks for this purpose is called bank rate. If the RBI wants to increase the liquidity and money supply in the market, it will decrease the bank rate and if RBI wants to reduce the liquidity and money supply in the system, it will increase the bank rate. The Bank Rate has lost its significant as a monetary policy tool as the central bank presently signals stance through changes in repo, the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from RBI. The Bank Rate, which is the standard rate at which the RBI buys or re-discount bills of exchange or other commercial paper, is presently used as a penal rate which the banks have to pay for their failure to meet the mandatory Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-02-14/news/31059431_1_repo-rate-bank-rate-cash-reserve-ratio As of 29 jan, 2014, the bank rate was 9.00%.

===Reserve requirement cash reserve ratio (CRR)===

Every commercial bank has to keep certain minimum cash reserves with RBI. Consequent upon amendment to sub-Section 42(1), the Reserve Bank, having regard to the needs of securing the monetary stability in the country, RBI can prescribe Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for scheduled banks without any floor rate or ceiling rate,  the enactment of this amendment, in terms of Section 42(1) of the RBI Act, the Reserve Bank could prescribe CRR for scheduled banks between 5% and 20% of total of their demand and time liabilities. RBI uses this tool to
increase or decrease the reserve requirement depending on whether it wants to effect a
decrease or an increase in the money supply. An increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) will make it mandatory on the part of the banks to hold a large proportion of their deposits in the form of
deposits with the RBI. This will reduce the size of their deposits and they will lend less.
This will in turn decrease the money supply.
The current rate is 4.00%..
-25 basis points cut in Cash Reserve Ratio(CRR) on 17 September 2012, It will release Rs 17,000 crore into the system/Market.
The RBI lowered the CRR by 25 basis points to 4.25% on  30 October 2012, a move it said would inject about 175 billion rupees into the banking system in order to pre-empt potentially tightening liquidity.
The latest CRR  is 4%

===Statutory Liquidity ratio (SLR)===

Apart from the CRR, banks are required to maintain liquid assets in the form of gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts the bank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities.The latest SLR as on 14/12/13 is 23%
In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling
of eligible securities by central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash
reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they
can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government
securities are traded at market related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open
market operations in the more recent years.
Generally RBI uses three kinds of selective credit controls:
Direct credit controls in India are of three types:
