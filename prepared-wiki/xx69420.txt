</ref> exchange rates of the [[eurozone]] countries were frozen and the value of the euro, which then superseded the ECU at par, was thus established.
In 1999, ERM II replaced the original ERM. The Greek and Danish currencies were part of the new mechanism, but when Greece joined the euro in 2001, the Danish krone was left at that time as the only participant member.  A currency in ERM II is allowed to float within a range of ±15% with respect to a central rate against the euro. In the case of the krone, Danmarks Nationalbank keeps the exchange rate within the narrower range of ± 2.25% against the central rate of EUR 1 = DKK 7.460 38.
EU countries that have not adopted the euro are expected to participate for at least two years in the ERM II before joining the eurozone.

==Current status of the ERM II==

On 1 May 2004, the ten National Central Banks (NCBs) of the new member countries became party to the ERM II Central Bank Agreement. The national currencies themselves were to become part of the ERM II at dates to be agreed.
The Estonian kroon, Lithuanian litas, and Slovenian tolar were included in the ERM II on 28 June 2004; the Cypriot pound, the Latvian lats and the Maltese lira on 2 May 2005; the Slovak koruna on 28 November 2005.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2005/html/pr051128.en.html |title=European Central Bank |publisher=European Central Bank |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] The currencies of the three largest countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 (the Polish złoty, the Czech koruna, and the Hungarian forint), the two countries which joined on 1 January 2007 (the Bulgarian lev, and the Romanian leu) as well as the currency of Croatia, which joined the EU on 1 July 2013, (the Croatian kuna) are required to follow in accordance with the terms of the applicable treaties of accession.
Other countries to have since joined the eurozone, and hence left ERM II, include Slovenia (1 January 2007), Cyprus (1 January 2008), Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), Estonia (1 January 2011) and Latvia (1 January 2014).

Bulgaria wanted to apply for ERM II membership as soon as possible after the EU entry. In November 2009, Bulgaria confirmed that it planned to apply for joining ERM II in early 2010, but was forced to delay its application for at least one year after updated figures put the budget deficit for 2009 at 3.7% of GDP, outside the Maastricht criteria.[tpl]Cite web|work=The Sofia Echo |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2010/04/09/885072_bulgaria-drops-goal-of-erm2-entry-in-2010 |title=Bulgaria drops goal of ERM2 entry in 2010 |publisher=sofiaecho.com |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010[/tpl] Romania initially planned to join ERM in 2010–2012,Isarescu: Trecem la euro dupa 2012 | Eveniment | Ziarul Financiar[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] but after the onset of the euro crisis, postponed this indefinitely, citing concerns about its workforce productivity.[tpl]Cite web|author=Banking News|url=http://www.bankingnews.ro/adoptare-euro.html |title=Croitoru (BNR): Adoptarea monedei euro, un orizont indepartat|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 July 2012[/tpl]
Sweden has chosen to stay out of the mechanism. This choice is currently tolerated by the ECB, even though it warned in 2002 that such an option will not be permitted for newer union members.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002170.stm |title=Sweden 'not ready' for euro |date= 22 May 2002|accessdate=14 December 2011 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
The Swiss Franc had always floated independently until its currency appreciation became unsustainable during the eurozone debt crisis, at which point it made a compromise to keep the exchange rate at a minimum of 1.20 francs to the euro, which does not constitute a peg.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/10/03/noyer-joins-the-euro-peg-gaffe-list/ |title=Noyer Joins the Euro Peg Gaffe List |date= 3 October 2011|accessdate=3 November 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Katie |last=Martin[/tpl] Switzerland is not officially a member of ERM II as it is not an EU member and expresses no ambitions to become one.

==Exchange rate bands==

In theory, most of the currencies are allowed to fluctuate as much as 15% from their assigned value. In practice, however, the currency of Lithuania is pegged tightly to the central rate, and the currency of Denmark deviates very little (usually less than 1%) from it.

===Historical reference===

The former members of ERM II are the Greek drachma, Slovenian tolar, Cypriot pound, Estonian kroon, Maltese lira, Slovak koruna and Latvian lats.
