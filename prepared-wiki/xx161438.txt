James Andrew Haley (January 4, 1899 – August 6, 1981) was a U.S. Representative from Florida.
Born in Jacksonville, Alabama, Haley attended the public schools and the University of Alabama. During World War I, Haley enlisted in Troop A, Second Cavalry, in April 1917 and served overseas.

In 1944, a fire broke out at a Ringling Circus show in Hartford, Connecticut that killed 169 persons. As a result of the fire he and five other circus officials pleaded no contest to charges of involuntary manslaughter and were sentenced to prison. He served eight months and in 1945 was returned to Florida, where he received a pardon.
Haley worked for the Bailey Circus, of Sarasota, Florida, from 1946 to 1948. He engaged in newspaper publishing and later in general printing business. He served as chairman of the Democratic executive committee of Sarasota County 1935–1952. He served as member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1949 to 1952.
