The Mercedes-Benz 260 D was one of the first two diesel engined series produced passenger cars.   The other was the diesel version of the Hanomag Rekord.  Both were introduced at the Berlin Motor Show in February 1936. The 260 D was named in reference to its engine's cubic capacity. Nearly 2,000 vehicles were assembled until 1940, after which the Daimler-Benz group had to devote itself almost entirely to military manufacture. 
The 2545 cc overhead valve, 4-cylinder engine employed the Bosch diesel injection system and produced [tpl]Convert|45|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] at 3000 rpm. The car weighed approximately [tpl]Convert|1530|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and could attain a top speed of [tpl]Convert|95|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. 
The chassis was based on contemporary Mercedes technology and had transverse leaf spring independent front suspension and swing axles at the rear.  The brakes were hydraulic. A range of body types were made including saloons, landaulettes and cabriolets.
Two series were manufactured, 170 pullman-landaulets used only as taxis based on the W21 chassis, called the Nullserie from 1936 to 1937, with a three-speed plus overdrive transmission, without syncromesh on the first gear, and, from 1937 on, the regular production 260D based on the W143 chassis, with a four-speed fully synchronized transmission.
A surviving example of the car is displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.
