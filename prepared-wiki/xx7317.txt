Matthew Abram "Matt" Groening ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|eɪ|n|ɪ|ŋ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|GRAY|ning[/tpl]; born February 15, 1954)[tpl]cite web url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/question-676887/49/Matt-Groening-born |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080207103601/http://www.britannica.com/eb/question-676887/49/Matt-Groening-born |title=When and where was Matt Groening born? |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |archivedate=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 17, 2013[/tpl] is an American cartoonist, screenwriter, producer, animator, author, musician, comedian, and voice actor. He is the creator of the comic strip Life in Hell (1977–2012) as well as co-creating two successful television series, The Simpsons (1989–present) and Futurama (1999–2003, 2008–2013).
Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, Matt Groening's Simpsons family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series: The Simpsons, which has since aired [tpl]The Simpsons episode count[/tpl] episodes. In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999. After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox in 2003, but Comedy Central commissioned 16 new episodes from four direct-to-DVD movies in 2008. Then, in June 2009, Comedy Central ordered 26 new episodes of Futurama, to be aired over two seasons.
Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, ten for The Simpsons and two for Futurama as well as a British Comedy Award for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on Life in Hell. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 14, 2012.

==Career==

===Early career===

In 1977, at the age of 23, Groening moved to Los Angeles to become a writer. He went through what he described as "a series of lousy jobs," including being an extra in the television movie When Every Day Was the Fourth of July,[tpl]cite journal |last=Sheff |first=David |authorlink=|title=Matt Groening |journal=Playboy |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=June 2007 |url=http://playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/matt-groening/matt-groening-01.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013165626/http://playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/matt-groening/matt-groening-01.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007[/tpl] busing tables,[tpl]Harvnb|Morgenstern|1990[/tpl]. washing dishes at a nursing home, landscaping in a sewage treatment plant, and chauffeuring and ghostwriting for a retired Western director.[tpl]Harvnb|Chocano|2001[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |title=Matt Groening |date=April 26, 2006 |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |work=The Onion AV Club |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |accessdate=January 14, 2007[/tpl]

===Life in Hell===

Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book Life in Hell, which was loosely inspired by the chapter "How to Go to Hell" in Walter Kaufmann's book Critique of Religion and Philosophy.[tpl]cite web |title=Matt Groening |date=May–June 2001 |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |work=My Generation |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl] Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. The strip, titled "Forbidden Words," appeared in the September/October issue of that year.[tpl]cite web |title=World Wide WET—early |work=Wunderland.com |url=http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Rash/misc/wet/wet1.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007[/tpl]
Groening had gained employment at the Los Angeles Reader, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper. Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25, 1980.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/viewCompany?oid=1157 |title=Acme Features Syndicate |accessdate=August 30, 2007 |work=Association of Alternative Newsweeklies |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100902011029/http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/acme-features-syndicate/Company?oid=1157 |archivedate=September 2, 2010[/tpl] Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, "Sound Mix," in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his "various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems" instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he "just made stuff up," concocting and reviewing fictional bands and non-existent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the "music" column.[tpl]Harvnb|Groening|2001a |pp=92–93[/tpl]. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons.[tpl]cite web |title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 3 of 4) |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035862p1.html |author=Plume, Kenneth |publisher=IGN |date=February 10, 2000 |accessdate=April 30, 2009[/tpl]
Life in Hell became popular almost immediately.[tpl]Harvnb|Ortved|2007 |p=71[/tpl]. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish "Love is Hell", a series of relationship-themed Life in Hell strips, in book form.[tpl]Harvnb|Groening|1994[/tpl]. Released a month later, the book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work is Hell soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for Life in Hell. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life in Hell, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life in Hell. At the end of its run, Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School is Hell, Childhood is Hell, The Big Book of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell. Although Groening has stated, "I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation,"[tpl]cite web |title=Prime time is heaven for 'Life in Hell' Artist |work=TV Host |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening89.html |last=Bergman |first=Erik H. |date=December 16, 1989 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 [/tpl] he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark Life in Hell[tpl]'[/tpl]s conclusion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-06-19/matt-groening-life-in-hell/55698336/1 |title='Life in Hell' is over for cartoonist Matt Groening |author=Graham, Jefferson |work=USA Today |accessdate=June 20, 2012 |date=June 19, 2012[/tpl] After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work.

===The Simpsons===

====Creation====

Life in Hell caught the eye of Hollywood writer-producer and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks, who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt.[tpl]cite web |title=Keep 'em Laughing |date=October 1999 |last=Kim |first=John W. |work=Scr(i)pt |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99d.html |accessdate=January 14, 2007[/tpl] In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project, which would turn out to be developing a series of short animated skits, called "bumpers," for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Groening feared that he would have to give up his ownership rights, and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it.[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |date=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6-minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Groening conceived of the idea for The Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family: Homer, the overweight father; Marge, the slim mother; Bart, the bratty oldest child; Lisa, the intelligent middle child; and Maggie, the baby.[tpl]Harvnb|Scott|2001[/tpl].[tpl]cite video |people=Rose, Charlie (Host, Executive producer) |date=July 30, 2007 |title=Charlie Rose:A Conversation About The Simpsons Movie |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/8620 |medium=Television production |publisher=Charlie Rose, Inc. |accessdate=July 31, 2007[/tpl] Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name "Bart," an anagram of brat.[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |date=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Duncan |first=Andrew |title=Matt Groening |work=Radio Times |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening99c.html |date=September 18–24, 1999 |accessdate=September 19, 2007[/tpl] However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004[/tpl] Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark "is the actual inspiration for Bart."
Maggie Groening has co-written a few Simpsons books featuring her cartoon namesake.[tpl]cite web |title=Index to Comic Art Collection: "Gro" to "Groenne" |work=Michigan State University Libraries |url=http://comics.lib.msu.edu/rri/grri/groan.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007[/tpl]

====The Tracey Ullman Show====

The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "Fear of Flying", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans.[tpl]Harvnb|Groening|2001b |p=90[/tpl]. Marge's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.[tpl]cite news |last=Solomon |first=Deborah |authorlink=Deborah Solomon |title=Screen Dreams |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=July 22, 2007 |page=15 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22wwln-Q4-t.html |accessdate=October 31, 2008[/tpl] Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size.Silverman, David; Archer, Wes. (2004). Illustrated commentary for "Treehouse of Horror IV", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and "not thinking that Bart would eventually be drawn in color" gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head.Anderson, Mike B.; Groening, Matt; Michels, Pete; Smith, Yeardley. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Lisa's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "Principal Charming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. While designing Lisa, Groening "couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles".Silverman, David; Reardon, Jim; Groening, Matt. (2005). Illustrated commentary for "Treehouse of Horror V", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. When designing Lisa and Maggie, he "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".Groening, Matt. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as The Simpsons shorts), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.[tpl]cite web |title=The David Silverman Interview |last=Heintjes |work=Hogan's Alley |url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070102052143/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp  |archivedate=January 2, 2007[/tpl]
The Simpsons shorts first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14[/tpl] Another family member, Grampa Simpson, was introduced in the later shorts. Years later, during the early seasons of The Simpsons, when it came time to give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose Abraham, unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Old Money" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]

====Half-hour====

Although The Tracey Ullman Show was not a big hit,[tpl]Harvnb|Ortved|2007 |p=72[/tpl]. the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour spin-off in 1989. A team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. James L. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer' |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |author=Kuipers, Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.[tpl]cite news |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Toon Terrific |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 12, 1993 |page=48(3)[/tpl] The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", a Christmas special."Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" The Simpsons.com. Retrieved on February 5, 2007 "Some Enchanted Evening" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
The series quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: "Nobody thought The Simpsons was going to be a big hit. It sneaked up on everybody." The Simpsons was co-developed by Groening, Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along and were often in conflict over the show; Groening once described their relationship as "very contentious." Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences.[tpl]cite web |title=Conan on being left out of "Simpsons Movie" its the best movie in the whole world lol |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2007[/tpl]
Like the main family members, several characters from the show have names that were inspired by people, locations or films. The name "Wiggum" for police chief Chief Wiggum is Groening's mother's maiden name.[tpl]Harvnb|Groening|2001b |pp=90–91[/tpl]. The names of a few other characters were taken from major street names in Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon, including Flanders, Lovejoy, Powell, Quimby and Kearney.[tpl]cite web |title=Painting the town in Portland |date=January 6, 2007 |last=Blake |first=Joseph |work=The Vancouver Sun |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/travel/story.html?id=f90268d8-6a5b-438d-9509-f03ecff27cc1 |accessdate=January 13, 2007[/tpl] Despite common fan belief that Sideshow Bob Terwilliger was named after SW Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, he was actually named after the character Dr. Terwilliker from the film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=August 17, 2007 |date=July 26, 2007 |author=Larry Carroll |publisher=MTV[/tpl]
Although Groening has pitched a number of spin-offs from The Simpsons, those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other Simpsons producers pitched a live-action spin-off about Krusty the Clown (with Dan Castellaneta playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground.From a radio interview with Groening that aired on the April 22, 1998 edition of Fresh Air on NPR. Link to stream (13 minutes, 21 seconds in) Groening has also pitched "Young Homer" and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of Springfield.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill;, Weinstein, Josh; Appel, Richard; Cohen, David; Pulido, Rachel; Smith, Yeardley; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
In 1995, Groening got into a major disagreement with Brooks and other Simpsons producers over "A Star Is Burns", a crossover episode with The Critic, an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former Simpsons crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise The Critic at the expense of The Simpsons," and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced The Critic.[tpl]Harvnb|Paul|1995[/tpl]. He requested his name be taken off the episode.[tpl]cite web |title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html |last=Brennan |first=Judy |date=March 3, 1995 |accessdate=September 4, 2007[/tpl]
Groening is credited with writing or co-writing the episodes "Some Enchanted Evening", "The Telltale Head", "Colonel Homer" and "22 Short Films About Springfield", as well as The Simpsons Movie, released in 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title=Homer going to bat in '07 |accessdate=July 3, 2006 |author=Fleming, Michael |date=April 2, 2006 |publisher=Variety.com[/tpl] He has had several cameo appearances in the show, with a speaking role in the episode "My Big Fat Geek Wedding". He currently serves at The Simpsons as an Executive Producer and Creative Consultant.

===Futurama===

[tpl]Main|Futurama[/tpl]After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Simpsons writer/producer David X. Cohen (still known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000.[tpl]cite journal |last=Needham |first=Alex |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |title=Nice Planet...We'll Take It! |  journal=The Face |issue=33 |date=October 1999[/tpl] By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of his grown-up life." The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, "Space Pilot 3000" (co-written with Cohen), "Rebirth" (story) and "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela" (story).
After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films—Bender's Big Score (2007), The Beast with a Billion Backs (2008), Bender's Game (2008) and Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009)—would be produced.[tpl]cite interview |last=Katz |first=Claudia |subjectlink=Claudia Katz |interviewer=Evan Jacobs |title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Claudia Katz on Futurama the Movie: Bender's Big Score |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEyTuBCyy6XECD |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening |author=Rabin, Nathan |publisher=The A.V.

===Other pursuits===
