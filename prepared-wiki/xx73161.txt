Gesine Lötzsch løːtʃ (born on August 7, 1961) is a German politician of the left-wing party Die Linke ("The Left").  In 2010, with Klaus Ernst, she was elected president of the party.
Born at Berlin-Lichtenberg in what then was East Germany, Lötzsch joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1984 and continued a member of its successor parties:  the SED-PDS (1989–1990), the PDS, (1990–2005), Die Linkspartei.PDS (2005–2007), and from 2007, Die Linke.  In 2002, as a candidate of the Party of Democratic Socialism, Lötzsch was elected to the German parliament (the Bundestag) for Berlin Lichtenberg, which she continues to represent today.  For her first term, she and Petra Pau were the only PDS deputies in the chamber.
