==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Willison services a predominantly residential area. The nearest tram runs along Riversdale Road, which is closer to Riversdale station.
The station has two platforms located either side of the railway tracks, with weatherboard buildings on both platforms. As it is not a "premium station", it is unmanned, and has no open toilets or other facilities. It has a Telstra payphone located near the entrance to the outbound platform.
Myki ticket vending machines are located at entrances to platform 1 and platform 2.

===History===

While Willison was not part of the original Outer Circle line, it was built soon afterwards and opened on 8 June 1908,VICSIG Infrastructure - Willison as part of the Deepdene Dasher service. This remnant of the Outer Circle went from Ashburton to Deepdene.
When it first opened, the station was known as Golf Links, and existed to serve the Riversdale Golf Club, which was originally adjacent to the site. It has been said that influential members of the club did not appreciate having to walk to either Riversdale or Hartwell stations, and pressed for a closer alternative.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/our-city/history/resources/outer-circle-railway/riversdale-station |title=Riversdale Station |publisher=City of Boroondara |accessdate=2013-10-06 [/tpl] This may explain why Willison was built so close to Riversdale station - only [tpl]convert|400|m[/tpl] away.
The station was originally just a siding where members could embark after a game. The golf club moved from the site in 1927, and on 23 July 1936, the station was renamed Willison. By this time, the Deepdene Dasher service had ceased operations, and Willison was served only by the Ashburton line. Twelve years later, this was extended to Alamein - the service which still exists today.
