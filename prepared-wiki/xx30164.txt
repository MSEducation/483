Exploration of these regions by European powers first began in the late 15th century and early 16th century, led by the Portuguese explorers.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4397/ |title = The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe |website = World Digital Library |date = 1778 |accessdate = 2013-08-30 [/tpl]  The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the Indies. Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of Indies. The East Indies, which was also called "Old Indies" or "Great Indies", consisting of India and the West Indies, also called "New Indies" or "Little Indies", consisting of the Americas.[tpl]cite book|last=Kitchin|first=Thomas|title=The Present State of the West-Indies: Containing an Accurate Description of What Parts Are Possessed by the Several Powers in Europe|year=1778|publisher=R.

These regions were important sources of trading goods, particularly cotton, indigo and spices after the establishment of European trading companies: the British East India Company and Dutch East India Company, among others, in the 17th century.
The New World was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the Indies by explorer Christopher Columbus, who had grossly underestimated the westerly distance from Europe to Asia.  Later, to avoid confusion, the New World came to be called the "West Indies", while the original Indies came to be called the "East Indies".  
The designation East Indian was once primarily used to describe people of all of the East Indies, in order to avoid the potential confusion from the term American Indian who were once simply referred to as Indians (see the Native American name controversy for more information).
