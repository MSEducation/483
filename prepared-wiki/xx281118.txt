After seven years photographing life in the remaining communist nations, Van Houtryve's interest turned to the US military's use of surveillance drones. Thanks to a Getty Editorial Grant of $10,000, he is able to use his own drone to witness reactions within the US to surveillance similar to that conducted by the US outside its borders. Warfare may now be conducted at a distance from one of the parties, and Van Houtryve recognizes this as a challenge for a new kind of photography.Rachel Segal Hamilton, "Getty Images Grants for Editorial Photography: Tomas van Houtryve", British Journal of Photography, Archived here by the Wayback Machine from the original on 8 September 2013.
