Tràm Chim National Park is a national park in Đồng Tháp Mười, Đồng Tháp Province. This national park is created to protect several rare birds, especially the Sarus Crane (Grus antigone), a species listed in the IUCN Red Book.

==History==

In 1985, Tram Chim was established by the provincial government as Tram Chim Afforestation and Fishery Company aimed at planting cajuput and exploitation of aquatic resources and also preserve the original Dong Thap Muoi area.
In 1986, the sarus crane was found here. In 1991, Tram Chim became provincial-level Natural Reserve to protect crane (Grus antigone sharpii). In 1994, the reserve became a national natural reserve by the decision Circular 4991/KGVX. The protected area covers 7,500 ha. In September 1998, the area was adjusted to 7588 ha. In 1998, this area became Tram Chim National Park by the governmental decision 253/1998/QĐ dated December 29, 1998.
