Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, commonly abbreviated MeOTf, is the organic compound with the formula CF3SO2OCH3.  It is a colourless liquid that is a very powerful (and very dangerous) methylating reagent in chemistry.Roger W. Alder, Justin G. E.

==Reactivity==

This compound is closely related to methyl fluorosulfonate (FSO2OCH3), which is an older and less common reagent. These compounds alkylate faster and with wider range of substrates than traditional methylating agents such as methyl iodide. One ranking of alkylating agents is (CH3)3O+ > CF3SO2OCH3 ~ FSO2OCH3 > (CH3)2SO4> CH3I.  It will alkylate many functional groups that are only weakly basic such as aldehydes, amides, and nitriles.  It does not methylate benzene or the bulky 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine.  Its ability to methylate N-heterocycles is exploited in certain deprotection schemes.[tpl]OrgSynth|author=Albert I.
