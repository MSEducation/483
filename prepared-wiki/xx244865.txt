Kilve Chantry was a religious site in Kilve, Somerset, England.
The Chantry was founded in 1329, when a brotherhood of five monks was employed to say Mass for their founder, Simon de Furneaux.[tpl]cite book |last=Bush |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Bush (historian) |coauthors= |title=Somerset: The complete guide |year=1994 |publisher=Dovecote Press |location=Wimborne, Dorset |isbn=1-874336-27-X [/tpl] The Roll of Incumbents shows that several successive chantry priests were incumbents of Kilve parish. It was dissolved in the late 14th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=30560|title=Remains of Chantry, abutting East side of Chantry Cottage, Sea Lane (West side), Kilve|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl] The chantry seems to have fallen into a ruin long before the dissolution of the monasteries, and for centuries it served as a barn for the adjacent farm.[tpl]cite web | title=Remains of Chantry, abutting east side of Chantry Cottage | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=265168 | accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl]
The building stayed in use for many years, possibly by smugglers, until a fire in 1848,[tpl]cite book |title=Portrait of the Quantocks |last=Waite |first=Vincent |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-1158-4 |pages= [/tpl] caused by an attempt to destroy evidence of contraband brandy.[tpl]cite book|last=Byford|first=Enid|title=Somerset Curiosities|date=1987|publisher=Dovecote Press|isbn=0946159483|page=24[/tpl] Some parts of the chantry complex have survived intact and are now 'Chantry' and 'Priory Cottages', but the large solar wing is now ruined.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=34540|title=Kilve chantry, Kilve|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl]
