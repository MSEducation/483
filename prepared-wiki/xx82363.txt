The principal field stands for the Serbian state. It consists of a silver double-headed eagle on a red shield; its body and wings in silver, and tongues, beaks, legs and claws in gold, between two golden fleur-de-lis. The inescutcheon stands for the Serbian nation; in a red shield, a cross between four silver firesteels arranged in the quarters around it, all of them facing horizontally outwards.
A blazon in heraldic terms is: Gules, a bicephalic eagle Argent armed Or, two fleurs-de-lys Or. Overall an escutcheon Gules, a cross Argent between four firesteels Argent. All crowned with a royal crown.
The design on the inescutcheon has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages.  
The four shapes around the central cross are firesteels.
Although Serbia is now a republic, the coat of arms features the royal crown of the former monarchy.
The lesser arms is used more frequently, appearing on passports, identity cards, driver's licenses, and the state flag.

==History==

===Serbian eagle===

The use of the double-headed eagle dates back to Beginning in the 14th century, the double-headed eagle can be seen more often on inscriptions, medieval frescoes and embroidery on the clothes of Serbian royalty.[tpl]cite book|author=Alexander Solovyev|title=The History of the Serbian coat of arms|year=1958|page=130[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=J. Kovacevic|title=Medieval Clothes of the Slavs in the Balkans|year=1953|pages=19-97, 183-210[/tpl] Earlier, Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1166-1196) used the symbol. The Serbian Orthodox Church also adopted it; the entrance of the Žiča monastery, which was the seat of the Archbishop of the Serbs between 1219–1253, and by tradition the coronational church of the Serbian kings, is engraved with the double-headed eagle. The survived golden ring of Queen Teodora (1321–1322) has the symbol engraved. The Nemanjić dynasty coat of arms was the double-headed eagle. During the reign of Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1345), the double-headed eagle can be seen on everyday objects and state related documents, such as vax stamps and proclamations. In 1339, map maker, Angelino Dulcert, marks the Serbian Empire with a flag with a red double-headed eagle.Solovyev 1958, pp. 134-135 Other Serbian dynasties also adopted the symbol as a symbolic continuation, like the Mrnjavčević and Lazarević. Prince Lazar (r. 1371-1389), when renovating the Hilandar monastery of Mount Athos, engraved the double-headed eagle at the northern wall.[tpl]cite book|author=A. Ivic|title=Old Serbian Stamps and coat of arms|year=1910|page=30[/tpl] The Codex Monacensis Slavicus 4 (fl. 1371-1389) has richly attested artwork of the Serbian eagle.  The double-headed eagle was officially adopted by Stefan Lazarević after he received the despot title, the second highest Byzantine title, by John VII Palaiologos in August 1402 at the court in Constantinople.Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas, vol. 8, Osteuropa-Institut München, F. Steiner Verlag, 1960, p. 511

===Serbian cross===

Serbian historian Stanoje Stanojević argues that it was officially adopted in 1345, with Dušan the Mighty's raising to a Serbian Empire.Atlagic, p. 5 Stojan Novaković argues that the recorded use of the Serbian cross, as a national symbol, began in 1397, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević.Atlagic, p. 4 It was possibly derived from a known candle chandelier from the Visoki Dečani. The Serbian cross is found in the Korenić-Neorić Armorial (1595), which shows the coat of arms of Serbia (Svrbiae) as a white cross over a red background, with four firesteels, also depicting the Mrnjavčević noble house with the same design, with inverted colours and the Serbian eagle in the center of the cross.  According to Mavro Orbini (1607), it was used by Vukašin Mrnjavčević (King, 1365–1371) and Lazar Hrebeljanović (Prince, 1371–1389).  Miloš Obrenović adopted the Serbian cross as the military flag when forming the first units of the regular army in 1825.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IA_0ouM0CKYC&q=Српски+симбол|title=Posebna izdanja 295|publisher=Srpska Akademija Nauka i Umetnosti|year=1957|page=133[/tpl]  The Serbian cross then appeared on all Serbian coats of arms, except the Serbian coat of arms dated 1974, which had the cross removed, leaving four stylized S; this was done symbolically by the Yugoslav government to "socially curtail and politically marginalize religious communities and religion in general".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rqjLgtYDKQ0C&pg=PA187|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|author=Mitja Velikonja|page=187|quote=nations (in a symbolical sense as well, for example, by removing the cross from the Serbian coat of arms but keeping the four stylized esses), and to socially curtail and politically marginalize religious communities and religion in general.[/tpl]
