==Synopsis==

The setting is on a bridge over a river, during the first half of the 19th century.  The river separates two opposing armies during an unspecified conflict.  Josephine Popelka has earlier been to the battlefield and buried her brother.  On her return, the enemy sentry lets her pass, but holds her papers from his commanding officer.  Without the proper papers, the sentry on her own side denies her request to pass, and Josephine must remain on the bridge.  
In parallel, Bedron, the village brewer, is allowed on to the bridge from his own side, but is prevented from crossing over at the other side.  With Josephine and Bedron detained on the bridge, Bedron casually makes a pass at Josephine.  Josephine's fiancé Johnny then appears, and accuses her of being unfaithful.  Eva, Bedron's wife, in turn arrives and she joins the argument.  
The schoolmaster then joins the scene, trying to solve a riddle that he heard from Colonel Ladinsky, an officer on his own side:  'a deer is in a field, surrounded by a wall too high and steep to jump or climb.  How does the deer escape?'  The riddle parallels the characters' situation.  Then, offstage, battle sounds are heard.  The two couples settle their differences peacably.  Then they hear news of battlefield victory, on their side.  Colonel Ladinsky then appears and tells Josephine her brother is alive; it turns out that she buried another deceased soldier.  The colonel also reveals the answer to the riddle: the deer does not escape.  Everyone laughes and celebrates the victory.
