==History==

Billboard Brasil was launched by Bill Werde, Editor-in-chief of the American Billboard magazine, in Brazil in September 2009. Werde expressed his appreciation of Brazilian music, and stated that Billboard would monitor the local market.
The first number-one song on the main chart was "Halo" by Beyoncé. Its first cover was Roberto Carlos, Brazil's best-selling music artist. In May 2010, "Tapa na Cara" (English: "Slap in the Face") by Brazilian duo Zezé Di Camargo e Luciano became the first ever national song to reach number-one song on the main chart, following six consecutive months of Mariah Carey's cover version of "I Want to Know What Love Is" holding this position.
