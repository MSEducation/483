Phyllostachys ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ɵ|ˈ|s|t|æ|k|ɨ|s[/tpl]
or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ɵ|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|k|ɨ|s[/tpl])
is a genus of bamboo.  The species are native to Asia with a large number of species found in Central China, but can now be found in many warm temperate and subtropical areas around the world as cultivated plants or escapes from cultivation.  Most of the species spread aggressively by underground rhizomes.  
The stem or culm has a prominent groove, called a sulcus, that runs along the length of each segment (or internode).  Because of this it is one of the most easily identifiable genera of bamboo.
There are approximately 75 species and 200 varieties and cultivars of Phyllostachys. The largest grow to be about 100 feet (30 m) tall in optimum conditions.  Some of the larger species, sometimes known as "timber bamboo", are used as construction timber and for making furniture.
The name Phyllostachys means "leaf spike" and refers to the inflorescences.[tpl]cite book|last=Coombes|first=Allen J.|title=The A to Z of plant names|year=2012|publisher=Timber Press|location=USA|isbn=9781604694962|pages=312[/tpl] 
Some of the smaller species can be grown as bonsai.
