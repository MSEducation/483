==Population==

According to the 2012 revison of the World Population Prospects the total population was 6,218,000 in 2010, compared to only 2,200,000 in 1950.Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision However, as shown by the chart to the right, the data are very imprecise -- in fact, the breakdown of population by gender is over a million more than the given total population.    Despite a threefold increase between 1950 and 2010, the increase in population was less than in many other countries in Central America. The total impact of civil wars, dictatorships and socioeconomics drove over a million Salvadorans (both as immigrants and refugees) into the US; in addition small Salvadoran communities sprung up in Canada, Panama, Costa Rica, Europe and Australia since the migration trend began in the early 1970s. The 2010 U.S. Census counted 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, up from 655,165 in 2000.http://factfinder2.census.gov/
The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 32.1%, 61% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% was 65 years or older.

==Ethnic groups==

12% of Salvadorans are white; population is mostly of Spanish, while there is also of  French, German, Swiss, English, Irish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch and Danish descent. The majority of Central European immigrants arrived during World War II as refugees Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland are scattered in different communities of El Salvador. About 1% is of full indigenous origin (Pipil and Lenca). Very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. In the Mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Afro-Salvadoran, and the indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have and indigenous culture, all identify themselves as Mestizo culturally.EL SALVADOR Visa Application - Tourist Visas, Business Visas, Expedited Visas - El Salvador Page
The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by mass murder during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising (or La Matanza) which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 peasants killed in a short period of time (nowadays this would be considered a genocide by the army's methods to exterminate a certain racial group). Many authors note that since La Matanza the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous.Military Rule, 1931-1979 - History - El Salvador - Central America: 1979 history, center poverty, cause condition, party pdc, soccer war
