==Plot==

As policeman Mal Toohey (Edgerton) chases an escaping suspect during a raid on a drug lab; he gets a bullet lodged in his protective vest and hero status for his trouble. After he celebrates a little too hard, he drives home intoxicated and accidentally clips a boy on a bike with his rear-view mirror. He phones for an ambulance, but denies any involvement in the accident. When by-the-book new cop Jim (Courtney) and his superior, Carl (Wilkinson), arrive on the scene, Carl recognizes Mal and sends Jim off to secure the perimeter. He privately questions Mal and sends him home, making Jim suspicious. While the boy remains in a coma, Mal’s guilt increases his need to confess. Jim's desire to solve the case is further fueled by his attraction to the boy’s mother (Roberts). He voices his doubts to Carl which causes Carl to grow increasingly desperate to keep secret meetings with both men.
Mal has a son not far in age from the one he hit, while Carl had a son too but was killed by a driver. When Mal finally confesses his guilt to his wife Julie (George), the truth pushes them farther apart rather than bring them closer together.
