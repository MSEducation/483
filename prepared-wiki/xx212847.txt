Bells Stores Ltd was a chain of 54 convenience stores in North East England. It was owned and run by the Bell family until February 2004, when it was acquired by Sainsbury's, the UK's third largest supermarket chain. Stores were initially refurbished to trade as 'Sainsbury's at Bells', but in May 2007 it was announced that the stores would be re-branded Sainsbury's Local by March 2008.
