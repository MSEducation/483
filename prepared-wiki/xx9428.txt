==Prophet Obadiah==

"The political situation implied in the prophecy points to a time after the Exile, probably in the mid-fifth century B.C.  No value can be attributed to traditions identifying this prophet with King Ahab's steward (... so Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 39b) or with King Ahaziah's captain (... so Pseudo-Epiphanius...)."  The Interpreters' Bible The Interpreter's Bible, 1953, Volume VI, pp. 857-859, John A. Thompson

According to the Talmud, Obadiah is said to have been a convert to Judaism from Edom,[ref]
