[[Kartha]]

CATEGORIES: Indian castes, Nair

Kartha or Karthavu is a Hindu Nair title name that means Lord. It was conferred by the king to powerful Nair families who enjoyed Raja or Naduvazhi status.
The most important of the Kartha clans are Anakkottil Kartha and Meenachil Kartha. Their independent principality was annexed by Marthandavarma along with Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur (Meenachil near palai), Cheraneloor Kartha/Kattu kaimal (Cheranallore near Ernakulam), Thazhassary kotta Kartha. 
The family deity Kottekkavilamma is seated in the pazhayakotta. The remains of the masonry basement of the fort and some portions of the 16-foot (width) fort walls with gun holes, are believed to have been built overnight during Hyder Alis invasion (1767) remain. They  enjoyed four names as is evident from land and revenue records: Udayakumaran, Eravi, Kuruvikkat Kaimal and Kartha.

==Legend==

Kartha, as a Kshatriya community, ruled smaller principalities or worked mainly in the Army, Police or as tax collectors. They were troop leaders. The Kartha surname is still used, although it is less prominent.
The title Kartha, ("doer"), appears to have been used as a titular name by some of the rulers of Madura. During the Madras census of 1901, the title Kartha was returned by Balijas claiming to be descendants of the Nayak kings of Madura and Tanjore. The Tekkumkur and Vadakkumkur Rajas are said to have first conferred the title Kartha on certain influential Nayar families who were related by blood to the Rajas. In social matters the authority of the Kartha was supreme. Only on important points were higher authorities called on to intercede. Karthas belong to the Illam sub-division of the Nayar caste.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/castestribesofso05thuriala/castestribesofso05thuriala_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Castes and tribes of southern India" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]

==Society==

Until the 19th century, the Karthas strictly followed marumakkathayam or matriachical tradition where the female was the head of the family. Her children would carry her name and inherit her property. Now Karthas follows makkathayam.

==Samantans==

The Samanthans of Chuntampattai and Cherupulasseri were known as Kartha or Karthavu. They were related to the Thirumulpads of Manchery and Amarampalam.Castes and Tribes of Southern India By Edgar Thurston p.284-289

==Caste system==

Karthas belong to the Illathu Nair caste. Some of these clans were later elevated to Samanthan Nair.Census of India, 1901, Volume 1 Census Commissioner, p.131
