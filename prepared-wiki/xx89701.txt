M-99 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan.  It runs from the Ohio state border, where it connects to State Route 15 (SR 15), north to Lansing, where it terminates at a junction with Interstate 496 (I-496). The highway mainly serves local communities along the route as it passes through farm lands in the southern part of the state. One segment is routed concurrently with US Highway 12 (US 12) in Jonesville while the northern end runs through urban areas on a street named for Martin Luther King, Jr. in Lansing.
The current highway is the third to carry the M-99 designation. The others were located near Lake Michigan near Muskegon in the Lower Peninsula and Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula in the 1920s and 30s. The current highway was first designated as parts of M-34 and M-64 in 1919. These numbers were later dropped in favor of an M-9 designation in 1929. For part of 1934, a loop route was designated M-158 in Hillsdale County that was used for a rerouted M-9 in the area. The M-99 designation was applied to the highway in 1940. Since then, the state has completed paving twice; one segment was returned to gravel surface for two years in the 1950s. The southern section in Hillsdale County was rerouted in the 1960s, and sections were converted into divided highways in the late 1970s.

==Route description==

SR 15 crosses into Michigan just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly agricultural areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing just a few blocks to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US 12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for less than half a mile (0.8 km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2011 |scale= 1 in:15 mi / 1 cm:9 km |section= L11–N11 [/tpl][tpl]google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=M-99+N%2FPioneer+Rd&daddr=42.09387,-84.80356+to:42.22894,-84.75513+to:42.363111,-84.6988708+to:S+Martin+Luther+King+Jr+Blvd&hl=en&sll=42.71839,-84.559793&sspn=0.060789,0.058279&geocode=FexTfAIdSNH1-g%3BFS5NggIdGADy-inFNqxdu2c9iDE60MClrYUu3Q%3BFcxchAIdRr3y-imV9Rwr3UQ9iDFunDvj0zVgLg%3BFedohgIdCpnz-imFDglADkw9iDGPeLAbNt3mZw%3BFaTwiwId3pr1-g&mra=ls&via=1,2,3&t=h&z=9 |title= Overview Map of M-99 |accessdate= May 16, 2012[/tpl]
In Litchfield, M-99 enters the town from the southeast, passing near downtown where it meets the northern terminus of M-49. The highway leaves Litchfield heading northwest on Homer Road for a few miles before bending to the north as it crosses into Calhoun County. The trunkline passes through more farmland as it runs toward Homer on Hillsdale Street. In Homer, after passing through a roundabout, M-99 meets up with M-60 and the two highways run concurrently through the town to the northeast. The road briefly splits into a divided highway near the end of the concurrency. M-99 heads north, while M-60 continues eastward. From here, M-99 continues northward on 28 Mile Road toward the city of Albion. After crossing the Kalamazoo River in downtown, M-99 merges with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94).  M-99 continues east concurrently with the business loop on Michigan Avenue passing near Albion College before heading back north to an interchange with I-94 at exit 124; this interchange marks the end of BL I-94 and M-99 continues northward on Eaton Rapids Road.
M-99 heads north through farmland to the village of Springport where it turns eastward along Main Street as it passes through the town. The highway continues easterly on Eaton Rapids Road before turning northward to cross into Eaton County. Shortly after crossing the county line, M-50 comes in from the southwest to meet up with M-99. The two highways travel together into Eaton Rapids. Together they form Main Street in the city before they separate on the north side of town. M-50 leaves to the northwest as Dexter Road, and M-99 continues to the northeast as Canal and Michigan streets. For the next few miles, the trunkline splits into a divided highway and runs parallel to the general course of the Grand River. M-99 crosses the river southeast of Diamondale after the opposing directions merge back together as an undivided highway.  North of the river crossing, M-99 meets I-96 at the latter's exit 101 on the southern border of Lansing.
From I-96, the road continues north through residential neighborhoods into Lansing as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The highway travels northeasterly through the southern side of the capital city, as far as Jolly Road. There it turns northward through the Old Everett Neighborhood. The street is bordered by commercial properties in this area. M-99 widens into a boulevard south of the intersection with Mount Hope Avenue before crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the highway is bordered by the site of the former Lansing Car Assembly plant, which for a century produced Oldsmobiles and other GM cars.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156402519.html |title= New Factory Is Reshaping GM's Future A Smaller, State-Of-The-Art Auto Plant Has Been Good For The Company And The City Of Lansing, Mich. |work= The Wisconsin State Journal |location= Madison, WI |date= December 24, 2006 |first= Tim |last= Martin |agency= Associated Press |issn= 0749-405X |accessdate= May 16, 2012[/tpl] M-99 ends at a junction with I-496 just north of the assembly plant area at exit 5; MLK Boulevard continues north from this interchange as the Capitol Loop.
M-99 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-3 were the 32,262 vehicles daily north of Mount Hope Avenue in Lansing; the lowest counts were the 2,300 vehicles per day between the state line and the M-34 junction.[tpl]cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning |url=http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=2008 |accessdate=May 16, 2011[/tpl] No section of M-99 has been listed on the National Highway System,[tpl]cite map |title= National Highway System, Michigan |date= April 23, 2006 |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate=October 7, 2008[/tpl] a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.[tpl]cite web |first= Kevin |last= Adderly |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/ |title= The National Highway System |work= Planning, Environment, & Realty |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |date= August 26, 2010 |accessdate= January 1, 2011[/tpl]

===Current designation===

In 1919, the highway that is now M-99 was first signed as M-64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M-34 from Hillsdale to the Litchfield area. In 1924, the western terminus of M-34 was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=May 15, 1924 |cartography= MSHD [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=October 1, 1924 |cartography= MSHD [/tpl] Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming an extension of the M-64.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=December 1, 1926 |cartography= MSHD [/tpl]

In 1929, this version of M-64 was renumbered M-9.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=May 1, 1929 |cartography= MSHD [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=January 1, 1930 |cartography= H.M. Gousha [/tpl] In 1934, M-9 traveled on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north from the corner of Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Michigan Highway Map |date= May 1, 1934 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title=  Official Michigan Highway Map |date= July 1, 1934 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Michigan Highway Map |date= September 1, 1934 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= [/tpl] By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1936 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= June 1, 1936 |cartography= Rand McNally |section= L11–N11 [/tpl] The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= 1940 Official Michigan Highway Map |date= April 15, 1940 |edition= Summer |cartography= Rand McNally |section= L11–N11 [/tpl]

A new alignment of M-99 highway was opened from the Ransom area north to Osseo in 1966; the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo and M-99 supplanted M-34 from Osseo to Hillsdale.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1966 |section= N11[/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1967 |section= N11[/tpl] The divided highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation |title= Official Transportation Map |year= 1979 |edition=1978–79 |scale= 1 in:14.5 mi / 1 in:23 km |section= M11[/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= Official Transportation Map |year= 1980 |edition= 1980–81 |scale= 1 in:14.5 mi / 1 in:23 km |section= M11 [/tpl]
