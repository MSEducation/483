Fiat S.p.A. (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) is the parent company of the Fiat Group and, since July 2011, also the majority shareholder in Chrysler. On 29 January 2014, it was announced that Fiat S.p.A. will be merged into a new Netherlands-based holding company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) with the now wholly owned Chrysler Group and that the merger is expected to take place before the end of 2014.
Fiat was founded in 1899 by a group of investors, including Giovanni Agnelli. During its more than century-long history, Fiat has also manufactured railway engines and carriages, military vehicles, farm tractors, and aircraft. In 2013, Fiat (together with Chrysler) was the second largest European automaker by volumes produced, and the seventh in the world ahead of Honda, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Suzuki, Renault and Daimler AG.
Over the years, Fiat has acquired numerous other automakers: it acquired Lancia in 1968, became a shareholder of Ferrari in 1969, took control of Alfa Romeo from the Italian government in 1986, purchased Maserati in 1993, and became the 100% owner of Chrysler Group LLC in 2014. Fiat Group currently produces vehicles under twelve brands: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Ram Trucks, and SRT. 
In 1970, Fiat employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4 million cars, in that country.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-29/maserati-boom-signals-fiat-arrivederci-to-italian-past.html |title=Maserati Boom Signals Fiat ‘Arrivederci’ to Italian Past  |author=Tommaso Ebhardt and David Rocks |date=2014-01-30 |publisher=Bloomberg [/tpl] As of 2002, Fiat built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company’s revenue.
Fiat-brand cars are built in several locations around the world. Outside Italy, the largest country of production is Brazil, where the Fiat brand is the market leader.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.it/post/9027/fiat-n1-in-brasile-a-maggio|title=Fiat n.1 in Brasile (a maggio) |publisher=autoblog.it |language=Italian|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=9 January 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://es.autoblog.com/2007/06/29/ventas-mayo-2007-brasil/|title=Ventas Mayo 2007: Brasil|publisher=Auto blog|language=Spanish |first=Enrique|last=Garcí|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=9 January 2013 [/tpl] The group also has factories in Argentina, Poland and Mexico (where Fiat-brand vehicles are manufactured at plants owned and operated by Chrysler for export to the U.S., Brazil, Italy and other markets) and a long history of licensing manufacture of its products in other countries. It also has numerous alliances and joint ventures around the world, the main ones being located in Serbia, France, Turkey, India and China.
Gianni Agnelli, the grandson of founder Giovanni Agnelli, was Fiat's chairman from 1966 until 1996; he then served as honorary chairman from 1996 until his death on 24 January 2003, during which time Cesare Romiti served as chairman. He was succeeded briefly by Paolo Fresco, who served as chairman, and Paolo Cantarella, as CEO. Umberto Agnelli then took over as chairman from 2003 to 2004. After Umberto Agnelli's death on 28 May 2004, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named chairman, with Agnelli heir John Elkann becoming vice chairman (at the age of 28), and other family members also serving on the board. On 1 June 2004, Giuseppe Morchio was replaced by Sergio Marchionne as CEO.

By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy—a position it has retained since. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company.[tpl]cite web|title=1913 Fiat Type 56|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2004/08/01/hmn_feature1.html|work=hemmings.com|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Inside the Poughkeepsie Fiat factory|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2009/06/08/inside-the-poughkeepsie-fiat-factory/|work=hemmings.com|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]  Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction.

After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themanufacturer.com/us/profile/4183/Case_New_Holland?PHPSESSID=c88bc|title=Case New Holland, Family history|accessdate=12 March 2008|work=themanufacturer.com[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9034166/Fiat-SpA|title=Fiat SpA |publisher=britannica |accessdate=24 October 2012[/tpl]
In 1921, workers seized Fiat's plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation ended. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory—then the largest in Europe—which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market.Georgano, p.151 In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.Georgano, p.8
Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Army and Regia Aeronautica and later for the Germans. Fiat made obsolete fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks (obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts) and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers. In 1945—the year Mussolini was overthrown—the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini's government. These were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni's grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966, as chairman until 1996.

===Gianni Agnelli===

Among the younger Agnelli's first steps after gaining control of Fiat was a massive reorganization of the company management, which had previously been highly centralized, with little provision for the delegation of authority and decision-making. Such a system was effective in the past, but lacked the responsiveness and flexibility needed by Fiat's steady expansion, and the growth of its international operations in the 1960s. The company was reorganized on a product-line basis, with two main product groups—one for passenger cars, the other for trucks and tractors—and a number of semi-independent division and subsidiaries. Top management, freed from responsibility for day-by-day operations of the company, was able to devote its efforts to more far-reaching goals. In 1967, Fiat made its first acquisition when it purchased Autobianchi; with sales amounting to $1.7 billion, it outstripped Volkswagen, its main European competitor, and in 1968 produced some 1,750,000 vehicles while its sales volume climbed to $2.1 billion. According to Newsweek in 1968, Fiat was "the most dynamic automaker in Europe...and may come closest to challenging the worldwide supremacy of Detroit." Then, in 1969, it purchased controlling interests in Ferrari and Lancia. At the time, Fiat was a conglomerate, owning Alitalia, toll highways, a typewriter and office machine manufacturer, electronics and electrical equipment firms, a paint company, a civil engineering firm, and an international construction company. Following up on an agreement Valletta had made with Soviet officials in 1966, Agnelli constructed the AvtoVAZ plant in the new city of Togliattigrad on the Volga. This began operation in 1970, producing a local version of the Fiat 124 as the Lada. On his initiative, Fiat automobile and truck plants were also constructed in industrial centers of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania.
Despite offering a relatively competitive range of cars, Fiat was not immune from the financial pressures that the auto industry confronted following the 1973 oil price shock. Towards the end of 1976 it was announced that the Libyan government was to take a 9.6% shareholding in the company in return for a capital injection worth an equivalent of £250 million.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Motor | author = Roger Bell (Ed) |title =MotorWeek: Fiat's Arabian connection| page =18 | date = 11 December 1976[/tpl] The size of the Libyan investment is apparent when it is compared to the £310 million IMF loan that the Italian government was trying to negotiate at the time. Other aspects of the Libyan agreement included the construction of a truck and bus plant at Tripoli. Chairman Agnelli candidly described the deal as "a classic petro-money recycling operation which will strengthen the Italian reserves, provide Fiat with fresh capital and give the group greater tranquility in which to carry out its investment programmes". Equally noteworthy was the fact that despite the dilutive effect of the Libyan investment on existing shareholders, the company's largest shareholder, the Agnelli family, retained a 30% stake in the recapitalised business.
In 1979, the company became a holding company when it spun off its various businesses into autonomous companies, one of them being Fiat Auto. That same year, sales reached an all-time high in the US, corresponding to the Iranian Oil Crisis. However, when gas prices fell again after 1981, Americans began purchasing sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup trucks in larger numbers (marking a departure from their past preference for large cars). Also, Japanese automakers had been taking an ever-larger share of the car market, increasing at more than half a percent a year. Consequently, in 1984, Fiat and Lancia withdrew from the United States market. In 1989, it did the same in the Australian market, although it remained in New Zealand.
In 1986, Fiat acquired Alfa Romeo from the Italian government. Also, in 1986 15% of Fiat company stock was still owned by Libya, an investment dating back to the mid-seventies. US foreign policy under President Reagan's administration canceled a Pentagon contract to produce earth movers with Fiat and pressured the company into brokering a buyout of the Libyan investment. In 1992, two top corporate officials in the Fiat Group were arrested for political corruption.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF1630F93AA25757C0A965958260|title= Corruption at Fiat Is Admitted by Chairman |date=19 April 1993|first=Alan |last=Cowell |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=14 October 2012[/tpl] A year later, Fiat acquired Maserati. In 1995 Alfa Romeo exited the US market. Maserati re-entered the US market under Fiat in 2002. Since then, Maserati sales there have been increasing briskly.

===Paolo Fresco===

Paolo Fresco became chairman of Fiat in 1998 with the hope that the veteran of General Electric would bring more emphasis on shareholder value to Fiat. By the time he took power, Fiat's market share in Italy had fallen to 41%[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] from around 62% in 1984.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] However, a Jack Welch-like management style would be much harsher than that used by the Italians (e.g., precarious versus lifetime employment). Instead, Fresco focused on offering more incentives for good performance, including compensation using stock options for top and middle management.
However, his efforts were frustrated by union objections. Unions insisted that pay raises be set by length of tenure, rather than performance. Another conflict was over his preference for informality (the founder, Giovanni Agnelli, used to be a cavalry officer). He often referred to other managers by their first name, although company tradition obliged one to refer to others using their titles (e.g., "Chairman Fresco"). The CEO of the company, Paolo Cantarella, ran the day-to-day affairs of the company, while Fresco determined company strategy and especially acted as a negotiator for the company. In 1999, Fiat formed CNH Global by merging New Holland NV and Case Corporation.
in 2003 Fiat shed its insurance sector, which it was operating through Toro Assicurazioni to the DeAgostini Group. In the same year, Fiat sold its aviation business, FiatAvio to Avio Holding. In February 2004, the company sold its interest in Fiat Engineering, as well as its stake in Edison.

===Sergio Marchionne===

Sergio Marchionne was appointed CEO of Fiat in 2004 and initially he impressed investors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/11/09/sergio-marchionne-steps-down-as-fiat-ceo/|title=Sergio Marchionne steps down as Fiat CEO|accessdate=20 January 2009|work=autoblog.com[/tpl] At the end of the 2005 financial year, the company saw its first profit in 17 quarters of €196M for the first 9 months of FY2006.[tpl]cite web|url= http://sec.edgar-online.com/2006/06/30/0000950123-06-008493/Section5.asp |title=20-F SEC Filing, filed by Fiat S P A on 30 June 2006 |accessdate=5 April 2008|work=sec.edgar-online.com[/tpl] 
Marchionne reduced Fiat's managerial bureaucracy refocused the business on markets and profit. While chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, dealt with politicians and unions, Marchionne rebuilt the car business. The success of the Grande Punto model was in large part responsible for the turnaround in Fiat's fortunes, but the award-winning 500 cemented it. Fiat formed a joint venture with India's TATA Motors, which has subsequently ended,[tpl]cite news|title=After split with Tata Motors, Fiat begins its solo India ride|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-11/news/38463206_1_tata-fiat-jv-tata-motors-outlets|work=Economic Times|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=11 April 2013[/tpl]  and with China's Chery Motors which didn't conclude.

Under Marchionne Fiat also re-entered several large markets that it had exited years before, such as Mexico and Australia. 
In December 2008, Marchionne announced Fiat had to become one of the top five automakers to survive in the long run. Under Marchionne´s leadership, Fiat returned to Canadian and American markets with the new 500. However, since 2009, Marchionne has presided over a business that has experienced a loss in European market share from 9.3 to 6.2 percent.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-09/fiat-looks-to-maseratis-jeeps-and-the-cute-little-500-for-a-jumpstart |title=Fiat Looks to Maseratis, Jeeps, and the Cute Little 500 for a Jump-Start |first=Carol |last=Matlack  |date=9 December 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg Business Week |accessdate=11 December 2013 [/tpl] In December 2013, Marchionne announced that he intended to discontinue the Grande Punto so that the company could focus on "cool, high margin" Fiat 500 (2007) variants and the Fiat Panda.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.carscoops.com/2013/12/fiat-reportedly-plans-to-invest-9.html |title=Fiat Reportedly Plans to Invest €9 Billion on New Models Built in Italy, Will Kill Punto |date=9 December 2013 |publisher=carscoops.com |accessdate=11 December 2013 [/tpl]
In 2010, John Elkann became the Chairman of Fiat SpA and shareholders approved a plan to demerger Fiat's capital goods businesses. Agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer CNH Global NV, truck maker Iveco, and the industrial and marine division of Fiat Powertrain Technologies were spun off into a new group on 1 January 2011. The parent company, Fiat Industrial S.p.A., was listed on the Milan stock exchange on 3 January 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51544720100916|title=Fiat shareholders approve corporate split|date=16 September 2010|first=Ian|last=Simpson|newspaper=Reuters[/tpl]

===Acquisition of Chrysler===

On 20 January 2009, Fiat S.p.A. and Chrysler LLC announced their intention to form a global alliance. Under the terms of the agreement, Fiat would take a 20% stake in Chrysler and gain access to its North American distribution network in exchange for providing Chrysler with technology and platforms to build smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles in the US and providing reciprocal access to Fiat's global distribution network.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.autonews.com/article/20090120/COPY01/301209861/1128|title=Fiat confirms plan to acquire 35% stake in Chrysler |accessdate=20 January 2009|work=autonews.com/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040826/http://www.autonews.com/article/20090120/COPY01/301209861/1128 |archivedate = 24 January 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/industry/01/chrysler/2001_statement.html|title=20.01.2009 Fiat to take equitiy stake in Chrysler as alliance is announced |accessdate=20 January 2009 |work=italiaspeed.com/2009[/tpl] Agreements were signed on 30 April 2009,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiatspa.com/en-US/media_center/press_release/Pages/home.aspx?PYear=2009|title= Press release |publisher=Fiat |accessdate=9 January 2013 [/tpl] with Fiat's future shareholding capped at 49% until all government loans had been repaid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiatgroup.com/en-us/mediacentre/press/Documents/2010/Clarifications_on_certain_issues_relating_to_the_Chrysler_Fiat_Alliance.pdf|title=Clarifications on certain issues relating to the Chrysler-Fiat Alliance|accessdate=6 December 2010|work=fiatgroup.com/en-us/mediacentre[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-01-04/fiat-may-increase-chrysler-stake-to-51-before-ipo.html|title=Fiat May Increase Chrysler Stake to 51% Before IPO|accessdate=4 January 2011|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek  [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]
In addition, the proposed agreement would entitle Fiat to receive a further 15% (without cash consideration) through the achievement of specific product and commercial objectives. No cash or financial support was required from Fiat under the agreement. Instead it would obtain its stake mainly in exchange for covering the cost of retooling a Chrysler plant to produce one or more Fiat models for in the US. Fiat would also provide engine and transmission technology to enable Chrysler to introduce smaller, fuel-efficient models in the NAFTA market.
The deal was engineered by Fiat chief Sergio Marchionne, who pulled the Italian group back from the brink of collapse after taking over in 2004. The principal objective of the partnership was to provide both groups with significantly enhanced economies of scale and geographical reach at a time when they were struggling to compete with larger and more global rivals such as Toyota, Volkswagen and alliance partners  Renault S.A. and Nissan.[tpl]cite news |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123238519459294991.html?mod=special_page_campaign2008_mostpop | work=The Wall Street Journal |title= Fiat Nears Stake in Chrysler That Could Lead to Takeover | first1=Stacy |last1= Meichtry |first2= John |last2= Stoll |date= 20 January 2009[/tpl]
Fiat would not have to pay any money for its 20% of Chrysler. On 7 June 2009, the Indiana State Police Pension Fund, the Indiana Teacher's Retirement Fund, and the state's Major Moves Construction Fund asked the US Supreme Court to delay the sale of Chrysler to Fiat while they challenge the deal. The funds argued that the sale went against US bankruptcy law because it unlawfully rewarded unsecured creditors ahead of secured creditors.Court asked to stop Chrysler sale, BBC, 7 June 2009 On 9 June 2009, the Supreme Court lifted the temporary hold, clearing the way for Fiat to acquire Chrysler.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124453532783397365.html|title=Supreme Court Won't Block Chrysler-Fiat Deal|accessdate=9 June 2009|work=online.wsj.com/article | first1=Mark H. | last1=Anderson | first2=Neil | last2=King Jr | date=10 June 2009[/tpl] See Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler for more information. On 10 June, the Supreme Court announced that Fiat was now an owner of the new Chrysler a.k.a. Chrysler Group LLC.
Marchionne was appointed CEO of Chrysler following its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings. Under his leadership, Chrysler has taken on a structure similar to that of Fiat and has released, in quick succession, a large number of completely redesigned or refreshed vehicles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]  Fiat launched its 500, which had been available in Europe since 2007, in the United States and Canada in 2011, marking the company's return to the American auto market, which it had been absent from since 1984.  Prior to this, Fiat's main presence on the continent was Mexico, where it offers a greater variety of products than in the United States and Canada.

===Fiat Argentina===

Fiat has been present in Argentina since the beginning of the 20th century. There was a Fiat manufacturing plant in Córdoba at least as far back as 1954 when Fiat entered into a joint venture with two local companies to manufacture tractors. The company was known as Fiat-Concord until 1980. In 1959 the construction of a car plant in Caseros was approved, and 1960 saw the production there of the first Argentinian produced Fiat passenger car, a Fiat 600, after the Fiat 1100 Export and after in 1963 the Fiat 1500. In 1977 appears the Fiat 133, just a rebadged Seat 133 but made in Argentina. By 1978 a car manufacturing facility was well established in Córdoba, producing Fiat 128s as well as two models which from the Italian perspective belonged in earlier decades, the 125 (with some derivates) and the 600R.[tpl]cite journal| title = Bunte Mischung: Wo und welche Fiat-Modelle in aller Welt produziert werden | journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=7 |page=15 |date=29 March 1978[/tpl]
In 1980 a joint venture with PSA called Sevel Argentina S.A. was begun, which lasted until 1995. The current day automobile manufacturing started with a new factory opened in Córdoba on 20 December 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autohistoria.com.ar/Historias/Fiat_Argentina.htm|title=Historia de Fiat en Argentina|language=Spain|accessdate=21 May 2009|work=auto-historia.com.ar[/tpl] From April 1997 the Siena and Palio models production started.
Production was suspended in the early 2000s as the Argentinean economy went downhill. In 2008 Fiat invested new money and the production of Fiat Siena saloon and the Fiat Palio was started. In October 2009, a Fiat Siena HLX becomes the 2 million unit produced by Fiat in Argentina.

===Fiat Automobili Srbija===

Its first enterprise came in 1955, when it agreed to a deal with Yugoslav carmaker Zastava to assemble Fiats for Eastern Europe. The first cars produced by Zastava were its versions of the Fiat 1300 and Fiat 1400. By 1970, Zastava was producing parts for the newer Fiat 124 and Fiat 125 models, which were assembled in Poland. The Zastava 750, launched in 1962, was Zastava's version of the iconic Fiat 600 minicar. It outlived the car on which it was based, with production lasting until 1981. Zastavas were not popular outside of Eastern Europe before the 1980s, although they were exported to the US and several European countries under the Yugo brand during the 1980s.
The most famous product launched by Zastava is the Zastava 101, a front-wheel drive car based on the Fiat 128, also available as a hatchback version never sold in Italy. With the demise of the Zastava 750 in 1981, the minicar gap in the Zastava range was filled by the Zastava Koral, which was best known in Britain and America as the Yugo Tempo or Yugo 45/55. It was based on the 1971 Fiat 127, which was due to be replaced by the Fiat Uno in 1983. Hostility towards Yugoslavia in the wake of the 1992 civil unrest saw a swift ending of imports to both Britain and America. The Zastava factory in Kragujevac was later bombed, but was rebuilt after the war ended, and production continued at another factory in Kragujevac.
In 1987, Zastava came up with a new car design. The Zastava Florida—known in other markets as the Yugo Sana—was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro at the ItalDesign studio, featured a range of refined Peugeot engines. Sales continued in its homeland, with an update at the end of the 1990s. Zastava did not launch another new car for another 16 years. The 2003 Zastava 10 model was another Fiat design—this time the second generation Punto, and in 2009 was renamed Fiat Punto Classic
A new memorandum of understanding between Fiat and the Serb ministry of economic and regional development about the acquisition of Zastava's Kragujevac plant in 2008 led to a new company being set up in which the Italians would have a 70 percent stake and the Serb government 30 percent.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/04/30/afx4951532.html|title=Fiat signs agreement with Serb govt to acquire Zastava's Kragujevac plant|accessdate=21 October 2009|work=forbes.com/feeds|date=30 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019041914/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/04/30/afx4951532.html|archivedate=19 October 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The factory was renamed from "Zastava Automobili Srbija" to "Fiat Automobili Srbija".

===Polski Fiat/FSO (Poland)===

Fiat automobiles have been made in Poland since 1920. In 1932, the Polskie Zakłady Inżynieryjne (Polish Engineering Works, PZInż) started the production of Fiat 508, produced until 1939 also as a military vehicle. In 1936 the licence was extended to include the Fiat 518 model. In 1965, the Polish communist government signed a deal with Fiat to produce selected Fiat models in Poland at the FSO factory in Warsaw that had been built in 1951. Production of the new car—the Polski Fiat 125p—began in 1967. It was visually identical to the Fiat 125, but it made use of older Fiat mechanicals which dated back to 1960. The car sold well in its homeland and was soon exported to Western Europe. 1978 saw the appearance of a new five-door hatchback, the FSO Polonez, that made use of Fiat 125p running gear. After 1982, Fiat withdrew its licence; since then FSO badge was reinstated with the Polski Fiat 125p surviving until 1991, and the Polonez production ending in 2002. FSO was taken over by Daewoo of South Korea in 1995, and become independent again in late 2000, after Daewoo went bankrupt and was taken over by General Motors. 
Fabryka Samochodów Małolitrażowych (FSM) in Bielsko-Biała and Tychy was a joint venture between FSO and Fiat, and manufactured the Fiat 126(p) in 1973 and the Cinquecento in 1991. In 1992 Fiat owned 90% of FSM (called Fiat Auto Poland, since 1993) and since then it produced Cinquecento, Uno, Seicento, Siena and Palio Weekend models with the capacity up to 200.000 cars a year. In 2003, FSM become the sole producer of Fiat Panda, and in 2007, the Fiat 500 and its related Ford Ka[tpl]cite web|title=Ford Ka|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/ford/ka/road-test/1.2-zetec|work=Top Gear|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=December 2008[/tpl] Capacity was increased with production reaching over 600,000 in 2009, but dropped below 300,000 in 2013, resulting in the workforce being cut by a third.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/fiat-poland-idUSL5E8N790J20121207 |title=UPDATE 2-Fiat Poland to slash workforce as slack demand bites |date=December 7, 2012 | work=Reuters[/tpl]

===AutoVAZ Lada (Russia)===

In 1966, Fiat helped USSR state industries build a new car factory (AvtoVAZ) on the Volga river. A planned city called Tolyatti (named after Palmiro Togliatti, former Italian Communist Party Secretary) was developed around the factory, which started producing a "people's car" similar to the Volkswagen Beetle and Citroën 2CV of Germany and France. The new Soviet car, called the Lada, was a more spacious offering, in four-door saloon and five-door estate variants. Fiat installed British machine tools supplied by Herbert-BSA[tpl]cite web|url=http://bsamachinetools.com/main.htm |title=Main |publisher=Bsamachinetools.com |accessdate=27 April 2009[/tpl] of Birmingham for the manufacture of many Lada parts. The 124's design was mechanically upgraded to survive treacherous Russian driving conditions and extremely cold winters. Imports to Western Europe, Canada, and some third world countries sold well owing to their low price. This car was upgraded to become the Lada Riva (marketing name in some markets) in 1980. Lada has gone on to develop some of its own models. The four-wheel drive Lada Niva uses some Fiat based components, e.g. engine and gearbox, but the body and four-wheel drive system are VAZ designs.
