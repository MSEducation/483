[[Pacific Maritime Association]]

CATEGORIES: Trade associations

The principal business of the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) is to negotiate and administer labor agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). PMA’s 72 members are cargo carriers, terminal operators and stevedores that operate along the U.S. West Coast. 

==Background==

Despite some fluctuations in recent years, containerized cargo movement through West Coast ports has risen dramatically in the past two decades – to a total of just over 15 million loaded container TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). As a result, West Coast port operations (including non-containerized cargo such as bulk and autos) support 8 million U.S. jobs, according to a 2008 report.
The domestic business impact of West Coast port trade is roughly equivalent to the GDP of Canada or South Korea.
As of December 2012, PMA members employed nearly 14,000 registered longshore, clerk and foreman workers at 29 West Coast ports in California, Oregon and Washington, and thousands more “casual” workers, who typically work part-time. Since the 2002 agreement that brought the widespread use of technology to the West Coast, the registered workforce has increased by 32 percent.
