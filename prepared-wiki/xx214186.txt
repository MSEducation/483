In 1991 he was elected deputy mayor, and in 1994 he became mayor of Tinn municipality. Representing the Centre Party, he became the first non-Labour mayor of Tinn since 1945. With Ulleren at the helm, the Centre Party almost reached 45% in polls. Ulleren was re-elected in 1995 for a second four-year term, but on 10 May 1999, some months before the 1999 election, he was appointed State Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as a part of the first cabinet Bondevik.Kjell Magne Bondevik's First Government. 17 October 1997–17 March 2000 — Government.no Subsequently, the Centre Party in Tinn plummeted with 27.3 percentage points. Ulleren lost his State Secretary position when the first cabinet Bondevik lost a vote of no confidence on 17 March 2000.

===Leaving politics===

When his tenure as State Secretary ended, Ulleren did not return to local politics. Instead, he was hired as director in Bioparken. He also served as chair of Akvaforsk, and later as a member of the board of the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority and of Blefjell Hospital Trust.[tpl]cite news|url=http://telen.no/article/20081028/NYHET01/206110678|title=–Blefjell-deling kan bety fare for liv og helse|last=Andersen|first=Kai|date=28 October 2008|work=Telen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl] He was also a member of the Norwegian Council for Quality Improvement and Priority Setting in Health Care. Ulleren stopped paying the membership fee for the Centre Party in 2001,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationen.no/landbruk/article3988904.ece|title=Kritisk til Ulleren-utnemning|last=Aase|first=Bjarne Bekkeheien|date=13 December 2008|work=Nationen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl] and in 2006 he described himself as "without a political attachment".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.siste.no/Innenriks/article2489735.ece|title=Vil se på kommunestrukturen på nytt|author=Avisenes Nyhetsbyrå|date=28 December 2006|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl]
In 2002 Ulleren was hired as general director of the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS). In addition to the usual task of negotiating wages with the trade unions of employees in the municipal sector, Ulleren marked himself as more politically involved than several of his predecessors. Notably, in 2006 Ulleren proposed that a Norwegian municipal reform be considered. In light of the recent reform in Denmark, it has been suggested that the number of municipalities of Norway be reduced, through mergers, from the current tally at around 430. Ulleren stated while a direct import of the Danish model was undesirable, something should be done in the way of merging some municipalities. Ulleren has also supported a regional reform. In 2003 he predicted the future abolishment of the county municipality and the county council,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article615419.ece|title=- Siste eller nest siste fylkestingsvalg|last=Ruud|first=Solveig|date=1 September 2003|work=Aftenposten|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl] though at the end of his term in 2009, both still existed.

===Civil servant===

In late 2008, it was announced that Ulleren would become the new permanent under-secretary of State in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in 2009, succeeding Per Harald Grue who was due to retire.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bondebladet.no/nyhetsarkiv/2008/2008/12/12/olav-ulleren-blir-ny-departementsraad.aspx|title=Olav Ulleren blir ny departementsråd|last=Åsen|first=Arne|date=12 December 2008|work=Bondebladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The permanent under-secretary of State is the highest-ranking position in a Ministry, except for the partisan positions of Minister and State Secretary.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=549258|title=KS-direktøren blir ny departementsråd|author=Norwegian News Agency|date=12 December 2008|work=Bondebladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl] Among the tasks in the Ministry of Agriculture is to represent the state party in the annual general price settlement on agricultural produce.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nationen.no/landbruk/article3987428.ece|title=Blir ny landbrukstopp|last=Aase|first=Bjarne Bekkeheien|date=12 December 2008|work=Nationen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 December 2008[/tpl]
The decision to appoint Ulleren was criticized by Hans Frode Asmyhr of the Progress Party for being a perceived consolidation of the Centre Party. First, the Minister who was responsible for the appointment, Lars Peder Brekk, represents the Centre Party. Second, Asmyhr insinuated that the other parties in the agricultural settlement also represented the Centre Party.Quote: [tpl]Lang|no|"Nå vil det sitje Sp-sympatisørar på alle sider av bordet."[/tpl] In English: "Now, sympathizers of the Centre Party will be seated on all sides of the table." (remark made by Asmyhr, written by the journalist in Nynorsk) While both leaders of the main farmers' interest organizations, Pål Haugstad of the Norwegian Agrarian Association and Ole-Anton Teigen of the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union, did support the appointment, Teigen is an active politician for the Socialist Left Party.[tpl]Stortingetbio|OLT|name=Ole-Anton Teigen[/tpl] Lars Peder Brekk deemed Asmyhr's allegations to be "clear-cut piffle", citing that Ulleren had the necessary qualifications for the position. In addition, other politicians from opposition parties, including Leif Helge Kongshaug (Liberal) and Torbjørn Hansen (Conservative), defended the appointment of Ulleren.
