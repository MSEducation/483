The 9-2 was thought to developed in a joint venture with another automaker, probably European. Although little is known about the design, those who have seen it report it is the same teardrop shape as the 1949–1956 Saab 92, but also futuristic with the front similar to the new Saab 9-5.http://blogs.motortrend.com/6661914/corporate/exclusive-victor-muller-shows-us-new-saab-92-sketch-calls-it-top-priority/index.html/ Saab Managing Director Jan-Åke Jonsson said the model would likely not be on the global GM Gamma platform.[tpl]cite web | last = Bergman | first = Björn | date = 2008-10-01 | url = http://www.automotorsport.se/news/15729/saab-planerar-9-1-p%C3%A5-egen-plattform/ | title = Saab planerar 9-1 på egen plattform  | work = Auto Motor & Sport| accessdate = 2009-08-24[/tpl]
