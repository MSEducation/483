Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī (828–896 A.D) ([tpl]lang-ar|أبو حنيفة الدينوري[/tpl]) was a Muslim polymath excelling as much in astronomy, agriculture, botany and metallurgy and  as he did in geography, mathematics and history.  He was born in the region of Dinawar, halfway between Hamadan and Kermanshah in modern-day western Iran. He studied astronomy, mathematics and mechanics in Isfahan and philology and poetry in Kufa and Basra. He died on July 24, 896 at Dinawar. His most renowned contribution is Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany. He also wrote a book on the ancestry of the Kurds titled Ansab al-Akrad. There is no consensus regarding his ethnic background among scholars. Ludwig Adamec considers him to be of Kurdish descent, while Encyclopedia of Islam classifies him as an Arab philologist and scientist, however, Encyclopaedia Iranica lists him as Persian.

His General History (al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa'id Rafi'i, 1911; 'Abd al-Munim 'Amir & Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj 'Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jacksonbonner.com/current-projects/abu-hanifah-ahmad-ibn-dawud-al-dinawari |title=Abu Hanifa Ahmad ibn Dawud ibn Wanand al-Dinawari (A.D. 828-895) - Michael Richard Jackson Bonner |publisher=Jacksonbonner.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07[/tpl]

==Book of Plants==

===Botany===

Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters sin to ya. He also discusses plant evolution from its birth to its death, describing the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit.[tpl]citation|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815[/tpl], in [tpl]Citation |last1=Morelon |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-12410-7 |pages=813–852[/tpl]
Many of the Muslim early Botanical works are lost, such as that of Al-Shaybani (d.820), Ibn Al-Arabi (d.844), Al-Bahili (d.845) and Ibn as-Sikkit (d.857), but their works, however, are extensively quoted in later books by Abu Hanifa Al-Dinawari.

===Astronomy and meteorology===

Parts of al-Dinawari's Book of Plants deals with the applications of Islamic astronomy and meteorology to agriculture. It describes the astronomical and meteorological character of the sky, the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, the anwa (heavenly bodies of rain), and atmospheric phenomena  such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, floods, valleys, rivers, lakes, wells and other sources of water.

===Earth sciences===

Parts of al-Dinawari's Book of Plants deals with the Earth sciences in the context of agriculture. He considers the Earth, stone and sands, and describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground.
