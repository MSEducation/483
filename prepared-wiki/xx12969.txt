China was ruled by Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty during the 1830s. The decade witnessed a rapid rise in the sale of opium in China, despite efforts by Daoguang to end the trade.Peter Ward Fay, The Opium War, 1840-1842: Barbarians in the Celestial Empire in the Early Part of the Nineteenth Century and the Way by Which They Forced the Gates Ajar (Chapel Hill, North Carolina:: University of North Carolina Press,  1975).  A turning point came in 1834, with the end of the monopoly of the British East India Company, leaving trade in the hands of private entrepreneurs. By 1838, opium sales climbed to 40,000 chests.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Greenberg (economist)|title=British Trade and the Opening of China 1800-1841|format=preview|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=QNo8AAAAIAAJ|page=113 | quote=expansion in imports from 16,550 chests in the season 1831-2 to over 30,000 in 1835-6, and 40,000 in 1838-9[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|editor1-last=Ebrey|editor1-first=Patricia Buckley|editor1-link=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-19620-8|page=236|edition=second|chapter=9.

Lin also closed the channel to Canton, leading to the seizure and destruction of 20,000 chests of opium.[tpl]cite web |first=Leon |last=Poon |url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/modern.html#opium |title=Emergence Of Modern China |publisher=University of Maryland |date= |accessdate=22 Dec 2008[/tpl]  The United Kingdom retaliated, seizing Hong Kong on August 23 of that year, starting what would be known as the First Opium War.  It would end three years later with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.

=====Royalty=====

In 1830, William IV succeeded his brother George IV as King of the United Kingdom.  Upon his death in 1837, his 18-year-old niece Queen Victoria acceded to the throne. where she would reign for more than 63 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/icons-timeline/1820-1840|title=Icons, a portrait of England 1820–1840|accessdate=2007-09-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070922055840/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/icons-timeline/1820-1840|archivedate=22 September 2007|deadurl=no[/tpl] Under Salic law, the Kingdom of Hanover passes to William's brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, ending the personal union of Britain and Hanover which has persisted since 1714.  Queen Victoria took up residence in Buckingham Palace, the first reigning British monarch to make this, rather than St James's Palace, her London home.[tpl]cite book|title=Penguin Pocket On This Day|publisher=Penguin Reference Library|isbn=0-14-102715-0|year=2006[/tpl]

=====Politics and Law=====

The United Kingdom had four prime ministers during the 1830s.  As the decade began, Tory Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington led parliament.  Wellington's government fell in late 1830, failing to react to calls for reform.Holmes (2002). p. 283.  The Whigs selected Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey to succeed him, who led passage of many reforms, including the Reform Act 1832, the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire), and the Factory Acts (limiting child labour).
In 1834 Grey retired from public life, leaving Lord Melbourne as his successor. Reforms continued under Lord Melbourne, with the  Poor Law Amendment Act in 1834, which stated that no able-bodied British man could receive assistance unless he entered a workhouse.  King William IV's opposition to the Whigs' reforming ways led him to dismiss Melbourne in November, appointing Sir Robert Peel to form a Tory government. an opportunity to form a government. Peel's failure to win a House of Commons majority in the resulting general election (January 1835) made it impossible for him to govern, and the Whigs returned to power under Melbourne in April 1835.  The Marriage Act 1836 established civil marriage and registration systems that permit marriages in nonconformist chapels, and a Registrar General of Births, Marriages, and Deaths.wikisource:1836 (33) Registration of Births &c.

There were protests and significant unrest during the decade.  In May and June 1831 in Wales, coal miners and others rioted for improved working conditions in what was known as the Merthyr Rising. William Howley Archbishop of Canterbury has his coach attacked by an angry mob on his first official visit to Canterbury in 1832.  In 1834, Robert Owen organized the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, an early attempt to form a national union confederation.  In May 1838, the People's Charter was drawn up in the United Kingdom, demanding universal suffrage.  Chartism continued to gain popularity, leading to the Newport Rising in 1839, the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain.
In 1835, James Pratt and John Smith were hanged outside Newgate Prison in London after a conviction of sodomy, the last deadly victims of the judicial persecution of homosexual men in England.See http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/newgate.html 2012

In 1830, France invaded and quickly seized Ottoman Regency of Algiers, and rapidly took control of other coastal communities. Fighting would continue throughout the decade, with the French pitted against forces under Ahmed Bey at Constantine, primarily in the east, and nationalist forces in Kabylie and the west.  The French made treaties with the nationalists under `Abd al-Qādir, enabling them to capture Constantine in 1837.  Al-Qādir continued to give stiff resistance in the west, which lasted throughout the decade (and well into the 1840s, with Al-Qādir surrendering in 1847).

Many key discoveries about electricity were made in the 1830s.  Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in 1831; however, Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments.[tpl]cite book|last=Ulaby|first=Fawwaz|title=Fundamentals of applied electromagnetics|edition=5th|year=2007|url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0132413264/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&v=glance|publisher=Pearson:Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-241326-4|page=255[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html|title=Joseph Henry|accessdate=2006-11-30|work=Distinguished Members Gallery, National Academy of Sciences[/tpl]  Electromagnetic induction is the production of a potential difference (voltage) across a conductor when it is exposed to a varying magnetic field.  This discovery was essential to the invention of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.[tpl]cite book|author=Sadiku, M. N.

In 1834, Michael Faraday's published his research regarding the quantitative relationships in electrochemical reactions, now known as Faraday's laws of electrolysis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ehl, Rosemary Gene|author2= Ihde, Aaron | title = Faraday's Electrochemical Laws and the Determination of Equivalent Weights | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | year = 1954 | volume = 31 | issue = May | pages = 226–232 | doi = 10.1021/ed031p226 | bibcode=1954JChEd..31..226E[/tpl]  Also in 1834, Jean C. A. Peltier  discovered the Peltier "effect", which is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors.  In 1836, John Daniell invented a primary cell in which hydrogen was eliminated in the generation of the electricity.
