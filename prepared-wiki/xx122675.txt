Ruling Bunt clans irrespective of whether they use the title Ballal or not are colloquially and collectively referred to as Ballal Bunt. The origin of the title Ballal is explained by a proverb which goes when a Bunt becomes powerful he becomes a Ballal.Thurston, Edgar; K. Rangachari (1909). Castes and Tribes of Southern India Volume 1.Pg. 145 Madras: Government Press Some Bunts who use the surname Ballal also trace direct maternal descent from the Bunt princess Krishnayitayi and her husband the Hoysala Emperor, Veera Ballala III. In modern times apart from the Bunts some Tulu speaking Shivalli Brahmin families of high socio-religious position and some Deshastha Brahmin families also use the surname Ballal.
