Rosais is a civil parish in the municipality of Velas in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores.  Although the 2001 statistics have identified approximately 800 residents in the parish, estimates from 2003 show 1123 people inhabitants, in an area of [tpl]convert|24.44|km2|mi2[/tpl] (its density was about 33 people per kilometre square).

==History==

Rosais already existed as a parish since 1568, when the first documents started appearing. It was considered the barn for the island of São Jorge, due to its great fertility and, event today, supports rich pasturelands.

==Geography==

The parish of Rosais is located on the island of São Jorge and extends approximately [tpl]convert|7|km|mi[/tpl] from Figueiras to Ponta, and approximately 820 inhabitants (2001 census).
The western corner of the island is essentially a plateau, with tall cliffs, until the Ponta dos Rosais, where the islands lighthouse stands as a beacon. The rest of the parish is pasture-lands and very small agglomerations, although the Parque Florestal das Sete Fontes breaks a portion of the territory. The Sete Fontes, which green-spaces and animal pens, realizes an annual festivals in honour of the emigrants that built the island.
Although many of the cliffs are shear drops, there are some debris fields along the coast that give rise to the islands' fajãs. In particular is the Fajã de João Dias, located five minutes by foot from the cliff tops, a small enclave of buildings where many of the early settlers established homes.
