Peter Millar (1929 â€“ 2003) was an American illustrator, cartoonist, and drag racer best known for his work with CARtoons and DRAGtoons magazines. Millar often used the pen names Arin Cee and Millarkey.  
What most aren't aware of is that Pete was a brilliant bronze sculptor with his main emphasis on early western art depicting dramatic scenes of horseback riding; featuring cowboys, bronc riders, mountain men, native Americans, and more, all of which are rare and highly collectible worldwide.  His pieces are signed and numbered, usually limited to 200-300 per sculpture. They often sell for thousands and one of his pieces was recently being offered in an art gallery in a famous Las Vegas casino.
His sculpting began after his daughter brought home some clay for a school art project! He had fun with the clay and progressed from there.  He was eventually commissioned by major gallery's to produce works for their clientele. If you find a Millar bronze then cherish and hang onto it for it is a very rare and valued find indeed!
Millar co-created the Petersen Publication CARtoons magazine in 1959, which ended its run in 1991. The first issue of CARtoons included the story of the hot rod community as a social collective and introduced the term Rumpsville. He worked on the project until 1963, when he was replaced by Hot Rod Magazine editor and Stroker McGurk creator Tom Medley.
In June 1963 Millar founded DRAGcartoons under the Millar Publications label. He worked on this project well into the 1970s . Millar Publications also produced four issues of the popular Ed "Big Daddy" Roth Magazine.
