[[Dii languages]]

CATEGORIES: Adamawa languages, Languages of Cameroon

The Dii language is a dialect cluster in the Duru branch of Savanna languages. Yag Dii is the ethnonym.
Ethnologue lists Mambe’, Mamna’a, Goom, Boow, Ngbang, Sagzee, Vaazin, Home, Nyok as dialects, and notes that Goom may be a separate language. Blench (2004) lists them all, as well as Phaane, as separate languages, no closer to each other than they are to the other Dii languages, Duupa, Dugun (Panõ).
