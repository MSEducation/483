CATEGORIES: Mountains of Egypt

Mount Serbal is a mountain located in Wadi Feiran in southern Sinai, sometimes identified in texts as Gebel Serbal.  At [tpl]convert|2070|m|ft|0[/tpl] high, it is the fifth highest mountain in Egypt. It is part of the St. Catherine National Park. It is thought by some to be the Biblical Mount Sinai.[tpl]Who|date=September 2011[/tpl]
There were many granite dwellings on Mount Serbal which were inhabited by anchorites in early Christian times, and there are traces of a fourth-century monastery close to its base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14011a.htm|publisher=New Advent, The Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Sinai[/tpl] It is likely that the many inscriptions (some in Greek) found on rocks at the foot of Mount Serbal and the path up to its peak date from these times. One spot on the path is called Mokatteb, or the valley of writing.[tpl]cite book|title=History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11|author=Rappoport, S.[/tpl]
