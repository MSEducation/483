Cap-Rouge ([tpl]lang-en|Red Cape[/tpl]) is located in central Quebec, Canada on the Saint Lawrence River within  the Borough Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge in Quebec City. The site of the first attempted permanent European settlement in North America, Cap-Rouge was long a town on its own before being incorporated within Québec on January 1, 2002.

==History==

In 1541 Jacques Cartier wintered  with 400 people at present-day Cap-Rouge. Named Charlesbourg-Royal, the encampment  was abandoned in June 1542 due to harsh weather and attacks from neighbouring Iroquoians of Stadacona and other villages.[tpl]cite book|author1=Conrad Heidenreich|author2=K.

In August 2006, Quebec Premier Jean Charest and Canadian archaeologists under Yves Chretien announced the discovery of this long-lost settlement. Chretien identified its location from fragments of a decorated c.1540-1550 Italian style ceramic plate and six wood timber samples dated to the mid-16th century by a United States laboratory.[tpl]cite web|title=Pottery shard unearths North America's first French settlement|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=edd7eac6-f566-4011-87d7-82becfc883a2&k=48975|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=May 3, 2012|author=Canwest News Service|date=August 22, 2006[/tpl] 
Re-occupied during the French colonisation effort of the 17th century, the area remained agricultural until the 1960s when residential developments transformed it into a suburb of Québec City.

==Attractions==

In addition to its long history, the main attraction of Cap-Rouge is the towering "Tracel" rail-road bridge. Built in 1907-1908 with the participation of Gustave Eiffel, the steel trestle was constructed under the authority of the National Transcontinental as part of the Winnipeg-Moncton trunk. It spans 3,335 feet at an average of 172 feet above ground and is still in use today.
