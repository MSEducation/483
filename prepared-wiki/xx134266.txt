==History==

Green Corps was founded in 1992 by Gina Cummings and Leslie Samuelrich to train young people to become environmental organizers.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Chronicle of Philanthropy |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Green-Corps/59428/ |title= Green Corps |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] These graduates have since become leaders of the environmental and social change fields, holding positions with the Sierra Club,[tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdqXfOAHo1M |title= Sarah Hodgdon, Green Corps class of 1994 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PjU8ePQUT4 |title= Sarah Hodgdon: Sierra Club, Director of Conservation on saving the planet |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] Greenpeace,[tpl]cite web |publisher=Grist.org |url=http://grist.org/article/2009-04-14-greenpeaces-new-leader-talks/|title= Greenpeace’s new leader talks up need for a green grassroots |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl] and MoveOn.org.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_Vya9Dc-Ac |title= Firsthand: Justin's GC experience |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
Green Corps was founded in response to the momentum created by Earth Day in 1990.  Interest and desire to act burgeoned on university campuses around the country, producing graduates who were passionate and ready to contribute to the movement but who were faced with an obstacle—how do you find a position with one of these activist groups with minimal experience?[tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIVjWhafJmI |title= Bernadette Del Chiaro, Green Corps Class of 1998 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]  This was where Green Corps came in, seeking to channel this valuable force directly into the causes that need it, through a training program involving direct fieldwork.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OFVe8tAdgY|title=Sam Landenwitsch, Green Corps class of 2007|accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl]
During the Green Corps year, participants work with veterans in the field to make progress on important campaigns.  Through partnering with these other influential groups, the Green Corps member creates valuable ties and learns from those who have been on the front lines.  Upon graduating, Green Corps members pursue careers with these leading organizations.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Youtube |url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIVjWhafJmI |title= Bernadette Del Chiaro, Green Corps Class of 1998 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl]
