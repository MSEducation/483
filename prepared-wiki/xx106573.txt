==Career and later life==

Levin spent most of his career with Time Inc. (later Time Warner, then AOL Time Warner), starting as a programming executive for Home Box Office (HBO) and eventually becoming CEO of the corporation. Levin is probably most famous for having brokered the merger between AOL and Time Warner in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, a merger which seemed to many to be disadvantageous to Time Warner as the bubble collapsed in the next few years. CNBC named him as one of the "Worst American CEOs of All Time".CNBC.com[tpl]Cn|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Murder of Jonathan Levin===

One of his children, Jonathan Levin, a 31-year-old high school English teacher at Taft High School in the Bronx, was tortured and murdered on May 31, 1997 by one of his own students.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/11/nyregion/maximum-term-in-slaying-of-teacher.html?ref=coreyarthur|title=Jurors Convict Youth in Killing Of His Teacher|author=David Rohde|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 25, 2011|date=December 11, 1998[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DF1639F937A35755C0A961958260|accessdate=August 7, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times | title=Paid Notice: Deaths LEVIN, JONATHAN|date=June 4, 1997[/tpl] The student, Corey Arthur, was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison in November 1998. A purported accomplice, Montoun Hart, was acquitted on the same charges in February 1999. While Hart had written a confession, jurors were not able to find out how it was obtained and felt it was unreliable.[tpl]cn|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The murder occurred after Jonathan had mentioned in the classroom that his father was Time-Warner head Gerald M. Levin. The former student, Corey Arthur, assumed that Jonathan was rich. Arthur stole Jonathan's bank card and got the account's PIN, obtaining about $200 from the account.[tpl]cn|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications in The Bronx, New York City, is named after the murdered teacher.
