Alan Stuart "Al" Franken (born May 21, 1951) is an American politician who is the junior United States Senator from Minnesota, where he has served since 2009. A member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, an affiliate of the Democratic Party, he narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman in 2008. Prior to serving in the Senate, he was a writer and performer for the television show Saturday Night Live (SNL) from its inception in 1975 to 1980 and from 1985 to 1995.
After leaving SNL, he wrote and acted in movies and television shows. He also hosted a nationally syndicated, political radio talk show, The Al Franken Show, and authored six books, four of which are political satires critical of right-wing politics.
Franken declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2007 and after a close race, he trailed Coleman by 215 votes. After a statewide manual recount, required because of the closeness of the election, Franken was declared the winner by a margin of 312 votes.

==Saturday Night Live==

Franken and Davis were recruited as two of the original writers (and occasional performers) on Saturday Night Live (SNL) (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In Season 1 of SNL, as apprentice writers, the two shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken received seven Emmy nominations and three awards for his television writing and producing while creating such characters as self-help guru Stuart Smalley. Another routine proclaimed the 1980s to be the "Al Franken Decade".[tpl]cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/you-can-call-me-senator|title=Al Franken: You Can Call Me Senator|work=Harvard Magazine |first=Jesse|last=Kornbluth|date= March–April 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2012[/tpl] Franken and Davis wrote the script to the 1986 comedy film One More Saturday Night, appearing in it as rock singers in a band called "Bad Mouth". They also appeared in minor roles in All You Need Is Cash and in the Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd film Trading Places.
Franken mocked controversial NBC president Fred Silverman as "a total unequivocal failure" and displayed a chart showing the poor ratings of NBC programs. As a result of this sketch, Silverman refused Lorne Michaels' request that Franken succeed him as head producer, prompting Franken to leave the show when Michaels did, at the end of the 1979–80 season.Shales, Tom, Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests, p. 191.

Franken signed a one-year contract in early 2004 to host a talk show for Air America Radio's flagship program with co-host Katherine Lanpher, who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The Al Franken Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, five days a week for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived to be the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: "I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected," he told a New York Times reporter in 2004.[tpl]Cite news|last=Shorto |first=Russell |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E6DA1731F932A15750C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=8 |title=Al Franken, Seriously So — |work=New York Times |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=July 9, 2009[/tpl] Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, at the end of which Franken announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.Al Franken to leave Air America - Radio - MSNBC.com
Franken wrote the original screenplay and starred in the film Stuart Saves His Family which was not generally commercially or critically successful. Franken also co-wrote the film When a Man Loves a Woman, co-created and starred in the NBC sitcom LateLine, and appeared in the 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate.
In 2003, Franken served as a Fellow with Harvard's Kennedy School of Government at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. Since 2005, Franken has been a contributor at The Huffington Post.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/|title=The Huffington Post; Al Franken|accessdate=September 26, 2012[/tpl]

==Political activism prior to election==

According to an article by Richard Corliss published in Time, "In a way, Franken has been running for office since the late '70s." Corliss also hinted at Franken's "possibly ironic role as a relentless self-promoter" in proclaiming the 1980s "the Al Franken Decade" and saying, "Vote for me, Al Franken. You'll be glad you did!"[tpl]Cite news|last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1590138,00.html |title=Vote for Me, Al Franken |work=TIME |date=February 14, 2007 |accessdate=July 9, 2009[/tpl] In 1999, Franken released a parody book, Why Not Me?, detailing his hypothetical campaign for President in 2000. He had been a strong supporter of Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and was deeply affected by the Senator's death in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election. Wellstone was a mentor and political and personal role model for Franken, with Franken stating his hopes of following in the late Senator’s footsteps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2009/07/tuesday-frankens-hand-will-be-wellstone-bible-his-thoughts-likely-many-minne|title=Tuesday, Franken's hand will be on Wellstone Bible, his thoughts likely on the many Minnesotans he's met|date=July 6, 2009|accessdate=January 5, 2013|author=Jay Weiner|work=MinnPost[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/politics/2009/07/06/dcl.keilar.franken.cnn |title=From satirist to senator |publisher=CNN |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090708212201/http://www.cnn.com/video/| archivedate= July 8, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Franken said he learned that 21% of Americans received most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, "I didn't want to sit on the sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference." In November 2003, Franken talked about moving to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need to do in order to do it."[tpl]Cite news| last = Kuhn | first = David Paul | title = Senator Franken? | url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/04/28/franken/ | date = April 28, 2005 | accessdate =February 15, 2007 | publisher=Salon.com [/tpl] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC.

Franken initially supported the Iraq War but opposed the 2007 troop surge.

However, since then he had come to believe that "we were misled into the war" and urged the Democratically controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they don't include timetables for leaving Iraq. In an interview with Josh Marshall, Franken said of the Democrats, "I think we've gotta make George W. Bush say, 'OK, I'm cutting off funding because I won't agree to a timetable.'"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014615.php |title=Joshua Marshall |publisher=Talkingpointsmemo.com |date=June 14, 2007 |accessdate=July 8, 2009[/tpl]

Preliminary reports on election night November 4 had Coleman ahead by over 700 votes; but the official results certified on by November 18, 2008, had Coleman leading by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 percent, the Secretary of State of Minnesota Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount stipulated in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion with regard to the recount. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.[tpl]cite web|author=Chris Welch and Ed Hornick |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/05/minnesota.recount/ |title=Franken declares Senate race win after state ruling |publisher=CNN |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=January 3, 2012[/tpl]

During the debate on health care reform under President Obama, many proposals were made. Franken was one of the strongest supporters of a single-payer system. He authored an amendment, called the Medical Loss Ratio, to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80% of premiums on actual health care costs, rising to 85% for large group plans.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2010/07/franken-warns-against-weakening-law-health-care-spending|title=Franken warns against weakening law on health-care spending|date=22 July 2010|first=Lauren|last=Knobbe|publisher=Minn Post|accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] In June 2013, it was reported that the amendment had saved consumers $3.4 billion on premiums and resulted in nationwide rebates of $1.1 billion in 2012 and $500 million in 2013.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://hometownsource.com/2013/06/20/sen-frankens-health-reform-provision-will-return-1-4-million-in-rebate-checks-to-thousands-of-minnesotans/|title=Sen.

Citing the case of Jamie Leigh Jones, Franken offered an amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would withhold defense contracts from companies that restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault, battery and discrimination cases to court.
