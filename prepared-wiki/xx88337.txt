The Holden Camira is a mid-size car which was produced by Holden, the Australian subsidiary of General Motors (GM) between 1982 and 1989. It was Holden's version of GM's J-body family of cars — GM's third "global" car platform. The name "Camira" comes from an Aboriginal word meaning "wind."
After an initial good sales run, Camira sales dropped significantly and the model was discontinued in 1989. The Holden Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry was introduced as the Australian market replacement, with New Zealand instead offering the European-sourced Opel Vectra. In all 151,807 Camiras were built (85,725 JBs; 36,953 JDs; and 29,129 JEs).Jeeves (2008), p. 197.

==JB (1982–1984)==

The original Camira, the JB series, was introduced in 1982 with a major trans-Tasman marketing campaign. The Camira replaced the Sunbird and Torana, although an interim four-cylinder version of the Commodore bridged the two-year production gap.
A station wagon version was introduced the following year, and its bodywork was exported to Vauxhall in the United Kingdom for the Cavalier wagon.[tpl]cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Ewan | date = 2005-05-09 | url = http://www.marque.com.au/usedcars/050509_Holden_Camira.htm | title = Holden Camira 1982-1989 | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-09-14[/tpl] Some Camiras were also exported to right-hand drive markets in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and Singapore. The wagon variant was specifically a Holden design, which Holden insisted should be part of the overall "J-car" program. A five-door hatchback, based on the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier "J-car" was proposed for the Camira, but never made it to the production stage due to Holden's financial losses at that time.
There was only one engine, the carburettored, naturally aspirated, transversely mounted 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine delivering [tpl]Convert|64|kW|hp[/tpl]. The transaxle offering was a four-speed manual on the SL and SL/X, with a five-speed unit specified to SJ and SL/E variants. A three-speed automatic was optional on all models. Power steering was optional from early 1984
The Camira was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1982. While superior to most other cars of the day in terms of ride and handling, the 1.6 litre Camtech engine was regarded as "underpowered" by much of the motoring media. While partly true, the powerplant produced similar power levels to many of its rivals, although the actual power delivery differed. Unlike traditional Australian engines that had reserves of low down torque, the Camira required a very different driving style that involved revving the engine.
Early models of the Camira suffered from a litany of quality control problems, which included smoking engines, insufficient drainage holes in the doors, poor paint quality and lack of adequate fan cooling, resulting in overheating in JB Camiras fitted with air conditioning. This tarnished the Camira's reputation and led to it being withdrawn from the New Zealand market, where a Camira-labeled Isuzu Aska was sold instead.

==JD (1984–1987)==

The second series JD Camira, released in 1984 received a facelift, with a more aerodynamic front-end and the absence of a conventional front grille. The differences were not only cosmetic, the engine was upgraded from 1.6 to a multi-point fuel injected 1.8-litre on the SL/X and SL/E models.  These changes combined allowed the engine to deliver [tpl]Convert|85|kW|hp[/tpl]. The new 1.8 litre engine was mated with a close ratio five-speed manual transmission, as opposed to the four-speed fitted to the 1.6.
In mid-1986 new emissions regulations required that all cars manufactured in Australia run on unleaded petrol. This forced another reworking of the engine (all variants prior to this ran on leaded petrol), during which time Holden was operating at a loss. The result was that Holden dropped the multi-point injection and reverted to single-point, akin to a carburettor, and altered the tuning of the engine to suit. A power-robbing catalytic converter was fitted, and power output was reduced by [tpl]convert|20|kW|hp[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|63|kW|hp[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|work=Sydney Morning Herald| date = 22 December 1986|author=Eugene Brady|title=New GM-H: content to play a lesser role|page=22[/tpl]
This engine was also used in Holden's locally manufactured compact car, the LD Astra (1987–1989), a badge engineered Nissan Pulsar (N13; 1987–1991), as well as the Pulsar itself. This was the result of a model sharing alliance between Holden and Nissan at the time, where the Nissan body was used in conjunction with GM powertrains. Running on unleaded petrol, this engine had an output of [tpl]Convert|79|kW|hp[/tpl]. The Pulsar's 1.8 litre engine contained the same basic internals as the JD Camira's 1.8 litre engine, with the main exception being the block casting and smaller ports/valves on the head, and smaller intake manifold. Both the Camira and Astra/Pulsar engines were powered by a Delco Electronics engine control unit. This caused problems of its own, as with age, the fine tolerance of the circuitry and componentry have a tendency to fail unexpectedly, and on failing, the engine will cease to operate, or operate with a crippling loss of power due to incorrect tuning and fuel delivery. The external engine mounts are better placed on the Pulsar, and hence result in longer engine mount life.

==JJ (New Zealand 1984–1987)==

In New Zealand the second generation Camira was marketed as the Camira JJ. This consisted of two entirely different J-cars: the sedan version was a rebadged version of the Isuzu Aska from Japan. This decision was made by General Motors New Zealand as sales figures of the Camira JB were poor for this market, however the wagon version which was built and sold in Australia was retained and assembled locally.

==JE (1987–1989)==

The JE was the final series of Camira. By this time, many of the Camira's early quality problems had been overcome, and Holden now fitted the multi-point fuel-injected 2.0 litre engine to replace the 1.8 litre unit. The 2.0 litre unit delivered [tpl]convert|85|kW|hp[/tpl] at 5200 rpm and [tpl]convert|176|Nm[/tpl] of torque at 3200 rpm. The automatic transaxle in the JE, the Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C, sported a lockup torque converter. Styling changes were minor from the JD with the addition of a thin grille up front, revised bonnet, larger 14-inch wheels and new wheel trims.
After Camira production wound up during 1989, Holden replaced the Camira with the Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry. This was a result of the Button car plan introduced by the Australian Government, which encouraged a reduction in the number of Australian car-makers and models. General Motors New Zealand was not affected by this scheme and instead replaced the Camira with the European-sourced Opel Vectra, which after 1994 was rebadged as the Holden Vectra. Holden continued to produce the Family II engine for export well after the Camira was discontinued. Over three million variants were produced, in 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 litre configurations, with the 1.8 and 2.0 litre variants being fuel injected.

The Vacationer, SLi 2000 and the Formula were sold in limited numbers and are subsequently rare today, as were cars built with power windows, central locking and automatic boot lid releases.

==Common problems==

All Camira models suffered from some common problems, which is one of the reasons why the car did not garner significant sales figures.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/car_info_holden_camira.htm | title = Holden Camira and Piazza | publisher = Unique Cars and Parts | accessdate = 2008-03-26[/tpl]

==Safety==

The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that 1982–1989 Holden Camiras provide a "significantly worse than average" level of  safety in the event of an accident, in a comparison to other "medium cars".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/2008/pdf/ucsr_08.pdf | format = PDF | title = Used Car Safety Ratings 2008 | publisher = Monash University | accessdate = 2009-01-25[/tpl] The safety rating was not calculated solely on the basis of the protection of the vehicle's occupants, but also included protection for "cyclists, pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles" to give a "better guide to the total community impact of vehicle safety."
