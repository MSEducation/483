===Race===

The race was held over 45 laps of the Enna-Pergusa circuit. After a furious battle, Henton took the chequered flag, ahead of Eje Elgh. However, Elghâ€™s team, Marlboro Team Tiga successfully appealed against Henton using an escape road on the first lap to avoid an accident. Despite being delayed by the first corner incident, Derek Daly followed Elgh home, with his team-mate Stephen South next home.  Elgh won in a time of 1hr 11:02.09mins., averaging a speed of 117.564mph.    http://www.formula2.net/F279_19.htm
