Scott Smith (born October 19, 1981) is an American figure skater. He won three senior international medals—silver at the 2003 Nebelhorn Trophy and 2003 Karl Schäfer Memorial, gold at the 2005 Ondrej Nepela Memorial—and placed fifth at the 2005 Four Continents Championships.

==Career==

Smith represented the Skating Club of Boston. He is not to be confused with Scott Smith who skated pairs with Erin Goto and Christie Baca in southern California.
At the 2006 U.S. Championships, he was the only competitor to land a clean quadruple jump.[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Smith trained, for a time, at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club in Newark, Delaware, then moved to the Skating Club of Boston, and was coached by Mark Mitchell and Peter Johansson. His programs have been choreographed by Jamie Isley, Lori Nichol and Nikolai Morozov. Before the 2008 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, he changed coaches again, this time to work with Stephanie Grosscup in Salt Lake City.
Smith withdrew from the 2009 U.S. Championships due to muscle spasms in his back, just before he was to skate his short program. He hoped to compete at the 2010 U.S. Championships but needed surgery on his left hip in December 2009.
