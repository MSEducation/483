At least it makes no pretense of being anything but a musical interlude dragged in by the scruff of its neck to illustrate the devastating effect upon the public of some anonymous young busybody's question about the workings of a three-valve sax horn. Like the "March of Time," it preserves in film the stark record of a social phenomenon—in this case, the conversion of a song hit into a plague, like Japanese beetles or chain letters. |work=New York Times |date=February 22, 1936 |accessdate=2008-10-02 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

==Biography==

Riley's date and place of birth have been the subject of some debate. He played both trumpet and trombone, and by 1927 was working in New York City, playing trumpet in Jimmy Durante's band at the Parody Club. He soon found work in several local bands as a trombonist, then co-led an ensemble with Eddie Farley, with whom he held a regular gig at the Onyx Club and wrote several songs including "The Music Goes Round and Round".[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Music Goes Round and Round' Perpetrated by 'Red' Hodgson.
