Arnold Harris Mathew, self-styled [tpl]Not a typo|de jure 4th Earl Landaff[/tpl] of Thomastown,
 (7 August 1852 – 19 December 1919) was the founder and first bishop of the Old Catholic Church in the United Kingdom and a noted author on ecclesiastical subjects.
Mathew had been both a Roman Catholic and an Anglican before becoming a bishop in the Union of Utrecht (UU). His early life is the subject of some interest from researchers as a result of his aristocratic connections and his father's connection with colonial India.

==Biography==

Mathew was a relative of Theobald Mathew the noted "Apostle of Temperance".[tpl]Failed verification|date=August 2013[/tpl] Born in France in 1852 and baptised in the Roman Catholic Church (RCC); due to his mother's scruples he was rebaptised in the Church of England (CoE). He studied for the ministry in the Scottish Episcopal Church, but sought reconciliation and confirmation in the Church of Rome.
As a Roman Catholic, Mathew was ordained a priest in 1877 in St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow, Scotland, by Archbishop Charles Eyre, apostolic administrator of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western District. Mathew received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Pope Pius IX. He became a Dominican in 1878 but only persevered a year, moving around a number of dioceses: Newcastle, Plymouth, Nottingham and Clifton. He had met Hyacinthe Loyson in France,[tpl]rp|page=159[/tpl] while Mathew was, [tpl]Circa|1888|1889[/tpl], a missionary-rector in Bath where he apostatized in 1889 and sent an announcement to his congregation that having ceased to believe in the fundamental doctrines of the Christianity he could no longer act as a priest.[tpl]rp|page=159[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=42[/tpl] He lost faith in the inspiration of Scripture and in the divinity of Christ. After leaving Bath, he went to Paris to consult with people there. Later in 1891 he was persuaded to "trial" the Anglican ministry and went to assist the rector of Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, London.  He was never officially received into the Church of England, neither did he formally leave the Roman Catholic Church.
In October 1890, he changed his name, by deed poll, from Arnold Jerome Matthews to Arnoldo Girolamo Povoleri.[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=33139|date=10 October 1890|page=1|title=Personal, &c.|url=|accessdate=18 March 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
Mathew, under the name Povoleri, married Margaret Florence Duncan at St Marylebone Parish Church, London, on 22 February 1892.[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=33569|date=24 February 1892|page=1|title=Marriages|url=|accessdate=[/tpl] He was "described as a clerk in holy orders."
In 1892, when he had reconciled with the [tpl]abbr|RCC|Roman Catholic Church[/tpl] as a layman, he at the same time participated in non-Catholic religious functions and officiated at marriages in a [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl] church without a license from the [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl].[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=40186|date=15 April 1913|pages=3–4|title=King's bench division|url=|accessdate=[/tpl][/tpl]

he stopped using the title of Count in 1894.
In 1897, Mathew had met Father Richard O'Halloran[ref][tpl]LondonGazette|issue=33652|date=14 October 1930|startpage=6280|accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl]
[/ref][tpl]Failed verification|date=August 2013[/tpl] and became curious about the suggestion of an Old Catholic Church in Great Britain.
In 1897, Richard O'Halloran was suspended in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster for "reasons of canonical discipline".[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Tablet|issn=0039-8837|date=25 September 1915|page=408|title=An excommunication by name|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/25th-september-1915/19/rome|accessdate=19 March 2014[/tpl] O'Halloran condemned the censure and created the "Ealing schism". O'Halloran was, according to The Tablet, also suspected of heresy.

===Election===

[tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] bishops had corresponded with O'Halloran since 1902.[tpl]cite journal|location=Bern|publisher=Stämpfli & Cie|journal=Internationale Kirchliche Zeitschrift|issn=0020-9252|language=German|volume=neue folge 5; ganzen folge 23|issue=3|date=Jul–Sep 1915|title=Internationale beziehungen|pages=342–349|url=http://archive.org/details/a635309805bernuoft[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=344[/tpl]
O'Halloran believed that such a movement would interest a large number of disaffected Roman Catholics and Anglo-Catholics.
In June 1906 the Royal Commission appointed in 1904 to inquire into "ecclesiastical disorders", afterwards known as the Ritual Commission, The king issued Letters of Business after the report. It was expected that the Catholic-minded Anglican clergy, with their congregations, might, by Act of Parliament, be forced out of the Anglican Communion. Persuaded by O'Halloran, Mathew decided to join the movement and was elected the first Regionary Old Catholic Bishop for Great Britain and in 1908 the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (OKKN) was petitioned to consecrate him to this charge.
Mathew's election was to some extent a precautionary endeavour by those[tpl]Who|date=August 2013[/tpl] anticipating a precipitous action by the Government regarding the Ritual Commission's findings, there were only a small number of Old Catholics in England. However, the King's Letters of Business dealing with the Report of the Ritual Commission received no further attention and no action was taken.  The result was that those who had taken part in Mathew's election were able to remain within the Anglican Communion.[tpl]Clarify|reason=Was he elected by Old Catholic congregations or by Anglican congregations?|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Added to the natural differences[tpl]which|date=April 2014[/tpl] with their former brethren in the Roman Church was a campaign of persecution[tpl]Examples|date=April 2014[/tpl] directed by certain elements[tpl]Who|date=April 2014[/tpl] of the [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl].[tpl]MIR|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1898 Willibald Beyschlag wrote, in The American Journal of Theology, that Old Catholic churches sought "federation with other churches having an" episcopal polity. They sought "recognition that they all belong to the one ecumenical church which rests upon the dogmatic and episcopal foundation of the early church, and can, therefore, practice communion with each other." Those negotiations had "no tangible result" in 1898, according to Beyschlag, who did not "think that such a result would be of any great value," because some Anglicans "emphatically desire to be 'catholic', and are at the same time wholly out of sympathy with the Old Catholics." Beyschlag distinguished that the Ritualist Anglican Catholics "are on the way to Rome; the Old Catholics on the way from Rome."[tpl]cite journal|location=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|journal=The American Journal of Theology|issn=|volume=2|issue=3|date=Jul 1898|page=523|last=Beyschlag|first=Willibald|title=The origin and development of the Old Catholic movement|jstor=3153434[/tpl]

===Consecration===

Mathew was consecrated in St. Gertrude's Cathedral, Utrecht, on 28 April 1908, by the [tpl]abbr|OKKN|Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland)[/tpl] Archbishop Gerardus Gul of Utrecht, assisted by two [tpl]abbr|OKKN|Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland)[/tpl] bishops, Jacobus Johannes van Thiel of Haarlem and Nicolaus Bartholomeus Petrus Spit of Deventer, and one Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany bishop, Josef Demmel of Bonn.[tpl]rp|page=12[/tpl]
Soon after the consecration, Mathew and O'Halloran were estranged and O'Halloran, under a pseudonym,[tpl]rp|page=346[/tpl] questioned if the seventeen priests and the eight congregations did not exist in reality but were only a deception and if "the Old Catholic theology teaches that deception of any kind invalidates the consecration" then was Mathew "a validly consecrated Old Catholic bishop according to the teaching of Old Catholic theology?"[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|oclc=21987594|date=13 May 1908|page=|title=|author=Incredulous (pseud. of Richard O'Halloran)|url=|accessdate=[/tpl] Reprinted in [tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Tablet|issn=0039-8837|date=16 May 1908|page=28|title=A new 'Old Catholic' bishop?|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/16th-may-1908/28/a-new-old-catholic-bishop|accessdate=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140402153356/http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/16th-may-1908/28/a-new-old-catholic-bishop|archivedate=2 April 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl] Unprepared for the position in which he then found himself,[tpl]Clarify|reason=What position did he find himself in?|date=August 2013[/tpl] Mathew informed Gul that he was himself a deceived victim and "the information given him by O'Halloran was entirely false" and offered to resign but his resignation was not accepted.[tpl]rp|pages=12–13[/tpl][tpl]rp|pages=174–175[/tpl][tpl]efn|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|oclc=21987594|date=20 May 1908|page=|title=|url=|accessdate=[/tpl] cited by Herzog.[tpl]rp|page=346[/tpl][/tpl] Yet weeks earlier, Mathew and O'Halloran traveled to Utrecht where Mathew personally presented him to Gul.[tpl]rp|page=346[/tpl] Within weeks, van Thiel wrote that the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] "had no reason to suppose that we were mistaken in complying with" O'Halloran's request and stated that their "confidence in Bishop Mathew remains unshaken, after carefully perusing a large number of the documents bearing upon this matter," and they "earnestly hope that his ministrations will be abundantly blessed by Almighty God, and that he will receive the cordial support of the British people and Church in the trying circumstances in which he has been placed."[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|oclc=21987594|date=3 June 1908|page=|title=An Old Catholic bishop for England|last=Thiel|first=Jacobus J. van|url=|accessdate=[/tpl] Also reprinted in various works and online.[tpl]efn|By 1920, the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] believed "that Mathew himself was responsible for the false testimony submitted in 1908 and, rather than being a victim of O'Halloran, was in fact his confederate."[tpl]rp|page=15[/tpl] However, in the same year,[tpl]Clarify timeframe|date=April 2014[/tpl] the [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl] was eager to develop friendly relations with the [tpl]abbr|UU|Union of Utrecht[/tpl] and perhaps it was convenient, after the death of Mathew to try and repair relations by "brushing under the carpet" the original "failed experiment?"[tpl]speculation-inline|date=April 2014[/tpl][/tpl] Brandreth thought that the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] "exonerated him from personal blame" in this letter.[tpl]rp|page=13[/tpl] But Anson believed that it "was a polite way of stating that he had been consecrated under false pretenses, though not of his making."[tpl]rp|page=176[/tpl]
The 1908 Lambeth Conference "deprecated the setting up of a new organised body" and requested that Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, notify the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] bishops about the resolution. This was a protest against the consecration and although it was not publicized at the time,[tpl]cite journal|location=London|publisher=Longmans, Green|journal=The Month|issn=0027-0172|volume=136|issue=675|date=Sep 1920|title=Miscellanea|pages=260–262|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ttwb7jkTsb8C&pg=PA260[/tpl] Gul replied with explanations and promised "that in future they 'would take care not to make trouble by encroaching on the order of a friendly Church'."[tpl]cite conference|location=London|publisher=Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge|conference=6th Lambeth Conference, 5 July – 7 August 1920|author=Conference of bishops of the Anglican Communion|booktitle=Encyclical letter from the bishops, with the resolutions and reports|year=1920|oclc=729498943|pages=154–156|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t39029m6v?urlappend=%3Bseq=170[/tpl]

===Mission in England 1908–1919===

Mathew published The Old Catholic Missal & Ritual in 1909, for Old Catholics using the English language.[ref]

In September 1909, he attended the Old Catholic Congress in Vienna, where he sympathized with the Dutch Old Catholics conservative position which opposed the innovations being introduced among the German and Swiss Old Catholics to renounce the Sacrament of Penance (auricular confession), the intercession of saints and alterations to the liturgy, including the omission of the Pope's name from the Canon of the Mass. He proposed the acceptance of the 1673 Synod of Jerusalem's doctrines.[tpl]rp|page=303[/tpl]
Mathew expressed fears that the trend of Continental Old Catholicism was towards Modernism, perhaps because of the growing association with Anglicans and Lutherans, and hoped for a return to the traditional principles of the Church of Utrecht.
Moss wrote that Mathew thought they were becoming "steadily more Protestant".[tpl]rp|page=302[/tpl]
[tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] rejected Herford's request to join. "the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] was uncertain about Herford's credentials" and, only one bishop, i.e. Mathew, was needed for England.[tpl]rp|page=196[/tpl] Mathew also rejected Herford's applications several times.
Brandreth wrote that for two years Mathew, "with the status of a missionary bishop", remained in full communion with the [tpl]abbr|UU|Union of Utrecht[/tpl]. In October 1909, Mathew assisted Gul at the consecration of Jan Maria Michał Kowalski as archbishop of the Polish Mariavite Church.[tpl]rp|page=13[/tpl]
In June 1910, he secretly consecrated, without agreement of the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl],[tpl]rp|page=193[/tpl] Beale and Howarth, both of whom did not accept or sign the Convention of Utrecht,[tpl]rp|page=302[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|location=Rotterdam|publisher=|journal=De Oud-Katholiek: godsdienstig maandblad|issn=0167-3963|language=Dutch|volume=|issue=|date=1 December 1910|page=[/tpl] Translated in [tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|oclc=21987594|date=9 December 1910|page=|title=[/tpl] Translation reprinted in [tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Tablet|issn=0039-8837|date=17 December 1910|page=39|title=The "Old Catholics" in England|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/17th-december-1910/39/the-old-catholics-in-england|accessdate=5 April 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140405194248/http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/17th-december-1910/39/the-old-catholics-in-england|archivedate=5 April 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl][/tpl] and Mathew informed the Holy See of these consecrations.[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=40184|date=12 April 1913|page=3|title=Alleged libel in 'The Times.'|url=|accessdate=[/tpl][/tpl] Beale and Howarth were suspended.[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=39364|date=30 August 1910|page=5|title=Ecclesiastical intelligence|url=|accessdate=[/tpl]
In August, van Thiel declared that Old Catholics "could not be considered responsible for ... Mathew's eventual particular attitude or opinions, because he only represents his own clergy and himself in England." Mathew was "in no sense a representative of the Church of Holland in England."[tpl]efn|See [tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Guardian|oclc=21987594|date=1910-08-05|page=|title=|url=|accessdate=[/tpl] cited by Herzog and reprinted in Brandreth.[tpl]rp|page=14[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=347[/tpl][/tpl]
In October, Mathew defended the consecrations in The Church Times against a critical article in [tpl]lang|de|Katholik[/tpl].[tpl]efn|[tpl]cite news|location=Bern|newspaper=Der Katholik|oclc=8739103|language=German|date=|page=[/tpl] and [tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Church Times|issn=0009-658X|date=28 October 1910|page=|title=[/tpl] cited by [tpl]lang|nl|De Oud-Katholiek[/tpl].[/tpl]
In December 1910, [tpl]lang|nl|De Oud-Katholiek[/tpl] concluded that Mathew had "given up communion with the other Old Catholics" when he acted against the Convention of Utrecht. He ignored "his duty to inform" the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] prior to "any consecration", so "that the case may be duly examined and all precautions taken that no unworthy person be consecrated;" he consecrated men who belonged to another Church "knowing that they were Roman Catholics and would probably remain so"; he consecrated alone without need and in secret.[tpl]rp|page=302[/tpl]

===Autonomy and Independence===

Within weeks of the De Oud-Katholiek article, on 29 December 1910, Mathew issued A Declaration of Autonomy And Independence from the [tpl]abbr|UU|Union of Utrecht[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|location=Kingsdown|publisher=|last=Mathew|first=Arnold H|title=An episcopal odyssey: an open letter to ... the ...

This necessitated[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=August 2013[/tpl] then the continuation of the apostolic succession for the survival of the "old" Roman Catholic faith and so, on 7 January 1911, Mathew consecrated Archdeacon Francis Herbert Bacon, Canon Cuthbert Francis Hinton, Fr William Edmond Scott-Hall and Fr Frederick Clement Christie Egerton to the episcopate.
An episcopal synod then followed and Mathew was unanimously elected Old Roman Catholic Archbishop of Great Britain and Ireland.
Although the Holy See usually did not respond to notifications about episcopal consecrations, in this case, on 11 February 1911, Pope Pius X excommunicated Beale, Howarth, and Mathew. The Times reported on their excommunication and included an English language translation of the Latin language document which described Mathew as a "pseudo-bishop".[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=39520|date=28 February 1911|page=6|title=The excommunication of Englishmen|url=|accessdate=[/tpl][/tpl][ref][tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Tablet|issn=0039-8837|date=4 March 1911|page=25|author=Pope Pius X|authorlink=Pope Pius X|title=Motu Proprio|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/4th-march-1911/25/motu-proprio|accessdate=22 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6J3us2g3d|archivedate=22 August 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl] English translation of [tpl]cite journal|location=Rome|publisher=Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis|journal=Acta Apostolicae Sedis|volume=3|issue=2|date=11 February 1911|publication-date=1911-02-15|author=Pope Pius X|title=Sacerdotes Arnoldus Harris Mathew, Herbertus Ignatius Beale et Arthurus Guilelmus Howarth nominatim excommunicantur|type=motu proprio type apostolic letter|language=Latin|pages=53–54|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2003%201911%20-%20ocr.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GXqyZ3A2|archivedate=11 May 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
[/ref][tpl]efn|name=UtrechtChapter|In 1145, Pope Eugene III granted the cathedral chapter in Utrecht the right to elect bishops after such had been requested by the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III and Bishop Heribert of Utrecht. The Fourth Lateran Council confirmed this in 1215. Pope Leo X issued the papal bull Debitum Pastoralis in 1520 giving extraordinary powers to Philip of Burgundy, 57th Bishop of Utrecht, essentially removing the ability of any external authority to "in the first instance, have his cause evoked to any external tribunal, not even under pretense of any apostolic letters whatever; and that all such proceedings should be, ipso facto, null and void".[/tpl] Father David Fleming testified during the Mathew v.

"It is hard to believe that an Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch would have been prepared to accept a married prelate into communion with his Church," Anson wrote.

The trial, Mathew v. "The Times" Publishing Co., Ltd., "was tense with laughter over the elaborate and convoluted ecclesiastical definitions." Mathew lost the case.[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=40189|date=18 April 1913|page=3|title=King's bench division|url=|accessdate=[/tpl][/tpl]
A "material part of the case" about whether Mathew was truthful was the 1889 printed announcement sent to his congregation in Bath. The trial revealed that in 1897 Mathew restated that he had apostatized in 1889 and had circulated the printed announcement but by 1897 had concluded that his change in belief was a mistake; he therefore recanted the 1889 document, in 1897, which during the trial he said that he never wrote. He testified that he was hypnotized in Bath and so the announcement was written without his knowledge.
The jury considered whether the consecrations of Beale and Howarth "would not be rightfully described as a sacrilegious crime of which all those holding Christian views would be ashamed."
Mathew's attorney argued that publication of the excommunication by The Times in English was high treason under a 1571 law re-enacted in 1846.[tpl]efn|Mathew's attorney cited [tpl]cite act|title=An Act against the bringing in and putting in execution of bulls writings or instruments and other superstitious things from the See of Rome|number=13 Eliz. 1, c. 2|date=1571[/tpl] and [tpl]cite act|title=An Act to relieve Her Majesty's subjects from certain penalties and disabilities in regard to religious opinions|number=9 and 10 Vict., c. 59|date=1846[/tpl][/tpl] The trial was, according to a 1932 article in The Tablet, the last time this principle was invoked and the judge, Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling, "held that it was not unlawful to publish a Papal Bull in a newspaper simply for the information of the public."[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Tablet|issn=0039-8837|date=1932-05-07|page=6|title=Catholic authority and English law|last=Cowper|first=Francis H.|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/7th-may-1932/6/catholic-authority-and-english-law|accessdate=2014-03-22[/tpl][tpl]cite court|litigants=Mathew v.

Either Novikov or Uxkull-Gyllenband, according to Anson, introduced Mathew to Rudolph de Landas Berghes.[tpl]rp|page=189[/tpl]
By 1914 all six bishops which Mathew consecrated had separated from him, so he consecrated Berghes to continue his succession and initially to establish the ministry of the Old Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and then later in the United States. Shortly thereafter, Father Carmel Henry Carfora, an Italian Franciscan friar who had left the Roman Catholic Church, was elected[tpl]By whom|date=August 2013[/tpl] to succeed Berghes as Archbishop of the Old Roman Catholic Diocese of America. After Berghes moved to the U.S., Mathew consecrated Bernard Mary Williams, in 1916 and on 25 March 1917, Mathew appointed Williams as his successor.

===Death===

Neither do I intend or claim even to exercise priestly functions, unless and until, as I earnestly hope, this privilege may be permitted to me.

But because the Holy See insisted that he would only be reconciled as a layman and would be obliged to accept the doctrine of papal infallibility and primacy of the Roman Pontiff, Mathew then sought union with the [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl] but the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to give him any position in the [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl].
Mathew retired to South Mimms, a village in the English countryside in Hertfordshire, and contented himself with assisting at services in a [tpl]abbr|CoE|Church of England[/tpl] parish church.
He died suddenly, on 20 December 1919, at South Mimms and was buried in the churchyard at South Mimms.[tpl]citation-attribution|[tpl]cite news|location=London|newspaper=The Times|issn=0140-0460|issue=42290|date=23 December 1919|page=13|title=Death Of 'Archbishop' Mathew|url=|accessdate=[/tpl][/tpl]

==Contemporary significance==

There are many independent churches, "rites" and ecclesiastic bodies in the English speaking world, particularly in North America and some in Continental Europe which trace their Holy Orders to Mathew's apostolic succession. This makes Mathew a significant figure in the Independent Sacramental Movement. However, genuine Old Roman Catholic jurisdictions directly descended from the missionary endeavours of the first generation of Mathew's bishops are very few.
Mathew's activities as a bishop gave birth to the Liberal Catholic Church and the more conservative Old Roman Catholic churches, which are autocephalous churches holding to a traditional Roman Catholic worship style, most rejecting the dogmas of the First Vatican Council (1869–1870) but some offering nominal acceptance.

===Old Roman Catholic Church===

[tpl]According to whom|In Europe the maintenance of traditional Old Roman Catholicism (i.e. maintaining the original aims of Mathew and arguably the original mission of the Ultrajectines) is maintained by the Old Roman Catholic Church in Europe (ORCCE) of the Old Roman Catholic Church Latin Rite (ORCC/LR),|date=August 2013[/tpl] the only global Old Roman Catholic jurisdiction with provinces in North America, South America, Asia and Africa and the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain (ORCC/GB) headed by Archbishop Douglas Lewins, the lineal descendant of Mathew's original church.
In the United States, as well as the Old Roman Catholic Church Latin Rite (ORCC/LR), the following are [tpl]According to whom|date=August 2013[/tpl] the only churches descended directly from the Old Roman Catholic Church of North America founded by Landas Berghes succeeded by Carfora, namely the Old Roman Catholic Church: See of Caer-Glow (ORCC/SoG) headed by Archbishop John Humphreys; the Old Roman Catholic Church in North America (ORCCNA) headed by Archbishop Francis P. Facione; the North American Old Roman Catholic Church (NAORCC) headed by Archbishop Edward J. Ford; the North American Old Roman Catholic Church (NAORCC) headed by Archbishop Theodore Rematt.   
There are other churches using the name "Old Roman Catholic" that have no direct connection to the above jurisdictions and are not directly descended from the original Old Roman Catholic missions. Such churches' claims to being Old Roman Catholic are usually by virtue of having attained Mathew's succession from various episcopi vagantes or by adopting the polity of Old Roman Catholicism.

===Liberal Catholic Church===

Mathew was a traditional Ultrajectine and Roman Catholic in his religious beliefs and believed the bishops he consecrated were orthodox in their theology as well, preaching doctrines common to the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.
Anson wrote that, for at least two years, Mathew was "in close touch with leading Theosophists, apparently without investigating the orthodoxy of their beliefs," and believed that Mathew "had no excuse" for not understanding the cult of Maitreya beliefs held by the majority of his clergy.[tpl]rp|pages=195–196[/tpl] The manifestations of Maitreya included the Hindu deity Krishna and Christ during the three years of the ministry of Jesus.[tpl]rp|page=278[/tpl] According to Catholic Encyclopedia, theosophy "is a form of pantheism and denies a personal God,"[tpl]Catholic|inline=1|volume=14|last=Driscoll|first=John T.|wstitle=Theosophy[/tpl] and pantheism is simply atheism.[tpl]Catholic|inline=1|volume=11|last=Pace|first=Edward|wstitle=Pantheism[/tpl] According to Anson, the majority of clergy involved with Mathew were members of the Theosophical Society and the Order of the Star in the East, and were dismayed when Mathew directed them to separate from these organizations in 1915.[tpl]rp|pages=200, 342[/tpl] Instead, within weeks, they had separated from Mathew and elected Bernard Gauntlett, secretary of the Theosophical Society's Order of Healers, and Robert King, a consulting psychic and astrologer, to the episcopate.[tpl]rp|page=19[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=344[/tpl] But the "effective leader of the schism" was Wedgwood.[tpl]rp|page=344[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=32[/tpl] Charles Webster Leadbeater wrote to Annie Besant, in 1916, that Wedgwood offered Mathew's Old Catholic movement to Maitreya, one of the Great White Brotherhood's ascended masters and holder of the office of World Teacher, "as one of the vehicles for Maitreya's force, and a channel for the preparation of His Coming."

Concerning the validity of the Holy Orders conferred by Mathew in the period following his departure from the [tpl]abbr|UU|Union of Utrecht[/tpl].

===Utrecht denial===

After Mathew died in 1919, the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] declared in 1920 that Mathew's "consecration was obtained [tpl]lang|la|mala fide[/tpl] and that consequently it is null and void."[tpl]rp|at=xvi, pp14–15[/tpl]
The suggestion was that the petition for his consecration and its 150 signatories collated by O'Halloran was false in its premise for the consecration and thus the consecration was invalid.[tpl]cite book|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Evangelisches Verlagswerk|last=Küry|first=Urs|title=Die altkatholische Kirche, ihre Geschichte, ihre Lehre, ihr Anliegen|year=1978|isbn=3771501903|language=German|edition=3rd, amended with an addendum[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=97[/tpl]
However, Mathew had disclosed the matter fully to the Dutch bishops days after the consecration when it transpired that the Anglicans who had participated in his election withdrew from the petition due to the changed situation regarding the Ritual Commission (see above).

The [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] bishops inquired into the circumstances and Mathew was publicly exonerated from all suggestion of misrepresentation in a letter to The Guardian of 3 June 1908, the bishops also refused Mathew's request to retire.
Also, on 5 October 1909, Mathew assisted Gul together with Thiel, Demmel, and Spit at Kowalski's consecration, so clearly there was no suggestion of mala fides or "invalidity" then by the Old Catholic bishops.
Smit explained that in 1913, "ties of the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] with Mathew were formally severed",[tpl]cite book|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|series=Brill's Series in Church History|issn=1572-4107|volume=52|last=Smit|first=Peter-Ben|title=Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History: The Catholic Church in every place|year=2011|isbn=9004206477|pages=50, 180–285|publication-date=to Brill European History and Culture E-Books Online, Collection 2011|doi=10.1163/ej.9789004206472.i-548.19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rE3HEeoXJNsC&pg=PA197[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=197[/tpl] and after World War I, the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl] "distanced itself more from the [tpl]'[/tpl][tpl]lang|la|episcopus vagans[/tpl][tpl]'[/tpl] Mathew and those ordained and consecrated by him."[tpl]rp|page=213[/tpl] Consecrations derived from Mathew were not recognised by the [tpl]abbr|IBC|International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference[/tpl].[tpl]rp|at=xvi[/tpl]

Herzog's discourse was published in [tpl]lang|de|Internationale Kirchliche Zeitschrift[/tpl] in 1915.

In 1908, Lambeth had expressed regret over the consecration of Mathew.
Lambeth also indicated a desire for a closer relationship with Utrecht.
[tpl]According to whom|This may have been due to Pope Leo XIII's 1896 pronouncement, in [tpl]lang|la|Apostolicae curae[/tpl], that Anglican orders were "null and void".|date=August 2013[/tpl]
[tpl]According to whom|Leo XIII's pronouncement may almost have been the basis upon which some had supported the petition for his consecration by Utrecht.|date=August 2013[/tpl] Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, and William Maclagan, Archbishop of York, replied to the Holy See in Saepius Officio giving a defence of Anglican orders.
Discussions about union with Utrecht had been taking place since the end of the 19th century,
such as the conferences of reunion in Bonn in 1874 and 1875 convoked by Johann von Döllinger.
Though the Dutch bishops in a report of 1894 still could not decide on the recognition of Anglican orders.[tpl]rp|page=109[/tpl]
It would appear that a desire for closer cooperation on the part of Utrecht with an Anglican desire for the recognition of their orders, conspired to impugn the reputation of Mathew.[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
By June 1925, Davidson stated that the [tpl]abbr|OKKN|Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland)[/tpl] had "after lengthy investigations and serious discussions" arrived "without any reservation (to recognise) that the apostolic succession was not interrupted in the Church of England" and in 1931 the Bonn Agreement was signed and intercommunion agreed between the [tpl]abbr|UU|Union of Utrecht[/tpl] and the Anglican Communion.

===Rite===

Old Roman Catholic jurisdictions have consistently employed the Tridentine Ordinal and Roman Pontifical for the conferral of ordinations and the consecration of bishops.
This was the case with the See of Utrecht right up to and some years beyond the consecration of Mathew himself, without any alterations to the ceremonies.
Mathew's Old Catholic Missal & Ritual contains his English translation of the Roman Pontifical;[tpl]rp|page=289–326[/tpl] and, either this or the original Latin is used in all Old Roman Catholic ceremonies still to this day, even by those jurisdictions who permit modern liturgies for the Mass.
"A priest or bishop who confers a sacrament doesn't have to 'prove' that he intends to do what the Church does. He is automatically presumed to intend what the rite means. This is certain theological doctrine, taught by the Church. And to deny it is 'theologically rash'," according to Cekada.[tpl]cite journal|location=|publisher=|journal=Sacerdotium|issn=|volume=3|issue=|date=Spring 1992|last=Cekada|first=Anthony|title=The Validity of the Thuc Consecrations|url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=60&catname=13|accessdate=20 August 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6J1hqznRy|archivedate=20 August 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]

==="Schismatic" or "excommunicate" ordinations===

According to Cekada, Traditionalist Catholics sometimes assert that "without a papal dispensation, an episcopal consecration performed without two priest-assistants is doubtful".
Using the 1917 Code of Canon Law but not the current 1983 Code of Canon Law which replaced it, he argued against this assertion and stated that "no law or canonist supports this" and reasoned that "teachings of the canonists directly contradict it too".
Cekada quoted Marie Dominique Bouix, who wrote: "Even if there should be a consecration without any assistants and without obtaining a pontifical dispensation, it would still be valid."
Cekada wrote that Eduardo Regatillo's writing "goes even further. He Regatillo says that a consecration performed without a dispensation would be valid even if the bishop 'is the only one who is present at the consecration';"[ref]Quote translated by Cekada from [tpl]cite book|location=Santander|publisher=Sal Terrae|series=Bibliotheca Comillensis., Serie canonica|last=Regatillo|first=Eduardo F.|title=Interpretatio et iurisprudentia codicis iuris canonici|language=Latin|year=1953|origyear=1948|edition=3rd|oclc=12072665|page=465|quote=Unus episcopus sufficit ad validitatem consecrationis, dummodo ritum essentialem cum debita intentione ponat. Idque etsi sine pontificia dispensatione unicus sit qui consecrationi intersit[/tpl] Translation of [tpl]cite book|title=Interpretación y jurisprudencia del código canónico|language=Spanish[/tpl] 
[/ref] and that, "Pope Alexander VII, Pope Clement XI and Pope Benedict XIV declared that consecrations performed without such a dispensation are valid."Quote translated by Cekada from [tpl]cite book|author=Pope Alexander VII|title=Brief Alias|date=27 February 1660|quote=... supradictam consecrationem Episcopi Paraquariensis, quantum spectat ad sacramentum et impressionem characteris, fuisse validam; quantum vero spectat ad licitam executionem ordinis, fuisse irritam et inanem, et Episcopum ita consecratum, ac respective consecrantem indigere absolutione et dispensatione.[/tpl]

Sometimes, it is asserted that, because Mathew was excommunicated by Pius X, anyone ordained or consecrated by him thereafter incurs the same penalty.
"Penalties aren't 'contagious'", according to Cekada, even if a bishop "had personally incurred excommunication, it would not be incurred by clergy who derive their orders from him"; he wrote that the [tpl]abbr|CIC1917|1917 Codex Iuris Canonicis[/tpl] states: "It is not permitted to extend penalties from person to person or from case to case, even though the reason is the same or even stronger."[tpl]rp|at=[tpl]url|1=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P82.HTM|2=can.2219.3[/tpl][/tpl]
"Receiving orders from an excommunicate incurs only suspension", wrote Cekada, which prohibits "licitly exercising orders".[tpl]efn|"Those who presume to receive orders from one who is excommunicated, or suspended, or interdicted, after a declaratory sentence has been passed upon him, or from a notorious apostate, heretic, or schismatic, [tpl]lang|la|ipso facto[/tpl] incur a suspension [tpl]lang|la|a divinis[/tpl] reserved to the Holy See; one who in good faith is ordained by any such person is forbidden to exercise the orders so received until he shall be dispensed."[tpl]rp|at=[tpl]url|1=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/__P8L.HTM|2=can.2372[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl]
Thus, based on the [tpl]abbr|CIC1917|1917 Codex Iuris Canonicis[/tpl], Mathew's excommunication is not "contagious" and would not pass to clergy deriving their orders from him.
Furthermore, the [tpl]abbr|CIC1917|1917 Codex Iuris Canonicis[/tpl] states that "Except as provided in §3, the faithful can for any just cause ask for sacraments or sacramentals of one who is excommunicated, especially if there is no one else to give them; and in such cases the excommunicated person so asked may administer them, and is not obliged to ask the reason for the request."[tpl]rp|at=[tpl]url|1=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/__P88.HTM|2=can.2261[/tpl][/tpl]
No Old Roman Catholic bishops have been declared [tpl]lang|la|excommunicate[/tpl] since Mathew.[tpl]efn|which must be publicly declared by the Apostolic See and the name of the excommunicated person made public,according to the [tpl]abbr|CIC1917|1917 Codex Iuris Canonicis[/tpl].[tpl]rp|at=[tpl]url|1=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/__P88.HTM|2=can.2258.2[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl][tpl]clarify|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Thus as his excommunication is not contagious, this scenario does not apply.[tpl]clarify|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Affirmations of validity===

There are various incidences where Old Roman Catholic orders have been affirmed by theologians, canonists and even representatives of the Holy See.

Despite critics,[tpl]Who|date=August 2013[/tpl] there is incontrovertible evidence that the apostolic succession of Mathew originating from the [tpl]abbr|OKKN|Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland)[/tpl], has been consistently considered "valid" by Vatican officials and Roman Catholic canon lawyers and theologians.

In 1913, Fleming testified in Mathew v. "The Times" Publishing Co., Ltd. about the [tpl]abbr|OKKN|Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands (Oud-Katholieke Kerk van Nederland)[/tpl] that, "The Holy See or the Pontiff has never condemned these orders as invalid; but he has never explicitly recognized them."
But [tpl]According to whom|in all such cases it has been assumed that orthodox praxis and intention has been concurrent with each ordination/consecration and the cases of particular affirmation have only been of individuals known to be conservative in Catholic doctrine.|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In all above cases too, only the Roman Pontifical was used for the Rite of Consecration, other liturgies are not therefore affirmed.
It certainly cannot be assumed that the arguments and affirmations detailed here are in any way applicable across the board to other groups outside the Old Roman Catholic tradition, most especially those whose teachings are not consistent with orthodox and conservative Catholic doctrine.
Similarly, though the canonical principles above may be applied to other scenarios, the conclusions rely inherently on orthodox Catholic praxis and would not apply to those demonstrably apostate or heretical by comparison to traditional Catholic doctrine.
It is generally suggested[tpl]According to whom|date=August 2013[/tpl] that Roman Catholics may fulfill their Holy Day of Obligation by attending Mass celebrated by an Old Roman Catholic priest if unable to attend a Roman Catholic Mass.[tpl]Disputed-inline|A Catholic does not fulfill a Mass obligation by attending a non-Catholic Mass|date=February 2014|reason=This is a confusion between Mass obligation and sacrament reception.
