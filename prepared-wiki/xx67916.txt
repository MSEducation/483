[tpl]nihongo|Puyo Puyo|ぷよぷよ|Puyo Puyo[/tpl] a puzzle video game released in 1991 by Compile for the MSX2.MAWS - showing resource: puyo Since its creation, it uses characters from Madou Monogatari. It was created by Masamitsu "Moo" Niitani, the founder of Compile, who was inspired by certain elements from the Tetris and Dr. Mario series of games.
The game was released by Tokuma Shoten and Technosoft on the same day of the MSX2 release under the name [tpl]nihongo|Famimaga Disk Vol. 5: Puyo Puyo|ファミマガディスク Vol.5 ぷよぷよ|Famimaga Disuku Boryūmu Faibu: Puyo Puyo[/tpl] and as part of the Famimaga Disk series for the Family Computer Disk System and Technosoft's port for the Mac OS was entitled [tpl]nihongo|Puyo Puyo MacOS|ぷよぷよマクOS|Puyo Puyo MakuOS[/tpl]. A year after the MSX2, Mac OS and FDS versions, Sega released an arcade version, which heavily expanded the previous versions by including a one-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode. An English-translated version was created and released internationally. It replaces the original voice work, changes many of the characters' names, and removes Harpy's (now "Dark Elf's") wings.

==Gameplay==

===Original Version===

====Endless Mode====

The Player must continually match puyos to get the highest score they can.

====Mission Mode====

The player must complete 52 missions requiring the Puyos on the field to be eliminated by using limited pieces.

===Arcade-based version===

====Game modes====

The main game of Puyo Puyo is played against at least one opponent, computer or human. The game itself has three modes, Single Puyo Puyo, Double Puyo Puyo, and Endless Puyo Puyo.

====Single Puyo Puyo====

In this mode, the player takes on the role of Arle Nadja, a 16 year old female spellcaster that has the pleasure of foiling Satan's plans. Satan wishes to take over the world, and Arle stands in his way. Arle must first however battle her way through 12 opponents before facing Satan, and unlike Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, with the exception of Rulue, they are not under Satan's control, nor were they created by him (for Rulue, she fell in love with him). Once Arle has beaten Satan, the world is saved, so she can return home.
As in all main Puyo games, the story mode consists of playing Puyo matches against a fixed sequence of characters in one of three courses. The characters faced are listed below.

====Double Puyo Puyo====

In this mode, two players play against each other. In exactly the same fashion as before, by out-chaining one another, the player tries to fill up their opponent's grid. Since the rules of sending so many garbage blocks made games short-lived, no matter how many chains are sent, Compile added the rule of Sousai in Puyo Puyo TSU and onwards. This enables players to counter opponents' attacks with chains of their own, sending any garbage blocks back to them as a result of overflow.

The N-Gage version of Puyo Puyo stories becomes different, however. The character's colour is different than the original. The stories about Arle save the world from Satan's grasp turn into a little girl (Arle's counterpart) that lost her way home. The characters are nameless and some opponents in some stages are replaced (though Schezo, Minotaurus, and Rulue don't appear in the N-gage version, they're replaced by the stronger version of Sukiyapodes and Harpy with different colours).
