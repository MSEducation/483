==Career==

Jo Yeo-jeong debuted as a CeCi Magazine cover girl at the age of 16 in 1997, and began actively acting in 1999. Despite appearing in drama series, music videos, and TV commercials afterwards, she remained obscure. During this period, she was also unhappy with the limited roles being offered to her.[tpl]cite web|last=Lim|first=Ju-ri|title=Cho Yeo-jeong keeps it steamy in The Concubine|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2953591|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=30 May 2012[/tpl]
Then Jo rose to the spotlight in 2010 by starring as the ambitious Joseon woman of low caste in the erotic period drama The Servant.[tpl]cite web|title=Jo Yeo-jeong Hits Box-Office Gold with Daring Part|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/06/12/2010061200230.html|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=The Chosun Ilbo|date=12 June 2010[/tpl] The R-rated movie, which was a newly adapted and tragic version of Korea’s famous folktale The Story of Chunhyang, had been turned down by a few actresses because it contained too many sex scenes. Jo, however, took advantage of the opportunity and it turned out to be a huge stepping stone in her career.[tpl]cite web|last=Ki|first=Sun-min|title=Director twists classic tale|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2922274|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=25 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=The Servant|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/the-servant|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Film Business Asia|date=1 July 2010[/tpl] Upon the release of the film, Jo successfully escaped being "another pretty face" in Korea's entertainment scene.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=Actress returns in another racy period thriller|url=http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120523001115|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=The Korea Herald|date=23 May 2012[/tpl]
In 2011 Jo starred in hit cable series I Need Romance, a sexually frank and funny comedy about a group of single thirtysomething girlfriends navigating the dating scene in Seoul, which boasted stylish and slick production values.
Few would have expected her to star in another period drama that requires full nudity, as doing so may stigmatize her in Korea's film industry ― where most young actresses still stay away from nude scenes as much as possible. Despite the collective concerns expressed by the local media outlets that she was "going nude too often," in 2012 the actress chose another period thriller with explicit sex scenes.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Jin-ho|title=Jo Yeo Jeong to Bare it All Again in New Film|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=1350|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=enewsWorld|date=3 November 2011[/tpl] She had admired the work of director Kim Dae-seung and wanted to work with him, so after reading his latest script, she pursued being cast as the complex titular character of The Concubine.[tpl]cite web|last=Jung|first=Hyun-mok|title=Director says Concubine sex scenes are complicated|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2954850|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=22 June 2012[/tpl] The film proved her fine taste in roles when, despite the hype, it was well-made and critically praised. In an interview for the film, Jo said that most of all, she wants to be seen as an adventurous and intriguing actress.[tpl]cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=In Focus: The Concubine (Hu-gung: Je-wang-ui cheop)|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/inFocus.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=1|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=Korean Film Biz Zone|date=13 June 2012[/tpl]
In the 2012 romantic comedy series Haeundae Lovers, she played the bright and cheerful daughter of a Busan gangster, who falls in love with the amnesiac undercover prosecutor living with them.[tpl]cite web|title=Jo Yeo-jeong Says Acting Lets Her Explore Her Hidden Self|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/10/06/2012100600495.html|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=The Chosun Ilbo|date=6 October 2012[/tpl] A year later, Jo's book Healing Beauty was published, containing tips and advice on health and beauty, based on the know-how she's amassed as an actress over her 16-year career.[tpl]cite web|title=Jo Yeo-jeong Discloses Beauty Secrets in New Book|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/04/24/2013042400652.html|work=The Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=24 April 2013[/tpl]
