An urban legend associated with the cemetery claims that it is haunted by a spirit known as the Hookman. There are three different versions of the Hookman legend. They are as follows:
All three versions of the story have been circulating in the area since the 1950s. There is also a local legend about a house that once stood near the cemetery. Supposedly there was a family who lived in the house, and the young son murdered the whole family and then himself.
Records at the Derby Historical Society show that a small caretaker's house once existed on the grounds of the cemetery; this may have inspired some of the legends.Derby Historical Society. 37 Elm Street, Ansonia, CT The third version of the story is probably just another version of the classic Hookman legend that originated in Maine in the 1920s.
