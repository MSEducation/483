==History==

Alexander's was followed by the Diadochi empire of the Seleucids.
In 46 A.D., according to the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul journeyed  to Perga, from there continued on to Antiocheia in Pisidia, then returned to Perga where he preached the word of God (Acts 14:25). Then he left the city and went to Attaleia.[tpl]bibleref|Acts|14:25[/tpl]
In the first half of the 4th century, during the reign of Constantine the Great (324-337), Perga became an important centre of Christianity, which soon became the official religion of the Roman Empire. The city retained its status as a Christian centre in the 5th and 6th centuries.

===Ecclesiastical history===

St. Paul the Apostle and his companion St. Barnabas, twice visited Perga as recorded in the biblical book, the Acts of the Apostles,Acts 13:13–14 and 14:25. during their first missionary journey, where they "preached the word"[tpl]bibleverse||Acts|14:25|KJV|[/tpl] before heading for and sailing from Attalia (modern-day Antalya city), [tpl]convert|15|km[/tpl] to the southwest, to Antioch.
Paul and Barnabas came to Perge during their first missionary journey, but probably stayed there only a short time, and do not seem to have preached there;Acts 13:13. it was there that John Mark left Paul to return to Jerusalem. On his return from Pisidia Paul preached at Perge.Acts 14:24.
The Greek Notitiae episcopatuum mentions the city as metropolis of Pamphylia Secunda until the 13th century. Le QuienLe Quien.
