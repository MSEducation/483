==Historical information==

Mega-Gem was fabricated in 1989 with the resources of Cincinnati art dealer Carl Solway.Carl Solway Gallery. It was presented at the Chicago International Art Exposition, where it was located on the Navy Pier in Chicago, Illinois. The presentation of Mega-Gem was promoted through posters and buttons proclaiming the sculpture to be the largest diamond in the world, weighing over 360 million carats. Mega-Gem was considered by Torreano to be one of a series of "oxy-gem" sculptures, playing on the oxymoron of combining precious gems with materials of lesser value, such as a "plywood gem," "gold gem," and Mega-Gem as "aluminum gem."[tpl]cite web | author=Torreano, John| year=2009 | title= Writing Article on Mega-Gem | work= Personal Communication| url=| accessdate= November 23, 2009[/tpl] Mega-Gem is one of Torreano's oversized and exaggerated jewel sculptures.[tpl]cite book | last =Greiff | first =Glory-June | title =Remembrance, Faith & Fancy: Outdoor Public Sculpture in Indiana | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | year =2005 | location =Indianapolis | pages =183 | url =  | isbn =0-87195-180-0[/tpl]

===Location history===

In 1989 Mega-Gem was presented at the Chicago International Art Exposition where it was displayed on Navy Pier along Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois, until 1994. 
In October 1994 Mega-Gem was loaned to the Indianapolis Museum of Art for two years. It arrived on October 10, 1994, and was put on display in the southwest corner of Krannert Plaza, which is a section of the IMA's grounds and gardens located on the west side of the property overlooking the White River. In 1997, after the loan period had expired, the Contemporary Art Society raised funds for Mega-Gem to be acquired by the IMA. It remained on view in Krannert Plaza until 2001, when it was relocated to the southeast corner of the IMA property near the intersection of 38th Street and Michigan Road.[tpl]cite web | author=| year=2009 | title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: 4000 Michigan Road, Indianapolis, Indiana | work=Google Maps| url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=indianapolis+museum+of+art&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.587666,79.013672&ie=UTF8&hq=museum+of+art&hnear=Indianapolis,+IN&ll=39.825318,-86.182643&spn=0.002048,0.004823&t=h&z=18| accessdate=November 23, 2009[/tpl]

===Acquisition===

Mega-Gem was loaned to the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) by the Carl Solway Gallery from 1994 to 1996.

==Condition==

The fading paint on the rosettes has been a cause for concern in the past. In 1996, in preparation for Mega-Gem's acquisition into the Indianapolis Museum of Art collection, the rosettes were returned to the artist for repainting.
