70 Virginis (abbreviated 70 Vir) is a yellow dwarf star approximately 59 light-years away in the constellation Virgo.  It is rather unusually bright for its spectral type and may be just starting to evolve into the subgiant phase.
In 1996, 70 Virginis was discovered to have an extrasolar planet in orbit around it. There is also a dust disc with a maximum temperature of 153 K located at a minimum distance of 3.4 AU from the star.
