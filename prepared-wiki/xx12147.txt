Sir Walter Raleigh ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|i[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|l|i[/tpl], or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|l|i[/tpl];Many alternative spellings of his surname exist, including Rawley, Ralegh, Ralagh and Rawleigh. "Raleigh" appears most commonly today, though he, himself, used that spelling only once, as far as is known. His most consistent preference was for "Ralegh". His full name is [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔː|l|t|ər|_|ˈ|r|ɔː|l|i[/tpl], though, in practice, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|l|i[/tpl], [tpl]Respell|RAL|ee[/tpl] or even [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɑː|l|i[/tpl], [tpl]Respell|RAH|lee[/tpl] are the usual modern pronunciations in England. c. 1554[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]29 October 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, politician, courtier, spy, and explorer. He is also well known for popularising tobacco in England.
Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Little is known of his early life, though he spent some time in Ireland, in Killua Castle, Clonmellon, County Westmeath, taking part in the suppression of rebellions and participating in the Siege of Smerwick. Later he became a landlord of property confiscated from the native Irish. He rose rapidly in the favour of Queen Elizabeth I and was knighted in 1585. Instrumental in the English colonisation of North America, Raleigh was granted a royal patent to explore Virginia, which paved the way for future English settlements. In 1591, he secretly married Elizabeth Throckmorton, one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, without the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the Tower of London. After his release, they retired to his estate at Sherborne, Dorset.
In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for being involved in the Main Plot against King James I, who was not favourably disposed toward him. In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. This was unsuccessful, and men under his command ransacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England and, to appease the Spanish, was arrested and executed in 1618.
Raleigh was one of the most notable figures of the Elizabethan era. In 2002, he featured in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons - A complete list |publisher=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=5 August 2012[/tpl]

==Early life==

Little is known about Raleigh's birth.(Broadview Anthology) pg. 724 Some historians believe he was born on 22 January 1552, although the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography currently favours a date of 1554. He grew up in the house of Hayes Barton,Hayes Barton, Woodbury Common. a farmhouse near the village of East Budleigh, not far from Budleigh Salterton, in Devon. He was the youngest of five sons born to Catherine Champernowne in two successive marriages. His half-brothers, John Gilbert, Humphrey Gilbert, Adrian Gilbert and full brother Carew Raleigh were also prominent during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Catherine Champernowne was a niece of Kat Ashley, Elizabeth's governess, who introduced the young men at court.Ronald, p. 249.
Raleigh's family was highly Protestant in religious orientation and had a number of near escapes during the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I of England. In the most notable of these, his father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result, during his childhood, Raleigh developed a hatred of Roman Catholicism and proved himself quick to express it after the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. In matters of religion Elizabeth was more moderate than her sister Mary.
In 1569 Raleigh left for France to serve with the Huguenots in the French religious civil wars."Broadview Anthology" pg. 724  In 1572, Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford but he left a year later without a degree.  Raleigh proceeded to finish his education in the Inns of court.Broadview Anthology pg. 724 In 1575, he was registered at the Middle Temple. At his trial in 1603, he stated that he had never studied law. His life between these two dates is uncertain but in his History of the World he claimed to be an eye-witness at the Battle of Moncontour (3 October 1569) in France.Edward Edwards, The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh. Volume I (London: Macmillan, 1868), p. 26. In 1575 or 1576 Raleigh returned to England.Edwards, p. 33.

==Ireland==

Between 1579 and 1583, Raleigh took part in the suppression of the Desmond Rebellions. He was present at the Siege of Smerwick.[tpl]cite book|title=Life of Sir Walter Raleigh: 1552 – 1618 : in two volumes, Volume 1|first=James Augustus|last=Saint-John|authorlink=James Augustus St. John|chapter=Perpetrates the Massacre of Del Oro|pages=52–77[/tpl] Upon the seizure and distribution of land following the attainders arising from the rebellion, Raleigh received [tpl]convert|40000|acre|km2[/tpl], including the coastal walled towns of Youghal and Lismore. This made him one of the principal landowners in Munster, but he enjoyed limited success in inducing English tenants to settle on his estates.
During his seventeen years as an Irish landlord, frequently being domiciled at Killua Castle, Clonmellon, County Westmeath, Raleigh made the town of Youghal his occasional home.  He was mayor there from 1588 to 1589. His town mansion, Myrtle Grove, is assumed to be the setting for the story that his servant doused him with a bucket of water after seeing clouds of smoke coming from Raleigh's pipe, in the belief he had been set alight. But this story is also told of other places associated with Raleigh: the Virginia Ash Inn in Henstridge near Sherborne, Sherborne Castle and South Wraxall Manor in Wiltshire, home of Raleigh's friend, Sir Walter Long.
Amongst Raleigh's acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land there, the poet Edmund Spenser. In the 1590s, he and Raleigh travelled together from Ireland to the court at London, where Spenser presented part of his allegorical poem, the Faerie Queene, to Elizabeth I.
Raleigh's management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties, which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602, he sold the lands to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, who subsequently prospered under kings James I and Charles I.Concise Dictionary of National Biography, founded 1882 by George Smith, part 1 - to 1900 page 133  Following Raleigh's death, members of his family approached Boyle for compensation on the ground that Raleigh had struck an improvident bargain.

==The New World==

Raleigh explored from North Carolina to Florida and named the region Virginia in honor of the "Virgin Queen." Walter Raleigh Biography
Raleigh's plan in 1584 for colonisation in the "Colony and Dominion of Virginia" in North America ended in failure at Roanoke Island, but paved the way for subsequent colonies.[tpl]cite book |author=Markham, Jerry W. |title=A Financial History of the United States |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, N.Y |year=2001 |page=22 |isbn=0-7656-0730-1 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl] These expeditions were funded primarily by Raleigh and his friends, but never provided the steady stream of revenue necessary to maintain a colony in America. (Subsequent colonisation attempts in the early 17th century were made under the joint-stock Virginia Company, which was able to raise the capital necessary to create successful colonies.)
In 1587, Raleigh attempted a second expedition, again establishing a settlement on Roanoke Island. This time, a more diverse group of settlers was sent, including some entire families, under the governance of John White.[tpl]cite book|last=Blacker|first=Irwin|title=Hakluyt's Voyages: The Principle Navigations Voyages Traffiques & Discoveries of the English Nation|year=1965|publisher=The Viking Press|location=New York|page=522[/tpl] After a short while in America, White returned to England to obtain more supplies for the colony, planning to return in a year. Unfortunately for the colonists at Roanoke, one year became three. The first delay came when Queen Elizabeth I ordered all vessels to remain at port for potential use against the Spanish Armada. After England's 1588 victory over the Spanish Armada, the ships were given permission to sail.[tpl]cite book |last=Quinn |first=David B. |title=Set Fair for Roanoke: Voyages and Colonies, 1584-1606 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DvA0Az4owikC |accessdate=3 June 2011 |date=February 1985 |publisher=UNC Press Books |isbn=978-0-8078-4123-5[/tpl][tpl]rp|125–126[/tpl]
The second delay came after White's small fleet set sail for Roanoke and his crew insisted on sailing first towards Cuba in hopes of capturing treasure-laden Spanish merchant ships. Enormous riches described by their pilot, an experienced Portuguese navigator hired by Raleigh, outweighed White's objections to the delay.[tpl]rp|125–126[/tpl]
When the supply ship arrived in Roanoke, three years later than planned, the colonists had disappeared.[tpl]rp|130–33[/tpl]  The only clue to their fate was the word "CROATOAN" and letters "CRO" carved into tree trunks. White had arranged with the settlers that if they should move, the name of their destination be carved into a tree or corner-post. This suggested the possibilities that they had moved to Croatoan Island. But a hurricane prevented John White from investigating the island for survivors.[tpl]rp|130–33[/tpl]  Other speculation includes their having starved, or been swept away or lost at sea during the stormy weather of 1588. No further attempts at contact were recorded for some years. Whatever the fate of the settlers, the settlement is now remembered as the "Lost Colony of Roanoke Island".

==Later life==

===1580s===

In December 1581, Raleigh returned to England from Ireland to despatches as his company had been disbanded. He took part in Court life and because of his efforts in increasing the Protestant Church in Ireland  he became a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I.  Various colourful stories are told about him at this period, but they are likely apocryphal.Fragmenta RegaliaFuller's Worthies
In 1585 Raleigh was knighted and was appointed warden of the stannaries, that is of the mines of Cornwall and Devon, Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall, and vice-admiral of the two counties. Both in 1585 and 1586, he sat in parliament as member for Devonshire.J. K. Laughton and Sidney Lee, Ralegh, Sir Walter (1552?–1618), military and naval commander and author, 1896  He was also granted the right to colonize America.
Raleigh commissioned the shipbuilder R. Chapman, of Deptford to build a ship for him. Originally called Ark, it became Ark Raleigh, following the convention at the time by which the ship bore the name of its owner. The Crown, in the form of Queen Elizabeth I, purchased the ship from Raleigh in January 1587, for the sum of £5,000 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|5000|1587|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-5[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl] (This took the form of a reduction in the sum Sir Walter owed the queen: he received Exchequer tallies, but no money.) As a result, the ship was renamed Ark Royal.Archaeologia, p. 151

===1590–1603===

In 1592, Raleigh was given many rewards by the Queen, including Durham House in the Strand and the estate of Sherborne, Dorset. He was appointed Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. However, he had not been given any of the great offices of state. In the Armada year of 1588, Raleigh was appointed Vice Admiral of Devon, looking after the coastal defences and military levies.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
In 1591, Raleigh was secretly married to Elizabeth "Bess" Throckmorton (or Throgmorton). She was one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, eleven years his junior, and was pregnant at the time. She gave birth to a son, believed to be named Damerei, who was given to a wet nurse at Durham House, but died in October 1592 of plague. Bess resumed her duties to the queen. The following year, the unauthorised marriage was discovered and the Queen ordered Raleigh imprisoned and Bess dismissed from court. Both were imprisoned in the Tower of London in June 1592. He was released from prison in August 1592 to help set up an expedition for an attack on the Spanish coast. Although recalled by the Queen, the fleet captured an incredibly rich prize, the Madre de Deus (Mother of God) off Flores of which he had to divide the spoils. Bess was released in December.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
It would be several years before Raleigh returned to favour. The couple remained devoted to each other. During Raleigh's absences, Bess proved a capable manager of the family's fortunes and reputation. They had two more sons, Walter (known as Wat) and Carew.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
Raleigh was elected a burgess of Mitchell, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1593.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23039?docPos=1|title=Ralegh, Sir Walter (1554–1618)|last=Nicholls|first=Mark|coauthors=Williams, Penry|date=September 2004|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]ODNBsub[/tpl] He retired to his estate at Sherborne where he built a new house, completed in 1594, known then as Sherborne Lodge. Since extended, it is now known as Sherborne (new) Castle. He made friends with the local gentry, such as Sir Ralph Horsey of Clifton Maybank and Charles Thynne of Longleat. During this period at a dinner party at Horsey's, there was a heated discussion about religion. The argument later gave rise to charges of atheism against Raleigh. He was elected to Parliament, speaking on religious and naval matters.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
In 1594, he came into possession of a Spanish account of a great golden city at the headwaters of the Caroní River. A year later he explored what is now Guyana and eastern Venezuela in search of Manoa, the legendary city. Once back in England, he published The Discovery of GuianaSir Walter Raleigh. The Discovery of Guiana Project Gutenberg. (1596) an account of his voyage which made exaggerated claims as to what had been discovered. The book can be seen as a contribution to the El Dorado legend. Although Venezuela has gold deposits, there is no evidence Raleigh found any mines.  He is sometimes said to have discovered Angel Falls, but these claims are considered far-fetched."Walter Raleigh – Delusions of Guiana" at The Lost World: Travel and information on the Gran Sabana, Canaima National Park, Venezuela web page. Retrieved 5 July 2008.
In 1596 Raleigh took part in the Capture of Cadiz, where he was wounded. He was also the second-in-command of the Islands Voyage to the Azores in 1597.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
In 1597, he was chosen member of parliament for Dorset, and, in 1601, for Cornwall.  He was unique in the Elizabethan period in sitting for three counties.
From 1600 to 1603, as Governor of the Channel Island of Jersey, Raleigh modernised its defences. This included construction of a new fort protecting the approaches to Saint Helier, Fort Isabella Bellissima, or Elizabeth Castle.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]

==Trial and imprisonment==

Royal favour with Queen Elizabeth had been restored by this time but his good fortune did not last. The Queen died in 1603, and Raleigh was arrested at Exeter Inn, Ashburton, Devon and imprisoned in the Tower of London on 19 July 1603. On 17 November, Raleigh was tried in the converted Great Hall of Winchester Castle for treason, due to his involvement in the Main Plot against King James.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
Raleigh conducted his defence. The chief evidence against Raleigh was the signed and sworn confession of his friend Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. Raleigh frequently requested that Cobham be called in to testify so that he might recant, "Let my accuser come face to face, and be deposed. Were the case but for a small copyhold, you would have witnesses or good proof to lead the jury to a verdict; and I am here for my life!" Raleigh essentially was objecting that the evidence against him was "hearsay"; but the tribunal refused to allow Cobham to testify and be cross examined.1 Criminal Trials 400, 400–511, 1850.[ref]Note on the trial under commission of Oyer and Terminer with a jury, at a court of assizes
http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey_BE_Trial_of_Sir_Walter_Raleigh.pdf.[/ref] King James spared his life, despite a guilty verdict.[tpl]citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl] In October 1994 documents which had previously been imperfectly catalogued at the Bodleian Library were discovered during random checking of papers held there. These included Raleigh's own deposition and Cobham's statement to the tribunal, and provide strong evidence that Raleigh denounced King James and spoke in favour of a Spanish invasion, and went so far as to advise on the best invasion location (he recommended Milford Haven); he also requested a Spanish pension of £1,500 a year in return for his spying.Autograph papers held at the Bodleian Library, dated 1603, previously catalogued in the papers of Thomas Carte
He remained imprisoned in the Tower until 1616. While there, he wrote many treatises and the first volume of The Historie of the World (published 1628)[tpl]cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?&au=w+raleigh&ti=historie+world&sort-order=ti%2C%2Ddate|title=The Historie of the World|last=Raleigh|first=Walter|accessdate=19 November 2009[/tpl] about the ancient history of Greece and Rome. His son, Carew, was conceived and born (1604) while Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower.

==Second voyage to Guiana, 1617–1618==

In 1616, Raleigh was released in order to conduct a second expedition to Venezuela in search of El Dorado. During the expedition, Raleigh's men, under the command of Lawrence Keymis, attacked the Spanish outpost of Santo Tomé de Guayana (San Tomé) on the Orinoco River. In the initial attack on the settlement, Raleigh's son, Walter, was fatally shot. On Raleigh's return to England, an outraged Count Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, successfully demanded that King James reinstate Raleigh's death sentence. Raleigh was brought to London from Plymouth, by Sir Lewis Stukeley, and passed up numerous opportunities to make an effective escape.[tpl]ODNBweb|id=26740|title=Stucley, Sir Lewis|first=Mary|last=Wolffe[/tpl][tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Stucley, Lewis|volume=55[/tpl]

==Execution and aftermath==

Raleigh was beheaded in the Old Palace Yard at the Palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618. "Let us dispatch", he said to his executioner. "At this hour my ague comes upon me. I would not have my enemies think I quaked from fear." After he was allowed to see the axe that would behead him, he mused: "This is a sharp Medicine, but it is a Physician for all diseases and miseries." According to many biographers – for instance, Raleigh Trevelyan in Sir Walter Raleigh (2002) – Raleigh's final words (as he lay ready for the axe to fall) were: "Strike, man, strike!"Trevelyan (2002) p. 552
Having been one of the people to popularise tobacco smoking in England, he left a small tobacco pouch, found in his cell shortly after his execution. Engraved upon the pouch was a Latin inscription: Comes meus fuit in illo miserrimo tempore ("It was my companion at that most miserable time").[tpl]cite web|author=Gene Borio |url=http://www.tobacco.org/resources/history/Tobacco_History17.html |title=Tobacco Timeline: The Seventeenth Century-The Great Age of the Pipe |publisher=Tobacco.org |accessdate=October 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sir Walter Raleigh's tobacco pouch|url=http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=64809&viewType=detailView|publisher=Wallace Collection|accessdate=1 November 2012[/tpl]
Raleigh's head was embalmed and presented to his wife. His body was to be buried in the local church in Beddington, Surrey, the home of Lady Raleigh, but was finally laid to rest in St. Margaret's, Westminster, where his tomb may still be visited today.Williams, Norman Lloyd. "Sir Walter Raleigh", Cassell Biographies, 1962) "The Lords", she wrote, "have given me his dead body, though they have denied me his life. God hold me in my wits."Durant, Will, The Story of Civilisation, vol. VII, Chap. VI, p.158 It has been said that Lady Raleigh kept her husband's head in a velvet bag until her death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/raleghana08brus/raleghana08brus_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Raleghana" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=October 29, 2012[/tpl] After his wife's death 29 years later, Raleigh's head was returned to his tomb and interred at St. Margaret's Church.Lloyd, J & Mitchinson, J: "The Book of General I.
Although Raleigh's popularity had waned considerably since his Elizabethan heyday, his execution was seen by many, both at the time and since, as unnecessary and unjust, as for many years his involvement in the Main Plot seemed to have been limited to a meeting with Lord Cobham.ed. Ronald Christenson, Political Trials in History: From Antiquity to the Present, p. 385-7. Transaction Publishers (1991). ISBN 978-0-88738-406-6 One of the judges at his trial later said: "The justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of the honourable Sir Walter Raleigh."Historical summary, Crawford v. Washington (page 10 of .pdf file) This view has been less widely held since the discovery of some of the 1603 tribunal's paperwork in the Bodleian Library in 1994, which strongly supports the case against Raleigh.

==Poetry==

Raleigh's poetry is written in the relatively straightforward, unornamented mode known as the plain style. C. S. Lewis considered Raleigh one of the era's "silver poets", a group of writers who resisted the Italian Renaissance influence of dense classical reference and elaborate poetic devices.  His writing contains strong personal treatment of themes such as love, loss, beauty, and time.  Most of his poems are short lyrics that were inspired by actual events.Broadview Anthology pg. 724
In poems such as "What is Our Life" and "The Lie", Raleigh expresses a contemptus mundi (contempt of the world) attitude more characteristic of the Middle Ages than of the dawning era of humanistic optimism. But, his lesser-known long poem "The Ocean to Cynthia" combines this vein with the more elaborate conceits associated with his contemporaries Edmund Spenser and John Donne, expressing a melancholy sense of history.  The poem was written during his imprisonment in the Tower of London.
Raleigh wrote a poetic response to Christopher Marlowe's "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love" of 1592, entitled "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd". Both were written in the style of traditional pastoral poetry and follow the structure of six four-line stanzas employing a rhyme scheme of AABB, with Raleigh's an almost line-for-line refutation of Marlowe's sentiments.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/marlowe/shepherd_&_notes.htm |title=Notes for "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love" |publisher=Dr. Bruce Magee, Louisiana Tech University |accessdate=29 October 2012[/tpl] Years later the 20th century poet William Carlos Williams would join the poetic "argument" with his "Raleigh was Right."

==Legacy==

The state capital of North Carolina and its second largest city was named Raleigh in 1792 after Sir Walter, sponsor of the Roanoke Colony. In the city a bronze statue, which has been moved around different locations within the city, was cast in honour of the city's namesake. The "Lost Colony" is commemorated at the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site on Roanoke Island, North Carolina.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
One of eleven boarding houses at the Royal Hospital School has been named after Raleigh. Raleigh County, West Virginia, is also named in his honour.[tpl]Citation needed|date = October 2012[/tpl]
