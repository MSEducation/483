The House of ValoisValois meaning, literally, "of the valley" or "from the valley" ([tpl]IPA-fr|valwa[/tpl]) was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty, succeeding the House of Capet (or "Direct Capetians") as kings of France from 1328 to 1589. A cadet branch of the family reigned as dukes of Burgundy from 1363 to 1482.
The Valois descended from Charles, Count of Valois (1270-1325), the fourth son of King Philip III of France (reigned 1270-1285). They based their claim on the Salic law, which excluded females (Joan II of Navarre) as well as male descendants through the distaff line (Edward III of England), from the succession to the French throne.

==Unexpected inheritance==

The Capetian dynasty seemed secure both during and after the reign of Philip IV from 1285 to 1313. Philip had left three surviving sons (Louis, Philip and Charles) and a daughter (Isabella). Each son became king in turn but died young without male heirs, leaving only daughters who could not inherit the throne. When Charles IV died in 1328, the French succession became more problematic.
In 1328 three candidates had plausible claims to the throne:

 

 The claimants to the French throne in 1328
In England, Isabella of France claimed the throne on behalf of her son. Similarly to French conventions, the English law of succession did not allow the succession of females,[ref]
The contested reign in the early 12th century of Mathilda, Lady of the English, had not set a good precedent, occasioning lengthy civil war.[tpl]Clarify|1=date=29 Mar 2012|date=March 2012[/tpl].

but allowed the succession through the female line (as occurred de facto with Henry II of England). The French rejected Isabella's claims, arguing that since she herself, as a woman, could not succeed, then she could not transmit any such right to her son. Thus the French authorities chose Philip of Valois, who became Philip VI of France. The throne of Navarre went its separate way, to Joan of France, daughter of Louis X, who became Joan II of Navarre.
Because diplomacy and negotiation had failed, Edward III would have to back his claims with force to obtain the French throne. For a few years, England and France maintained an uneasy peace. Eventually, an escalation of conflict between the two kings led to the confiscation of the duchy of Aquitaine (1337). Instead of paying homage to the French king, as his ancestors had done, Edward claimed that he was the rightful King of France. These events helped launch the Hundred Years War (1337-1453) between England and France.
