Deg Tegh means kettle and sword, where the kettle symbolizes "charity", as in  langar, the free distribution of food.
The sword (talwar) represents the warrior code of the Khalsa, The Khanda emblem is a graphical design based on the slogan.
The Sikh warrior Banda Singh Bahadur incorporated this slogan into his seal, and Sardar Jassa Singh Ahluwalia struck it into coins in 1765 after a decisive defeat of the rival Afghans.
The seal bore the inscription Deg-o-Tegh-o-Fateh Nusrat-i-bedirang, Yaft az Nanak Guru Gobind Singh "Cauldron (charity), Sword, Victory and  Unhesitating Patronagem are obtained from Nanak Guru Gobind Singh  .'''
This inscription was later adopted by the Sikh Misaldar Sardars and rulers on their coins. It was the national anthem of the princely state of Patiala during the Sikh Confederacy. This national anthem had been sung in all the Sikh States until 1948. Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha, too, has mentioned it in his magnum opus Mahan Kosh (p. 1165 of the 1999 edition).
