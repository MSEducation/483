After performing for the short-lived Washington D.C.-based band State of Alert in 1980, Rollins fronted the California hardcore punk band Black Flag from August 1981 until mid-1986. Following the band's breakup, Rollins established the record label and publishing company 2.13.61 to release his spoken word albums, as well as forming the Rollins Band, which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 until 2003, and during 2006.
Since Black Flag disbanded, Rollins has hosted numerous radio shows, such as Harmony in My Head on Indie 103, and television shows such as The Henry Rollins Show, MTVs 120 Minutes, and Jackass. He had a recurring dramatic role in the second season of Sons of Anarchy and has also had roles in several films. Rollins has also campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including promoting LGBT rights, World Hunger Relief, and an end to war in particular.

==Early life==

Rollins was born Henry Lawrence Garfield in Washington, D.C. He is the only child of Iris H. Garfield, a federal employee in the health and education sectors,[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] and Paul Jerome Garfield, an economist who is a PhD and published author on the subject.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Life-on-road-suits-Rollins-fine-263878.php |title=Life on road suits Rollins fine |publisher= The News Times (Danbury, CT)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.comeinandburn.com/archive/hqmay97.htm |title=An Unofficial Henry Rollins & Rollins Band Website |publisher=Come In And Burn |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19[/tpl] When he was three years old, his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in the affluent Glover Park neighborhood of the city.J.

As a child and teenager, Rollins suffered from depression and low self-esteem.Azerrad, Michael. Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991. Little Brown and Company, 2001. ISBN 0-316-78753-1. p. 25 In the fourth grade, he was diagnosed with hyperactivity and took Ritalin for several years so that he could focus during school. He attended The Bullis School, then an all-male preparatory school in Potomac, Maryland.
According to Rollins, the Bullis School helped him to develop a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic. It was at Bullis that he began writing; his early literary efforts were mainly short stories about "blowing up my school and murdering all the teachers."

==Music career==

===State of Alert===

After high school, Rollins attended American University in Washington D.C. for one semester, but dropped out in December 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/ |title=An Interview With Henry Rollins | The Daily |publisher=Dailyuw.com |date=1996-11-27 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl] He began working minimum-wage jobs, including a job as a courier for liver samples at the National Institutes of Health.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/henryrollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2007-08-14 |author=Sklar, Ronald |publisher=PopEntertainment.com[/tpl] Rollins developed an interest in punk rock after he and his friend Ian MacKaye procured a copy of The Ramones's eponymous debut album; he later described it as a "revelation." From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including Teen Idles. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins's ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; Bad Brains singer H.R. would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.Azerrad, 2001. p. 26
In 1980, the Washington punk band The Extorts lost their frontman Lyle Preslar to Minor Threat. Rollins joined the rest of the band to form State of Alert, and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, No Policy, and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's Dischord Records.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442659|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=State of Alert > Overview |accessdate=2007-08-16 |author=DePasquale, Ron |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said: "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam ... Loved to get in the dust-ups." By this time, Rollins had become the manager of the Georgetown Häagen-Dazs ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.Azerrad, 2001. p. 27

===Black Flag===

In 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's Nervous Breakdown EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist Chuck Dukowski and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28 When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist Dez Cadena allowed Rollins to sing "Clocked In", as Rollins had a five-hour drive back to Washington, D.C., to return to work after the performance.Azerrad, 2001. p. 28
Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist. The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in NYC, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.Azerrad, 2001. p. 29
After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps and chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers. Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California.[tpl]cite web|title=Black Flag at the Cuckoo’s Nest|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21|work=It All Happened - A Living History of Live Music[/tpl]  Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. ... My little eyes were opened big time."Azerrad, 2001. p. 31
Before concerts, as the rest of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.Azerrad, 2001. p. 34 His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in Anacortes, Washington, Sub Pop critic Calvin Johnson wrote: "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen."Azerrad, 2001. p. 38
By 1983, Rollins' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience, who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a "macho asshole."Azerrad, 2001. p. 39 A legal dispute with Unicorn Records held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist Dez Cadena had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.Azerrad, 2001. p. 41 1984's heavy metal music-influenced My War featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.Azerrad, 2001. p. 47
Black Flag's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I really want to do to them."Azerrad, 2001. p. 46 During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself."  Rollins has since replied that "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/henry-rollins/2008/04/03/1206851089537.html |title=Henry Rollins interview |accessdate=2008-04-04 |author=Jensen, Erik|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=2008-04-03[/tpl]

===Rollins Band and solo releases===

Before Black Flag disbanded in August 1986, Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |title=Lip Service – Henry Rollins |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Waggoner, Eric |publisher=Seattle Weekly |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014220714/http://seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php |archivedate = October 14, 2007[/tpl] He released two solo records in 1987, Hot Animal Machine, a collaboration with guitarist Chris Haskett, and Drive by Shooting, recorded as "Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters";[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/punk_newwave_postpunk/support/Rollins.htm |title=Henry Rollins/Black Flag |accessdate=2007-09-09 |author=Hoffmann, Frank |publisher=Survey of American Popular Music[/tpl] Rollins also released his second spoken word album, Big Ugly Mouth in the same year. Along with Haskett, Rollins soon added Andrew Weiss and Sim Cain, both former members of Ginn's side-project Gone, and called the new group Rollins Band. The band toured relentlessly,[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p191773|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Rollins Band > Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] and their 1987 debut album, Life Time, was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection Do It. The band continued to tour throughout 1988; 1989 marked the release of another Rollins Band album, Hard Volume.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5299|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Henry Rollins > Biography |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Huey, Steve |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Another live album, Turned On, and another spoken word release, Live at McCabe's, followed in 1990.
1991 saw the Rollins Band sign a distribution deal with Imago Records and appear at the Lollapalooza festival; both improved the band's presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police initially suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edwebproject.org/rollins.html |title=Primal Scream: Henry Rollins speaks |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Carvin, Andy; Crone, Chris |publisher=EdWebProject.org[/tpl] Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book Now Watch Him Die, Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album Human Butt appeared in 1992 on his own record label, 2.13.61. The Rollins Band released The End of Silence, Rollins's first charting album.
The following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, The Boxed Life.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r77934|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=The Boxed Life > Overview |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] The Rollins Band embarked upon the End of Silence tour; bassist Weiss was fired towards its end and replaced by funk and jazz bassist Melvin Gibbs. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollins's "breakout year". The Rollins Band appeared at Woodstock 94 and released Weight, which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag, a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording as a result. Rollins was named 1994's "Man of the Year" by the American men's magazine Details and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and VH1 around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in The Chase playing a police officer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022646/bio |title=Henry Rollins Biography |accessdate=2007-09-14 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies[/tpl]
In 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released Everything, a recording of a chapter of his book Eye Scream with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including Heat, Johnny Mnemonic and Lost Highway. The Rollins Band signed to Dreamworks Records in 1997 and soon released Come in and Burn, but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing Black Coffee Blues in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released Think Tank, his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.
By 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three. After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he "may never do music again"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=61600|title=Henry Rollins on 'Tom Green Live'|date=November 5, 2006|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2010-01-19[/tpl] a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/henry_rollins_Student_protests_are_great/|title=Henry Rollins:Student Protests are Great|date=January 11, 2011|publisher=Trebuchet Magazine|accessdate=2011-01-05[/tpl] In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – "... and I must say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different."[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.culturebrats.com/2011/03/tramp-last-mile-our-interview-with.html |title=Tramp The Last Mile: Our Interview With Henry Rollins |publisher=Culture Brats |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2012-10-31[/tpl]

===Musical style===

As a vocalist, Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years. Rollins was initially noted in the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a "compelling, raspy howl." With State of Alert, Rollins "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer." He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album Damaged, however, Black Flag began to incorporate a swing beat into their style. Rollins then abandoned his S.O.A. "bark" and adopted the band's swing.Azerrad, 2001. p. 32 Rollins later explained: "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed."Azerrad, 2001. p. 33
In both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as "Liar" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), as well as barking his way through songs (such as "Tearing" and "Starve") and employing the loud-quiet dynamic. Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a "screeching hate machine" and his "hallmark" as "the sheets-of-sound assault".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again |title=Rollins Band: Get Some Go Again |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012173915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again  |archivedate=2007-10-12[/tpl]
With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused "almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity," according to critic Geoffrey Welchman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight |title=Rollins Band: Weight |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author=Welchman, Geoffrey |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012173910/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight  |archivedate=2007-10-12[/tpl]

===As producer===

In the 1980s, Henry Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict Charles Manson titled Completion. The record was supposed to be released by SST Records, but the project was later canceled due to the label receiving death threats for working with Manson. Only five test presses of Completion were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins' possession.[tpl]cite web| last = Luerssen| first = John D. | title = Henry Rollins Reveals He Produced Charles Manson Album| work = Spinner| publisher = AOL Music| date = December 15, 2010| url = http://www.spinner.com/2010/12/15/henry-rollins-charles-manson/| accessdate = December 15, 2010[/tpl]

==Joe Cole==

Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared Venice Beach, California home where Cole was killed after being shot in the face while Rollins escaped.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-02/entertainment/ca-151_1_henry-rollins |title=Singer-Poet Henry Rollins Fuels His Art With Rage - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1999-01-12 |accessdate=2014-04-19[/tpl] The murder remains unsolved.[tpl]cite news|title=Dennis Cole, ‘Felony Squad’ Actor, Is Dead at 69|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|work=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/arts/television/22cole.html?_r=0[/tpl]
In a 1992 Los Angeles Times interview Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Joe Cole. Rollins said "I dug up all the earth where his head fell—he was shot in the face—and I've got all the dirt here, and so Joe Cole's in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good."
Rollins went on to include Cole's story in his spoken word performances.[tpl]cite web|work=DVD Verdict|title=Henry Rollins: Live At Luna Park|first=Patrick|last=Bromley|date=May 6, 2004|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/rollinslunapark.php[/tpl]
