[[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (country)]]

CATEGORIES: Vehicle registration plates by country, Road transport in Georgia (country), Georgia (country) transport-related lists

Vehicle registration plates of Georgia are composed of an embossed serial of three letters, a hyphen and three numbers (e.g. ABC-123), in black on a white background. The plates are issued in the Latin alphabet. Georgian license plates are the same size as the most common European license plate. All plates have the abbreviation "GE" or formerly "GEO" in the lower left corner of the plate, while newer plates also have the national flag in the upper left corner. This set of license plates were running out of combinations by 2014, when a new style of plates were announced.[tpl]cite web | url = http://police.ge/ge/shss-s-momsakhurebis-saagentoshi-akhali-sanomre-nishnebis-dizainis-prezentatsia-gaimarta/6279 | title = შსს-ს მომსახურების სააგენტოში ახალი სანომრე ნიშნების დიზაინის პრეზენტაცია გაიმართა | trans_title = Presentation of new license plates held at Service Agency | language = Georgian | accessdate = 2014-03-25 | date = 2014-03-05 | publisher = Service Agency of MIA of Georgia [/tpl]
A new, European-style of license plate is to be introduced in the autumn of 2014. These are to have sets of two letters first and last, with three numerals in the middle. A blue strip on the left contains the Georgian flag and a "GE", while there will be a small security hologram on the bottom right. The old style plates will remain valid until 2030 at least. To accommodate owners of imported American or Japanese vehicles, a more square styled plate will also become available.

==Car designations==

Originally the first letter of the registration plate was assigned according to the territory where the vehicle was registered:
Once the system was exhausted, it was removed. Anyone may buy the combination they like. Some commercial organization have bought up all the number sequences within one tri-letter combination (e.g. all the TBC license plates are owned by TBC Bank, and all the MZE license plates are owned by Mze TV Company). Ambulances have license plates in the PSP series, after the pharmaceutical company sponsoring them, and fire engines have license plates in the SOS series.

==Abkhazia and South Ossetia==

The self-proclaimed republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia issue their own license plates: Russian-style plates in Abkhazia and Soviet-style plates in South Ossetia. Since 2004 these license plates are forbidden to be used on the territory controlled by the government of Georgia; while the Georgian license plates are not allowed to be used on the territory controlled by separatists. Thus most cars that cross the boundaries of the unrecognised republics have to use Russian license plates.

==Military plates==

As of 2011, military police patrol vehicle plates were black with white letters, with a narrow yellow strip on the left containing the letters "GA" above each other. The code was two latin letters followed by three numerals, with a safety hologram separating them.
