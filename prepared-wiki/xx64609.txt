Evin Prison ([tpl]lang-fa|زندان اوین[/tpl] Zendān Evin) is a prison in Iran, located in Evin, northwestern Tehran. It is noted for its political prisoners' wing, where prisoners have been held both before and after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Due to the number of intellectuals that the prison housed, it was nicknamed "Evin University".Inskeep, Steve. "Iran's Evin Prison Likened to Torture Chamber." National Public Radio. 19 July 2007.

==Background==

Constructed in 1972 under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, Evin Prison is located at the foot of the Alborz mountains on the former home of Ziaeddin Tabatabaee, who briefly served as prime minister in the 1920s. The grounds of the prison included an execution yard, courtroom and separate blocks for common criminals and female inmates. Originally operated by the Shah's security and intelligence service, SAVAK, Evin quickly supplanted Qasr Prison as "the country's Bastille". Initially designed to house 320 inmates (20 in solitary cells and 300 in two large communal blocks), Evin expanded to hold more than 1,500 prisoners (including 100 solitary cells for the most important political prisoners) by 1977.[tpl]Cite book|title=Tortured confessions: prisons and public recantations in modern Iran |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |authorlink=Ervand Abrahamian |year=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-21866-6 |page=105 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_mnrYNIVfCgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=24 December 2009[/tpl]
Under the Islamic Republic, the prison population was again expanded significantly, holding 15,000 inmates according to scholar Ervand Abrahamian.Abrahamian, p. 135-6 "In theory, Evin was a detention center for those awaiting trial", after which the prisoners would be transferred to another prison, Qezel Hesar or Gohardasht Prison. "In reality, Evin served as a regular prison as many waited years before being brought to trial", and prominent prisoners often served their entire sentences in Evin". Executions also took place at Evin.Abrahamian, p.135 Following the Islamic Revolution, Mohammad Kachouyi was made warden of Evin. After his assassination in June 1981, Asadollah Lajevardi, the chief prosecutor of Tehran, served as warden until 1985.Abrahamian, p.136 In 1998, the People's Mujahedin of Iran assassinated Lajevardi.
The prison is located in a residential and commercial area known as Evin, next to the Saadat Abad district. There is a large park area with a popular upscale teahouse and restaurant located immediately next to it.

It is said that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades.New Prison-Rape Allegations In Iran Bring Practice To Light During the 1980s, the rape of female political prisoners was prevalent. It was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, who was Ayatollah Khomeini’s deputy at the time, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated October 7, 1986: "Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?"
