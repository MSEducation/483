The World Bank is a United Nations international financial institution that provides loans[tpl]cite web |title=About Us |publisher=World Bank |date=14 October 2008 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,pagePK:50004410~piPK:36602~theSitePK:29708,00.html |accessdate=9 November 2008[/tpl] to developing countries for capital programs. The World Bank is a component of the World Bank Group, and a member of the United Nations Development Group. 
The World Bank's official goal is the reduction of poverty. According to its Articles of Agreement, all its decisions must be guided by a commitment to the promotion of foreign investment and international trade and to the facilitation of capital investment. Articles of Agreement: as amended effective 16 February 1989.[tpl]cite web |title=About Us |publisher=World Bank |date=29 June 2011|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/0,,contentMDK:20049563~pagePK:43912~menuPK:58863~piPK:36602,00.html#I1 |accessdate=14 August 2011[/tpl]

==Composition==

===World Bank===

The World Bank is composed of two institutions: 

===World Bank Group===

The World Bank should not be confused with the  United Nations World Bank Group, a member of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and a family of five international organizations that make leveraged loans to poor countries which is comprised of the:[tpl]cite web |title=About The World Bank (FAQs) |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011 |url=http://go.worldbank.org/1M3PFQQMD0 |accessdate=14 August 2011[/tpl] 

==History==

The World Bank was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, along with three other institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The World Bank and the IMF are both based in Washington, D.C., and work closely with each other.
Although many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference, the United States and United Kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations.[tpl]Cite book | title = Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization | author = Goldman, Michael | year = 2005 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, CT | isbn = 978-0-30-011974-9[/tpl][tpl]rp|52–54[/tpl]

===1944–1968===

Before 1968, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff was aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. Fiscal conservatism ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.[tpl]rp|56–60[/tpl]
The first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, John McCloy, chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250 million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the United States State Department told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied with this diktat and removed the Communist coalition government. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.[tpl]Cite book | title = The Chairman: John J. McCloy, the Making of the American Establishment | author = Bird, Kai | year = 1992 | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-67-145415-9[/tpl][tpl]rp|288, 290–291[/tpl]
When the Marshall Plan went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were earmarked for the construction of income-producing infrastructure, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan.

===1968–1980===

From 1968 to 1980, the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world. The size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors.[tpl]cite web | title = World Bank Historical Chronology: 1970-1979 | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/847R4CBE80 | accessdate = 2012-05-31[/tpl]
These changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by Lyndon B. Johnson.[tpl]rp|60–63[/tpl] McNamara imported a technocratic managerial style to the Bank that he had used as United States Secretary of Defense and President of the Ford Motor Company.[tpl]rp|62[/tpl] McNamara shifted bank policy toward measures such as building schools and hospitals, improving literacy and agricultural reform. McNamara created a new system of gathering information from potential borrower nations that enabled the bank to process loan applications much faster. To finance more loans, McNamara told bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of bank funding. Rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | title = Financial Operations of the World Bank | author = Rotberg, Eugene | encyclopedia = Bretton Woods: looking to the future: commission report, staff review, background papers | year = 1994 | publisher = Bretton Woods Commission | location = Washington, D.C. | url = http://external.worldbankimflib.org/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/5/?searchdata1=219610%7Bckey%7D#_[/tpl] One consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of third world debt. From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20%.[tpl]Cite book | title = Aid and Power: The World Bank and Policy Based Lending, 2nd Edition | author = Mosley, Paul | author2 = Harrigan, Jane | author3 = Toye, John | year = 1995 | volume = 1 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abington, UK | isbn = 978-0-415-13209-1[/tpl][tpl]Cite book | title = Your Money or Your Life!: The Tyranny of Global Finance | author = Toussaint, Eric | year = 1999 | publisher = Pluto Press | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-74-531412-9[/tpl]
In 1980, the World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established to decide on disputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of non-observance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored.[tpl]cite web | title = World Bank Administrative Tribunal | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/crn/wbt/wbtwebsite.nsf/%28resultsweb%29/about?opendocument | accessdate = 2011-08-14[/tpl]

===1980–1989===

In 1980, McNamara was succeeded by US President Jimmy Carter's nominee, A.W. Clausen. Clausen replaced many members of McNamara's staff and instituted a new ideological focus. His 1982 decision to replace the bank's Chief Economist, Hollis B. Chenery, with Anne Krueger was an indication of this new focus. Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing Third World governments as "rent-seeking states."
During the 1980s, the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and structural adjustment policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. UNICEF reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for  "reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in Asia, Latin America, and Africa".[tpl]Cite book | title = Adjustment with a Human Face: Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Growth | editor = Cornia, Giovanni Andrea | editor2 = Jolly, Richard | editor3 = Stewart, Frances | year = 1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-828609-7[/tpl]

===1989–present===

Beginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism.[tpl]rp|93–97[/tpl] It also formed an  implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop ozone-depletion damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called "Six Strategic Themes," the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991, the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.
In order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces. In 2000, the bank announced a "war on AIDS", and in 2011, the Bank joined the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.[tpl]cite web | title = Results | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://www.worldbank.org/results/ | accessdate = 2012-05-31[/tpl]
Traditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe, the president of the World Bank has always been selected from candidates nominated by the United States. In 2012, for the first time, two non-US citizens were nominated.
On 23 March 2012, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that the United States would nominate Jim Yong Kim as the next president of the Bank.[tpl]Cite news | title = President Obama Announces U.S. Nomination of Dr. Jim Yong Kim to Lead World Bank | author = Office of the Press Secretary | date = 2012-03-23 | publisher = The White House | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/23/president-obama-announces-us-nomination-dr-jim-yong-kim-lead-world-bank | accessdate = 2012-03-23[/tpl] Jim Yong Kim was elected on 27 April 2012.

====Criteria====

Many achievements have brought the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets for 2015 within reach in some cases. For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more and better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.[tpl]cite web | title = Millennium Development Goals | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/ | accessdate = 2012-05-31[/tpl]
To make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal Safeguards were defined. However these Safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these Safeguards has been initiated which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.[tpl]cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations[/tpl]

==Leadership==

The President of the Bank is the president of the entire World Bank Group. The president, currently Jim Yong Kim, is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Boards of Directors and for overall management of the Bank. Traditionally, the Bank President has always been a US citizen nominated by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank (the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund having always been a European). The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Board of Executive Directors, to serve for a five-year, renewable term. While most World Bank presidents have had banking experience, some have not.[tpl]Cite news | title = Why Jim Yong Kim would make a great World Bank president | author = Hurlburt, Heather | date = 2012-03-23 | publisher = The Guardian | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/23/jim-yong-kim-world-bank-president | accessdate = 2012-03-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Leadership | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/HWEWI4KIO0 | accessdate = 2012-07-17[/tpl]
The vice presidents of the Bank are its principal managers, in charge of regions, sectors, networks and functions. There are two Executive Vice Presidents, three Senior Vice Presidents, and 24 Vice Presidents.[tpl]cite web | title = Senior Management | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/DHWEE5LGQ0 | accessdate = 2012-08-12[/tpl]
The Boards of Directors consist of the World Bank Group President and 25 Executive Directors. The President is the presiding officer, and ordinarily has no vote except a deciding vote in case of an equal division. The Executive Directors as individuals cannot exercise any power nor commit or represent the Bank unless specifically authorized by the Boards to do so. With the term beginning 1 November 2010, the number of Executive Directors increased by one, to 25.[tpl]cite web | title = Boards of Directors | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank | url = http://go.worldbank.org/LHHOT1LSW0 | accessdate = 2012-08-12[/tpl]

===List of Presidents===

José Antonio Ocampo, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and Jim Yong Kim were candidates for the 2012 election. It was announced on 16 April 2012, that Jim Yong Kim will succeed Robert Zoellick as president, continuing the chain of successive World Bank president nominees from the United States.[tpl]cite news |title=US choice Jim Yong Kim is new World Bank chief |date=2012-04-16 |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17735368 |accessdate=2012-04-16[/tpl]

==Members==

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has 188 member countries, while the International Development Association (IDA) has 172 members. Each member state of IBRD should be also a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and only members of IBRD are allowed to join other institutions within the Bank (such as IDA).[tpl]cite web | title = Member Countries | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Group | url = http://go.worldbank.org/SGCDPJKLX0 | accessdate = 2012-07-14[/tpl]

===Voting power===

In 2013, voting powers at the World Bank were revised to increase the voice of developing countries, notably China. The countries with most voting power are now the United States (15.85%), Japan (6.84%), China (4.42%), Germany (4.00%), the United Kingdom (3.75%), France (3.75%), India (2.91%),[tpl]cite news|title=Developing nations get more say in World Bank affairs|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Developing-nations-get-more-say-in-World-Bank-affairs/articleshow/5858176.cms|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Times of India|date=26 April 2010[/tpl] Russia (2.77%), Saudi Arabia (2.77%) and Italy (2.64%). Under the changes, known as 'Voice Reform – Phase 2', countries other than China that saw significant gains included South Korea, Turkey, Mexico, Singapore, Greece, Brazil, India, and Spain. Most developed countries' voting power was reduced, along with a few poor countries such as Nigeria. The voting powers of the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia were unchanged.[tpl]Cite report | title = IBRD 2010 Voting Power Realignment | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2010 | author = International Bank for Reconstruction and Development | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/IBRD2010VotingPowerRealignmentFINAL.pdf | accessdate = 2011-08-14[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | title = China given more influence in World Bank | author = Veloo, Betsy May | date = 2010-04-26 | publisher = RTHK | url = http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?main&20100426&56&663699 | accessdate = 2010-04-26[/tpl]
The changes were brought about with the goal of making voting more universal in regards to standards, rule-based with objective indicators, and transparent among other things. Now, developing countries have an increased voice in the "Pool Model," backed especially by Europe. Additionally, voting power is based on economic size in addition to International Development Association contributions.[tpl]Cite news | title = World Bank: More responsibility for developing countries | author = Stumm, Mario | date = March 2011 | publisher = D+C | url = http://www.dandc.eu/articles/193054/index.en.shtml | accessdate = 2011-08-12[/tpl]

==Poverty reduction strategies==

For the poorest developing countries in the world, the bank's assistance plans are based on poverty reduction strategies; by combining a cross-section of local groups with an extensive analysis of the country's financial and economic situation the World Bank develops a strategy pertaining uniquely to the country in question. The government then identifies the country's priorities and targets for the reduction of poverty, and the World Bank aligns its aid efforts correspondingly.
Forty-five countries pledged US$25.1 billion in "aid for the world's poorest countries", aid that goes to the World Bank International Development Association (IDA) which distributes the loans to eighty poorer countries. While wealthier nations sometimes fund their own aid projects, including those for diseases, and although IDA is the recipient of criticism, Robert B. Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, said when the loans were announced on 15 December 2007, that IDA money "is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on".[tpl]Cite news | title = Britain Overtakes U.S. as Top World Bank Donor | author = Landler, Mark | date = 2007-12-15 | publisher = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/world/15worldbank.html | accessdate = 2011-08-14[/tpl]
World Bank organizes Development Marketplace Awards which is a competitive grant program that surfaces and funds innovative, development projects with high potential for development impact that are scalable and/or replicable. The grant beneficiaries are social enterprises with projects that aim to deliver a range of social and public services to the most underserved low-income groups.

==Global Partnerships and Initiatives==

The World Bank has been assigned temporary management responsibility of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), focused on making renewable energy cost-competitive with coal-fired power as quickly as possible, but this may not continue after UN's Copenhagen climate change conference in December, 2009, because of the Bank's continued investment in coal-fired power plants.[tpl]Cite news | title = Climate Change in Nashville: A Gathering Storm for the World Bank? | author = Wheeler, David | date = 2008-05-20 | publisher = Center for Global Development | url = http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2008/05/climate-change-in-nashville-a.php | accessdate = 2008-11-09[/tpl]
Together with the WHO, the World Bank administers the International Health Partnership (IHP+). IHP+ is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. Partners work together to put international principles for aid effectiveness and development cooperation into practice in the health sector. IHP+ mobilizes national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national health strategy in a well-coordinated way.

===Climate Change===

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in 2012 that: 
A World Bank report into Climate change in 2012 noted that (p. xiii): "Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4°C by 2100." This is despite the fact that the "global community has committed itself to holding warming below 2°C to prevent 'dangerous' climate change"". Furthermore: "A series of recent extreme events worldwide highlight the vulnerability of all countries. ... No nation will be immune to the impacts of climate change." Why a 4 degree centrigrade warmer world must be avoided November 2012 World Bank
The World Bank doubled its aid for climate change adaptation from $2.3bn (£1.47bn) in 2011 to $4.6bn in 2012. The planet is now 0.8°C warmer than in pre-industrial times. It says that 2°C warming will be reached in 20 to 30 years.What Climate Change Means for Africa, Asia and the Coastal Poor WorldBank 19.6.2012World's poorest will feel brunt of climate change, warns World Bank The Guardian 19.6.2012

==Training wings==

===World Bank Institute===

The World Bank Institute (WBI) creates learning opportunities for countries, World Bank staff and clients, and people committed to poverty reduction and sustainable development. WBI's work program includes training, policy consultations, and the creation and support of knowledge networks related to international economic and social development.
The World Bank Institute (WBI) can be defined as a "global connector of knowledge, learning and innovation for poverty reduction". It aims to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. 
WBI has four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. 
World Bank Institute(WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on March 11, 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. 
Currently Sanjay Pradhan is the Vice President of the World Bank Institute.[tpl]cite web | title = About WBI | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Institute | url = http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | accessdate = 2012-05-31[/tpl]

===Global Development Learning Network===

The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.
GDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.

====GDLN Asia Pacific====

The GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.
GDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become "the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.
The committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1).  The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.
The Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a "Foundation". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.
GDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand – Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.

===The JUSTPAL Network===

A Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.
The JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.
To facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.

==Criticisms==

The World Bank has long been criticized by non-governmental organizations, such as the indigenous rights group Survival International, and academics, including its former Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz, Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises.[tpl]Cite book | title = The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade | author = Stiglitz, Joseph E. | year = 2003 | publisher = W.

One of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank has been the way in which it is governed. While the World Bank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank, and so their interests dominate the bank.[tpl]Cite book | title = The Globalizers: The IMF, the World Bank, and Their Borrowers | author = Woods, Ngaire | year = 2007 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithica, NY | isbn = 978-0-80-147420-0[/tpl][tpl]rp|190[/tpl] Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of global apartheid.[tpl]Cite book | title = Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | author = Alexander, Titus | year = 1996 | publisher = Polity | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-74-561352-9[/tpl][tpl]rp|133–141[/tpl]
In the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF forged the Washington Consensus, policies which included deregulation and liberalization of markets, privatization and the downscaling of government. Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out. Joseph Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus placed too much emphasis on the growth of GDP, and not enough on the permanence of growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards.[tpl]rp|17[/tpl]
The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations report criticized the World Bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too much "on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time" and called on the institution to "strengthen anti-corruption efforts".[tpl]Cite report | title = The International Financial Institutions: A Call For Change | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | date = 2010 | author = Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, 111th Congress | url = http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/55285.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-20[/tpl]

Another source of criticism has been the tradition of having an American head the bank, implemented because the United States provides the majority of World Bank funding. "When economists from the World Bank visit poor countries to dispense cash and advice," observed The Economist in 2012, "they routinely tell governments to reject cronyism and fill each important job with the best candidate available. It is good advice. The World Bank should take it."[tpl]Cite news | title = Hats off to Ngozi | date = 2012-03-31 | publisher = The Economist | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21551490 | accessdate = 2012-04-02[/tpl] Jim Yong Kim is the most recently appointed president of the World Bank.[tpl]Cite news | title = World Bank names US-nominated Jim Yong Kim as president | author = Rushe, Dominic | author2 = Stewart, Heather | author3 = Mark, Monica | date = 2012-04-16 | publisher = The Guardian | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/16/world-bank-president-jim-yong-kim | accessdate = 2012-04-17[/tpl]

===Structural adjustment===

The effect of structural adjustment policies on poor countries has been one of the most significant criticisms of the World Bank.[tpl]cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|authorlink=David Graeber|title=Direct Action: An Ethnography|publisher=AK Press|pages=442–443|ISBN=9781904859796[/tpl] The 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | title = The World Bank's Focus on Poverty | author = deVries, Barend A. | encyclopedia = The World Bank: Lending on a Global Scale | editor = Griesgraber, Jo Marie | editor2 = Gunter, Bernhard G. | year = 1996 | publisher = Pluto Press | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-0-74-531049-7[/tpl][tpl]rp|68[/tpl] The World Bank responded with structural adjustment loans which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.[tpl]rp|69[/tpl]
By the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.[tpl]rp|70[/tpl] In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-41-541282-7[/tpl][tpl]rp|147[/tpl] The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.[tpl]rp|152[/tpl] By reinforcing the relationship between lending and client states, many believe that the World Bank has usurped indebted countries' power to determine their own economic policy.[tpl]Cite book | title = The Globalisation of Poverty: Impacts of IMF and World Bank Reforms | author = Chossudovsky, Michel | year = 1997 | publisher = Zed Books | location = London, UK | isbn = 978-1-85-649401-4[/tpl]

===Fairness of assistance conditions===

Some critics,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/sites/default/files/treacherousconditions07052003.pdf | title=Treacherous conditions: How IMF and World Bank policies tied to debt relief are undermining developmen | publisher=World Development Movement | year=2003 | accessdate=2013-05-12 | author=Hardstaff, Peter[/tpl] most prominently the author Naomi Klein, are of the opinion that the World Bank Group's loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests, financial power and political doctrines (notably the Washington Consensus) of the Bank and, by extension, the countries that are most influential within it. Amongst other allegations, Klein says the Group's credibility was damaged "when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan; when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system; when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch; when it demanded labour "flexibility" in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami; when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post-invasion Iraq."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/apr/27/comment.business | title=The World Bank has the perfect standard bearer | newspaper=The Guardian | date=2007-04-27 | accessdate=2013-05-12 | author=Klein, Naomi[/tpl]

===Sovereign immunity===

The World Bank requires sovereign immunity from countries it deals with.[tpl]Cite journal | title = The World Bank and the Question of Immunity | journal = IFI Watch - Bangladesh | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | year = 2004 | pages = 1–10 | author = IFI Watch | url = http://www.unnayan.org/Other/IFI_Watch_Bangladesh_Vol_1%20No_1.pdf | accessdate = 2004-09-04[/tpl][tpl]Cite report | title = Sovereign Immunity | publisher = World Bank Group | date = 2007 | author = World Bank | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINFANDLAW/Resources/sovereignimmunity.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-20[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | title = Extraterritorial Jurisdiction and Sovereign Immunity on Trial: Noriega, Pinochet, and Milosevic - Trends in Political Accountability and Transnational Criminal Law | journal = Boston College International and Comparative Law Review | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 125–158 | author = Hasson, Adam Isaac | url = http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/iclr/vol25/iss1/6/ | accessdate = 2012-04-25[/tpl] Sovereign immunity waives a holder from all legal liability for their actions. It is proposed that this immunity from responsibility is a "shield which World Bank wants to resort to, for escaping accountability and security by the people." As the United States has veto power, it can prevent the World Bank from taking action against its interests.
