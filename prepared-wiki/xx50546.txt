CATEGORIES: Turnicidae, Turniciformes, Bird families, Turnix

Buttonquail or hemipodes are members of a small family of birds, Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the quails of Phasianidae. They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia. There are 16 species in two genera, with most species being found in the genus Turnix and only one being found in the genus Ortyxelos.
Buttonquails are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship. Unusually, the buttonquails are polyandrous, with the females circulating among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but only the male incubates the eggs and tends the young. The eggs hatch after an incubation period of 12 or 13 days, and the young are able to fly within two weeks of hatching.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Archibald, George W.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 101|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

Buttonquail were traditionally placed in Gruiformes or Galliformes (the crane and pheasant orders).  The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy elevated them to ordinal status as the Turniciformes and basal to other Neoaves either because their accelerated rate of molecular evolution exceeded the limits of sensitivity of DNA-DNA hybridization or because the authors did not perform the appropriate pairwise comparisons or both.  Morphological, DNA-DNA hybridization and sequence data indicate that turnicids correctly belong to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes).[tpl]cite journal |author=Paton TA, Baker AJ, Groth JG, Barrowclough GF|year=2003|title=RAG-1 sequences resolve phylogenetic relationships within charadriiform birds |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=29 |pages=268–78 |doi=10.1016/S1055-7903(03)00098-8 |pmid=13678682 |issue=2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Fain, Matthew G. & Houde, Peter|year=2004|title=Parallel radiations in the primary clades of birds |journal=Evolution |volume=58 |pages=2558–73 |doi=10.1554/04-235|url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/houde/Parallel_radiations.pdf PDF fulltext |pmid=15612298 |issue=11[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Paton TA, Baker AJ|year=2006|title=Sequences from 14 mitochondrial genes provide a well-supported phylogeny of the Charadriiform birds congruent with the nuclear RAG-1 tree|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=39 |pages=657–67 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.01.011 |pmid=16531074 |issue=3[/tpl]

==Description==

The buttonquails are a group of small terrestrial birds. The smallest species is the Quail-plover, the only species in the genus Ortyxelos, which is [tpl]convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and weighs only [tpl]convert|20|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl]. The buttonquails in the genus Turnix range from [tpl]convert|12|to(-)|23|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and weigh between [tpl]convert|30|to(-)|130|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl]. They superficially resemble the true quails of the genus Coturnix, but differ from them in lacking a hind toe and a crop. The females of this family also possess a unique vocal organ created by an enlarged trachea and inflatable bulb in the oesophagus, which they use to produce a booming call.
