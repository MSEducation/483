On the bottom panel of the Nokia 6030 is a 4-pin connector similar to a USB port, a bit smaller than normal 4-pin mini-USB connectors, but it is actually a FBus port, named the EZ Flash port, and the data cable for this port is not supplied for end-users. Only authorized Nokia support have the ability to make use of the port.[tpl]Dubious|date=November 2008[/tpl]  There is no official data cable connection for 6030 end-user. Those so-called "CA-45" cables for sale are counterfeits or an attempt to copy a Nokia special EZ flash cable, CA-45DS.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] The official Nokia CA-45DS actually has a connector that fits into the headphone jack and the FBus port on one end, and the other end is a connection much like an Ethernet cable that hooks into the flash box.
