Another highlight of his career with the Knights was the 1997 Australian Rugby League grand final victory over the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Johns was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at five-eighth and scored a try in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory.
Salary cap problems led to Johns leaving the Knights and Australia at the end of 2000 to play a season with the UK based Super League club the Wigan Warriors. He considered playing for Wales at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup due to his Welsh heritage.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/3390523.stm|title=Wales launch Johns bid|publisher=BBC|date=14 January 2004|accessdate=4 March 2008[/tpl] Johns played for the Wigan Warriors at five-eighth in their 2001 Super League Grand Final loss against the Bradford Bulls.

===2002 NZ tour sexual assault investigation===

While on a pre-season tour of New Zealand in February 2002, Johns and 11 other unnamed members of the Cronulla Sharks were involved in a group sex session with a 19-year-old in a Christchurch hotel room.[tpl]cite news | last = Barrett | first = Rebecca | date = 8 May 2009 | title = Matthew Johns in group sex scandal | work = ABC News | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/07/2563957.htm | accessdate = 14 May 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Sarah|title=Code of Silence|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2009/s2567972.htm|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite episode | title = Code of Silence | episodelink =  | series = Four Corners | serieslink = Four Corners (TV program)  | airdate = 11 May 2009  | season =  | number = [/tpl] Following an allegation of sexual assault from the woman five days later, police investigated the incident both in New Zealand and Australia but did not lay any charges.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Herald|title=Woman tells of Matthew Johns incident |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/woman-tells-of-matthew-johns-incident/1508386.aspx?storypage=0 |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=9 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|title=Christchurch police to question Sharks |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=1241053 |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=19 March 2002[/tpl]
Seven years later the ABC TV Four Corners program "Code of Silence", broadcast on 11 May 2009, reported on the incident. Although Four Corners spoke to Johns about the incident, he declined to give an on-camera interview for the program.[tpl]cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Sarah|title=Code of Silence - statement|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2009/s2575275.htm|date=19 May 2009|accessdate=21 May 2009[/tpl] The alleged victim (known by the pseudonym "Clare") stated that she had returned to room 21 of the Racecourse Hotel with Johns and another player, and that when one of them began to kiss her without her consent, she felt socially awkward objecting to the unwanted advance; which eventually led to sex.Four Corners - 11/05/2009: Program Transcript  Ten or more rugby league players and staff arrived over the course of two hours, and presumed consent to participate.
Johns admitted to taking part but stated that the act was consensual. In May 2009, Johns agreed to be interviewed by the Nine Network to give his viewpoint of the incident, saying it had been painful for his family and regretted what happened.[tpl]cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|title=Matthew Johns expresses regret over 'group sex' incident |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25446486-5001021,00.html |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=8 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  He stated that he had been apprehensive about the consequences of the incident for seven years.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/ive-waited-7-years-for-call-johns/story-e6frg6no-1225711921979 | first=Amanda | last=Meade | title=I've waited seven years for call: Matthew Johns | date=14 May 2009 | work=The Australian[/tpl] Brett Firman stated that "she was up for it a hundred per cent." It is implied that Firman and Johns took her to the hotel as they stated that they were the first to have sex with her.
Following the incident, the young woman was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and attempted suicide a number of times.  She has been receiving financial support and counselling from the New Zealand Government.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Radio New Zealand News|title=Matthew Johns responds to sex allegation |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/sport/2009/05/08/1245af98a6a4 |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=8 May 2009[/tpl] Nevertheless, a former colleague stated that, shortly after the incident, the woman boasted about having sex with several players.[tpl]cite web|publisher=League HQ|title=Friend says 'Clare' bragged about Sharks sex romp |url=http://www.leaguehq.com.au/articles/2009/05/14/1241894109113.html |accessdate=27 May 2009|date=14 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In response, a statement released by Four Corners related how the New Zealand police "... noted that some comments she made suggesting she was not distressed were a mechanism for coping with what had happened."[tpl]Cite news|last=Honeysett|first=Stuart|work=The Australian |title=Matthew Johns to consider legal avenues |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25509188-2722,00.html |accessdate=14 July 2009|date=20 May 2009 [/tpl]  Detective Superintendent Neville Jenkins described Clare as naive, young for her age and "...just a growing up teenager."
Subsequent to the Four Corners program, Johns was stood down by Channel Nine from his role as rugby league commentator and co-host of The Footy Show. The Melbourne Storm also took the step of releasing Johns indefinitely as an assistant coach.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Herald Sun (Sydney)|title=Matthew Johns stood down by Melbourne Storm and Channel Nine |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25469726-661,00.html |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=12 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Vaughan|first=Robert|publisher=ninemsn.com|title=Melbourne Storm and Johns part ways |url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=813420 |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=13 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=Fox Sports News (Australia)|title=Matthew Johns stood down indefinitely by Channel Nine, Melbourne Storm |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25472799-23214,00.html |accessdate=21 May 2009|date=13 May 2009[/tpl]

==Entertainment career==

===Film===

Matthew Johns' first foray into entertainment began in 1999 when he adopted the persona of Reg Reagan in a low-budget film, In Search of the Holy Grail, which appeared at the Newcastle Film Festival.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/28/1096137230798.html|title=Sentimental bloke|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=29 September 2004|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]  The film also starred fellow Knights players Andrew Johns, Matthew Gidley and Robbie O'Davis.  The Nine Network showed excerpts of the film on The Footy Show.
The Reg Reagan character was developed further in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2000 where Johns described the character as a late 1970s Australian (or ocker) who smoked only Winfield Reds and drank KB beer.  Fans of Johns' new side Cronulla started wearing copies of the t-shirt worn by Reagan, with the slogan "Bring Back the Biff", to games.

===Television===

In 2002, Johns became a regular on The Footy Show with Reagan and a new character, Trent, a gay flight attendant from San Francisco.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] After his retirement as a player, Johns signed deals with the Nine Network and Sony Music Entertainment.  He appeared on The Footy Show and as a commentator on Nine's broadcasts of rugby league matches.  He has recorded a DVD titled "All of Me", released in June 2004, featuring skits by Reg Reagan and Trent the flight attendant.  Since then he has released a follow up entitled "Blood, Sweat and Beers" and also features on The Footy Show's 'Best Of' DVD collection from 1994-2002. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
In 2004, as Reg Reagan, Johns recorded a song called "Am I Ever Gonna See the Biff Again?" sung to the tune of The Angels' 1977 hit "Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again?".  The song is a humorous lamentation of the decline of onfield violence in professional rugby league.
Johns was indefinitely stood down from his position on the Nine Network in May 2009 after the airing of the Four Corners program.  He was subsequently replaced by Phil Gould.[tpl]cite news | last = McWhirter | first = Erin  | date = 14 May 2009 | title = Channel Nine league expert Phil Gould replaces Matthew Johns on Footy Show | work = The Daily Telegraph | url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25480755-5001021,00.html | accessdate = 14 May 2009 [/tpl] He was asked by Channel 9 to make a comeback to commentary later in the season but Johns declined.Johns rejects a return to Nine | thetelegraph.com.au
