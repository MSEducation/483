Bakery Mix is an add water only pre-mixed baking product consisting of flour,  dry milk,  shortening,  salt, and   baking powder (a leavening agent).  Originally intended for making biscuits very quickly, bakery mix can be used to make a wide variety of baked goods from pizza dough to dumplings to pretzels. The typical flavor profile of bakery mix differs from that of pancake mix. Bakery mixes do not require refrigeration.Food Product Design[tpl]deadlink|date=November 2013[/tpl]
