==History==

Brønnøysund was established as a municipality on 1 January 1923 when it was separated from the municipality of Brønnøy to become a town (ladested) and municipality of its own.  On 1 January 1964, Brønnøysund was merged with the neighbouring municipalities of Brønnøy, Sømna, Velfjord, and part of Bindal to form a new, larger municipality of Brønnøy.  At that time, it lost its town status until 2000 when they were once again granted.[tpl]cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
During the Viking era, Torgar, by the foot of the legendary mountain Torghatten, was a nationally powerful chieftain seat and an important commercial center along the coast. The original inhabitants were wiped out in an outright massacre by Duke Skule and his men in the Norwegian civil wars that raged around 1240, in the high medieval era of Norway. 
The region was re-populated by immigrants from Southern Norway, Trøndelag, and Sweden, which could explain the unique dialect with a Swedish-like intonation.
