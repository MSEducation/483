[[Little Immaculate White Fox]]

CATEGORIES: 2010 albums

Little Immaculate White Fox is the debut album of American rock singer Pearl Aday, released in January 2010 on Megaforce Records. The album deviates from the style of Pearl's father Meat Loaf's operatic rock, and leans more towards classic rock sound with a strong resemblance to the music of Janis Joplin. The opening track, "Rock Child", is an autobiographical piece where Pearl sings of how she used to nap in a guitar case as a child while her father was recording in the studio.
