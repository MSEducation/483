Blue, Dressed In Black is the third CD (second full-length album) from the Eric Stuart Band, in which Eric Stuart is the songwriter and lead singer. This album is a compilation of Stuart’s four-song demo EP (1999) produced by Peter Frampton in Nashville sessions (Lost Innocence, One Good Reason, Hole in the Head, God’s Roof), two more songs produced by Peter Frampton in Nashville (Home and Corner Booth Chronicles), and six songs (Staring You In The Face, The Best Ones Get Away, Blue Dressed In Black, Heaven In A Cadillac, Can’t Get Enough Of It, and Raise a Little Hell) recorded in NYC and produced by John Regan (Frampton's bass player), and Harvey Jay Goldberg (a producer for Dave Matthews Band and Sting).  Stuart credits Peter Frampton as his mentor, and Frampton even did background vocals, lead guitar, and/or other roles in four of the songs.  For example, Frampton has an extensive guitar solo at the end of “God’s Roof” and also plays the mountain dulcimer in “Home.”  Stuart’s song "Corner Booth Chronicles" won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in 1998.  In 1999, ”One Good Reason” was released on AudioDiner as a single and received 2,500 downloads in two days.
