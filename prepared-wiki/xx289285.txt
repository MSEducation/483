[[Boone's Lick Trail]]

The Boone's Lick Trail, or Boonslick Road was a 19th-century transportation route from eastern to western Missouri in the United States. Parallel to the Missouri River and beginning in St. Charles, it played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States. The trail's eventual terminus at Franklin was the start of the better known Santa Fe Trail. First traced by the son's of Daniel Boone, the path originally ended at a salt lick in Howard County used by the pair to manufacture salt. Today the lick is maintained as Boone's Lick State Historic Site.  A large area in central Missouri became known as the Boonslick, or "Boonslick country", and became the core of a larger area eventually known as Little Dixie. Parts of the trail eventually became roads and its route is the forerunner to today's U.S. Highway 40 and Interstate 70. Towns founded along the trail include Franklin, Columbia, Fulton, Williamsburg, and Warrenton among others.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.booneslickroad.org/Boones_Lick_Road_Association/Road_History.html |title= The Early History of the Boone’s Lick Road |publisher= Boone’s Lick Road Association  |accessdate= August 17, 2013[/tpl]

==Route==

The trail began at the Missouri River port of St. Charles, a colonial town, and struck a westward path through present day St. Charles, Warren, Montgomery, Callaway, Boone and Howard counties. Different shortcuts appeared on the trail as towns and county seats were founded especially in Boone and Callaway counties. Major streams crossed include Cedar, Roche Perche, and Moniteau creeks.
The route was followed by Joseph Smith and his followers on their way to establish the settlement of Far West, Missouri.[tpl]cite book |chapter= First White Settlement in Boone |title= History of Boone County, Missouri |location= St. Louis |publisher= Western Historical Company |year=1882 |pages= 129–34 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Lns_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=Boone%27s+lick+in+Columbia,+mo&source=bl&ots=uinzxLCrrX&sig=uzu_cmwdCo6QeDeGf-XKoiSDy08&hl=en&ei=XmNITMrGCMaFnQf-6K20DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBjha#v=onepage&q&f=false |oclc= 2881554 [/tpl]
