==Early life==

Foley was born in Cairns, Queensland and attended Newington College (1957â€“1959).Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp66 In the late 1960s he started designing rock concerts and psychedelic light shows. His experimental light shows through to the 1970s were precursors to present multi-media installation.

==Yellow House==

He was one of a group of artists who worked and exhibited at the Yellow House Artist Collective in Potts Point. The Yellow House was founded by artist Martin Sharp and between 1970 and 1973 was a piece of living art and a mecca to pop art. The canvas was the house itself and almost every wall, floor and ceiling became part of the gallery. Many well-known artists, including George Gittoes, Brett Whiteley, Peter Kingston, Albie Thoms and Greg Weight, helped to create the multi-media performance art space that may have been Australia's first 24-hour-a-day happening.Transcript of TV interview by George Negus of some of the Yellow House artists on 15 September 2003
