Zbigniew "Zibì" Kazimierz Boniek ([tpl]IPA-pol|ˈzbiɡɲɛv ˈbɔɲɛk[/tpl]; born 3 March 1956 in Bydgoszcz) is a former Polish footballer and manager.

==Club career==

Boniek first played at Zawisza Bydgoszcz and later at Widzew Łódź. He transferred to Italian football giants Juventus in 1982. With Juventus he won the Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup in 1984 (scoring in the final of the former) and the European Cup in 1985. After finishing his professional career at Roma in 1988, he had a successful business career.
As a player, Boniek was known for his blistering pace and acceleration. He was one of the best dribblers of his time and also displayed superb technique. The Juventus president Gianni Agnelli nicknamed him Bello di notte ("Beauty at night", which is a play on the title of the Buñuel movie Belle de Jour) because of his performances in European club tournament matches, which were played in the evening. Boniek was named by Pelé as one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers and by FIFA as one of the 100 best-ever players. On 12 October 2009, he received a Golden Foot career award.[tpl]Cite news| url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=682076&sec=europe&cc=5901 | title = Zbigniew Boniek to receive Golden Foot career award | date = 2 October 2009 | work = ESPN | accessdate =14 October 2009[/tpl]
