The 1935 Masters Tournament was the second Masters Tournament, then still known as the "Augusta National Invitation Tournament," held April 4â€“8 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.
In a change from the first year, the nines were switched to their present order, with the finishing hole at "Holly." In the fourth round, Gene Sarazen holed a double eagle (235 yards, 4 wood) to tie Craig Wood and force a 36-hole playoff.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TBdWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WuMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6661%2C2151071 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |title=Sarazen's long spoon holes out, ties Craig Wood at Augusta |last=Rice |first=Grantland |authorlink=Grantland Rice |date=April 8, 1935 |page=9[/tpl] This second shot at "Firethorn," the par-5 15th hole (then [tpl]convert|485|yd[/tpl]), is referred to in golf as the "shot heard 'round the world." Sarazen won the Monday playoff by five strokes, even-par 144 to 149 (+5), and parred the 15th hole in both rounds. Tournament co-founder and host Bobby Jones finished at 297, fifteen strokes back in a tie for 25th place. The purse was $5,000 and the winner's share was $1,500.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NIxRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ImkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2302%2C4969583 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Sarazen ties Wood in Augusta golf |date=April 8, 1935 |page=15[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NYxRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ImkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2830%2C4691064 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Sarazen beats Wood in golf playoff |date=April 9, 1935 |page=10[/tpl]
