==History==

During the 60s WNOR-FM was an easy listening station, and at one point employed an all-female air staff, a revolutionary move at the time. In 1969 the station began airing a progressive rock format from 9pm-6am. They abandoned the "split-format" approach in 1974 and began playing rock full-time. The station’s Arbitron ratings quickly took off, culminating in the station’s rise to #1 – the first time an FM station in the Norfolk market had achieved #1 status.

==Henry "The Bull" Del Toro==

The station was, for many years, home to the late shock jock Henry "The Bull" Del Toro, who became a legend in Norfolk radio in the 80s.  Del Toro, was co-host of the "Reeger and The Bull Show", then "Jimmy and The Bull", and later "Tommy and The Bull" morning show.  Del Toro, along with Tommy Griffiths (who left WNOR in 2009), created havoc on April Fools' Day in 1992 by warning listeners that a large build-up of methane gas was about to cause a fiery explosion at Mount Trashmore, a landfill-turned-park in Virginia Beach.  Residents were warned to evacuate the area, causing the local 911 to be flooded with calls.http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=102387&ran=110635http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/worstaprilfools.html
Del Toro was also known for his charity work with the many organizations in the Hampton Roads area.
He would later go on to work at WROX-FM, WKLR and finally WOBR before he died in 2002.  He was 44 years old.http://www.knotheadradio.com/bull/bull.htm

==Programming==

The station's morning programming is dominated by the Rumble in the Morning show, which broadcasts from 5:30AM to 10:00AM. Afterwards, the programming is composed of a 20 song marathon at 10 AM, then Shelley's Lunch Box.  WNOR also carries the nationally syndicated Sixx Sense.
