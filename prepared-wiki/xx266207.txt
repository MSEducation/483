In 1997, Lewith presented a documentary series examining complementary medicine for Channel 4 called Natural Born Healers.[tpl]cite web|title=Filmography: Lewith, George|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/746298?view=credit|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl] The series won a Royal Television Society award for its programme on herbalism.[tpl]cite web|title=Educational Television Awards 1997: Personal Education|url=http://www.rts.org.uk/educational-television-awards-1997|publisher=Royal Television Society|accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl] However, the series also drew criticism from Dr. Peter May and colleagues at the Grove Medical Practice in Southampton, who had cooperated with the programme, in a complaint to HealthWatch.[tpl]cite web|title=Doctors in controversy over "natural born healers"|url=http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/newsletters/nlett28.html#chan4|publisher=HealthWatch|accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl] A book of the same title as the documentary series and co-authored by Lewith accompanied the series.[tpl]cite book|last=George Lewith|first=Elisabeth Wilson|title=Natural Born Healers: How to Find the Best Complementary Health Treatments for You and Your Family|year=1997|publisher=Collins & Brown|location=London|isbn=978-1-85585-446-8[/tpl]

A 2006 BBC documentary series, Alternative Medicine, was criticised by several people, including Lewith, in the Guardian over a controversial sequence in which acupuncture appeared to be used as a replacement for general anaesthesia during open heart surgery.[tpl]cite news|last=Singh|first=Simon|title=A groundbreaking experiment ... or a sensationalised TV stunt?|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/25/science.broadcasting|accessdate=4 March 2012|newspaper=The The Guardian[tpl]![/tpl]Guardian|date=25 March 2006[/tpl] Lewith had participated in the series as an advisor, but criticised the programme for inappropriate sensationalism and poor interpretation of science.
In criticisms published in the British Medical Journal, both Jane Cassidy and David Colquhoun criticise Lewith, claiming that he prescribes homoeopathy despite having written papers that conclude it doesn’t work.[tpl]cite journal | journal=BMJ | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d3712 | pmid=21677014 | date=15 June 2011 | title=The College of Medicine | author=Jane Cassidy[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=BMJ | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4368 | date=12 July 2011 | title=The College of Medicine is Prince’s Foundation reincarnated  | author=David Colquhoun| pmid=21750061|url=http://www.dcscience.net/dc-bmj-july-2011.pdf[/tpl] Lewith has conducted research suggesting that the homeopathic remedy has no effect,[tpl]cite journal|last=Lewith|first=GT|coauthors=Watkins AD, Hyland ME, et al|title=Use of ultramolecular potencies of allergen to treat asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite: double blind randomised controlled clinical trial|journal=BMJ|date=March 2002|volume=324|issue=7336|pages=520–520|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7336.520|pmid=11872551|url=http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/333182/field_highwire_article_pdf/0.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Brien|first=Sarah|coauthors=Lewith, George, Bryant, Trevor|title=Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical effects.
