==About==

George F. Sheperd was a stonemason and artist in Omaha at the time of the 1889 Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Kountze Place. The Shepard House reflects that influence. With stone cutter's precision, Shepard personalized much of the residence with marble and stone etchings. One of Sheperd's Classical-styled works is owned by the Nebraska Art Collection housed in Kearney, Nebraska.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofomaha.org/planning/landmarks/alphabetical-listing/shepard-house|title=Shepard House|publisher=City of Omaha â€” Landmarks Heritage Preservation Commission|accessdate=2013-03-03[/tpl]
