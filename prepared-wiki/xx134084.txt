Kampong Speu ([tpl]lang-km|កំពង់ស្ពឺ[/tpl], literally: "Port of the Carambola.") is the capital of Kampong Speu Province in central Cambodia.
Speu is the Khmer word for starfruit, but Kampong Speu is actually famous for its palm sugar and wine.
Most of the townspeople speak only Khmer, but some are conversant in Mandarin (you can usually find them employed by the small coffeeshops/restaurants or shops).
The centre of the town hosts a market, surrounded by bicycle shops, a dispensary and small restaurants. There is a guesthouse (Pheng Ang Guesthouse) just minutes away for travellers.
Kampong Speu has numerous privately run schools and orphanages run by social and missionary organizations from Singapore, the Philippines and other countries.
