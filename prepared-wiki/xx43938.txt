==Top grossing films (U.S.)Box Office Digest, March 1942==

Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater.  For example, Sergeant York performed at 220% while Citizen Kane did 130% (coming in a surprisingly strong 30th for the year).  This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
