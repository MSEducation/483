[[List of submissions to the 76th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]

CATEGORIES: Submissions for Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award (by year)

The following 56 films, all from different countries, were submitted for the 76th Academy Awards in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film which took place in 2004. The bolded titles were the five nominated films.
Films were submitted by Mongolia, Palestine and Sri Lanka for the first time. Palestine had tried to submit a film the year before, but was prevented from doing so by the Academy which said that Palestine was not a country and had no recognized Film Board. The Academy subsequently changed its mind saying that although Palestine was not a recognized country, they would make "an exception" in the interests of inclusiveness.

The Film Federation of India announced that their selection committee had been unable to find a suitable film to send to the Oscars and so declined to send an entry. This left India out of the race for the first time in over a decade.  http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/sep/26oscar.htm  Also notable by their first absence in over ten years was Switzerland (though they were disqualified in 1994).
