Hinton Priory was one of the ten medieval Carthusian houses (charterhouses) in England. It was first established at Hatherop in 1222 by William Longspee, Earl of Salisbury. The monks disliked the location, and on Longspee's death in 1226 they petitioned his countess for a new site to achieve greater solitude. She gave them her manors of Hinton and Norton St Philip in Somerset and the new house was consecrated at Hinton Charterhouse in May 1232. It was called Locus Dei meaning 'God's Place'.
The house was suppressed as part of the dissolution of the monasteries on 31 March 1539, and then bought by Matthew Colthurst.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Famous houses of the West Country|year=1977|publisher=Kingsmead Press|location=Bath|isbn=978-0-901571-87-8|pages=40â€“43[/tpl]
The chapter house, prior's cell and refectory survive as agricultural buildings belonging to the sixteenth century mansion, Hinton Abbey. Surviving earthworks from the great cloister are still visible in an orchard and paddocks.
