Marc-Louis-Emmanuel Solon (1835 – June 23, 1913), pseudonym Miles,  was a French porcelain artist for Sèvres Pottery who moved to Stoke-on-Trent in 1870 to become a leading artist at Mintons Ltd.  He remained resident in England until his death. His work commanded high prices in the late Victorian period as a leading exponent of the technique of ceramic decoration called pâte-sur-pâte. One of his vases, believed to be his largest, is on display at Osborne House.
Solon was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne. Despite some family resistance to his becoming an artist, he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and with Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran.[ref]SOLON, Louis Marc Emmanuel
[/ref] Some of Solon's work came to the attention of the art director of the Sèvres Pottery.  Solon was employed there from 1862-1870 as a ceramic artist and designer, and he learnt and greatly improved the technique of pâte-sur-pâte. His subjects included portraits, female figures, putti, small animals, and birds, in styles derived from Classical Greece, the Renaissance, 17th- and 18th-century paintings, and Victorian postcards. 
Solon moved to England in 1870 at the time of the Franco-Prussian War.  He found employment at Mintons Ltd, and settled at Nº1, The Villas, Stoke-on-Trent.The Villas  Mintons experienced more demand for pâte-sur-pâte ceramics than Solon could meet working on his own, and from the 1870s he trained a number of English apprentices including Frederick Alfred Rhead.

Their eldest son, Léon-Victor Solon (1872–1957), joined Minton in the 1890s and became art director (1900–09).

He also collected books about ceramics; after his death, his library was acquired by the local technical college with funds provided by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.
