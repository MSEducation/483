==History==

North American Charters (NAC) was established in 2000 to provide cheaper and more frequent airline services to First Nations communities in Northwestern Ontario. NAC's airfares were 40-50% lower than its competitors' existing fares[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] and it also offered daily services with the possibility of same-day returns for business travellers. It commenced services with two Piper PA31-350 Chieftains and quickly added a Fairchild SA226-TC Metro II as well. The two Chieftains were soon replaced by the first Pilatus PC-12s and the Metro was also retired at the end of 2001.Canadian historic civil aircraft register search, using "North American Charters" as the search parameter.

NAC grew steadily, evolving from the early two aircraft operation serving four communities to an eleven aircraft operation connecting Sioux Lookout, Ontario; Winnipeg; Thunder Bay; Red Lake, Ontario; Thompson, Manitoba and 21 First Nations communities. In 2006 NAC changed its name to NAC Air, this coincided with the company moving into a new three-storey office and hangar complex at the Thunder Bay International Airport. In 2007 a base was opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, it serviced 2 aircraft which flew out of Winnipeg and 1 which flew out of Thompson, Manitoba. 
On 13 January 2008 NAC Air ceased operations indefinitely due to financial difficulties, they claim, stemmed from a lawsuit with rival Wasaya Airways. The shut down forced 150 employees off the job.
