CATEGORIES: 1994 singles, Die Ärzte songs, Songs written by Farin Urlaub

"Friedenspanzer" (in German: Peace tank) is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It's the thirteenth track and the third single from their 1993 album Die Bestie in Menschengestalt. This song is about a war machine, that spreads peace, love and solutions for problems in the world, and helps people. "Friedenspanzer" and "Schopenhauer" on the maxi single are actually the same versions as on the usual single.
The opening lines "Ich möchte eine Welt, in der Insekten und Würmer endlich wieder schmecken. Ich möchte eine Welt, in der ich aus einer Toilette trinken kann ohne Ausschlag zu bekommen." (I want a world, where insects and worms are tasty again. I want a world, where I can drink out of the toilet without getting a rash.) are samples from the end of the German version of the film "The Naked Gun 2½".
