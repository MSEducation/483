Before joining the University of Guelph, she taught for many years at the University of Victoria where she was Director of the English graduate program and the first Associate Deanâ€”Research.
Her publications include in the second person (Longspoon 1985), On the Edge of Genre: The Contemporary Canadian Long Poem (1991), Making a Difference: Canadian Multicultural Literature (1996), and a new edition of it, Making a Difference: Multicultural Literatures in English Canada (2006).

On the Board of NeWest Press (Edmonton) since 1981, she is the founder and editor of The Writer as Critic series, which includes, among others, Douglas Barbour's Lyric/Anti-lyric: Essays on Contemporary Poetry, Frank Davey's Canadian Literary Power, Daphne Marlatt's Readings from the Labyrinth, Fred Wah's Faking It: Poetics and Hybridity, Phyllis Webb's Nothing But Brush Strokes, and, most recently, Di Brandt's So This Is the World & Here I Am in It. She has also reissued, with corrections, Roy K. Kiyooka's Transcanada Letters and edited his posthumous Pacific Rim Letters, with an afterword and a chronology of his life. In collaboration with Roy Miki, she organized "TransCanada: Literature, Institutions, Citizenship" (Vancouver, June 2005), a conference intended to spearhead a critical look at the institutional structures that inform the making and study of CanLit, as well as collaborative projects to be sponsored by the TransCanada Institute. Trans.Can.Lit: Resituating the Study of Canadian Literature, a collection of essays presented at the conference, and edited by Kamboureli and Roy Miki, will appear in 2007 (Wilfrid Laurier University Press).
