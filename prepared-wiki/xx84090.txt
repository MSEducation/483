CATEGORIES: Hiking trails in Europe

The Grande Randonnée (French), Grote Routepaden or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Dutch), Grande Rota (Portuguese) or Gran Recorrido (Spanish) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. In France alone, the trails cover approximately [tpl]convert|60000|km|mi[/tpl].  The trails are blazed with characteristic marks consisting of a white stripe above a red stripe. These appear regularly along the route, especially at places like forks or crossroads.
In France, the network is maintained by the Fédération Française de la Randonnée Pédestre (French Hiking Federation),[tpl]cite web|title=French Hiking Federation|url=http://www.ffrandonnee.fr/[/tpl] and in Spain by the Spanish Mountain Sports Federation.[tpl]cite web|title=Spanish Mountain Sports Federation|url=http://www.fedme.es/?action=seccion.seccion&subseccion=89[/tpl]
Many GR routes make up part of the longer European walking routes which cross several countries.
