Avian is an open-source, lightweight Java virtual machine (JVM) and class library designed to provide a useful subset of Java's features, suitable for building self-contained applications.
The VM is implemented from scratch and designed to be small and fast, featuring:
The class library is designed to be as loosely-coupled as possible, allowing optimization tools like ProGuard to aggressively isolate the minimum code needed for an application; this can possibly result in smaller downloads and faster application startup times.  Linkage against the OpenJDK classpath is supported for applications that require a more comprehensive standard library.
The virtual machine is designed to be embedded along with application classes into a single executable file, which can be run on systems where the Oracle Java platform isn't installed.
