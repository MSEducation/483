The United States federal budget for fiscal year 2009 began as a spending request submitted by President George W. Bush to the 110th Congress. The final resolution written and submitted by the 110th Congress to be forwarded to the President was approved by the House on June 5, 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 382|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll382.xml|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=June 5, 2008|accessdate=December 14, 2012[/tpl]  The final spending bills for the budget were not signed into law until March 11, 2009 by President Barack Obama, nearly five and a half months after the fiscal year began.

==Deficit==

Decreased tax revenue and high spending resulted in an unusually large budget deficit of about $1.4 trillion, well above the $407 billion projected in the FY 2009 budget.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/budget.pdf |title=Budget of the US Government, FY 2011 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |accessdate=July 21, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110707205322/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/pdf/budget.pdf| archivedate= July 7, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] A 2009 CBO report indicated that $245 billion, about half of the excess spending, was a result of the 2008 TARP bailouts. Spending increases and tax credits resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 accounted for another 200 billion of the budget deficit.
