Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ENTPD2 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chadwick BP, Frischauf AM | title = Cloning and mapping of a human and mouse gene with homology to ecto-ATPase genes | journal = Mamm Genome | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 668â€“72 |date=Oct 1997 | pmid = 9271669 | pmc =  | doi =10.1007/s003359900534  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ENTPD2 ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=954| accessdate = [/tpl]

It has been shown, by scientists from the University of Warwick, that E-NTPDase2 stimulates the growth of the eye: by testing the enzyme on tadpoles, the tadpoles were found to develop extra eyes on their body.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
