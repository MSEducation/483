Earth Surface Processes and Landforms is the journal of the British Society for Geomorphology (BSG), formerly the British Geomorphological Research Group (BGRG) and is an international journal of geomorphology, publishing on all aspects of Earth Surface Science. The journal was founded in 1976 as Earth Surface Processes and obtained its present name in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117935722/tocgroup|title=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms: All Issues|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=2009-03-16[/tpl] The Journal primarily publishes original research papers that will have a sustained impact upon geomorphological science and cognate disciplines. It also publishes Earth Surface Exchanges which include commentaries on issues of particular geomorphological interest, discussions of published papers, shorter journal articles suitable for rapid publication and specially-commissioned reviews on key aspects of geomorphological science. Foci include the physical geography of rivers, valleys, glaciers, mountains, hills, slopes, coasts, deserts, and estuary environments, along with research into Holocene, Pleistocene, or Quaternary science.

==Aims and scope==

Earth Surface Processes and Landforms is an interdisciplinary international journal concerned with:

Virtual Special Issues are collections of papers that have been solicited and managed by Guest Editors of the journal. These were previously published in print form but, since 2009, the Special Issues are on-line only. This allows Earth Surface Processes and Landforms to publish Special Issue manuscripts in a timely fashion, not held back by the slowest paper in review, and then to bring the Special Issue together on-line once all papers are published.
