[[Glot-Up]]

CATEGORIES: Dental equipment

A Glot-Up is type of dental equipment, something in between a mouth guard and an adult-sized pacifier.
It was designed by an Acupuncture and Osteopathy Practice in Barcelona. It is an oral prottusor used mainly to treat TMJ (Temporo Mandibular Joint syndrome) because it relieves the tension from the jaw by replacing the grinding movement (Bruxism or night bruxism) which often causes the dysfunction of the TMJ in the jaw.
It is also a tool for use in mobilising the SBS (Sphenobasilar synchondrosis) as the suction acts as a way to manipulate this bone at the base of the skull.
