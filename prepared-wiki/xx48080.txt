Cook focuses his work on domestic violence and family programs. He examines the results of research, the feelings and problems of victims, and the response of the media on the issue. He has been the director of radio stations in Texas and Oregon as well as director of television news stations in Washington and Nevada. 
Cook left journalism for a year and became a stay at home dad for his one child. He later returned to work where he was the program director and eventually executive director of PACE Institute For Families in Transition. Here, Cook along with many others, created classes called "Children for Divorce". The class required all divorcing and separating parents with children to attend and taught the parents how to not involve the children in the conflicts, diffuse anger, and improve the children's self-esteem. The classes are now mandatory, for parents divorcing or splitting up, in one-third of Oregon counties.
