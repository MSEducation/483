==Football career==

Being raised in the ranks of Akçaabat Sebatspor youth academy, he soon attracted the interests of sports authorities in Trabzon. His excellent playmaking and dribbling skills, and his ability to use both feet and flanks proved him an excellent prospect. He was transferred to Trabzonspor youth academy, and soon signed a professional contract, however, then-coach Şenol Güneş never gave him a chance to play for the senior team. He was soon loaned out to his hometown team of Akçaabat Sebatspor.Kulüp Bilgileri Türkiye Futbol Federasyonu There he became the favourite of the local fans and spent 2,5 years helping the team's success. In the summer of 1998, he signed a contract with Elazığspor who then played in Türk Telekom League A. Without being able to play a single official game for the team, he got another offer from A. Sebatspor. He mutually terminated his contract with Elazığspor, given the promise by A. Sebatspor board of directors that they would compensate Elazığspor's financial loss. They never did. Angered by this move, Elazığspor set an astronomical fee for Erman, although his contract was ended. Until Bosman rule came into effect in Turkey, Erman was not able to sign with any professional football clubs who showed an interest for his skills. Feeling betrayed by both teams, he distanced himself from professional football that showed him its dark side. When he was eventually freed from his contract burden, he was already out of hopes and will for playing professional again.
