Tea for the Tillerman is an album by the singer-songwriter Cat Stevens. This album, Stevens' second during 1970, includes many of Stevens' best-known songs including "Where Do the Children Play?", "Hard Headed Woman", "Wild World", "Sad Lisa", "Into White", and "Father and Son". Four of the tracks ("Where Do the Children Play?", "On the Road to Find Out", "Tea for the Tillerman", and "Miles from Nowhere") were featured in the Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins' black comedy film Harold and Maude, in 1971. The track "But I Might Die Tonight" was featured in a film the year before, in 1970: Deep End, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. Stevens, a former art student, created the artwork featured on the record's cover. "Tea for the Tillerman" was also used over the end credits for the BBC TV show Extras.
With "Wild World" as an advance single, this was the album that brought Stevens world-wide fame.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] The album itself charted into the top 10 in the United States, where he had previously had few listeners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a "B–" and found the music monotonous and lacking the "dry delicacy" Stevens exhibited on Mona Bone Jakon (1970).[tpl]cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=June 10, 1971|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg18.php|title=Consumer Guide (18)|newspaper=The Village Voice|location=New York|accessdate=February 13, 2014[/tpl] Rolling Stone magazine's Ben Gerson said that Stevens' songs effortlessly resonate beyond their artfully simple lyrics and hooks, despite his occasional overuse of dynamics "for dramatic effect."[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Rolling Stone |issue=76 |date=18 February 1971 |first=Ben |last=Gerson |title=Cat Stevens Tea for the Tillerman > Review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/tea-for-the-tillerman-19710218 |accessdate=14 April 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080620010857/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/211804/review/6067354?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview |archivedate=20 June 2008[/tpl]
In a retrospective five-star review, AllMusic's William Ruhlmann praised Stevens' themes of spirituality and transcendence, and felt that he had continued to show his ability as a pop melodicist: "As a result, Tea for the Tillerman became a big seller and, for the second time in four years, its creator became a pop star."[tpl]Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r19021 |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |accessdate=11 March 2005[/tpl] On 18 November 2003, Rolling Stone included this album in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at number 206.[tpl]cite book |chapter=206 | Tea for the Tillerman – Cat Stevens |chapterurl=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/tea-for-the-tillerman-cat-stevens-19691231 |accessdate=11 March 2005 |last=Levy |first=Joe |coauthors=Steven Van Zandt |title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |origyear=2005 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Turnaround |location=London |isbn=1-932958-61-4 |oclc=70672814 |ref=RS500[/tpl] In 2006, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1001Albums.htm In 2007, the album was included in the list of "The Definitive 200 Albums of All Time", released by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.http://eil.com/features/Definitive_200.asp
