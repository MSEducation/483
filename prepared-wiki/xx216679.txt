==Stetson Wind Farm==

In January 2008, First Wind (then UPC Wind) received the approval of the Maine Land Use Regulation Commission (LURC) for its Stetson Wind Farm. The 57 megawatt wind farm began commercial operations in January 2009. It consists of 38 General Electric 1.5-MW wind turbines, and is expected to generate approximately 167 million kilowatt-hours (kW·h) of electricity per year. [tpl]As of |2009[/tpl], Stetson Wind is the largest wind energy project in operation in New England, surpassing the Mars Hill Wind Farm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stetsonwind.com/stetson/|title=Welcome to Stetson Wind  |date=|year= 2009|month=|publisher=First Wind|accessdate= 2009-03-21 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/01/57-mw-stetson-wind-farm-starts-commercial-operations-in-maine-54573|title=57-MW Stetson Wind Farm Starts Commercial Operations in Maine|date= January 23, 2009 |work=|publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com|accessdate=2009-03-21[/tpl]
