About 37 million people are infected with this parasite;[tpl]cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=A|title=The global burden of neglected tropical diseases.|journal=Public health|date=Mar 2012|volume=126|issue=3|pages=233–6|pmid=22325616|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2011.11.015[/tpl] about 300,000 of those had been permanently blinded.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sightsavers.org/What%20We%20Do/Eye%20Conditions/River%20Blindness/World1622.html |title=What is river blindness? |accessdate=2008-01-28 |publisher=Sightsavers International |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215140210/http://www.sightsavers.org/What+We+Do/Eye+Conditions/River+Blindness/World1622.html  |archivedate = 2007-12-15[/tpl] About 99% of onchocerciasis cases occur in Africa.[tpl]cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Status of onchocerciasis in APOC countries|url=http://www.who.int/apoc/onchocerciasis/status/en/index.html |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl] Onchocerciasis is currently endemic in 30 African countries, Yemen, and isolated regions of South America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2006/Onchocerciasis/Epidemiology.html |title=Epidemiology |publisher=Stanford University |year=2006[/tpl] Over 85 million people live in endemic areas, and half of these reside in Nigeria. Another 120 million people are at risk for contracting the disease. Due to the vector’s breeding habitat, the disease is more severe along the major rivers in the northern and central areas of the continent, and severity declines in villages farther from rivers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Travelers who do not stay long in those areas have little risk of developing the disease, as it requires prolonged exposure to the fly bites and parasite introduction.
According to a 2002 WHO report, onchocerciasis has not caused a single death, but its global burden is 987,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs).  The severe pruritus alone accounts for 60% of the DALYs. Infection reduces the host’s immunity and resistance to other diseases, which results in an estimated reduction in life expectancy of 13 years.
According to the Panamerican Health Organization, on July 2013, Colombia became the first country to completely eliminate this disease from within its borders.http://www.eltiempo.com/vida-de-hoy/salud/colombia-primer-pais-libre-de-la-ceguera-de-los-rios_12954445-4

==History==

Using case studies of coffee plantation workers in Guatemala, Robles hypothesized the vector of the disease is a day-biting insect, and more specifically, two anthropophilic species of Simulium flies found to be endemic to the areas. He published his findings on a “new disease” from Guatemala associated with subcutaneous nodules, anterior ocular (eye) lesions, dermatitis, and microfilariae in 1917.ROBLES R. Enfermedad nueva en Guatemala. La Juventud Médica 1917; 17: 97–115.

==Society and culture==

Since 1988, ivermectin has been provided free of charge for use in humans by Merck through the Mectizan donation program (MDP). The MDP works together with ministries of health and nongovernmental development organisations, such as the World Health Organization, to provide free ivermectin to those who need it in endemic areas.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Trop Med Int Health |date=May 2008 |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=689–96 |title=Operational lessons from 20 years of the Mectizan Donation Program for the control of onchocerciasis|author=Thylefors B, Alleman MM, Twum-Danso NA |pmid=18419585 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02049.x[/tpl]

==Research==

Animal models for the disease are somewhat limited, as the parasite only lives in primates, but there are close parallels. Litomosoides sigmodontis , which will naturally infect cotton rats, has been found to fully develop in BALB/c mice. Onchocerca ochengi, the closest relative of O. volvulus, lives in intradermal cavities in cattle, and is also spread by black flies. Both systems are useful, but not exact, animal models.[tpl]cite journal |author=Allen JE, Adjei O, Bain O, Hoerauf A, Hoffmann WH, Makepeace BL, Schulz-Key H, Tanya VN, Trees AJ, Wanji S, Taylor DW |title=Of Mice, Cattle, and Humans: The Immunology and Treatment of River Blindness |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18446236 |pmc=2323618 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000217 |pages=e217 |editor1-last=Lustigman |editor1-first=Sara[/tpl]
A study of 2501 people in Ghana showed the prevalence rate doubled between 2000 and 2005 despite treatment, suggesting the parasite is developing resistance to the drug.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6753003.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=River blindness resistance fears |accessdate=2007-06-15 |date=2007-06-14[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Osei-Atweneboana MY, Eng JK, Boakye DA, Gyapong JO, Prichard RK |title=Prevalence and intensity of Onchocerca volvulus infection and efficacy of ivermectin in endemic communities in Ghana: a two-phase epidemiological study |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9578 |pages=2021–9 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17574093|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60942-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)60942-8[/tpl] A clinical trial of another antiparasitic agent, moxidectin(manufactured by Wyeth), began on July 1, 2009 (NCT00790998).[tpl]cite journal|journal=Lancet |title=Fighting river blindness and other ills |volume=374 |issue=9684|page=91 |date=11 July 2009 |pmid=19595328 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61262-9 |author=author listed[/tpl] (editorial)
