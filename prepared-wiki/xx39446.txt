The settlement is mentioned in 1599 because of lead and iron mining.
Since the construction of Krummhübel's first railway connection in 1895 history was connected with the development of metallurgy industries and with the progress of tourism. The ethnically German village was part of Austria and Austria-Hungary in 1526-1742, the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742-1870 and then Germany between 1871-1945. Krummhübel's  German population was forcibly expelled from the village between 1945 and 1947.  The town was subsequently repopulated with ethnic Poles and eventually renamed Karpacz — an allusion in Polish to the Carpathian Mountains, from which some of the new settlers hailed.
