==Critical reception==

Allmusic - "...Balancing a smooth flow with charismatic lyrics, the Latin rapper moves through a stunning number of tracks without exhausting thematic material...this album features an artist capable of going head to head with most major label MCs, along with slick, funk-influenced production. Furthermore, the straight-up Latin moments, such as the chorus to "Mamacita" -- featuring the superstar line-up of Cisco, Frost, Soopafly, and Kuruptâ€”bring a new aesthetic to hip-hop."
