CATEGORIES: Heart, Cardiology, Organs, Circulatory system

The heart is a hollow muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the blood vessels to various parts of the body by repeated, rhythmic contractions.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/circulatory-system/facilitating-exchange-with-cells-throughout-the-body/evolutionary-adaptations-of-the-circulatory-system/ |title=Evolutionary adaptations of the circulatory system – Facilitating Exchange with Cells Throughout the Body |publisher=Boundless.com |accessdate=2013-10-01[/tpl] It is found in all animals with a circulatory system, which includes the vertebrates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.seymoursimon.com/index.php/science_dictionary/heart_/ |title=Heart |work=SeymourSimon.com |date= [/tpl]
The adjective cardiac means "related to the heart" and comes from the Greek καρδιά, kardia, for "heart".  Cardiology is the medical speciality that deals with cardiac diseases and abnormalities.
The vertebrate heart is principally composed of cardiac muscle and connective tissue. Cardiac muscle is an involuntary striated muscle tissue specific to the heart and is responsible for the  heart's ability to pump blood.
The average human heart,  beating at 72 beats per minute, will beat approximately 2.5 billion times during an average 66 year lifespan, and pumps approximately 4.7-5.7 litres of blood per minute. It weighs approximately [tpl]convert|250|to|300|g|oz|0[/tpl] in females and [tpl]convert|300|to|350|g|oz|0[/tpl] in males.[tpl]cite book |last=Kumar |last2=Abbas |last3=Fausto |year=2005 |title=Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=7th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |page=556 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 [/tpl]

==Structure==

The structure of the heart can vary among the different animal species. (See Circulatory system.) Cephalopods have two "gill hearts" and one "systemic heart". In vertebrates, the heart lies in the anterior part of the body cavity, dorsal to the gut. It is always surrounded by a pericardium, which is usually a distinct structure, but may be continuous with the peritoneum in jawless and cartilaginous fish. Hagfish, uniquely among vertebrates, also possess a second heart-like structure in the tail.

===In humans===

The adult human heart has a mass of between 250 and 350 grams and is about the size of a fist.[tpl]cite book |author=MacDonald, Matthew |title=Your Body: The Missing Manual |publisher=Pogue Press |location=Sebastopol, CA |year=2009 |isbn=0-596-80174-2[/tpl] It is located anterior to the vertebral column and posterior to the sternum.[tpl]cite book|author1=Cecie Starr|author2=Christine Evers|author3=Lisa Starr|title=Biology: Today and Tomorrow With Physiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dxC27ndpwe8C&pg=PA422|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-56157-6|pages=422–[/tpl]
It is enclosed in a double-walled sac called the pericardium. The pericardium's outer wall is called the parietal pericardium and the inner one the visceral pericardium. Between them there is some pericardial fluid which functions to permit the inner and outer walls to slide easily over one another with the heart movements. Outside the parietal pericardium is a fibrous layer called the fibrous pericardium which is attached to the mediastinal fascia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/content/6/4/359.full.pdf|title=the anatomy and applied anatomy of the mediastinal fascia|accessdate=2013-02-27[/tpl] This sac protects the heart and anchors it to the surrounding structures.
The outer wall of the human heart is composed of three layers; the outer layer is called the epicardium, or visceral pericardium since it is also the inner wall of the pericardium. The middle layer is called the myocardium and is composed of contractile cardiac muscle. The inner layer is called the endocardium and is in contact with the blood that the heart pumps.[tpl]cite book|author=Pratiyogita Darpan|title=Competition Science Vision|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yEU6mYWgUcwC&pg=PT55|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=April 2009|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|pages=55–[/tpl] Also, it merges with the inner lining (endothelium) of blood vessels and covers heart valves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medicalook.com/human_anatomy/organs/Heart.html |title=Heart |accessdate=2010-05-03 |work=MedicaLook |publisher=Medicalook.com [/tpl]
The human heart has four chambers, two superior atria and two inferior ventricles. The atria are the receiving chambers and the ventricles are the discharging chambers. During each cardiac cycle, the atria contract first, forcing blood that has entered them into their respective ventricles, then the ventricles contract, forcing blood out of the heart.  The pathway of the blood consists of a pulmonary circuit and a systemic circuit[tpl]cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pulmonary+circuit |title=Pulmonary circuit |accessdate=2011-05-10 |publisher=medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com [/tpl] which function simultaneously.   Deoxygenated blood from the body flows via the vena cava into the right atrium, which pumps it through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, whose subsequent contraction forces it out through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries leading to the lungs. Meanwhile, oxygenated blood returns from the lungs through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium, which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, whose subsequent strong contraction forces it out through the aortic valve to the aorta leading to the systemic circulation.[tpl]cite book |title=Emergency Medical Responder: A Skills Approach |edition=3rd Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=Pearson |year=2010 |page=131 |isbn=978-0-13-500485-2 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Marieb |first=Elaine Nicpon |title=Human Anatomy & Physiology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2003 |isbn=0-8053-5463-8 [/tpl]

===In fish===

Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart, but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).
In the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.

===In double circulatory systems===

In amphibians and most reptiles, a double circulatory system is used but the heart is not completely separated into two pumps. The development of the double system is necessitated by the presence of lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.
In living amphibians, the atrium is divided into two separate chambers by the presence of a muscular septum even though there is only one ventricle. The sinus venosus, which remains large in amphibians but connects only to the right atrium, receives blood from the venae cavae, with the pulmonary vein by-passing it entirely to enter the left atrium.
In the heart of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be at least partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin in such species; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the vena cavae is, in fact, already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle seems to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams than appears the case at first glance. Furthermore, the conus arteriosus has lost its original valves and contains a spiral valve, instead, that divides it into two parallel parts, thus helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.
The heart of most reptiles (except for crocodilians; see below) has a similar structure to that of lungfish but, here, the septum is generally much larger. This divides the ventricle into two halves but, because the septum does not reach the whole length of the heart, there is a considerable gap near the openings to the pulmonary artery and the aorta. In practice, however, in the majority of reptilian species, there appears to be little, if any, mixing between the bloodstreams, so the aorta receives, essentially, only oxygenated blood.

==Invertebrate heart==

In invertebrates that possess a circulatory system, the heart is typically a tube or small sac and pumps fluid that contains water and nutrients such as proteins, fats, and sugars. In insects, the "heart" is often called the dorsal tube and insect "blood" is almost always not oxygenated since they usually respirate (breathe) directly from their body surfaces (internal and external) to air. However, the hearts of some other arthropods (including spiders and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp) and some other animals pump hemolymph, which contains the copper-based protein hemocyanin as an oxygen transporter similar to the iron-based hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates.
