The ''St. Louis'' class cruiser were a group of three protected cruisers used by the United States Navy at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Class history==

Authorized in 1900, the St. Louis-class cruiser initially began as an improved Columbia-class cruiser. However, during the design phase, decisions were made to increase the size of the vessel from 6,000 tons to 9,700 tons. Other decisions were made to try to increase speed, such as using smaller [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|sing=on|0[/tpl] guns instead of [tpl]convert|8|in|mm|sing=on|0[/tpl] guns. Also, armor was increased which led to the need for a larger powerplant for the ship. The completed ship at 9,700 tons was the same displacement as a full armored cruiser without the same armor or armament.
