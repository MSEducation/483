==History==

SolydXK originated in 2012 as an unofficial version of "Linux Mint Debian edition" (LMDE) using the KDE desktop environment.http://www.kde.org/download/distributions.php
In November 2012, Linux Mint ceased maintaining both the KDE and XFCE versions of LMDE.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2237 |title = Monthly Stats â€“ November 2012 | accessdate = 16 Aug 2013[/tpl] SolydXK was started to support these two desktop environments. "SolydX" refers to the XFCE version, while "SolydK" refers to the KDE version. The web site url is an amalgam of the two names.

==Features==

The two core editions for SolydXK, SolydX and SolydK, are both available in 32-bit and 64-bit LiveCDs with installers.
The distribution installs with common software such as Firefox, Abiword/LibreOffice, Xchat/Quassel, Pidgin/Kopete, and GIMP for a variety of common tasks. Both editions also provide Steam and PlayOnLinux installed for gaming, and a driver manager to easily enable the best gaming performance.
SolydK BE http://solydxk.com/business/solydkbe/ is the Business Edition. This version has less "state of the art" software since it is build on Debian stable, where SolydXK is build on Debian Testing. The BE version is more suitable for offices where stability is more important than having the latest versions of the software.
SolydK BO (Back Office)http://solydxk.com/business/solydkbo/ edition adds an emphasis on small businesses and non-profit organizations. It contains software for employee management (OrangeHRM), customer relations (Zurmo), invoicing (SiWapp), and internal information streams (LetoDMS). SolydK BO is downloadable as a LiveCD with an installer, or any SolydXK distribution can be converted by installing a metapackage from the repository.
The distribution provides updates using a moderated rolling release model.http://solydxk.com/homeedition/update-packs-explained/ Updates are released every three months as "Update Packs," which are tested snapshots of Debian-testing packages. To further increase security both Firefox and Thunderbird are being built from source if there are new versions available. These packages do not necessarily follow the UP frequency, but will be released whenever they are available. This process delivers current, yet at the same time stable software to the end user, in contrast to a pure rolling release model, which has greater potential for buggy software. In addition, the rolling model allows SolydXK to remain current without ever reinstalling the operating system, in contrast to some Ubuntu-derivatives.
