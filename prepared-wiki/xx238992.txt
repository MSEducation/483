==Career==

Although trained as a dancer at the Stella Mann College of Performing Arts, Bedford, Montgomery chose to pursue acting rather than dance professionally. Her lack of drama school training made it difficult to obtain acting representation initially. She achieved her breakthrough after producing a play alongside friend Gethin Anthony.BBC – Media Centre – Janet Montgomery plays Anna Skarbek
In 2008, Montgomery was cast as the love interest of Nicholas Hoult in an episode of the teenage drama Skins. She also appeared in both the TV movie Dis/Connected and the short film Flushed.
The following year, Montgomery appeared in two straight-to-DVD horror-genre releases filmed in Sofia, Bulgaria – The Hills Run Red and the finale of the Wrong Turn trilogy, Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead and played the role of Fallyn Werner, a teenage killer in the Lifetime film Accused at 17.
In 2010, Montgomery appeared in her first theatrically released films, playing Ruth in the mystery The Rapture, Giselle in the independent horror film Dead Cert and the supporting role of Madeline in the Academy Award nominated psychological thriller Black Swan – playing a Little Swan to Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning portrayal of the Black Swan.
That same year Montgomery also signed on to play Paul Rudd's love interest in Our Idiot Brother. After seeing her audition tape in Los Angeles, producers worked around her schedule on Entourage and flew her to New York to begin shooting. This was her first comedy movie and one in which she received rave reviews.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Whilst working on Entourage, Montgomery was invited to appear on The League, a critically acclaimed semi-improvised show about American football, and appeared playing Ambrosia the stripper in the first episode of the second season. Barely recognisable and improvising in an American accent paved the way for her offer from Human Target producers for the role of Ames.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

Poliakoff was impressed and offered her the job via Skype.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] The five-part mini series aired 4 February 2013 on BBC Two.
