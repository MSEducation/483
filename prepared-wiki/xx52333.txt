[[Macroprolactin]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical pathology

Macroprolactin is a physiologically inactive form of prolactin found in a small proportion of people. It is in fact prolactin bound to IgG.
Macroprolactin is important, as some laboratory assays will detect it as prolactin, leading to a falsely elevated prolactin result. This can lead to a misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia in some people, especially those with other symptoms, such as infertility[tpl]Cite book|title=Insights Into Infertility Management |author=K Jayakrishnan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk582FjaeZMC&pg=PT100&dq=Macroprolactin+Size-exclusion+chromatography&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Macroprolactin Size-exclusion chromatography&f=false| publisher= JP Medical Ltd.| page=79| chapter=chapter 11[/tpl] or menstrual problems.
There are certain chemicals, such as polyethylene glycol, that can be added to remove macroprolactin from a suspicious sample. The sample can then be re-analysed to see if the prolactin levels are still high.
Gold standard test to diagnose macroprolactin is gel-filtration chromatography.
