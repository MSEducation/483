==Early life and revolution==

Almeida was born in a poor area of Havana. He left school at the age of eleven and became a bricklayer.[tpl]cite news|title=Cuban revolutionary Almeida dies|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2009|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8252210.stm[/tpl]  Whilst studying law at the University of Havana in 1952, he became close friends with the revolutionary Fidel Castro and in March of that year joined the Cuban Revolution. In 1953 he joined Fidel and his brother Raúl Castro in the assault on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago, and was arrested and imprisoned with the Castro brothers in the Isle of Pines Prison.Castro/Ramonet (2007), p. 681 During the amnesty of May 15, 1955, he was released and transferred to Mexico.
Almeida returned to Cuba with the Castro brothers, Che Guevara and 78 other revolutionaries on the Granma expedition, and was one of just 12 who survived the initial landing, during which Cuban government forces killed most of the rebels.  During the battle, Almeida shouted "No one here gives up!" (alternatively "here, nobody surrenders") to Guevara, which would become a long-lived slogan of the Cuban revolution.  Almeida was also reputed to be a good marksman.[tpl]cite news|title=Cuban vice president Juan Almeida dies|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2009|publisher=AFP|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iaV_hhRsw9RWgARtUcZna9iHTeqg[/tpl] Following the landing, Almeida continued to fight Fulgencio Batista's government forces in the guerilla war in the Sierra Maestra mountain range.  In 1958, he was promoted to Commander and head of the Santiago Column of the Revolutionary Army. During the revolution, as a black man in a prominent position, he served as a symbol to Afro-Cubans of change from Cuba's discriminatory past.

==Post-revolution==

After the success of the Cuban revolution in January 1959, Almeida commanded large parts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba. In April 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, as Major Juan Almeida, he was head of the Central Army, with headquarters in Santa Clara, Cuba. Later, he was promoted to General, and was chosen as a member of the central committee and political bureau, and he has held a number of other government positions.
He was honoured with the title of Commander of the Revolution, and at the time of his death was one of just three living holders of that title, the others being Guillermo García and Ramiro Valdés.
In 1998, Almeida was named a "Hero of the Republic of Cuba" by Fidel Castro.[tpl]cite news|title=Cuba revolution commander Juan Almeida dies at 82|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2009|publisher=Reuters India|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-42408520090912?sp=true[/tpl]  Almeida also headed the National Association of Veterans and Combatants of the Revolution. His interests included writing and music, of which several books and recordings have been made, including the popular trilogy Military prison, Exile and  Disembarkation.  He was also a songwriter and one of his songs, "Dame un traguito" (English:"Give me a Sip") was popular in Cuba for several years.
In 2005, a book entitled Ultimate Sacrifice was published, alleging that Almeida had been picked by the Kennedy administration as the key power figure in a plot to remove Castro. The plot was called AMWORLD or C-Day and was run by Robert Kennedy. It was set to launch on Dec. 1, 1963, but was aborted by John F. Kennedy's assassination a week earlier, which the narrative attributes to a revenge slaying by Mafia figures prosecuted by the Kennedys.

==Death==

On September 11, 2009, Juan Almeida died of a heart attack, aged 82. On September 13, a memorial ceremony was held in the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana, with several other memorials occurring across Cuba. A national day of mourning was also declared, with flags flown at half mast.[tpl]cite news|title=Cuba mourns key revolution leader|date=September 13, 2009|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8252977.stm[/tpl]  The memorial service was attended by tens of thousands of his countrymen, who queued across the Plaza to view a large photograph of Almeida.[tpl]cite news|title=Thousands of Cubans pay tribute to Castro's right-hand man Juan Almeida Bosque|date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2009|publisher=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1213296/Thousands-Cubans-pay-tribute-Castros-right-hand-man-Juan-Almeida-Bosque.html#ixzz0R4vfUXsQ[/tpl]  The service was initiated by President Raúl Castro, who placed a pink rose in front of the photograph, but did not make a statement.  Fidel Castro, who at the time had not been seen in public since he resigned as president in 2008, did not attend the ceremony, but did release a statement praising Almeida's "exemplary conduct during more than half a century of heroic and victorious resistance".  Fidel Castro also sent a wreath to the memorial, that was placed alongside that of Fidel's brother, Raúl's.[tpl]cite news|title=Cubans pay homage to deceased vice president |date=September 14, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2009|publisher=Xinhua|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/14/content_12047668.htm[/tpl]  Other senior government and Communist Party members also attended the ceremony.
Internationally, there were several tributes. The President of Vietnam, Nguyen Minh Triet, sent a message to Raúl Castro, in which he expressed his sadness, describing Almeida as a great friend of the Vietnamese people who contributed to the ties of solidarity between the two nations.Sorrow for Almeida´s Decease Continue by the Cuban News Agency In Bolivia, the Coco and Inti Peredo Foundation (named after two brothers who died alongside Che Guevara) paid tribute as well.
