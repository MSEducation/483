The UCD Center for Mind and Brain is a research and training unit at the University of California, Davis dedicated to understanding the nature of the human mind from interdisciplinary perspectives.
Scientists currently in the CMB (19 core members), and those who will be recruited to join it, include those interested in a wide range of fundamental questions about how minds are organized. We address these questions using interdisciplinary approaches from social science (anthropology, economics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology), biological science (behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, physiology), engineering science (biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science), and medical science (neurology, psychiatry and medical imaging).
The research mission of the CMB includes investigation of a variety of fundamental issues aimed at answering the fundamental question: How does the mind arise from the biology of the brain? Scientists in the CMB study language, memory, attention, cognitive control, emotion, multisensory integration, music cognition, social cognition, and visual cognition from cognitive neuroscience and developmental perspectives in healthy infants, children, and adults, and in special patient populations. We are also a leader in the emerging field of translational cognitive neuroscience, which endeavors to translate basic science findings about the operation of healthy minds and brains into clinical research on mind-brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.
The Center for Mind and Brain is located adjacent to the University of California, Davis campus at 267 Cousteau Place (main building) and 202 Cousteau Place (CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex). The CMB and Developmental Psychology Annex includes over [tpl]convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl]. of custom designed laboratories, offices and shared facilities.
