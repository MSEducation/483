[tpl]Nihongo|Hitoshi Ashida|芦田 均|Ashida Hitoshi|15 November 1887 – 20 June 1959[/tpl] was a Japanese politician who served as the 47th Prime Minister of Japan from 10 March to 15 October 1948. He was a prominent figure in the immediate postwar political landscape, but was forced to resign his leadership responsibilities after a corruption scandal (Shōwa Denkō Jiken) targeting two of his cabinet ministers.

==Early political life==

Ashida was born in Fukuchiyama, Kyoto and studied French civil law at Tokyo Imperial University. After graduation, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for twenty years.
In 1932, Ashida ran his first successful campaign for a seat in the House of Representatives as a member of the Seiyukai Party. He sided with Ichirō Hatoyama's "orthodox" wing following the Seiyukai's split in 1939.
After the war, Ashida won a seat in the new Diet as a member of the Liberal Party, which soon merged with Kijūrō Shidehara's Progressive Party to form the Japan Democratic Party. Ashida was elected president of the new party, and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1947 under Socialist prime minister Tetsu Katayama. He chaired the Committee on the Bill for Revision of the Imperial Constitution, and served as the chairman of the Kenpō Fukyū Kai, a society created to promote the revised Constitution of Japan, from 1946-1948.[tpl]cite web|title=Alfred Hussey, Memorandum on Program for Publicizing the new Japanese Constitution, February 5, 1947|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/05/002_37shoshi.html|work=Birth of the Japanese Constitution|publisher=National Diet Library of Japan|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Constitution of Japan (The Official Gazettes, a Special Edition)|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2926/#q=Hitoshi+Ashida&qla=en|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl]

==Prime Minister and later life==

Ashida became prime minister in 1948, leading a coalition government of Democratic and Socialist members. During his rule, he made a key amendment to Article Nine of the Japanese Constitution, which enabled the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Force.[tpl]cite book|author=Fumiko Sasaki|title=Nationalism, Political Realism and Democracy in Japan: The thought of Masao Maruyama|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B8iqxR758vMC&pg=PA34|accessdate=24 May 2013|date=26 July 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-31378-3|page=136[/tpl] His tenure ended just seven months after it began.
