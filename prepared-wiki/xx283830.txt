In September 1944 after the Liberation of Paris she met Czechoslovakian-born British Army Captain Robert Maxwell, while working as an interpreter for the 'Welcome Committee' which introduced French people to allied officers and they married on 15 March 1945. She then worked as his secretary and assistant in London as he established his publishing empire and bore him 9 children, 2 of whom died in childhood. 
In her forties she worked in public relations for her husband's company and campaigned for him in the General Election of 1964.
