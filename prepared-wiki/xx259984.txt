[[Baghdad Championship]]

CATEGORIES: Football in Iraq

Baghdad Championship (Previously called Umm Al Maarek Cup (Mother of All Battles Cup) was an Iraqi football cup contested by Iraqi club teams. Initiated in September 1991, following the Gulf War. Played between the top-6 sides of the league in the first edition, then between the top-8. After the attack on Iraq in spring 2003, the tournament was called Baghdad Championship (presumably since all matches are played in Baghdad). 
Al Shorta won it 3 times in 2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03 and also lost the final in 1997. The tournament is now defunct.
