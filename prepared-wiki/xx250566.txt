==Selection Process==

The team is chosen by members of the Hall of Fame Selection Committee.  This committee consists of one media member from each NFL market (two for New York/ New Jersey owing to the market's two teams), a representative from the Pro Football Writers of America and 11 "at-large" delegates (primarily national sportswriters) for a total of 44 voters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/selectionprocess.aspx|title=Selection Process|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=19 January 2010[/tpl]  These voters are asked to select two coaches and a total of 53 players, broken out as follows: two quarterbacks, four running backs, a fullback, four wide receivers, two tight ends, four offensive tackles, four guards, two centers, four defensive ends, four defensive tackles, six linebackers, four cornerbacks, four safeties, two placekickers, two punters, two kick returners, two punt returners.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/nwsltr/sports/fromthe50/stories/122209dnspoinsidenfl.347a8f1.html |title=22 is the magic number for the NFL all-decade team |accessdate=19 January 2010 |last=Gosselin |first=Rick |date=December 23, 2009 |work= |publisher=The Dallas Morning News[/tpl]

Perhaps the biggest debate for the group came with the vote for the quarterback position. In the end, three-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady narrowly edged four-time MVP Peyton Manning for the first-team nod.
