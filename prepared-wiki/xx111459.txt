Tender Buttons is the third studio album by the British indie electronic band Broadcast. It was released by Warp Records on September 19, 2005 in the UK, one day later in the United States. The album marks a turn in the band's sound, featuring a stark, almost frigid aesthetic, bearing similarities to the sound of the Young Marble Giants, an early 1980s British minimalist post-punk band. 
The eleventh track was named "Minus 3" due to the third loss of a member from the band.
