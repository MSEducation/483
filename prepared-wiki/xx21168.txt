The sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant grown as a crop for its edible oil and edible fruits (commonly called "sunflower seeds"). Sunflower is also used as bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant) and in some industrial applications. The plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Wild Helianthus annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, possesses a single large inflorescence (flowering head) atop an unbranched stem. The name sunflower derives from the flower head's shape, which resembles the Sun. 
Sunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient.

==Structure==

The plant has a rough, hairy stem, broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves, and circular flower heads. The heads consist of many individual flowers which mature into seeds, often in the hundreds, on a receptacle base.

==Description==

What is usually called the "flower" on a mature sunflower is actually a "flower head" (also known as a "composite flower") of numerous florets (small flowers) crowded together. The outer petal-bearing florets (ray florets) are sterile and can be yellow, red, orange, or other colors. The florets inside the circular head are called disc florets, which mature into seeds
The flower petals within the sunflower's cluster are always in a spiral pattern. Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5°, producing a pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; on a very large sunflower there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=2gO2sBp4ipQC&pg=RA1-PA217&dq=large-sunflower+spirals+144+89 |title=John A.

Sunflowers commonly grow to heights between 1.5 and 3.5 m (5–12 ft.). The tallest sunflower confirmed by Guinness World Records is 8.0 m (2009, Germany). In 16th-century Europe the record was already 7.3 m (24 ft., Spain).[tpl]cite book|last=Gerard|first=John|title=Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes|publisher=John Norton|location=London|year=1597|pages=612–614|url=http://www.botanicus.org/page/1956748|accessdate=2012-08-08[/tpl] Popular botany book in 17th century England Most cultivars are variants of H. annuus, but four other species (all perennials) are also domesticated. This includes H. tuberosus, the Jerusalem Artichoke, which produces edible tubers.

==Mathematical model of floret arrangement==

A model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H. Vogel in 1979. This is expressed in polar coordinates
where θ is the angle, r is the radius or distance from the center, and n is the index number of the floret and c is a constant scaling factor. It is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio (55/144 of a circular angle, where 55 and 144 are Fibonacci numbers) and gives a close packing of florets. This model has been used to produce computer graphics representations of sunflowers.[ref]

==Genome==

The sunflower, Helianthus annuus, genome is diploid with a base chromosome number of 17 and an estimated genome size of 2871–3189 Mbp.[tpl]cite web |title=Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) Genome Project |publisher=NCBI |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=txid4232 |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl][tpl]NCBI | 4232 | Helianthus annuus[/tpl] Some sources claim its true size is around 3.5 billion base pairs (slightly larger than the human genome).[tpl]cite web |title=Sunflower Genome Holds the Promise of Sustainable Agriculture|publisher=ScienceDaily |date=2010-01-14 |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100112121930.htm[/tpl]

==Cultivation and uses==

To grow best, sunflowers need full sun. They grow best in fertile, moist, well-drained soil with heavy mulch. In commercial planting, seeds are planted 45 cm (1.5 ft.) apart and 2.5 cm (1 in) deep.
Sunflower "whole seed" (fruit) are sold as a snack food, raw or after roasting in ovens, with or without salt and/or seasonings added. Sunflowers can be processed into a peanut butter alternative, sunflower butter. In Germany, it is mixed with rye flour to make Sonnenblumenkernbrot (literally: sunflower whole seed bread), which is quite popular in German-speaking Europe. It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads. American Indians had multiple uses for sunflowers in the past, such as in bread, medical ointments, dyes and body paints.Pelczar, Rita. (1993) The Prodigal Sunflower. American Horticulturist 72(8).
Sunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is used for cooking, as a carrier oil and to produce margarine and biodiesel, as it is cheaper than olive oil. A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid compositions; some 'high oleic' types contain a higher level of monounsaturated fats in their oil than even olive oil.
The cake remaining after the seeds have been processed for oil is used as a livestock feed. Some recently developed cultivars have drooping heads. These cultivars are less attractive to gardeners growing the flowers as ornamental plants, but appeal to farmers, because they reduce bird damage and losses from some plant diseases. Sunflowers also produce latex, and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing nonallergenic rubber.
Traditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a "fourth sister" to the better known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash.Kuepper and Dodson (2001) Companion Planting: Basic Concept and Resources Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties.Nikneshan, P., Karimmojeni, P., Moghanibashi, M., Hosseini, N. (2011) Australian Journal of Crop Science. 5(11):1434-40. ISSN:1835-2707. Allelopathic potential of sunflower on weed management in safflower and wheat
However, for commercial farmers growing commodity crops, the sunflower, like any other unwanted plant, is often considered a weed.  Especially in the Midwestern US, wild (perennial) species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can have a negative impact on yields.
Sunflowers can be used in phytoremediation to extract toxic ingredients from soil, such as lead, arsenic and uranium, and used in rhizofiltration to neutralize radionuclides and other toxic ingredients and harmful bacteria from water. They were used to remove caesium-137 and strontium-90 from a nearby pond after the Chernobyl disaster,[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n3_v150/ai_18518620/?tag=content;col1 |title=Botanical cleanup crews: using plants to tackle polluted water and soil |author=Adler, Tina |publisher=Science News|date=July 20, 1996|accessdate= 2010-09-03[/tpl] and a similar campaign was mounted in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110624/wl_asia_afp/japandisasteraccidentnuclearsunflowers|title=Sunflowers to clean radioactive soil in Japan|author=AFP |publisher=Yahoo News|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate= 2011-06-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Sunflowers melt Fukushima's nuclear "snow"|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/19/us-japan-disaster-sunflowers-idUSTRE77I0PG20110819|accessdate=22 January 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 August 2011|author=Antoni Slodkowski|author2=Yuriko Nakao[/tpl]

==Heliotropism misconception==

A common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. Although immature flower buds exhibit this behaviour, the mature flowering heads point in a fixed (and typically easterly) direction throughout the day."Many people are under the misconception that the flower heads of the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) track the sun... Immature flower buds of the sunflower do exhibit solar tracking and on sunny days the buds will track the sun across the sky from east to west...  However, as the flower bud matures and blossoms, the stem stiffens and the flower becomes fixed facing the eastward direction."  [tpl]cite web|url=http://plantsinmotion.bio.indiana.edu/plantmotion/movements/tropism/solartrack/solartrack.html|title=Solar tracking: sunflower plants|last=Hangarter|first=Roger P|work=Plants-In-Motion website|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=22 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.flowers-org.com/helianthus-sunflower.html|title=Sunflowers in the blooming stage are not heliotropic anymore. The stem has frozen, typically in an eastward orientation.[/tpl] This old misconception was disputed in 1597 by the English botanist John Gerard, who grew sunflowers in his famous herbal garden: "some have reported it to turn with the Sun, the which I could never observe, although I have endeavored to find out the truth of it." The uniform alignment of sunflower heads in a field might give some people the false impression that the flowers are tracking the sun.
The uniform alignment results from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the bud stage, before the appearance of flower heads (anthesis).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/sunflower/|title=Sunflower, Developmental stages (life cycle) |work=GeoChemBio website|accessdate=8 August 2012[/tpl] The buds are heliotropic until the end of the bud stage, and finally face East.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2402749?uid=3738256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102587672931|title="Diurnal E-W oscillations of the heads occurred initially but ceased as the flowers opened and anthesis commenced, leaving the heads facing east."  Movements of Helianthus annuus Leaves and Heads A. R. G. Lang and J. E. Begg ''Journal of Applied Ecology (1979) 16, 299-305[/tpl]"When the plant is in the bud stage, it tends to track the movement of the sun across the horizon. Once the flower opens into the radiance of yellow petals, it faces east." National Sunflower Association Their heliotropic motion is a circadian rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the sun disappears on cloudy days. If a sunflower plant in the bud stage is rotated 180°, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization by the sun takes time.[tpl]cite book|author1=Donat-Peter Häder|author2=Michael Lebert|title=Photomovement|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2nevsljDiCYC&pg=PA673|accessdate=15 August 2010|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-50706-8|pages=673–[/tpl] The heliotropic motion of the bud is performed by the pulvinus, a flexible segment just below the bud, due to reversible changes in turgor pressure, which occurs without growth.

==History==

Although it was commonly accepted that the sunflower was first domesticated in what is now the Southeastern US, roughly 5000 years ago,Blackman et al. (2011) http://www.pnas.org/content/108/34/14360.full. PNAS. there is evidence that it was first domesticated in MexicoLentz et al. (2008) PNAS. around 2600 BC.  These crops were found in Tabasco, Mexico at the San Andre's dig site. The earliest known examples in the United States of a fully domesticated sunflower have been found in Tennessee, and date to around 2300 BC.Rieseberg, Loren H., et al. (2004) Origin of Extant Domesticated Sunflowers in Eastern North America. Nature 430.6996. 201-205. Many indigenous American peoples used the sunflower as the symbol of their solar deity, including the Aztecs and the Otomi of Mexico and the Incas in South America. In 1510 early Spanish explorers encountered the sunflower in the Americas and carried its seeds back to Europe.[tpl]cite book|last=Putt, E.D.|title=Sunflower Technology and Production|editor=A.A.

PNAS. and to have become important agricultural commodities, the sunflower is currently the most economically important.
During the 18th century, the use of sunflower oil became very popular in Russia, particularly with members of the Russian Orthodox Church, because sunflower oil was one of the few oils that was allowed during Lent, according to some fasting traditions."SUNFLOWERS: The Secret History."
