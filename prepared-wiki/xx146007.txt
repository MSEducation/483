"Freddy Kreuger" is the fifth single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben, and the second single taken from their debut album Racecar Is Racecar Backwards. It was released in June 2004, and was the first release on XtraMile/Sony, whom the band had at last signed a proper record deal with. The single was released on CD and 7" vinyl format, and reached #53 in the UK charts. It also made the #1 spot on the Chain With No Name independent chart, and Zane Lowe made it his Radio 1 single of the week. It was Reuben's first track to be playlisted on XFM and their first track to be played on Mary Anne Hobbsâ€™ Rock Show. It was also played on Virgin Radio sporadically.
