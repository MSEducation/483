==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Stewart Mason states "Something of a companion album to the earlier Julian Cannonball Adderley and Strings, Jump for Joy sounds like it could be outtakes from the same sessions in terms of its orchestral-quality arrangements, but this is very much its own album. Jump for Joy is Adderley's reinterpretation, circa 1958, of a Duke Ellington stage musical from 1941... Hearing Adderley's often thrilling, always well-constructed alto sax improvisations over tunes like the standard "I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good" is reason enough for the album to exist, and although Russo's orchestral flourishes occasionally threaten to overwhelm the soloist (especially on the closing "The Tune of the Hickory Stick"), they're always at the very least charming examples of '50s jazz-pop arrangements".Mason, S. Allmusic Review accessed 19 October 2009 
The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a three star rating saying "Jump for Joy puts Cannonball with Richard Hayman's strings for the first half, and it's not the happiest of combinations, though the sheer alacrity  of Adderrley's sound energises some otherwise tepid writing. The second half, arranged by Bill Russo to accommodate a string quartet beside a familiar rhythm section works better".[tpl]cite book|last = Cook|first = Richard|authorlink = Richard Cook (journalist)|coauthors = Brian Morton|title = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings|origyear = 1992|edition = 7th ed.|series = The Penguin Guide to Jazz|year = 2004|publisher = Penguin|location = England|isbn = 0-141-01416--4|pages = 11|chapter = Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley[/tpl]
