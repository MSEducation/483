Philippa of Clarence (16 August 1355 – before 7 January 1378) was the suo jure Countess of Ulster.

==Biography==

She was born at Eltham Palace in Kent on 16 August 1355, the only child of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster.Leese, Thelma Anna, Blood royal: Issue of the Kings and Queens of Medieval England, 1066–1399, (Heritage Books Inc., 2007), 91. Her father was the third son, but second son to survive infancy, of King Edward III of England and Philippa of Hainault.[tpl]sfn|Ormrod|2008[/tpl]
Philippa married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March at the age of twelve in 1368 in the Queen's Chapel at Reading Abbey,Leese, 91. forging an alliance that would have far-reaching consequences in English history. During her own lifetime, Philippa was the heiress presumptive to her first cousin Richard II; she would have been displaced in the succession by any legitimate children of the king.  Richard remained childless, so after her death, her position as first in queue for the throne passed to her son, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March.  He was killed at the Battle of Kells in Ireland in 1398, making his six-year-old son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, Richard's heir presumptive.
However, the throne was usurped by Richard and Philippa's first cousin, Henry of Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt, an event that later precipitated the Wars of the Roses.  As a result of Philippa's seniority in the line of succession to the throne of the Kingdom of England and her marriage into the powerful Mortimer family, her descendants eventually succeeded to the throne as the House of York under Edward IV.
Philippa died before 7 January 1378[tpl]sfn|Richardson III|2011|p=194[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Davies|2004[/tpl] in Cork, Ireland,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] and was buried at Wigmore Abbey, Herefordshire.
