The Housing Commission of Victoria (colloquially known as the Housing Commission) was a State Government body responsible for public housing in Victoria, Australia. Responsible to the Victorian Minister for Housing, it was established in 1938 and existed until replaced by the Victorian Office of Housing.
Its most notable legacy was the tens of thousands of buildings either acquired or constructed to provide more affordable housing for residents of Melbourne and other Victorian towns, including the construction of 40–45 individual precast concrete high-rise apartments in inner Melbourne. Though the Commission arguably often operated with the best of intentions, few would agree that its influence was benign or that its original ideal of replacing slums with modern and functional housing (and communities) was met. The high-rise apartments are popularly considered as a scar on the Melbourne cityscape, and successive governments have actively worked towards their demolition or gentrification.

==History==

The Commission was established over the Housing Act 1937 in response to slum housing in Melbourne, and worked under the Slum Reclamation and Housing Act 1938. The mission was 'slum abolition' driven by the zeal of Christian and other social reformers, but later became 'slum clearance' and 'block demolition'.
The Commission presided over the construction of the Melbourne Olympic Village in 1956, and made its mark on the Melbourne skyline during the 1960s in the form of high-rise blocks of flats on various sites around inner Melbourne, the largest of which being Lygon Street in Carlton and Atherton Gardens in Fitzroy. Approximately twenty of these precast concrete 20 to 30 storey height buildings were constructed around Melbourne, until the type of development fell into disrepute, mainly for sociological reasons. By 1970 nearly 4000 privately owned dwellings had been compulsory acquired and replaced by nearly 7000 high rise flats. 
Production then moved to low rise walk up and single dwelling units, with about 10,000 homes using locally engineered design and erection methods constructed using the technology. Public housing was also built in regional Victorian cities, such as Wangaratta, Wodonga and Geelong.

In the midst of the economic conditions caused by the Great Depression, the overcrowded conditions in the inner suburban areas of Melbourne had created a 'housing crisis'.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|page=20[/tpl] Oswald Barnett, active in campaigning against slums and his 'study group' led the Victorian Government to establish the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board (HISAB) in July 1936, to investigate housing conditions in these areas.[tpl]cite book|last=Russell|first=E.W.|title=The slum abolition movement in Victoria, 1933–37|year=1972|publisher=Hornet Publications|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-85919-191-5|pages=8[/tpl] HISAB's 1937 report found 3,000 houses 'unfit for habitation' and recommended the establishment of the Housing Commission with John O’Connor the Commission's first chairman, while Oswald Barnett, Oswald Burt and Frances Penington were appointed as part-time commissioners.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|pages=33–34[/tpl] In the next few years, the Commission moved thousands from the slums to new housing, improving conditions but also encountering problems along the way.
The Housing Commission of Victoria was established under the Housing Act 1937 to improve existing housing conditions and to provide adequate housing for persons of limited means; the Slum Reclamation Act 1938 and the Reclamation and Housing (Financial) Act 1938 provided the framework for the Commission's work.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|pages=34–35[/tpl] On the passing of the legislation, the Victorian Premier, Albert Dunstan,[tpl]cite news|title=Commission Meets|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11167395|accessdate=7 May 2011|newspaper=The Argus|date=2 March 1938[/tpl] declared the beginning of the Commission's activities as a 'war on slums', but also recognised the magnitude of the task before it. The legislation not only gave the Commission powers for housing construction and improvement, but also made it 'a planning authority in its own right'.[tpl]cite book|last=Hutchings|first=Alan|title=The Australian metropolis : a planning history|year=1999|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, N.S.W.|isbn=1-86508-053-5|authorlink=From theory to practice: the inter-war years|editor=Stephen Hamnett & Robert Freestone[/tpl] The Commission's chief concerns however, were the 'slum pockets' which required 'excision' for the 'common good'.[tpl]cite book|last=Freestone|first=Robert|title=Urban nation : Australia's planning heritage|year=2010|publisher=CSIRO Pub. in association wih the Dept. of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, and the Australian Heritage Council|location=Collingwood, Vic.|isbn=978-0-643-09698-1|pages=217[/tpl] The Commission developed a plan of action in March 1938, concentrating its attention on 1,240 houses in lanes, rights-of-way and slum pockets, referred to in HISAB's earlier report.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|page=37[/tpl] Slums were to be reclaimed and people rehoused.
To house the people moved from the slum areas, the Commission needed to provide new homes. The Commission's first estate was the Garden City development at Fisherman's Bend. Next was the development of flats at Pigdon Street, Carlton, though the original proposal for three storey flats was reduced to two storeys after local opposition.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|page=39[/tpl] The Commission then began to acquire cheap land in the northern suburbs of Coburg, Brunswick, Preston and Northcote as well as in inner suburban areas such as North Melbourne, Fitzroy and Richmond.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|page=40[/tpl] These estates and acquisitions were the first of many.
The Commission's acquisition plans were ambitious and it was bound to come across difficulties. The synchronisation of the 'demolition program' was proving difficult and by June 1940, only 53 families had moved into new houses while only 99 houses had been ordered for demolition.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|page=41[/tpl] The Commission also had difficulties dealing with local municipalities, in acquiring properties in the North Melbourne reclamation area as well as with the labour movement, who believed that the government should subsidise loans to enable workers to buy homes rather than rent them.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=Reform and social responsibility: the establishment of the Housing Commission|editor=Renate Howe|pages=43–44[/tpl] The rehousing of those from the slums was a difficult task.
As a landlord, the Commission also experienced problems. Tenants were initially reluctant to move, while rents on the estates were more expensive than in their former accommodation.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=From rehabilitation to prevention: the war years’|editor=Renate Howe|page=54[/tpl] At Fisherman's Bend, there was tension between tenants of the Commission's estate and those who had bought homes under an earlier housing program; vandalism was also a problem, both at Fisherman's Bend and in the West Brunswick estate.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=From rehabilitation to prevention: the war years’|editor=Renate Howe|pages=46–47[/tpl] Frances Penington, who was also a social worker, advocated for community facilities to be built at the estates to alleviate some of these problems, these were built after protracted debate by others on the Commission.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=From rehabilitation to prevention: the war years’|editor=Renate Howe|pages=50–51[/tpl] Transportation costs from the new estates to places of employment were also an issue.[tpl]cite book|last=Barnett, F.O. & Burt, W.O|title=Housing the Australian nation|year=1942|publisher=The Book Depot|pages=46[/tpl] Despite these issues, residents 'adjusted to their new homes and locations' and appreciated the 'better home environment'.[tpl]cite book|last=Barnett, F.O. & Burt, W.O|title=Housing the Australian nation|year=1942|publisher=The Book Depot|pages=22[/tpl]
By 1942, building had halted as the Commission shifted its focus to post-war planning. It continued to acquire land though, taking advantage of low prices by purchasing land in industrial areas in the western suburbs as well as in the middle class eastern and southern suburbs.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=From rehabilitation to prevention: the war years’|editor=Renate Howe|page=55[/tpl] The Commission, in its planning authority capacity had also drawn up plans for the future development of Melbourne but by 1944, it was lacking resources to deal with backlogs of council plans.[tpl]cite book|last=Lewis|first=Miles|title=Suburban backlash : the battle for the world's most liveable city|year=1999|publisher=Bloomings Books|location=Hawthorn, Vic.|isbn=1-876473-16-9|pages=46[/tpl] The Commission recruited Frank Heath from its advisory Architects Panel to deal with these problems but it was stripped of its town planning powers later in the same year. The Commission's 1944 report found that housing was required in 'large numbers as quickly as possible to house those recently returned to civilian life and catch up on the lag of construction over the war years'.[tpl]cite book|last=Housing Commission of Victoria|title=Housing Commission, Victoria: The first 25 years|year=1963|publisher=Housing Commission of Victoria|pages=3[/tpl] The era of slum reclamation was over.
While the Commission was planning for the future, so were its commissioners. Barnett and Burt[tpl]cite book|last=Barnett, F.O. & Burt, W.O|title=Housing the Australian nation|year=1942|publisher=The Book Depot[/tpl] published Housing the Australian Nation, reviewing the slum reclamation, but also putting forward their plans for a national housing policy. Barnett, Burt and Heath[tpl]cite book|last=Barnett, F.O., Burt, W.O. & Heath, F.|title=We must go on: a study in planned reconstruction and housing|publisher=The Book Depot|location=Melbourne[/tpl] published We Must Go On calling for a fairer society and centralised planning. By now, housing for growing numbers was the main concern.
The Housing Commission achieved a lot in these early years. The Commission had reclaimed slums and provided housing for many in new estates. In doing this though, it also encountered difficulties. With the end of the war approaching, the increasing housing shortage as well as the large numbers returning from war meant that the Commission shifted its focus from reclaiming slums to become a housing provider.[tpl]cite book|last=Howe|first=Renate|title=New houses for old : fifty years of public housing in Victoria, 1938–1988|year=1988|publisher=Ministry of Housing and Construction|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-7241-4797-7|authorlink=From rehabilitation to prevention: the war years’|editor=Renate Howe|page=60[/tpl]

==1960s high rises==

There are 20 or 21 sites, spread across 14 suburbs in Melbourne that contain around 40–45 high rises in total. The largest sites contain 4 buildings each; Elizabeth St, Richmond, Atherton Gardens, Fitzroy and Racecourse Rd, Flemington. Other large sites contain 3 buildings; Boundary Rd, North Melbourne and Malvern Rd, Prahran. The high-rise buildings vary between 20–30 storeys in height and come in a variety of shapes, when viewed from the air these appear as; S, T, Y, I, L and C-shape, the most common being the S-shape. The high-rises have become pop-culture icons, being synonymous with ambitious government projects and ideas that become compromised, and are used for various film and photographic work.
