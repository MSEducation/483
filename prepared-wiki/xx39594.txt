==History==

===Curb and The State (1995–2000)===

The band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover band called the "Village Idiots" by Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake, Mike Kroeger, and Brandon Kroeger. The band performed covers of songs from Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Chad Kroeger then asked his step-father to give him $4,000 so that the band could record their first demo, which was Hesher (EP).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/nickelback.html |title=Nickelback – Biography on Bio |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |accessdate=March 28, 2012[/tpl] The band's name originates from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave customers at his job at Starbucks; he would frequently say, "Here's your nickel back."Nickelback: Biography Rolling Stone[tpl]cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/N/Nickelback/2001/10/02/748171.html |title=CANOE – JAM! Music – Artists – Nickelback: First Nickelback CD soars in value |publisher=Jam.canoe.ca |date=October 2, 2001 |accessdate=February 14, 2010[/tpl] Nickelback's first release was a seven-track EP called Hesher in 1996. In the same year, they also recorded their first full-length album Curb. "Fly" was included on both Hesher and Curb and was the first single produced by Nickelback. In 1997, Brandon Kroeger left the band and the band searched for a new drummer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Later that year Mitch Guindon joined the band, but he decided to leave in 1998 because he started working in a car company.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] In Summer 1998, Ryan Vikedal joined the band.
Roadrunner A&R Ron Burman told HitQuarters that one of his West Coast scouts sent him the self-released album and, suitably impressed, he travelled to Vancouver to see them perform live. Although an unknown property in the industry at the time, the venue was packed out. In Burman's words: "I immediately got the chills! I thought their song "Leader of Men" was a smash hit."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2002/April23_2_33_20.html |title=Interview with Ron Burman |publisher=HitQuarters|date=Apr 23, 2002 |accessdate=Nov 19, 2010[/tpl] Off the stage he was impressed by their industry and initiative in managing their career: Despite this, it still took Burman three months for him to convince his label bosses' to approve the signing, a decision that would mark Roadrunner's first move into mainstream rock. Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and Roadrunner Records in 1999.
The State, was released by Nickelback in 2000 by Roadrunner Records and EMI Canada. The State, was released in Europe in 2001. It spawned 4 singles: "Old Enough", "Worthy To Say", "Leader of Men" and "Breathe", the last two being Top 10 rock hits. The album was certified platinum status in 2008, after the success of their later albums.[tpl]cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum – February 14, 2010 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=February 14, 2010[/tpl]  The album entered the Billboard 200 albums charts in position number 130 and peaked at number 3 in the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart.[tpl]cite book|title=awards|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fxEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA55&dq=billboard+nickelback+the+state+september+16+2000+top+independent+albums+chart&hl=en&ei=lt29TtHoN4Hb0QH25dS2BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Billboard Magazine Nickelback |publisher=Billboard Magazine date= |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]

===Silver Side Up, The Long Road (2001–04)===

Around 2001 Chad Kroeger started "studying every piece, everything sonically, everything lyrically, everything musically, chord structure. I would dissect every single song that I would hear on the radio or every song that had ever done well on a chart and I would say, 'Why did this do well?'" Nickelback's single How You Remind Me, Kroeger told Bliss, sold so well because it was about romantic relationships, a universal subject, and contained memorable hooks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/Nickelback.html |title=Nickelback Biography – born, house, time, year, Career, Sidelights, Selected discography, Sources – Newsmakers Cumulation |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |accessdate=November 6, 2011[/tpl]

"We just kinda showed up because we were supposed to give one of these away tonight," Chad Kroeger said after receiving the award. Chad Kroeger added he had thought the Red Hot Chili Peppers would win the award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/Nickelback.html |title=Nickelback Biography – born, house, time, year, Career, Sidelights, Selected discography, Sources – Newsmakers Cumulation |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |accessdate=March 28, 2012[/tpl]
It included appearances by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, who played a guitar solo on the song "Follow You Home" and sang backing vocals on "Rock Star"—and a posthumously sampled appearance by Chad Kroeger's friend Dimebag Darrell from Pantera, culled from guitar outtakes. The band also used more acoustic sound on some songs. "Savin' Me," for instance, included strings and piano as well as guitars. "We were a little scared of using piano," Chad Kroeger said in a biography on the band's website. "We just didn't think it was very rock and roll." But once they heard the result, he added, they liked it. All the Right Reasons had sold over 7 million copies in the US to June 19, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/The_Other_Shore/topic/6818594/1/ |title=A TON of SoundScan sales charts leaked last week |publisher=S15.zetaboards.com |accessdate=May 10, 2011[/tpl]  Aside from all the success of All the Right Reasons, lead singer Kroeger began his own label named 604 Records in 2005 and holds the position of executive producer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/nickelback-announces-2012-north-american-tour |title=Nickelback Announces 2012 North American Tour! |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 28, 2012[/tpl]
