==History==

===Early history===

Jackson Male Academy was founded in 1823 just after West Tennessee was opened for settlement.History | Union University  Only five years earlier in 1818 was the land purchased from the Chickasaw Indians.
In 1907, Dr. T. T. Eaton, a trustee of Southwestern Baptist University, left his 6,000 volume library to the college. Eaton was a former professor of Union University at Murfreesboro, where his father, Dr. Joseph H. Eaton, was a former president.
Southwestern soon changed its name to Union University in honor of the Eatons and others from Union at Murfreesboro who had impacted Southwestern as faculty, administrators, trustees, and contributors.
In 1925 the Tennessee Baptist Convention secured a charter that vested the rights, authority, and property of Union University in the Tennessee Convention.  This charter included the election of the University’s trustees. Two years later, the Convention consolidated Hall-Moody Junior College at Martin (1900–1927) with Union University.
In 1948 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Union University accreditation.
In 1962 Union developed a nursing program with the assistance of Jackson-Madison County General Hospital at the request of local physicians.
