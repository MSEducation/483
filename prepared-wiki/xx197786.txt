Mario Baccini (born Rome, December 14, 1957) is an Italian politician, former member of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats and promoter of the White Rose.
He started his political activity as town councilor in Rome, for the Christian Democracy. In 1994, when DC stopped to exist, he joined the Christian Democratic Centre, which entered the Pole of Freedoms.
In the same year, he became president of CCD parliamentary group at the Chamber of Deputies. Then he was secretary and national co-ordinator of the Christian Democratic Centre. In 2001 he was re-elected at the Parliament; then, in 2002 he joined the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats.
In Berlusconi II Cabinet he was sub-secretary of the Foreign Ministry from 2001 to 2004; later, on December 3, 2004 he was Minister of the Public Function. He was reconfirmed minister in Berlusconi III Cabinet.
From 2006 to 2008 he was vice-president of the Senate.
On January 30, 2008 he left UDC and he founded the movement White Rose with Bruno Tabacci. He was candidated as mayor of Roma, taking just 0.8% of the votes. At Italian general election, the White Rose was in alliance with UDC and other Christian democrats movements into the Union of the Centre, and Baccini was elected to the Chamber of Deputies: he didn't join White Rose's parliamentary group, but rather he adhered to the mixed group.
On May 14, at the Parliament, during the discussion about the motion of confidence to Berlusconi IV Cabinet, he announced to vote the confidence to the Cabinet, leaving the project of the White Rose.
