Herzog once promised to eat his shoe if Errol Morris completed the movie project on pet cemeteries that he had been working on, in order to challenge and motivate Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. In 1978 when the film Gates of Heaven premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a short documentary Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe by Les Blank. At the event, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.
In 2009, Herzog became the only filmmaker in recent history to enter two films in competition in the same year at the prestigious Venice Film Festival. Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans was entered into the festival's official competition schedule, and his My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done? entered the competition as a "surprise film".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSTRE5841N320090905 |title=Filmmaker Herzog is up against himself in Venice | Film |publisher=Reuters |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009[/tpl] Herzog also provided the narration for the short film Plastic Bag directed by Ramin Bahrani which was the opening night film in the Corto Cortissimo section of the festival.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/official_selection/corto_cortissimo/bag.html|title=66th Venice Film Festival Corto Cortissimo[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Film theory==

Herzog's films have received considerable critical acclaim and achieved popularity on the art house circuit. They have also been the subject of controversy in regard to their themes and messages, especially the circumstances surrounding their creation.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] A notable example is Fitzcarraldo, in which the obsessiveness of the central character was reflected by the director during the making of the film. Burden of Dreams, a documentary filmed during the making of Fitzcarraldo, explored the travails that Herzog undertook to make the film in harsh conditions.
His treatment of subjects has been characterized as Wagnerian in its scope, and Fitzcarraldo and his later film Invincible (2001) are directly inspired by opera, or operatic themes. He is proud of never using storyboards and often improvising large parts of the script. He explains this technique in the commentary track to Aguirre, the Wrath of God.

==Collaborations==

Herzog preferred to develop a team to work with, both of actors and technical people. He gathered a group who appeared in numerous films.
