His published works include over 1,700 short stories, novellas, screenplays, comic book scripts, teleplays, essays, a wide range of criticism covering literature, film, television, and print media. He was editor and anthologist for two ground-breaking science fiction anthologies, Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). Ellison has won numerous awards including multiple Hugos, Nebulas and Edgars.

==Early life and career==

Ellison was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (née Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler.(google books) Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2 (Wildside Press LLC, 2010)."Harlan Ellison Biography (1934–)". filmreference.com His Jewish family subsequently moved to Painesville, Ohio but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home, taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, "tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina, short order cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, floorwalker in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House".[tpl]cite book | last = Ellison | first = Harlan | authorlink = | title =Harlan Ellison's "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream": A Study Guide from Gale's "Short Stories for Students" | publisher =The Gale Group | date= July 23, 2002 | location = | page =27 | url =http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-mouthmustscream/bio.html | doi = | id = [/tpl]
Ellison attended Ohio State University for 18 months (1951–53) before being expelled. He has said the expulsion was for hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability, and over the next 20-odd years he sent that professor a copy of every story he published.[ref][tpl]cite journal | last = Levy | first =Michael | authorlink = | title =Books in Review, "Of Stories and the Man." | journal =Science Fiction Studies | volume =29 | issue =Part 3 | pages = | publisher = |date=November 2002 | url =http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/birs/bir88.htm | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2007-01-04 [/tpl]

Ellison published two stories in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, "four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator."Gentleman Junkie, 14
In 1954, Ellison decided to write about youth gangs. To research the issue, he joined a street gang in the Red Hook, Brooklyn,  area, under the alias "Phil 'Cheech' Beldone". His subsequent writings on the subject include the novel Web of the City/Rumble, the collection The Deadly Streets, and part of his memoir Memos from Purgatory.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison was drafted into the United States Army, serving from 1957 to 1959. In 1960, he returned to New York, living at 95 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. After moving to Chicago, Ellison wrote for William Hamling's Rogue magazine. As a book editor at Hamling's Regency Books, Hamling published novels and anthologies by writers such as B. Traven, Kurt Vonnegut, Robert Bloch, Philip José Farmer,  and Clarence Cooper Jr. as well as Ellison.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In the late 1950s, Ellison wrote a number of erotic stories, such as "God Bless the Ugly Virgin" and "Tramp", which were later reprinted in Los Angeles-based girlie magazines. He first used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird in July and August 1957, in two journals, each of which had accepted two of his stories. In each journal, one story was published under the name Harlan Ellison and the other under Cordwainer Bird. Later, as discussed in the Controversy section below, he used the pseudonym when he disagreed with the use or editing of his work.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Hollywood and beyond==

Ellison moved to California in 1962, and subsequently began to sell his writing to Hollywood. He wrote the screenplay for The Oscar, starring Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer. Ellison also sold scripts to many television shows:  The Flying Nun, Burke's Law, Route 66, The Outer Limits, Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Cimarron Strip, and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.
Ellison's screenplay for the Star Trek episode "The City on the Edge of Forever" has been considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series. 
During the late 1960s, Ellison wrote a column about television for the Los Angeles Free Press. Titled "The Glass Teat", the column addressed political and social issues and their portrayal on television at the time. The columns were gathered into two collections, The Glass Teat and The Other Glass Teat.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
He participated in the 1965 Bloody Sunday March from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.[tpl]cite news | last =Salm | first =Arthur | title =Dangerous visions | publisher =San Diego Union-Tribune | date= March 20, 2005 | url =http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20050320-9999-1a20harlan.html | accessdate = 2007-09-03 [/tpl]
In 1966, he married his third wife, Lory Patrick.  The marriage lasted only seven weeks.[tpl]cite book|authors=Ellen Weil and Gary K. Wolfe|title= Harlan Ellison: The Edge of Forever|publisher= Ohio State University Press|year= 2002|page=44[/tpl]
Also in 1966, in an article Esquire magazine would later name as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote about the goings-on around the enigmatic Frank Sinatra. The article, entitled "Frank Sinatra Has a Cold", briefly describes a clash between the young Harlan Ellison and Frank Sinatra, when the crooner took exception to Ellison's boots during a billiards game.  Talese is quoted as saying of the incident, "Sinatra probably forgot about it at once, but Ellison will remember it all his life."http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_
Ellison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios but was fired on his first day after  Roy O. Disney overheard him in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters. Ellison recounted this incident in his book Stalking the Nightmare, as part 3 of an essay titled "The 3 Most Important Things in Life".[tpl]cite web|url=http://harlanellison.com/iwrite/mostimp.htm|title=3.

Ellison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. "'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman" (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" (1967) is an allegory of Hell, where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity; the story was the basis of a 1995 computer game; Ellison participated in the game's design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM. Another story, "A Boy and His Dog", examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, post-apocalyptic world and was made into the 1975 film of the same name, starring Don Johnson.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison edited the influential science fiction anthology Dangerous Visions (1967), for which he commissioned stories accompanied by his commentary-laden biographical sketches of the authors. He challenged the authors to write stories at the edge of the genre. Many of the stories exceeded the traditional boundaries of science fiction pioneered by respected old school editors such as John W. Campbell, Jr. As an editor, Ellison was influenced and inspired by experimentation in the popular literature of the time, such as the beats. A sequel, Again Dangerous Visions, was published in 1972. A third volume, The Last Dangerous Visions, has been repeatedly postponed (see Controversy).[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In 1976, Ellison married his fourth wife, Lori Horowitz. He was 41 and she was 19. He said of the marriage, "I was desperately in love with her, but it was a stupid marriage on my part." They were divorced after eight months.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20092332,00.html|title=Harlan Ellison |accessdate=2011-05-28 |last=McMurran |first= Kristen|work=People Magazine|date=December 2, 1985[/tpl]
Ellison served as creative consultant to the science fiction TV series The Twilight Zone (1980s version) and Babylon 5. As a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), he has voiceover credits for shows including The Pirates of Dark Water, Mother Goose and Grimm, Space Cases, Phantom 2040, and Babylon 5, as well as made an onscreen appearance in the Babylon 5 episode "The Face of the Enemy".[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison has commented on a great many movies and television programs (see The Glass Teat and The Other Glass Teat for television criticism and commentary; see Harlan Ellison's Watching for movie criticism and commentary), both negatively and positively.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
For two years, beginning in 1986, Ellison took over as host of the Friday-night radio program, Hour 25, on Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM, Los Angeles, after the death of Mike Hodel, the show's founder and original host. Ellison had been a frequent and favorite guest on the long-running program. In one episode, he brought in his typewriter and proceeded to write a new short story live on the air (he titled the story "Hitler Painted Roses"). Hour 25 also served as the inspiration for his story, "The Hour That Stretches".[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison's 1992 short story "The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore" was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of The Best American Short Stories.Kennison, Katrina and Erdrich, Louise (editors), The Best American Short Stories 1993, New York, 1993.
In the 1990s, Ellison provided commentary segments for the early Sci-Fi Channel program Sci-Fi Buzz.http://harlanellison.com/buzz/index.htm
Ellison has narrated numerous audiobooks, written by him and by such other authors as Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Jack Williamson, and Terry Pratchett.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison lives in Los Angeles with Susan, his fifth wife, who he married in 1986. In 1994, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
He had his own name trademarked in 2005, registered by The Kilimanjaro Corporation, which Ellison owns, and under which all his work is copyrighted.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Ellison voiced himself as a character on the show Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, in the H. P. Lovecraft-inspired episode "The Shrieking Madness". He later reprised the role in the series finale, Come Undone, which aired in April 2013.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In April 2013, Ellison completed work on a forthcoming episode of The Simpsons, voicing "a scene with Milhouse and the Comic Book Guy".[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Pseudonyms [tpl]anchor|Cordwainer Bird[/tpl]==

Ellison has on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he feels his creative contribution to a project has been mangled beyond repair by others, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also Alan Smithee). The first such work to which he signed the name was "The Price of Doom," an episode of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of Burke's Law ("Who Killed Alex Debbs?") credited to Ellison contains a character given this name, played by Sammy Davis, Jr.
The "Cordwainer Bird" moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, Cordwainer Smith. The origin of the word "cordwainer" is shoemaker (from working with cordovan leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author. Ellison has said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean "a shoemaker for birds". Since he has used the pseudonym mainly for works he wants to distance himself from, it may be understood to mean that "this work is for the birds" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of "the bird" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled "Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto", describing his experience with the Starlost television series).
The Bird moniker has since become a character in one of Ellison's own stories, not without some prompting. In his book Strange Wine, Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jose Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, the Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in The New York Review of Bird, in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York Literary Establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of same.
Other pseudonyms Ellison has used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, and Jay Solo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/s968.htm#A30232 |title=Stories, Listed by Author |publisher=Philsp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl]

==Controversies and disputes==

===Temperament===

Ellison has a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative.Theodore Sturgeon, in his Introduction to "i have no mouth and i must scream", Pyramid Paperback, April, 1967, final paragraph, in which he describes H.E. as: "... a man on the move, and he is moving fast. He is, on these pages and everywhere else he goes, colorful, intrusive, ABRASIVE ... and one hell of a writer." He has generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of Ellison's books described him as "possibly the most contentious person on Earth". Ellison has filed grievances and attempted lawsuits; as part of a dispute about fulfillment of a contract, he once sent 213 bricks to a publisher postage due, followed by a dead gopher via fourth-class mail."alt.fan.harlan-ellison FAQ" Version 1.5.  James Shearhart (jalmatom@wco.com). Archived at HarlanEllison.com. Last modified November 26, 1995. Retrieved 2012-11-17. His friend Isaac Asimov noted "Harlan uses his gifts for colorful and variegated invective on those who irritate him — intrusive fans, obdurate editors, callous publishers, offensive strangers."  Another friend, writer Robert Bloch, spoke at a roast for Ellison, saying that while other people take infinite pains, "Harlan gives them."[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Star Trek===

Ellison has repeatedly criticized how Star Trek creator and producer Gene Roddenberry (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode "The City on the Edge of Forever". Ellison's original work included a subplot involving drug dealing aboard the Enterprise, and other elements that Roddenberry rejected. Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using "Cordwainer Bird" to indicate displeasure (above).
Ellison's original script was first published in the 1976 anthology Six Science Fiction Plays, edited by Roger Elwood. Ellison also novelized the story at that time, for the Star Trek Fotonovel series: The City on the Edge of Forever (Bantam Books, 1977, 0-553-11345-3). In 1995, Borderlands Press published The City on the Edge of Forever (ISBN 1-880325-02-0), with nearly 300 pages, comprising an essay by Ellison, four versions of the teleplay, and eight "Afterwords" contributed by other parties. He greatly expanded the introduction for the paperback edition: Harlan Ellison's The City on the Edge of Forever, White Wolf Publishing, 1996; ISBN 1-56504-964-0. It explains what he called a "fatally inept treatment".
Both versions of the script won prestigious awards: Ellison's original script won the 1968 Writers Guild Award for best episodic drama in television,[tpl]cite web|url=http://librarycatalog.wgfoundation.org/title/titleAwards.ashx?id=2484 |title=Writers Guild Foundation Library Catalog |publisher=wgfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01[/tpl] while the shooting script won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1968-hugo-awards/ |title= 1968 Hugo Awards |publisher=thehugoawards.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-01[/tpl]
[tpl]Wikinews|Harlan Ellison sues CBS-Paramount, WGA over Star Trek royalties[/tpl] On March 13, 2009, Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television, seeking payment of 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison's behalf. On October 23, 2009, Variety magazine reported that a settlement had been reached.[tpl]cite press release |title=ELLISON SUES STAR TREK |date=March 13, 2009 |url=http://harlanellison.com/heboard/visitors/startrekpressrelease.html |accessdate=2009-03-15[/tpl]

===Aggiecon I===

In 1969, Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A&M University's first science fiction convention, Aggiecon, where he reportedly[tpl]cite web|title=Science Fiction/San Francisco|url=http://efanzines.com/SFSF/SFSF30.pdf|date=September 30, 2006|page=5 |accessdate=2008-08-16[/tpl] referred to the university's Corps of Cadets as "... America's next generation of Nazis ...", inspired in part by the continuing Vietnam War. Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the studentry was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison's anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a Denny's because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school's administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year, and no guest of honor was invited for the next two Aggiecons. However, Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for Aggiecon V (1974) and Aggiecon XXXI (2000).[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===The Starlost===

The screenplay for his projected television series The Starlost received a Writers Guild Award, though the actual series, produced in 1973–74, was so altered by the producers that Ellison had his name removed from the credits and replaced with the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird (see above).[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===The Last Dangerous Visions===

The Last Dangerous Visions (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison's anthology series, has become science fiction's most famous unpublished book. It was originally announced for publication in 1973 but remains unpublished. Nearly 150 writers (many now dead) submitted works for the volume. In 1993, Ellison threatened to sue New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing "Himself in Anachron", a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and sold to Ellison for the book by his widow,[tpl]cite journal| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a76.html#worldcon| journal=Ansible| title=ConFrancisco Continued| volume=76|date=November 1993| issn=0265-9816[/tpl] but later reached an amicable settlement.[tpl]cite journal| journal=Ansible| title=Infinitely Improbable| volume=77| url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a77.html#he|date=December 1993| issn=0265-9816[/tpl]
British science fiction author Christopher Priest criticized Ellison's editorial practices in an article entitled "The Book on the Edge of Forever",[tpl]cite book| title=The book on the edge of forever: an enquiry into the non-appearance of Harlan Ellison's The last dangerous visions|oclc=34231805|year=1994|location=Seattle, WA|publisher=Fantagraphics Books| first=Christopher| last=Priest|authorlink=Christopher Priest (novelist)|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XlAFAAAACAAJ|isbn=1-56097-159-2[/tpl] later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish TLDV within a year of the statement. Priest claims he submitted a story at Ellison's request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by "Book on the Edge of Forever" and has, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions since its publication.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/cpriest.html |title=Christopher Priest interview (1995) |publisher=Ansible.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl]

===I, Robot===

Shortly after the release of Star Wars (1977), Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov's I, Robot short story collection for Warner Brothers. In a meeting with studio head Robert Shapiro, Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the "intellectual capacity of an artichoke". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and published in book form.[ref]

===With Connie Willis at Hugo Awards 2006===

On August 26, 2006, during the 64th World Science Fiction Convention, Ellison groped award-winning novelist Connie Willis' breast while on stage at the Hugo Awards ceremony."Sci-Fi Awards Show Marred By Boorish Groping" by Ron Hogan, Galleycat, August 30, 2006.[tpl]cite web| title=Hugo Awards – Harlan and Connie – 2006| url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4653991510586546104| accessdate=2006-09-03| first=Larry| last=Sanderson[/tpl] Ellen Datlow described this as "a schtick of Harlan acting like a baby".Unca Harlan's Art Deco Pavilion: Archives Patrick Nielsen Hayden described this as "pathetic and nasty and sad and most of us didn't want to watch it".Patrick Nielsen Hayden – LAcon IV Ellison responded three days after the event:[tpl]cite web|author=Jen Volant (tacithydra)|url=http://tacithydra.livejournal.com/957.html?format=light |title=tacithydra: GropeGate |publisher=Tacithydra.livejournal.com |date=September 3, 2006 |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl]
 "Nonetheless, despite my only becoming aware of this brouhaha right this moment (12 noon LA time, Tuesday the 29th), three days after the digital spasm that seems to be in uproar ... YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!!
 IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE FOR A MAN TO GRAB A WOMAN'S BREAST WITHOUT HER EXPLICIT PERMISSION. To do otherwise is to go 'way over the line in terms of invasion of someone's personal space. It is crude behavior at best, and actionable behavior at worst. When George W. Bush massaged the back of the neck of that female foreign dignitary (Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel), we were all justly appalled. For me to grab Connie's breast is inexcusable, indefensible, gauche, and properly offensive to any observers or those who heard of it later."
On August 31, he lost his temper with the community and with Willis for not defending him:
 "Does not anyone READ WHAT I WROTE within fifteen minutes of learning of this? Does not anyone wonder why, if it was such a piggish thing I did, as one of those jerkwad blogs calls it, Connie Willis hasn't, after twenty-five years of “friendship,” not returned my call on Monday … or responded to the Fedex packet of my posting here on Monday, which Fedex advises me she received at 2:20 pm on Tuesday?"
 "... am I even a leetle bit entitled to think that Connie likes to play Harlan as infantile schtick, and geez ain't it sad that as long as SHE sets the rules for play, and I'm the village idiot, she's cool ... but gawd forbid I change the rules and play MY way for a change ..."

===Lawsuit against Fantagraphics===

On September 20, 2006, Ellison sued Fantagraphics, a comic book publisher, claiming they had defamed him in their book Comics As Art (We Told You So).Spurgeon, Tom, and Jacob Covey. Comics As Art: We Told You So. Seattle, WA: Fantagraphics, 2006.  ISBN 978-1-56097-738-4 The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, The Comics Journal. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him "bugfuck" and "derange-o". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.[tpl]cite web| title=The Insanity Offense|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/c_platt.html| accessdate=2007-03-01[/tpl]
Ellison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics's website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal.[tpl]cite web| title=Harlan Ellison sues Fantagraphics| url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=413&Itemid=70| accessdate=2007-03-01[/tpl] On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved[tpl]cite web| title=IT IS FINISHED| url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/06/29/it-is-finished/| accessdate=2007-08-01[/tpl] pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website.[tpl]cite web |title=Feud shoe waiting to drop |url=http://comicsbeat.com/feud-shoe-waiting-to-drop/ |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl] No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.[tpl]cite web| title=You Boys Play Nice Now|url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/08/16/you-boys-play-nice-now/| accessdate=2007-08-20[/tpl]

On April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the newsgroup "alt.binaries.e-book" without authorization. The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ, internet service providers who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the "Notice and Takedown Procedure" outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison has initiated legal action and/or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, "If you put your hand in my pocket, you’ll drag back six inches of bloody stump".[tpl]cite news| title=Print Books Are Target of Pirates on the Web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/technology/internet/12digital.html?src=sch| accessdate=2009-05-10 | work=The New York Times | first=Motoko | last=Rich | date=May 12, 2009[/tpl]

==Ellison's self-parody==

At Stephen King's request, Ellison provided a description of himself and his writing in Danse Macabre. "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, `He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely."[tpl]cite news|author=Stephen King|journal= Danse Macabre| title= Chapter 9: Horror Fiction[/tpl]
