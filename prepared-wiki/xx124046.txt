==Life and career==

Joseph Benjamin Hutto was born in Blackville, South Carolina, the fifth of seven children.  His family moved to Augusta, Georgia when Hutto was three years old.  His father, Calvin, was a preacher and Hutto, along with his three brothers and three sisters, formed a gospel group called The Golden Crowns, singing in local churches.  Hutto's father died in 1949, and the family relocated to Chicago.Rowe 1981, p. 114  Hutto served as a draftee in the Korean War in the early 1950s, driving trucks in combat zones.van Rijn 2004, p. 97
In Chicago, Hutto took up the drums and played with Johnny Ferguson and his Twisters.  He also tried the piano before settling on the guitar and playing on the streets with the percussionist Eddie 'Porkchop' Hines.  After adding Joe Custom on second guitar, they started playing club gigs, and harmonica player George Mayweather joined after sitting in with the band.  Hutto named his band The Hawks, after the wind that blows in Chicago.Rowe 1981, p. 114-5  A recording session in 1954 resulted in the release of two singles on the Chance label and a second session later the same year, with the band supplemented by pianist Johnny Jones, produced a third.Ledbitter and Slaven 1987, p. 650
Later in the 1950s Hutto became disenchanted with music, and gave it up after a woman broke his guitar over her husband's head one night in a club where he was performing; during the next eleven years Hutto worked as a janitor in a funeral home to supplement his income.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cascadeblues.org/History/JBHutto.htm |title=J.B.

(2006): The Penguin Guide To Blues Recordings. London: Penguin Books, p. 299, ISBN 978-0-14-051384-4
After Hound Dog Taylor died in 1975, Hutto took over his band the Houserockers for a time, and in the late 1970s he moved to Boston and recruited a new band which he called the New Hawks, with whom he recorded further studio albums for the Varrick label.  His 1983 Varrick album Slippin' & Slidin', the last of his career and later reissued on CD as Rock With Me Tonight, has been described as "near-perfect".
