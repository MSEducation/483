''Aggeni Urbici in Julium Frontinum Commentarius,'' a commentary upon the work ''De Agrorum Qualitate,'' which is ascribed to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus|Frontinus]].  Aggenus' commentary was not well regarded by later writers; [[Karl Lachmann]] called it "the wretched work of some Christian schoolmaster".<ref>[tpl]cite book  | last = Teuffel  | first = Wilhelm Siegmund  | authorlink = Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel  |author2= George Charles Winter Warr (trans.)  | title = History of Roman Literature, Vol. II  | publisher = [[George Bell & Sons]]  | year = 1892  | location = London  | pages = 441  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=7OUdAAAAMAAJ  | doi =   | id =   | isbn = [/tpl]</ref>  The other two works are ''In Julium Frontinum Commentariorum Liber secundus qui Diazographus dicitur''; and ''Commentariorum de Controversiis Agrorum Pars prior et altera''.  The latter of which [[Carsten Niebuhr]] supposes to have been actually been written by [[Sextus Julius Frontinus|Frontinus]], and in the time of [[Domitian]], that is, the end of the 1st century, since the author speaks of "praestantissimus Domitianus," an expression which some feel would be unlikely to have been applied to this tyrant after his death.<ref>''Hist. of Rome,'' vol. ii. p. 621</ref>
