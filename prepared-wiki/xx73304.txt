[tpl]fr icon[/tpl]</ref>  Male marsupilamis have an incredibly long, strong, flexible and prehensile tail which can be used for almost anything.  Female marsupilamis have a much shorter tail, but still long compared to real animals. Unlike the males, the females also walk on the tips of their toes. When the animal rebounds, he makes the noise: "Boing". Males also have eyes that are not completely separate while females have two separate eyes. Female marsupilamis also have a totally different voice than the males. Males say "houba" most of the time, while females say "houbii", which means the same thing as houba, but sounds more feminine. According to the ''L'Encyclopédie du Marsupilami'', they are [[monotremes]] like the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]], which explains why they lay eggs while having [[mammalian]] features.<ref>L'encyclopédie du Marsupilami (1991), Marsu Productions</ref>

==Specimens==

"The Marsupilami" refers originally to the individual captured and then adopted by Spirou and Fantasio, which they never bothered to name because he was the only known specimen. The Spirou et Fantasio album Le nid des Marsupilamis is mostly concerned with a documentary-within-the-comic about the life of a family of marsupilamis still living in the wild in Palombia. The spin-off comics later drawn by Batem star those, and the title of the series now refers to the - also unnamed - father in this family, and not to Spirou's original Marsupilami.
In these series, Marsupilami's wife is referred to as Marsupilamie (a female version of the name) but their three young are named, respectively, Bibi, Bibu and Bobo. Mars le noir (Mars the Black) is another specimen, which first appears in the album Mars le Noir. A former captive marsupilami, he first finds it hard to live again in the forest. After failing to seduce Marsupilamie, he becomes jealous of Marsupilami and nearly gets into a fight with him. Later, he meets a black female marsupilami, named Vénus, who becomes his mate. In Baby Prinz, another specimen, an elderly male who lives in a zoo, is featured. Altogether, that comes to eight specimens in Palombia, plus Spirou and Fantasio's pet. Marsupilamis can come in colours of yellow, yellow with black spots, dark blue, white, white with black spots, and dark blue with yellow spots.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Only the yellow, yellow with black spots and dark blue marsupilami's show up in cartoon.

==Albums==

===Spirou and Fantasio===

These albums of Spirou and Fantasio feature the Marsupilami

===Le Marsupilami===

By the late 1960s, Franquin decided to retire from drawing the Spirou et Fantasio series, which was passed to a new artist, Jean-Claude Fournier. Franquin did not give permission for the character to continue appearing in the series after the first Fournier story, Le faiseur d'or ("The Gold Maker"),Franquin's official site (in French) in which he drew the Marsupilami himself.  Spirou's Marsupilami did not feature in comics after that.
In 1987 however, Franquin launched the Marsupilami series with the new publishing house, Marsu Productions, with Greg and Batem. This series featured the Marsupilami family which had appeared in Le nid des Marsupilamis. Later, Greg abandoned the series, and other collaborators were chosen by Franquin, such as Yann, Fauche and Adam. The first published album of the series is La Queue du Marsupilami. In 2002, an album #0 was published, consisting of short stories featuring the Marsupilami, drawn by Franquin before 1987.  The series, drawn by Batem, has survived André Franquin.

===Disney animation===

Disney's version of the Marsupilami first appeared on television in Raw Toonage in 1992, and was then spun off into his own eponymous show on the CBS network in 1993. Marsupilami's supporting characters included Maurice the gorilla, Stewart the elephant, Eduardo the jaguar, Leonardo the lion, Norman the poacher, and other characters. The original Marsupilami stories by Franquin never encountered a gorilla or elephant, since these species are native to Africa, while the marsupilami in the comic was said to come from South America (However, in the album "Le dictateur et le champignon", the Marsupilami escapes from his cell on a boat with a gorilla). Another change is Marsupilami can speak in difference to his comic counterpart that can only mimic sound like a parrot. In this version, Marsupilami is voiced by Steve Mackall.
Shnookums and Meat was a secondary segment on this show.
There were thirteen episodes in the series, and the series lasted one season. Reruns of the show were aired on The Disney Channel (from October 1994The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 12, no. 6, October/November 1994: pp. 36, 46, 58. to June 1995The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 13, no. 2 (typo in magazine: should be "no. 3"), April/May 1995: pp. 26, 36, 44.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 13, no. 4, June/July 1995: p. 48.), and later on Toon Disney.
Animators Tony Bancroft and Michael Surrey are in the character design ending credits.
