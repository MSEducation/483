==History==

The mountain, and nearby Strawberry Creek, were named by homesteader, Nathan Wills Fisk, "because there were wild strawberries in abundance there..."  It was originally named "Strawberry Butte", but common usage changed it to Strawberry Mountain, which now appears on official maps.[tpl]cite book | last = McArthur | first = Lewis A. | authorlink = | coauthors = Lewis L.
