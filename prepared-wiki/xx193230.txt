The University of Florida Alumni Association is an alumni organization for former students of the University of Florida. It was founded in 1906 by the graduating class of that year and is still around today.

==History==

With those words, the 14 graduates of 1906 established the UF Alumni Association at the close of their commencement ceremony. The first president was W.A. Munsell of Green Cove Springs. At that time, the main purpose of the Alumni Association was to hold annual meetings and social events. Before settling into Emerson Alumni Hall, the Alumni Association offices have had a number of homes on campus, including Thomas Hall, Anderson Hall, Ustler Hall, the basement of the University Auditorium and the Reitz Union (to name just a few). There have been 77 presidents and their role has significantly expanded since they started in 1906.
The University of Florida Alumni Association was organized and chartered in 1906 by the first group of graduates from the Gainesville campus.  They are headquartered at Emerson Alumni Hall in Gainesville, Florida. Today University of Florida alumni on record total nearly 350,000.http://www.ufalumni.ufl.edu/about/ The alumni can be found in every state and in more than 100 foreign countries.  The Alumni Association is responsible for a network of nearly 100 Gator Clubs in Florida, across the U.S. and internationally. These clubs are composed of alumni and friends who represent UF in their communities. They hold a wide variety of programs and events in support of the university. The Alumni Association is also actively involved with the recruitment of superior students to attend the University and with financial assistance programs in the form of scholarships sponsored by the Gator Clubs. In addition, this organization hosts outreach programs that bring faculty and administrators on the road to carry the University's message to alumni and friends.University of Florida Alumni Association History Overall this is one of the largest Alumni Associations within the United States.
