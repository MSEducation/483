[[Canada 2c Large Queen on laid paper]]

CATEGORIES: Postage stamps of Canada

The 2¢ Large Queen on laid paper is the rarest postage stamp of Canada. Printed in 1868, it was not discovered until 1925, and so far only three have been found, all used. Many more could exist as at least one sheet must have been printed, and possibly many sheets, however, they may all have been destroyed or lie unrecognised in stamp collections or on cover.

==Background==

The Large Queens were the first issue by the Dominion of Canada; they are so-called to distinguish them from the 1870 issues (the "Small Queens") which are similar in appearance but physically smaller. The Large Queens were normally printed on wove paper, but the 1¢, 2¢, and 3¢ values were also printed on the less-desirable laid paper. The 1¢ and 3¢ on laid paper were long-known although uncommon.
The Unitrade Specialized Catalogue of Canadian Stamps lists Scott number 32, the 2c Laid Paper Large Queen, at $250,000. The last auction price recorded is US$125,000.[tpl]citation required|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==First copy==

The stamp was first reported in 1925, although many authorities were dubious, and the Scott catalog did not list it until the 1930s.  According to a 2014 BNA Topics First Quarter article by Glenn Archer, the second known example bears a two-ring 5 numeral cancel and was discovered in 1935 in the estate of English stamp dealer JW Westhorpe.  It was later sold in the Firth collection by JN Sissons in 1971.  In 1986, Vancouver stamp dealer Daniel Eaton acquired this 2c Laid Paper from Stanley Gibbons in London and sold it to Los Angeles stamp dealer George Holschauer for $90,000.[tpl]citation required|date=September 2013[/tpl]

==Third copy discovered==

It was announced on 16 July 2013 that the Greene Foundation had issued a certificate of genuineness to a Canada Two Cent Large Queen stamp on laid paper, Scott number 32. This is only the third known copy of this stamp and the first copy seen since the two existing copies were expertized in 1935 by the Royal Philatelic Society London.Special Announcement Vincent Graves Greene Philatelic Research Foundation, 16 July 2013. Retrieved 28 September 2013. Archived here. According to a cover story in Canadian Stamp News, the third 2c Laid Paper was found in an American Philatelic Society salesbook and purchased for less than $5.
A 2014 First Quarter BNA Topics article, however, states that the price was $60 and the purchaser was American collector Michael D. Smith. The stamp is creased and torn and bears an 1870 "Hamilton C W" (Canada West) cancel. The stamp will be offered for sale at auction by Gary Lyon in October 2014.
