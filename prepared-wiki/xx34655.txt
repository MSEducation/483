CATEGORIES: Locations in Hindu mythology, Hindu cosmology

In Hinduism, Brahmapura is the abode of Brahma, one of the three Trimurti. It is located on Mount Meru. It is also referred to as Brahmaloka or Satyaloka in all of the puranas. Brahmapura is the topmost loka within this material universe.

==Upanishads, Advaita==

In the Puranas, and already in the Atharvaveda, there are fourteen worlds, seven higher ones (vyahrtis) and seven lower ones (patalas), viz. bhuu, bhuvas, svar, mahas, janas, tapas, and 'satya' above and atala, vitala, sutala, rasaataala, talatala, mahaatala, patala and naraka below.
  During each pralaya, the lower ten realms (loka) are destroyed B. K. Chaturvedi (2004). Shiv Purana. Diamond Pocket Books. p. 124. ISBN 8171827217 while the higher four realms, including Satya-loka, Tapa-loka, Jana-loka, and Mahar-loka are preserved. During each Mahapralaya, all 14 realms are destroyed. 
The Chāndogya Upaniṣad says in 8:1:1http://ishwar.com/hinduism/holy_upanishads/chhandogya_upanishad/part_08.html that within the Brahmapura "is an abode, a small 
lotus-flower within which is a small space (antarakasa). What is within that, should be searched 
out; that, assuredly, is what one should desire to understand."
  Further there are  Hiranyapura http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03172.htm  Hiranyapura(golden city) and Siddhapurahttp://www.experiencefestival.com/siddhapura or White Island.

==Trimurti==

Brahma loka, Vaikuntha loka(Vishnu), Shiva loka are seen as the same and form together the highest loka (dimension) of the 14 lokas. 'Satya loka' is at their top and can be looked at as the lowest plane of  Para Brahman.  Narayana is also venerated as Para Brahman and therefore to pervade all the 14 lokas and the entire Brahmanda (Universe) which includes both manifested (planets, stars, galaxies, black holes, etc. which constitute 25% of the Universe) and unmanifested (the unknown dark matter which constitutes 75%) energy. Lord Vishnu who is said to live in Vaikuntha is a finite form of the infinite formless, timeless Narayana.
