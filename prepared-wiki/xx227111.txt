The company's main source of growth has been complete takeovers (it holds no stakes in other companies) of smaller trucking companies (35 since 1992) which are then made into subsidiaries, though more recently organic growth contributed to the 53% rise in freight in the first half of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.todaystrucking.com/newscenter.cfm?pageaction=story&intNewsCenterID=1&intDocID=24521&CFID=1769628&CFTOKEN=87485173|title=TransCoreâ€™s freight index continues to rise above 2009|date=2010-08-20[/tpl]  In December 2010 Transforce will enter the US market when it agreed in prinicple to purchase Dallas based Dynamex with a $248 million takeover offer.  In the 12 months leading up to October 31, 2010 Dynamex made $418 million in revenue (about a quarter as much as Transforce). .
