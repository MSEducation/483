[[Swart gevaar]]

CATEGORIES: History of South Africa, Apartheid in South Africa

Swart gevaar (Afrikaans for black threat) was a term used during the days of the Apartheid South African regime to refer to the perceived security threat of the majority black, African population to the white South African government.
In the early days of post-Apartheid South Africa, the term was expanded to refer to a cultural 'black threat', in which many white Afrikaners feared their culture would be lost if they assimilated with the rest of black South Africans.
