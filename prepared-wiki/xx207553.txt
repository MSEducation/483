Harston was a railway station on the Hitchin-Cambridge Line, which served the village of Harston in Cambridgeshire. The station opened on 1 April 1852, and closed on 17 June 1963.[tpl]cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |id=R508 |page=114 [/tpl] A small part of the former northbound platform remains in situ but otherwise all remains of the station have gone. However, the Hitchin-Cambridge Line, which formerly served the station, remains an increasingly busy commuter line connecting the East Coast Main Line to the West Anglia Main Line.
