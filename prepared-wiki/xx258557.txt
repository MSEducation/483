Perugia railway station, also known as Perugia Fontivegge railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Perugia; Stazione di Perugia Fontivegge[/tpl]) is the main station serving the city and comune of Perugia, in the region of Umbria, central Italy.  Opened in 1866, it forms part of the Foligno–Terontola railway, which also links Florence with Rome.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni.  Train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia.  Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.
Regional train services calling at the station are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia.

==Location==

Perugia railway station is situated at Piazza Vittorio Veneto, in the heavily populated district of Fontivegge, about [tpl]convert|3|km[/tpl] southwest of the city centre.

==History==

The station was opened on 12 December 1866, upon the inauguration of the Ellera Corciano–Ponte San Giovanni section of the Foligno–Terontola railway.[tpl]cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=Trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]

==Features==

===Buildings===

The passenger building is a large structure built on three levels.  Only the ground floor is accessible to travellers, through a main entrance below three large arches.  Adjacent to the main building are two other buildings arranged symmetrically on a single plane.
Inside the entrance to the passenger building is a ticket office.  This room is very large. In its middle are four substantial columns, supporting a high ceiling.  Dividing the ticket hall from the station yard are three blue and green glass doors.
The waiting room is also very large.  It has beautiful wooden benches, which, although antique, are still in very good condition.
Passengers inside the building can also admire a sculpture from Roman times in honor of the sacrifice of Perugia in the war against Hannibal.  Above the sculpture are modern style mosaic pictorial maps of Umbria and Perugia.
Extending from the passenger building are several small buildings, including a modern building housing the RFI technical offices.
On the opposite side of the station yard from the passenger building is what remains of the now disused goods yard; it has a brick warehouse very similar in style to its counterparts at other Italian stations.
 

===Station yard===

The station yard has four through tracks.  Only the second track is used for through trains stopping at the station.  All of the others are used for overtaking, or for originating or terminating trains.
Each of the tracks is equipped with a platform and most have a concrete shelter.  The one exception is covered instead by a wrought iron canopy. On all platforms, there are light panels displaying the destination, type and time of departure of the train that is stopped or will be stopping at that platform. All platforms are connected by an underpass.
Until recently there was also a fifth track, but this was dismantled because it was little used.
In the former goods yard there are some free tracks and an electrification dock, all of which serve today for the storage of disused or out of service carriages and line maintenance equipment.
 

==Passenger and train movements==

The station has about three million passenger movements each year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centostazioni.it/flussi.html |title=Flussi Annui nelle 103 Stazioni|trans_title=Annual flows at the 103 stations|author= |date= |work=Centostazioni website |publisher=Centostazioni |accessdate=4 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
Passenger trains are mainly regional rail services, with occasional InterCity trains to Milan and Eurostar trains.   Regional services are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia.  InterCity and long distance services are operated by Trenitalia itself.
About 50 trains call at the station each day.  Their main destinations are Firenze Santa Maria Novella, Terontola-Cortona, Foligno and Roma Termini.
Goods services have long since ceased.

==Interchange==

The station has several underground car parks, a bus station and, about [tpl]convert|100|m[/tpl] along a path, a stop for the new Perugia Minimetrò.
