CATEGORIES: Solute carrier family

Thiamine transporter 2 (ThTr-2), also known as solute carrier family 19 member 3, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SLC19A3 gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: solute carrier family 19| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=80704| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Eudy JD, Spiegelstein O, Barber RC, Wlodarczyk BJ, Talbot J, Finnell RH | title = Identification and characterization of the human and mouse SLC19A3 gene: a novel member of the reduced folate family of micronutrient transporter genes | journal = Mol.

==Function==

ThTr-2 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane thiamine transporter that lacks folate transport activity.
It is specifically inhibited by chloroquine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Huang Z, Srinivasan S, Zhang J, Chen K, Li Y, Li W, Quiocho FA, Pan X | title = Discovering thiamine transporters as targets of chloroquine using a novel functional genomics strategy | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = e1003083 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23209439 | pmc = 3510038 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003083 [/tpl]

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in this gene cause biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease (BBGD); a recessive disorder manifested in childhood that progresses to chronic encephalopathy, dystonia, quadriparesis, and death if untreated. Patients with BBGD have bilateral necrosis in the head of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Administration of high doses of biotin in the early progression of the disorder eliminates pathological symptoms while delayed treatment results in residual paraparesis, mild mental retardation, or dystonia. Administration of thiamine is ineffective in the treatment of this disorder. Experiments have failed to show that this protein can transport biotin. Mutations in this gene also cause a Wernicke's-like encephalopathy.
