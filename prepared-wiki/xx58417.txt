==Overview==

A block is a set of pulleys or "sheaves" mounted on a single axle.  The assembly of two blocks with a rope threaded through the pulleys is called tackle.  A block and tackle system amplifies the tension force in the rope to lift heavy loads.  They are common on boats and sailing ships, where tasks are often performed manually.

==Mechanical advantage==

If frictional losses are neglected, the mechanical advantage of a block and tackle is equal to the number of parts in the line that either attach to or run through the moving block -- in other words, the number of supporting ropes.  The formula is derived using virtual work in detail in the article "mechanical advantage".
An ideal block and tackle with a moving block supported by n rope sections has the mechanical advantage,
where FA is the hauling, or input, force and FB is the load.
The mechanical advantage of a tackle dictates how much easier it is to haul or lift the load. A double tackle has a mechanical advantage of 4, so it will be able to lift a 100 N load with only 25 N of tension on the hauling part of the line.
Ideal mechanical advantage correlates directly with velocity ratio.  The velocity ratio of a tackle refers to the relative velocities of the hauling line to the hauled load.  A line with a mechanical advantage of 4 has a velocity ratio of 4:1.  In other words, to raise a load at 1 metre per second, the hauling part of the rope must be pulled at 4 metres per second. Therefore the mechanical advantage of a double tackle is 4.

==Example Block and Tackle Configurations==

Notice that there are two parts of the rope through each pulley in a block, and an additional part for the start of the rope that is attached to one of the blocks.  If there are p pulleys in each of the blocks then there are 2p parts for one block and 2p+1 for the other block.  This means if the block with the rope attachment is selected for the moving block, then the mechanical advantage is increased by one.  This configuration requires the hauling rope to move in the same direction as the load.
The Gun tackle, Double tackle and Threefold purchase have the same number of pulleys in both blocks, one, two and three, respectively.
For example, consider a block and tackle with two sheaves on both the moving block and the fixed block.  One block has four lines running through its sheaves, and the other block also has four lines including the part of the line being pulled or hauled, with a fifth line attached to a secure point on the block.  If the hauling part is coming out of the fixed block, the block and tackle will have a mechanical advantage of four.  If the tackle is reversed, so that the hauling part is coming from the moving block, the mechanical advantage is now five.
In the diagram on the right the mechanical advantage of the tackles shown is as follows:
