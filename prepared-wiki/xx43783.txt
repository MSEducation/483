Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the Castor plant (Ricinus communis).Alfred Thomas "Fats and Fatty Oils" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.

==Composition==

Castor oil is famous as a source of ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid.  Among fatty acids, ricinoleic acid is unusual in that it has a hydroxyl functional group on the 12th carbon.  This functional group causes ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats.  The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils. Because of its ricinoleic acid content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than other seed oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90 per kilogram (US$0.41 per pound)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.castorworld.com/market.asp|title= July 2007 commodity price for Indian castor oil|accessdate=2008-08-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower and canola oilseeds sold for about US$0.30 per kilogram (US$0.14 per pound).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/oilseeds/circular/2007/July/oilseedsfull0707.pdf|title=Seed oil prices from US Dept. of Agriculture, see page 31|accessdate=2008-08-10|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Ricin===

The castor seed contains ricin, a toxic protein. Heating during the oil extraction process denatures and inactivates the protein. However, harvesting castor beans may not be without risk.[ref]
