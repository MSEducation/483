[tpl]Gluck operas[/tpl]Le cinesi (The Chinese Women) is an opera in one act, with music composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck.  The Italian-language libretto was by Pietro Metastasio, and he described it as a componimento drammatico. This libretto had first been set by Antonio Caldara in 1735.  For Gluck's rework, the piece is often considered as an azione teatrale, even though Metastasio and the composer both retained the original designation. The work was first performed for the Austrian royal family at the Vienna Schlosshof on 24 September 1754, on the occasion of the visit of the Empress Maria Theresa to the household of Saxe-Hildburghausen.Howard, Patricia, "Music in London: Opera - Le cinesi" (September 1984).  The Musical Times, 125 (1699): pp. 515-517.
Max Loppert has commented on Gluck's relationship with the Austrian royal family and its bearings on this work.Loppert, Max, "Gluck's Chinese Ladies: An Introduction" (June 1984).  The Musical Times, 125 (1696): pp. 321-323, 325.  The work has also been characterized as a satire on then-contemporary opera conventions.Monelle, Raymond, Review of Les Fêtes théâtrales de Métastase à la cour de Vienne (1731-1767) by Jacques Joly (January 1980).
