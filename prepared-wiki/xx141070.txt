[[L.E.O.]]

CATEGORIES: American rock music groups

L.E.O. is an Electric Light Orchestra-style music project of a number of musicians.  Spawned by an on-stage cover of ELO's "Telephone Line" by lead singer-songwriter Bleu and Mike Viola, it quickly produced an entire album of original songs similar in style to 1970s AM radio pop music.
The project is mostly the brainchild of Bleu, but also features major contributions from Matt Mahaffey of Self, Andy Sturmer of Jellyfish, Hanson, Mike Viola, and members of Chicago.  Their album, Alpacas Orgling, was released in October 2006.
