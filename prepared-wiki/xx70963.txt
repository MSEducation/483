Dominion Stores was once a national chain of supermarkets in Canada, which was still known as the Dominion of Canada at the time of the company's founding. The chain was founded in 1919 in Ontario and was later acquired by the Argus Corporation. It was later sold to The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P), which ultimately restricted the chain to the Greater Toronto Area, with stores outside Ontario sold to third parties. A&P's Canadian division was later acquired by Metro Inc., which rebranded the remaining Dominion stores to its namesake banner in 2008.

==History==

Dominion store started from one Toronto store on May 23, 1919. The store was founded by American businessmen Robert Jackson of New Hampshire and William J. Pentland of Connecticut.[tpl]cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2010/04/historicist_mainly_because_of_the_meat_and_more.php|title=Historicist: Mainly Because of the Meat and More|last=Bradburn|first=Jamie|date=April 17, 2010|work=Torontoist|accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl] Pentland was manager of A&P stores in Connecticut and was hired by Jackson. By the end of 1919 they had a 20 store chain with 18 acquired from rival Loblaws and 61 stores a year later. In 1929 it tried to acquire a stake in Loblaws, but the stock market crashed ended the growth. During the Depression, Dominion lost both founders: Jackson went bankrupt and Pentland was killed in an auto accident in 1933.
Dominion's leadership was not resolved until 1939, when J. William Horsey became president. He in turn sold Dominion Stores to Argus Corporation. Smaller stores were consolidated from 574 to 195 by 1954. In the 1950s, Dominion began to build large stores with airy ceilings and large glass fronts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2007/07/vintage_toronto_21.php|title=Vintage Toronto Ad: Space-Age Grocery Shopping|last=Bradburn|first=Jamie|date=July 3, 2007|work=Torontoist|accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl] The chain also expanded beyond Toronto to other parts of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Newfoundland.
Dominion Stores was acquired by A&P's Canadian division, A&P Canada, from Hollinger in 1985. In the 1990s A&P subsequently re-branded all of its stores in the Greater Toronto Area as Dominion stores (absorbing Miracle Food Mart), while Dominion locations elsewhere in Ontario took the A&P or Food Basics name.
The territory of Dominion stores was approximately the following: Toronto; York Region, excluding Stouffville; Mississauga and Oakville; and Pickering and Ajax.
In northwestern Ontario, Safeway acquired at least two stores in Thunder Bay. (Safeway's presence in Thunder Bay prevents Metro from offering Air Miles at its Thunder Bay locations.)
In Western Canada, Dominion stores were closed, leaving many suburban shopping malls scrambling to fill large, now-vacant sections. This event, coupled with the subsequent collapse of several department store chains, sparked a wave of mall renovations in many parts of the country.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Alberta stores were acquired by Safeway in the late 1960s.
The remainder of the chain in eastern Canada was acquired by Loblaw Companies, through several unrelated transactions:

A&P initially retained a minority ownership share of the combined company.
On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it would invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner. Over a period of 15 months, all stores were converted to the Metro name, beginning with the Dominion stores in the Toronto area.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2008/08/07/metro.html|title=Metro to dump A&P, Dominion names|date=7 August 2008|work=CBC.ca|accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl]
Dominion's distribution centres in Toronto and Mississauga retained the old Dominion banner until 2009.
