The degu (Octodon degus, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|ɡ|uː[/tpl]) is a small caviomorph rodent that is endemic to the Chilean matorral ecoregion of central Chile. C. Michael Hogan & World Wildlife Fund. 2013.

It is sometimes referred to as the brush-tailed rat, and is also called the common degu, to distinguish it from the other members of the genus Octodon. Other members are also called degus, but they are distinguished by additional names. The name "degu" on its own, however, indicates either the genus Octodon or, more usually, O. degus. Degus are in the parvorder Caviomorpha of the infraorder Hystricognathi, along with the chinchilla and guinea pig. The word degu comes from the Mapudungun dewü (mouse, rat).[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |title=Diccionario Mapuche: Mapudungun/Español, Español/Mapudungun |language=Spanish |edition=2nd |year=2006 |editor=Muñoz Urrutia, Rafael |location=Santiago, Chile |isbn=956-8287-99-X |pages=104, 105, 141 |publisher=Editorial Centro Gráfico[/tpl]

==Description==

The degu is a small animal with a body length of [tpl]convert|25.0|to(-)|31.0|cm|in[/tpl] and a weight of [tpl]convert|170|to|300|g|oz[/tpl]. It has yellow-brown fur above and creamy-yellow below, with yellow around the eyes and a paler band around the neck. It has a long, thin tail with a tufted black tip, dark sparsely-furred ears, and pale grey toes. Its fifth toe is small with a nail, rather than a claw, on the forefeet. Its hindfeet are bristled. Its cheek teeth are shaped like figures-of-eight, hence the degu's genus name "Octodon".

==Social behavior==

Degus are highly social. They live in burrows, and, by digging communally, they are able to construct larger and more elaborate burrows than they could on their own.[tpl]Citation|last=Ebensperger| first=L.

Unlike some other octodontids, degus are diurnal[tpl]Citation| last=Kenagy| first=G.| last2=Nespolo| first2=R.| last3=Vasquez| first3=R.| last4=Bozinovic| first4=F.| year=2002| title=Daily and seasonal limits of time and temperature to activity of degus| journal=Revista Chilena de Historia Natural| volume=75| pages=567–581| doi=10.4067/S0716-078X2002000300008| issn=0716-078X| issue=3[/tpl] (active during the day), and they have good vision. Their retinas include rod cells and two types of cone cells, corresponding to peak sensitivity in the green and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.[tpl]Citation| last=Cha'vez| first=A.| last2=Bozinovic| first2=F.| last3=Peich| first3=F.| last4=Palacios| first4=A.| year=2003| title=Retinal spectral sensitivity, fur coloration and urine reflectance in the genus Octodon (Rodentia): Implications for visual ecology| journal=IOVS| volume=44| pages=2290–2296| doi=10.1167/iovs.02-0670| issue=5[/tpl] Behavioral experiments have shown that degus are able to discriminate ultraviolet light from the wavelengths visible to humans; it is likely that this ultraviolet sensitivity has a social function, since both their ventral (stomach) fur and their urine are highly UV reflective.[tpl]Citation| last=Palacios| first=A.| last2=Bozinovic| first2=F.| year=2003| title=An "enactive" approach to ingtegrative and comparative biology: Thoughts on the table| journal=Biol Res.| volume=36| pages=101–105| doi=10.4067/S0716-97602003000100008| issn=0716-9760| pmid=12795209| issue=1[/tpl]

==Diet==

Degus are strictly herbivorous, in the wild feeding on grasses and browsing the leaves of shrubs, though they will also take seeds.[tpl]Citation| last=Bozinovic| first=F.| last2=Gallardo| first2=P.A.| last3=Visser| first3=G.H.| last4=Cortés| first4=A.| year=2003| title=Seasonal acclimatization in water flux rate, urine osmolality and kidney water channels in free-living degus: Molecular mechanisms, physiological processes and ecological implications| journal=J Exp Biol.| volume=206| pages=2959–2966| doi=10.1242/jeb.00509| pmid=12878664| issue=Pt 17[/tpl] Throughout much of the year forage is dried and so degus are specially adapted to a very high fibre intake,[tpl]Citation| last=Langer| first=P.| year=2002| title=The digestive tract and life history of small mammals| journal=Mammal Review| volume=32| pages=107–131| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2002.00101.x|issue=2[/tpl] and this varies between food types and environmental conditions.[tpl]Citation| last=Gutiérrez| first=J.| last2=Bozinovic| first2=F.| year=1998| title=Diet selection in captivity by a generalist herbivorous rodent (Octodon degus) from the Chilean costal desert| journal=Journal of Arid Environments| volume=39| pages=601–607| doi=10.1006/jare.1998.0412| issue=4[/tpl] Like some other herbivores such as rabbits, they perform coprophagy (faecal reingestion) so as to extract more nutrition from their diet.[tpl]Citation| last=Kenagy| first=G.| last2=Veloso| first2=C.| last3=Bozinovic| first3=F.| year=1999| title=Daily rhythms of food intake and feces reingestion in the degu, an herbivorous Chilean rodent: Optimizing digestion through coprophagy| journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology| volume=72| pages=78–86| doi=10.1086/316644| pmid=9882606| issue=1[/tpl] This also serves to maintain healthy gut function during times when food is scarce. Although they are active by day, in high summer they do not leave their burrows in the middle of the day and instead emerge to forage in the mornings and evenings. 
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of degu physiology is their intolerance of dietary sugar. Degus have been found to have a divergent insulin structure (one of the hormones that regulates blood glucose level) and so are highly susceptible to developing diabetes mellitus when fed regularly on a diet containing free sugars.[tpl]Citation| last=Opazo| first=J.C.| last2=Soto-Gamboa| first2=M.| last3=Bozinovic| first3=F.| year=2004| title=Blood glucose concentration in caviomorph rodents| journal=Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A.| volume= 137| pages= 57=64| doi=10.1016/j.cbpb.2003.09.007[/tpl] This is thought to be due to evolutionary pressure arising from the lack of availability of free sugars in the degu's natural environment.[tpl]Citation| last=Nishi| first=M.| last2=Steiner| first2=D.| year=2003| title=Cloning of complementary DNA's encoding islet amyloid polypeptide, insulin, and glucagon precursors from a New World rodent, the degu, Octodon degus| journal=Molecular Endocrinology| volume=4| pages=1192–8| doi=10.1210/mend-4-8-1192| pmid=2293024| issue=8[/tpl] Because of this, the ingredients of non-degu specific hard feed formulations given to captive degus should be checked for free-sugar substances, such as molasses, honey and glucose syrup.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Research subjects==

Degus entered the research spotlight due to their unique relationship with sugar and diabetes, but are also studied for a wide variety of other reasons.
Neuroscientists at the Riken Institute in Tokyo, Japan, used degus for research into tool use in animals with good eye-and-paw coordination, in which they spontaneously learned to use a tiny rake to retrieve out-of-reach seeds. Degus have also been found to spontaneously stack objects in order of decreasing size.[tpl]Citation| last=Tokimoto| first=N.| last2=Okanoya| first2=K.| year=2004| title=Spontaneous construction of "Chinese boxes" by degus (Octodon degus): A rudiment of recursive intelligence?| journal=Japanese Psychological Research| volume=46| pages=255–261| doi=10.1111/j.1468-5584.2004.00257.x| issue=3[/tpl] In both cases it is the first time these behaviours have been recorded in animals other than apes and birds.
Another interesting area of degu research is circadian rhythm function, i.e. the ability of the brain to tell what time of day it is. Degus have the ability to show both diurnal and nocturnal rhythms if the environment permits,[tpl]Citation| last2=Edgar| first2=D. M.| last=Kas| first=M. J.

Degus can take cues that do not relate to day length, such as temperature,[tpl]Citation| last=Kas| first=M.J.| last2=Edgar| first2=D.M.| year=1998| title=Crepuscular rhythms of EEG sleep-wake in a hystricomorph rodent, Octodon degus| journal=J.

Degus are also invaluable in development and aging studies. Research has shown that separation anxiety caused by separating pups from their mother from an early age for periods of half an hour or more can cause developmental and behavioural changes in later life, similar to ADHD in humans.[tpl]Citation| last=Zehle| first=S.| last2=Bock| first2=J.| last3=Jezierski| first3=G.| last4=Gruss| first4=M.| last5=Braun| first5=K.| year=2007| title=Methylphenidate treatment recovers stress-induced elevated dendritic spine densities in the rodent dorsal anterior cingulate cortex| journal=Dev.

==Pets==

After initial interest into degus as research subjects, degus have become popular as pets, though until very recently they were seldom found in pet shops. Their advantages over traditional small pets are their diurnal habits, bubbly personalities, the haired tail (as compared to rats and mice) and their lifespan: they are reported to live up to 13 years under ideal circumstances (though a poor gene pool/genetic background often reduces a pet degu's lifespan significantly).[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] The average lifespan of a degu in captivity is typically around 6–8 years of age. One disadvantage of the degu as a pet is their predisposition to chewing, due to their continually growing incisor and molar teeth. For this reason degus cannot be housed in plastic-bottomed cages typically found in pet stores. A metal cage with multiple levels made for rats and secured double latches works best.  It is important to line the levels with grass mats or a soft fabric so that the degus do not get bumblefoot.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Untamed degus, as with most small animals, can be prone to biting, but their intelligence makes them easy to tame. Regular non-predatory handling and food offerings help with this transition. It is important never to try to catch a degu by the tail because it will fall off easily and is painful to the creature. If this occurs it will not grow back. Degus often 'groom' their human owners, by a gentle nibbling action, and readily bond with any person spending time with them. Degus need regular sand baths to keep their coats healthy and free from grease. Chinchilla sand is ideal for this. They should have access to this regularly, preferably two or three times a week, half an hour at a time. Daily sandbathing can make their coats soiled.

===Legal status===

Some jurisdictions consider degus as a potential invasive species and forbid owning them as a pet. In the United States, they are illegal to own in California, Georgia, and Alaska.http://degucage.com/where-are-degus-legal/ In Canada they are illegal to own in Newfoundland and Labrador. They are completely illegal in New Zealand.http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080905164302AAjFqrw
