The Kamloops Rockets were a Tier II Junior "A" ice hockey team from Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. They were a part of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League.

==History==

Founded in 1961, the Rockets won the first three straight league titles and two British Columbia titles winning the Mowat Cup.  They won the league again in 1966 and 1971.  In 1973, the team was relocated to White Rock as Kamloops was granted a team in the Western Canada Hockey League called the Kamloops Chiefs.  The town got another Tier II Junior "A" club in 1976, and the WCHL team folded that same year.  In 1980, the team merged with the Revelstoke Bruins and moved to Revelstoke, British Columbia.  In 1981, the Kamloops Jr. Oilers were founded and have continued on as the successful Kamloops Blazers ever since.
