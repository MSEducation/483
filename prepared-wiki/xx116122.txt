CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods of Bogotá

Rosales is a quarter of Bogotá, localized in city district Chapinero.

==Economy and Culture==

Rosales is a wealthy neighborhood in Bogotá, Colombia, specifically within the Chapinero district. The neighborhood is sprawling with beautiful, red brick highrises that creep up from Bogotá's principal artery, Carrera Septima (7th Ave), to the winding highway, La Circunvalar, that connects downtown Bogotá to the North at Carrera Septima and Calle 94 (94th St). The perimeters of the neighborhood are roughly Calle 68-98 (North-South) and Carrera 7-1Este (West-East).
The neighorhood was home to many affluent large homes until the late 1970s when families began selling their estates to make a large sum on multi-family dwellings.  The large, red-brick highrises offered high class Bogotanos with better security and a residence that was easier to maintain.
Rosales is home to many embassies as it has easy access to both the North and Downtown Bogotá with its proximity to Carrera Septima and La Circunvalar.
Another asset of Rosales is numerous parks and creeks that flow down from the Andean mountains.  These creeks add fresh scent and relaxing sound to the sometimes hectic city of Bogotá.

===Points of interest===

There are several parks which have natural streams sourced from the mountains, such as Quebradas de Rosales and Alameda de Quebrada Vieja, both of which are frequently used for leisure activities.

===Transportation===

Carrera Séptima y la Avenida Chile provide access to public transport. Other important streets are Carreras Quinta, Cuarta and the Avenida Circunvalar.
