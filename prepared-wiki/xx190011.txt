[[Master of Paradise]]

CATEGORIES: Tony MacAlpine albums, 1999 albums, Shrapnel Records albums

Master of Paradise is the ninth studio album by guitarist Tony MacAlpine, released on November 2, 1999 through Shrapnel Records. This album marks the first (and so far only) time MacAlpine himself has provided vocals on any of his releases, as all but two of the tracks contain singing; the final two being instrumental. Early pressings suffered from a mastering error, which resulted in the overall volume being very low.MacAlpine, Tony. "Session Notes: Master Of Paradise". tonymacalpine.com. Archived from the original on 2008-08-28. Retrieved 2013-08-08. This was corrected on later pressings, but yet another manufacturing error arose afterwards which remained uncorrected, this time involving the track listing: the order was printed incorrectly on the back cover, along with an image of MacAlpine mistakenly reversed to show him playing a left-handed guitar."Tony MacAlpine - Master Of Paradise Images".
