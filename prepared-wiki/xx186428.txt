[[Prydonian Academy]]

CATEGORIES: Doctor Who locations

The Prydonian Academy is a fictional institution in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was located on the slopes of Mount Cadon, near the Citadel, on the Doctor's home planet Gallifrey.
Prydon was one chapter, or college, of several in the Time Lord society that had its own Time Academy, and its colours were scarlet and orange. The Doctor graduated from the Prydonian Academy some time before he left Gallifrey and started travelling time and space in a stolen Type 40 Time Travel Capsule together with his granddaughter Susan. Other Time Lords who attended the Prydonian Academy include Drax, Goth, Borusa, The Master, and The Rani.
