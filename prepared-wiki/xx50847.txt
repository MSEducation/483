The Rochester Rattlers are a Major League Lacrosse (MLL) professional men's field lacrosse team based in Rochester, New York. They are a charter member of the MLL. From their inaugural season in 2001 to 2005, they were in the National Division. From 2006 to 2008, they were a member of the Eastern Conference.
After the 2008 season, the team was dissolved. The Rattlers' staff and roster was transferred to the new Toronto Nationals franchise; however, the history, colors, and name of the Rattlers franchise remained in Rochester so that they could be used for a future MLL team.  On November 23, 2010, the Chicago Machine officially announced they would move to Rochester and resume play in 2011 under the Rochester Rattlers name.
