Toshimaru Nakamura is a Japanese musician, active in free improvisation and Japanese onkyo.
He began his career playing rock and roll guitar, but gradually explored other types of music, even abandoning guitar and started working on circuit bending. He uses a mixing console as a live, interactive musical instrument: "Nakamura plays the 'no-input mixing board', connecting the input of the board to the output, then manipulating the resultant audio feedback."http://www.shef.ac.uk/~ps/efi/labels/erstwhil/erst013.htmlTodd S. Jenkins (2004). Free jazz and free improvisation, p.250. ISBN 0-313-29881-5. "His principal tool is his 'no-input' mixing board used to create feedback and tiny electronic sounds that are amplified tremendously."
Nakamura's music has been described as "sounds ranging from piercing high tones and shimmering whistles to galumphing, crackle-spattered bass patterns."http://www.furious.com/perfect/toshimarunakamura.html
He founded an ensemble A Paragon of Beauty in 1992.
Nakamura has recorded solo albums and has worked as a session musician, collaboration with Otomo Yoshihide, Keith Rowe, John Butcher, and Nicholas Bussmann among others. He has also collaborated with Taku Sugimoto, Tetuzi Akiyama, dancer Kim Ito, drummer Jason Kahn, and Sachiko M, "a kindred spirit".
