CATEGORIES: Specific letter-diacritic combinations

[tpl]Unicode|À, à[/tpl] (a-grave) is a letter of the Catalan, French, Galician, Italian, Portuguese, Scottish Gaelic, Vietnamese, and Welsh languages consisting of the letter A of the ISO basic Latin alphabet and a grave accent. À is also used in Pinyin transliteration. In most languages, it represents the vowel a. This letter is also a letter in Taos.
When denoting quantity, à means "each", e.g. "5 apples à $1" (one dollar each). This usage is based upon the French preposition à, and has evolved into the at sign (@). Sometimes it is part of a surname (e.g. Thomas à Kempis, Mary Anne à Beckett, Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, Gilbert Arthur à Beckett, Arthur William à Beckett, William à Beckett).
