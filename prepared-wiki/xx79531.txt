The [tpl]Nihongo|Hokuriku Shinkansen|北陸新幹線[/tpl] is a Shinkansen line currently under construction through the Hokuriku region of Japan. The first section, between [tpl]ja-stalink|Takasaki[/tpl] and [tpl]ja-stalink|Nagano[/tpl], currently called the Nagano Shinkansen, opened on 1 October 1997 (the Jōetsu Shinkansen links Takasaki with Tokyo). The extension to Toyama and Kanazawa is scheduled to open in March 2015. Construction of a further section to Fukui and Tsuruga commenced in 2012, with proposed completion in 2025. The options for the route of the final section to connect to the Tokaido Shinkansen are being studied, with three alignments being considered, that would connect at either Maibara, or at Kyoto, or at Shin-Osaka.

==Construction and future plans==

Future plans for the Hokuriku Shinkansen eventually include extension as far as Osaka via Toyama, Kanazawa and Fukui. Construction of parts of the 162.1 km section to Toyama began as early as 1993, and [tpl]as of|2013|lc=y[/tpl], construction is well advanced as far as Kanazawa. Breakthrough for the 22.2 km Iiyama tunnel, the longest on the line, was achieved on December 3, 2007.
