As Theoretica Chimica Acta the journal had the unusual policy of requiring that all articles had an abstract written in English, German, and French. Articles could be written in any of these languages or, very unusual for a modern science journal, in Latin. Only two articles were ever written in Latin. They were "Modus Computandi Eigenvectores et Eigenaestimationes e Matrice Densitatis" by T.K. Lim, and M.A. Whitehead from McGill University in Canada [tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00537361|pages=1–3|issue=1|title=Modus Computandi Eigenvectores et Eigenaestimationes e Matrice Densitatis|journal=Theoretica Chimica Acta|volume=7|year=1967|last1=Lim|first1=T.
