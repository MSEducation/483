==History==

In the beginning, Hayes was known as Dugas PastureLake Charles American Press August 9, 1987 pg 16  article by Nola Mae Ross or “La Savanne des Dugas" named for a cattle grazer from Andrus Cove who discovered this bountiful pasture land.
Cattle could be kept here without supervision because the area was bounded on the east by the Lacassine Bayou, on the north and west by swampland, and on the south by marsh.
In 1832 Thomas Hayes moved into Dugas Pasture and became the first while settler there. He married Mary Ann Foreman of Andrus Cove, and they settled near the Lacassine Bayou.
'The next settler was William Holland who was born in Tennessee in 1809.
William Holland, pioneer and father of nine children,1929 Mar 19 Lake Charles American Press established a school in what was now becoming known as Hayes, (for Thomas Hayes, the first settler.) Using a team of oxen, he moved an old slave cabin onto his properly, and he hired his friend Tom Cannon as the teacher.
The next settler in Dugas Pasture was a widow with seven sons and one daughter. In 1854, Mrs. Bazeline Derouen of New Iberia bought a piece of property from the U.S. Government, near the Lorrain settlement.  On her property, the first Methodist church was established in 1898. It was a simple, one-room structure with a small, foot-operated organ. The first pastor was the Rev. Robert P, Howell. Prior to that, as far back as 1835, Methodist circuit riders had come into the area on horseback and held meetings in the Hayes and Holland homes.
In 1905, after the railroad came to Hayes and the population shifted, the Methodist congregation decided the location was out of the way, so Bill Cox loaded the church building on a logging wagon and moved it to its present site in Hayes.
Francois, Louis, and Eugene LorrainLouisiana By Richard Bizier came from France and settled in the Hayes area in 1860, in what was known as the Lorrain Settlement.
The Lorrain Settlement had a brick mill, sugar mill, grits mill and sawmill which operated before steam boilers and used two men with cross-saws to work the mill.
Louis Lorrain also built a school in the settlement about 1860 and hired a teacher from France named Pierre Lenoir. The school was kept open by Paul Lorrain, who hired Marcelne Goodeaux as a teacher. She boarded with the family. Other teachers were Glady Kinsey and Miss Dicarlo. Then the school was moved to Hayes and early teachers there were Helen Bienvieu. Veva Stribling (Thom), J.R. Logan, Irma Howarton and Misses Freeman, Landreneaux, and Roy.
There was a post office at Lorrain around 1880, with mail brought up the bayou by Schooner. Mrs. Aueline Lorrain was the Post Mistress.
Another family moved into the Hayes area in 1885; Ophelien Primeaux, grandfather of Eloi Primeaux. 
In 1875, the first Gibbs made his appearance. Mr. and Mrs. George Gibbs moved to Hayes from Lowry and opened a general store, with living quarters upstairs. Kinney Gibbs was manager of the Island Plantation near Hayes which was owned by the Rice Plantation and Canal Company.
Others settling in the area in the earliest days included families named Brown, Atkinson, Moore, Mitchell, Duhon, Verrett, Lemelle, Andrus, and Trahan. Followed, after the turn of the century, by Gossett, Morgan, Gravelle, Carmouche, Fruge, Kent and Walker. Groups of northern farmers were brought down by J.B.Watkin'sCalcasieu Historical Preservation Society by Adley Cormier extensive advertising of the "Garden of Eden" in the Deep South.
This area remained isolated for many years. Midwives delivered most of the children. A Cherokee Indian "medicine woman" used concoctions prepared from herbs and plants to treat everything from snake bites, to toothaches. The first doctor, Leroy Lambert, did not come until 1916.
The Louisiana Western Railroad, through Lake Charles, Holmwood, Bell City, Hayes, and Lake Arthur was completed in 1904. Overnight, Hayes became a thriving little community. Toliver Hayes, son of the original settler, sold the rights-of-way and a depot site to the Railroad Company and [tpl]Convert|40|acre|ha[/tpl] of land to be used as a town site. Thus, the name of Hayes became permanent for the area.
March 1906, a new saw mill was established called Hayes Cypress and Lumber Co. and was started by Frank Dearborn and Jesse Thom. Less than two years later, J.M. Nugent, of Alexandria, LA purchased controlling interest.
A rice mill was built and a post office opened. 
In March 1911, Felix Hebert1911 Mar 24 Weekly - The Lake Charles American-Press became postmaster after the resignation of Hayes’s first postmaster, Solomon Hayes. Jesse Leo Thom1948 Jul 14 Lake Charles American Press was postmaster for 20 years until his death in 1948.
