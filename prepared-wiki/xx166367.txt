Amblyomma americanum, or lone star tick, is a species of tick in the genus Amblyomma.

==Distribution==

It is very widespread in the United States ranging from Texas to Iowa in the Midwest and east to the coast where it can be found as far north as Maine.[tpl]cite journal |author=James E. Childs & Christopher D. Paddock |title=The ascendancy of Amblyomma americanum as a vector of pathogens affecting humans in the United States |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=307–337 |year=2003 |pmid=12414740 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.48.091801.112728[/tpl] It is most common in wooded areas, particularly in forests with thick underbrush, and large trees.

==Vector==

Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari).[tpl]cite journal |author=Edwin J. Masters, Chelsea N. Grigery & Reid W. Masters |title=STARI, or Masters disease: lone star tick-vectored Lyme-like illness |journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=361–376, viii |date=June 2008 |pmid=18452807 |doi=10.1016/j.idc.2007.12.010[/tpl]  STARI exhibits a rash similar to that caused by Lyme disease but is generally considered to be less severe.  
Though the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. There is evidence that the A. americanum saliva inactivates Borrelia burgdorferi more quickly than the saliva of Ixodes scapularis.[tpl]cite journal |author=K. E. Ledin, N. S. Zeidner, J. M. C.

==Meat allergy==

According to research by Drs Thomas Platts-Mills and Scott Commins published in 2009 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3085643/pdf/nihms-273885.pdf, the bite of this tick can cause a person to develop a meat allergy to non-primate mammalian meat and meat products. This allergy is characterized by adult onset, and a delayed reaction of urticaria or anaphylaxis appearing 4-8 hrs after consumption of the allergen. The allergen has been identified as a carbohydrate called Alpha-Galactose, commonly known as alpha gal.  As well as occurring in non-primate mammals, Alpha Gal is also found in cat dander and a drug used to treat head and neck cancer.  Commercial tests for Alpha Gal IgE became available following from this research.
