Phil Albert was the second head coach of the Towson Tigers football team, where he has coached from 1972 through 1991 and compiled an 117–91–3 overall record. He coached the Tigers to the program's first conference championship when they went 10–0 and won the Mason-Dixon Conference.
A graduate and former football player at the University of Arizona, Albert was the head football coach at Towson State University from 1972 to 1991. When he was named as the Tigers' coach at the age of 28, he was one of the youngest head football coaches in the nation, and Towson was starting just its fourth season of college football. Over the next twenty years, Albert directed the very young program to success at three different levels of NCAA competition. His teams advanced to the NCAA postseason four times.
Albert was named "Coach of the Year" five times. He coached 28 All-Americans and four NFL players, including punter Sean Landeta and the recently retired "All Pro" Dave Meggett. In 1994, Phil was inducted into the Towson University Athletic Hall of Fame. From 1994 to 2001, he achieved success working with the San Diego Chargers organization as the advanced game day scout.
