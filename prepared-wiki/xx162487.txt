Ustilaginoidea virens, perfect sexual stage Villosiclava virens,Tanaka, Eiji, Taketo Ashizawa, Ryoichi Sonoda & Chihiro Tanaka. Villosiclava virens gen. nov., comb. nov., teleomorph of Ustilaginoidea virens, the causal agent of rice false smut. Mycotaxon 106: 491-501. 2008. is a plant pathogen which causes the disease False Smut of rice which reduces both grain yield and grain quality. The disease occurs in more than 40 countries, especially in the rice producing countries of Asia.Li, Y. Zhu, Z., Zhang Y., Zhao, L., Wang, C. Genetic Analysis of Rice False Smut Resistance Using Mixed Major Genes and Polygenes Inheritance Model. Acta Agronoimica Sinica. 2008 34(10): 1728-1733 but also in the U.S.Brooks, S., Anders, M., Yeater, K. Effect of Cultural Management Practices on the Severity of False Smut of Rice. Plant Disease. 2009. 93:1202-1208 As the common name suggests, it is not a true smut (fungus), but an ascomycete. False smut does not replace all or part of the kernel with a mass of black spores, rather sori form erupting through the palea and lemma forming a ball of mycelia, the outermost layers are spore-producing.Webster, R. K. and Gunnell, P. S. 1992. Compendium of rice diseases. American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN Infected rice kernels are always destroyed by the disease.
Of particular concern are the production of alkaloids in the grain as with the Claviceps spp. causing ergot.
Little is known of the exact life cycle of the pathogen. There is debate among plant pathologists at what time infection of the plant occurs. There are reports of early, systemic infections of seedlings and other reports of later infection at boot or flowering.
