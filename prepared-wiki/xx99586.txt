Belgian nationalism (or Belgicistic nationalism; [tpl]Lang-nl|Belgicisme[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-fr|Belgicanisme[/tpl]) defines an ideology that favours a strong centralized government, with less or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and dissolve the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium. 
It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the Belgian state level by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s - contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions. Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship. 
Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians, alongside some socialists, certain circles in Brussels, some sections of the far right and historically among fascists. Though the majority of Flemings do not (yet) favor independence of their region, and as the Walloons, Brussels and the German-speakers are strongly regionalist, there is no popular support in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in recent years, so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.
