The Lockheed A-12 was a reconnaissance aircraft built for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by Lockheed's famed Skunk Works, based on the designs of Clarence "Kelly" Johnson. The aircraft was designated A-12, the 12th in a series of internal design efforts with the A referring to "Archangel", the internal code name of the aircraft. It competed in the CIA's Oxcart program against the Convair Kingfish proposal in 1959, and won for a variety of reasons.
The A-12's specifications were slightly better than those of the Kingfish, and its projected cost was significantly less. Convair's design had the smaller radar cross section, however, and CIA's representatives initially favored it for that reason. The companies' respective track records proved decisive. Convair's work on the B-58 had been plagued with delays and cost overruns, whereas Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget. In addition, it had experience running a “black” project.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft - From Drawing Board to Factory Floor|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/from-the-drawing-board-to-factory-floor.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl]
The A-12 was produced from 1962 to 1964, and was in operation from 1963 until 1968.  It was the precursor to the twin-seat U.S. Air Force YF-12 prototype interceptor, M-21 drone launcher, and the famous SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. The A-12's final mission was flown in May 1968, and the program and aircraft retired in June of that year. The program was officially revealed in the mid-1990s.Mclninch 1996, title page.
Over the life of the Oxcart project, the participating US government departments and officials associated the project name "Oxcart" specifically with the A-12. An Agency officer later wrote, "OXCART was selected from a random list of codenames to designate this R&D and all later work on the A-12. The aircraft itself came to be called that as well."[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=ARCHANGEL: CIA's SUPERSONIC A-12 RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT Second Edition 2012|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/Archangel-2ndEdition-2Feb12.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Page 15[/tpl] The crews named the A-12 the Cygnus which was suggested by the pilot Jack Weeks to follow the Lockheed practice of naming aircraft after celestial bodies.Crickmore 2000, p. 16

==Design and development==

With the failure of the CIA's Project Rainbow to reduce the radar cross section of the U-2, preliminary work began inside Lockheed in late 1957 to develop a follow-on aircraft to overfly the Soviet Union. Under Project Gusto the designs were nicknamed "Archangel", after the U-2 program, which had been known as "Angel". As the aircraft designs evolved and configuration changes occurred, the internal Lockheed designation changed from Archangel-1 to Archangel-2, and so on. These names for the evolving designs soon simply became known as "A-1", "A-2", etc."The U-2's Intended Successor: Project Oxcart 1956–1968". Central Intelligence Agency, approved for release by the CIA in October 1994. Retrieved: 26 January 2007.  The CIA program to develop the follow-on aircraft to the U-2 was code-named Oxcart.[tpl]cite web|last=Mclninch|first=Thomas P.|title=The Oxcart Story — Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol15no1/html/v15i1a01p_0001.htm|publisher=CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM 2 JULY 96[/tpl]
These designs had reached the A-11 stage when the program was reviewed. The A-11 was competing against a Convair proposal called Kingfish, of roughly similar performance. However, the Kingfish included a number of features that greatly reduced its radar cross section, which was seen as favorable to the board. Lockheed responded with a simple update of the A-11, adding twin canted fins instead of a single right-angle one, and adding a number of areas of non-metallic materials. This became the A-12 design. On 26 January 1960, the CIA ordered 12 A-12 aircraft.Robarge 2008, p. 6.

===New materials and production techniques===

Because the A-12 was way ahead of its time, many new technologies had to be invented specifically for the Oxcart project, some still in use today. One of the biggest problems that engineers faced at that time was working with titanium.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The CIA covertly purchased the required titanium for A-12 construction from the Soviet Union. The Soviets considered the metal too difficult to work with and used it only where necessary on the Mach 2.83-capable MiG-25 "Foxbat".[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In his book Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed, Ben Rich stated, "Our supplier, Titanium Metals Corporation, had only limited reserves of the precious alloy, so the CIA conducted a worldwide search and using third parties and dummy companies, managed to unobtrusively purchase the base metal from one of the world's leading exporters - the Soviet Union.  The Russians never had an inkling of how they were actually contributing to the creation of the airplane being rushed into construction to spy on their homeland."[tpl]cite book|last=Rich|first=Ben R.|title=Skunk Works : a personal memoir of my years at Lockheed|year=1994|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York, NY |isbn=9780316743006|edition=1st pbk. ed.|coauthors=Janos, Leo[/tpl]
Before the A-12, titanium was used only in high-temperature exhaust fairings and other small parts directly related to supporting, cooling, or shaping high-temperature areas on aircraft like those subject to the greatest kinetic heating from the airstream, such as wing leading edges. The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium and some high-end composite materials.[tpl]cite web|title=Facts You Didn't Know About the SR-71 Blackbird|url=http://iliketowastemytime.com/facts-you-didnt-know-about-sr71-blackbird|publisher=Blog at ILTWMT[/tpl]

===Flight testing===

After development and production at the Skunk Works, in Burbank, California, the first A-12 was transferred to Groom Lake test facility.Jacobsen 2011, p. 51. On 25 April 1962 it was taken on its first (unofficial and unannounced) flight with Lockheed test pilot Louis Schalk at the controls.Robarge 2008, p. 16. The first official flight later took place on 30 April and subsequent supersonic flight on 4 May 1962, reaching speeds of Mach 1.1 at [tpl]convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl].Robarge 2008, p. 17.
The first five A-12s, in 1962, were initially flown with Pratt & Whitney J75 engines capable of [tpl]convert|17000|lbf|kN|abbr=on[/tpl] thrust each, enabling the J75-equipped A-12s to obtain speeds of approximately Mach 2.0.  On 5 October 1962, with the newly developed J58 engines, an A-12 flew with one J75 engine, and one J58 engine. By early 1963, the A-12 was flying with J58 engines, and during 1963 these J58-equipped A-12s obtained speeds of Mach 3.2.Landis and Jenkins 2005, pp. 16–17.  Also, in 1963, the program experienced its first loss when, on 24 May, "Article 123"Lacitis, Erik. "Area 51 vets break silence: Sorry, but no space aliens or UFOs." The Seattle Times, 27 March 2010. piloted by Kenneth S. Collins crashed near Wendover, Utah.Robarge 2008, p. 22, 23.
The reaction to the crash illustrated the secrecy and importance of the project. The CIA called the aircraft a Republic F-105 Thunderchief as a cover story;Jacobsen, Annie. "The Road to Area 51." Los Angeles Times, 5 April 2009. local law enforcement and a passing family were warned with "dire consequences" to keep quiet about the crash. Each was also paid $25,000 in cash to do so; the project often used such cash payments to avoid outside inquiries into its operations. The project received ample funding; contracted security guards were paid $1,000 monthly with free housing on base, and chefs from Las Vegas were available 24 hours a day for steak, Maine lobster, or other requests.
In June 1964, the last A-12 was delivered to Groom Lake,"SR-71 Blackbird." Lockheed Martin. Retrieved: 13 October 2010. from where the fleet made a total of 2,850 test flights. A total of 18 aircraft were built through the program's production run. Of these, 13 were A-12s, three were prototype YF-12A interceptors for the U.S. Air Force (not funded under the OXCART program), and two were M-21 reconnaissance drone carriers. One of the 13 A-12s was a dedicated trainer aircraft with a second seat, located behind the pilot and raised to permit the Instructor Pilot to see forward. The A-12 trainer "Titanium Goose", retained the J75 powerplants for its entire service life.Landis and Jenkins 2005, p. 16.
Three more A-12s were lost in later testing. On 9 July 1964, "Article 133" crashed while making its final approach to the runway when a pitch-control servo device froze at an altitude of [tpl]convert|500|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] and airspeed of [tpl]convert|200|knots|km/h|abbr=off[/tpl] causing it to begin a smooth steady roll to the left. Lockheed test pilot Bill Parks could not overcome the roll. At about a 45 degree bank angle and [tpl]convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] altitude he ejected and was blown sideways out of the aircraft. Although he was not very high off the ground, his parachute did open and he landed safely.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft - Full Stress Testing|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/full-stress-testing.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=McIninch|first=Thomas P.|title=STUDIES IN INTELLIGENCE VOL 26 NO 2 SUMMER 1982 - THE OXCART STORY (Blackbirds History)|url=http://www.blackbirds.net.pl/library/documents/oxcartstory/|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency document on blackbirds.net[/tpl]
On the 28 December 1965 the third A-12 was lost when "Article 126" crashed 30 seconds after take off when a series of violent yawing and pitching actions followed very rapidly with the aircraft becoming uncontrollable. Mele Vojvodich was scheduled to take aircraft number 126 on a performance check flight which included a rendezvous beacon test with a KC-135 tanker and managed to eject safely [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] above the ground. A post crash investigation revealed that the primary cause of the accident was a maintenance error in that the flight line technician was negligent in performing his duty when he connected the wiring harnesses for the yaw and pitch rate gyroscopes of the stability augmentation system in reverse. It was also found that a contributing cause was a design deficiency which made it possible to physically connect the wiring harnesses in reverse.[tpl]cite web|title=SUMMARY REPORT OF MAJOR AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF A-12 NUMBER 126|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001472027.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency  Doc Number 0001472027[/tpl]
The first fatality of the Oxcart program occurred on 5 January 1967, when "Article 125" crashed, killing CIA pilot Walter Ray when the aircraft ran out of fuel while on its descent to the test site. No precise cause could be established for the loss and it was considered most probable that a fuel gauging error led to fuel starvation and engine flame-out [tpl]convert|67|miles|km|abbr=off[/tpl] from the base. Ray ejected successfully but was unable to separate from the seat and was killed on impact.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft - Finding a Mission|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/finding-a-mission.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=LOSS OF ARTICLE 125 (OXCART AIRCRAFT)|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001473843.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Document Number  0001473843[/tpl]

==Operational history==

Although originally designed to succeed the U-2 in overflights over the Soviet Union and Cuba, the A-12 was never used for either role. After a U-2 was shot down in May 1960, the Soviet Union was considered too dangerous to overfly except in an emergency (and overflights were no longer necessaryMcIninch 1996, p. 19. due to reconnaissance satellites) and, although crews trained for the role of flying over Cuba, U-2s continued to be adequate there.McIninch 1996, p. 20.
The Director of the CIA decided to deploy some A-12s to Asia. The first A-12 arrived at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa on 22 May 1967. With the arrival of two more aircraft on 24 May, and 27 May this unit was declared to be operational on 30 May, and it began Operation Black Shield  on 31 May.McIninch 1996, pp. 25–27. Mel Vojvodich flew the first Black Shield operation, over North Vietnam, photographing surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, flying at [tpl]convert|80000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], and at about Mach 3.1. During 1967 from the Kadena Air Base, the A-12s carried out 22 sorties in support of the War in Vietnam. Then in 1968, Black Shield conducted operations in Vietnam and it also carried out sorties during the Pueblo Crisis with North Korea.

===Mission profile===

Operations and maintenance at Kadena began with the receipt of alert notification. Both a primary aircraft and pilot and a back-up aircraft and pilot were selected. The aircraft were given thorough inspection and servicing, all systems were checked, and the cameras loaded into the aircraft. Pilots received a detailed route briefing in the early evening prior to the day of flight. On the morning of the flight a final briefing occurred, at which time the condition of the aircraft and its systems was reported, last-minute weather forecasts reviewed, and other relevant intelligence communicated, together with any amendments or changes in the flight plan. Two hours prior to take-off the primary pilot had a medical examination, got into his suit, and was taken to the aircraft. If any malfunctions developed on the primary aircraft, the back-up could execute the mission one hour later.
A typical route profile for a mission over North Vietnam included a refueling shortly after take-off, south of Okinawa, the planned photographic pass or passes, withdrawal to a second aerial refueling in the Thailand area, and return to Kadena. Its turning radius of [tpl]convert|86|miles|km|abbr=off[/tpl] was such, however, that on some mission profiles it might be forced during its turn to intrude into Chinese airspace.
Once landed, the camera film was removed from the aircraft, boxed, and sent by special plane to the processing facilities. Film from earlier missions was developed at the Eastman Kodak plant in Rochester, New York. Later an Air Force Center in Japan carried out the processing in order to place the photointelligence in the hands of American commanders in Vietnam within 24 hours of completion of a mission.

===SAM evasion over North Vietnam===

There were a number of reasons leading to the retirement of the A-12, but one major concern was the growing sophistication of Soviet supplied SAM sites that it had to contend with over mission routes. In 1967 the vehicle was tracked with acquisition radar over North Vietnam, but the SAM site was unsuccessful with the Fan Song guidance radar used to home the missile to the target.[tpl]cite web |last=Kopp |first=Dr Carlo |title=SNR-75 Fan Song E Engagement Radar / Станция Наведения Ракет СНР-75 Fan Song E |url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-SNR-75-Fan-Song.html |publisher=Air Power Australia |date= April 2012 |accessdate= [/tpl]  On 28 October a North Vietnamese SAM site launched a single, albeit unsuccessful, missile. Photography from this mission documented the event with photographs of missile smoke above the SAM firing site, and with pictures of the missile and of its contrail. Electronic countermeasures equipment appeared to perform well against the missile firing.
During a flight on 30 October 1967, pilot Dennis Sullivan detected radar tracking on his first pass over North Vietnam. Two sites prepared to launch missiles but neither did. During the second pass at least six missiles were fired, each confirmed by missile vapor trails on mission photography. Looking through his rear-view periscope, Sullivan saw six missile vapor trails climb to about [tpl]convert|90000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] before converging on his aircraft. He noted the approach of four missiles, and although they all detonated behind him, one came within [tpl]convert|100|yd|m|abbr=off[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|200|yd|m|abbr=off[/tpl] of his aircraft.[tpl]cite web|title=Pieces of History: Missile Debris from A-12 OXCART|url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2013-featured-story-archive/pieces-of-history-missile-debris-from-a-12-oxcart.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl] Post-flight inspection revealed that a piece of metal had penetrated the lower right wing fillet area and lodged against the support structure of the wing tank. The fragment was not a warhead pellet but may have been a part of the debris from one of the missile detonations observed by the pilot.
The SA-2 'Guideline' was an early design intended to counter lower and slower aircraft like the B-52 and B-58. In response to faster, higher-flying designs like the B-70, the Soviets had begun development of greatly improved missile systems, notably the SA-5 'Gamon'. The SA-5 entered service in 1966, and represented a serious risk to the A-12.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The final Black Shield mission over North Vietnam and the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was flown on the 8 March 1968. Good quality photography was obtained of Khe Sanh and the Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnamese border areas. No useable photography was obtained of North Vietnam due to adverse weather conditions. There was no indication of a hostile weapons reaction and no ECM systems were activated.[tpl]cite web|title=BLACK SHIELD RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS 1 JANUARY - 31 MARCH 1968|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001472531.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Document Number 0001472531 page 16[/tpl]

===Final missions over North Korea===

In 1968 three missions were flown over North Korea. The first mission occurred during a very tense period following seizure of the Navy intelligence ship Pueblo on the 23rd of January. The aim was to discover whether the North Koreans were preparing any large scale hostile move following this incident and to actually find where the Pueblo was hidden. The ship was found anchored in an inlet in Wonsan Bay attended by two North Korean patrol boats and guarded by three Komars.[tpl]cite web|title=PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF BLACK SHIELD MISSION 6847 OVER NORTH KOREA|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001474986.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency  Document Number: 0001474986[/tpl]  Chinese tracking of the flight was apparent, but no missiles were fired at the Oxcart.[tpl]cite web|last=Mclninch|first=Thomas P.|title=The Oxcart Story|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol15no1/html/v15i1a01p_0001.htm|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl]
The second mission on the 19 February 1968 was also the first two-pass mission over North Korea. The Oxcart vehicle photographed 84 primary targets plus 89 bonus targets. Scattered clouds covered 20 percent of the area, concealing the area in which the USS Pueblo was photographed on the previous mission. One new SA-2 site was identified near Wonsan.[tpl]cite web|title=BLACK SHIELD RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS 1 JANUARY - 31 MARCH 1968|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001472531.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency  Document Number 0001472531 Page 14[/tpl]

===Retirement===

Facing changed circumstances in relations with the Soviet Union, US policymakers and intelligence officials had to decide with how best to use the A-12. Its intended purpose, replacing the U-2 in overflights of the Soviet Union, had become less likely well before the A-12 was operational. Soviet air defenses had advanced to the point that even an aircraft flying faster than a rifle bullet at the edge of space could be tracked. In any event, President Kennedy had stated publicly that the United States would not resume such missions. By 1965, moreover, the photoreconnaissance satellite programs had progressed to the point that manned flights over the Soviet Union were unnecessary to collect strategic intelligence.
The A-12 program was ended on 28 December 1966McIninch 1996, p. 31. — even before Black Shield began in 1967 — due to budget concerns and because of the forthcoming twin-seat SR-71 that began to arrive at Kadena during March 1968.[tpl]cite web|title=OXCART/SR-71 INFORMATION FOR EXCOM MEETING|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001472041.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency  Document Number: 0001472041[/tpl]  Being a twin-seater, the SR-71 was heavier and therefore flew slightly lower and slower than the A-12.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft - The OXCART "Family"|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/the-oxcart-family.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl]
Ronald L. Layton flew the 29th and final A-12 mission on 8 May 1968, over North Korea.[tpl]cite web|title=CRITIQUE FOR OXCART MISSION NUMBER BX6858|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001474970.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Document Number 0001472531[/tpl]  On 4 June 1968, just 2½ weeks before the retirement of the entire A-12 fleet, an A-12 out of Kadena, piloted by Jack Weeks, was lost over the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines while conducting a functional check flight after the replacement of one of its engines.McIninch 1996, p. 33. Frank Murray made the final A-12 flight on 21 June 1968, to Palmdale, California storage facility.Robarge 2008, p. 42.
On 26 June 1968, Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, presented the CIA Intelligence Star for valor to Weeks' widow and pilots Collins, Layton, Murray, Vojvodich, and Dennis B. Sullivan for participation in Black Shield.Robarge, David. "A Futile Fight for Survival. Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft."

The deployed A-12s and the eight non-deployed aircraft were placed in storage at Palmdale. All surviving aircraft remained there for nearly 20 years before being sent to museums around the U.S. On 20 January 2007, despite protests by Minnesota's legislature and volunteers who had maintained it in display condition, the A-12 preserved in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was dismantled to ship to CIA Headquarters to be displayed there.Karp, Jonathan.

The following timeline lists major events in the A-12's development and operation, and related events of its successor, the SR-71.
See SR-71 timeline for later SR-71 events.

==Variants==

===Training variant===

The A-12 training variant (60-6927 "Titanium Goose") was a two-seat model with two cockpits in tandem with the rear cockpit raised and slightly offset. In case of emergency, the trainer was designed to allow the flight instructor to take control.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft -   Breaking Through Technological Barriers|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/breaking-through-technological-barriers.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl]

===YF-12A===

The YF-12 program was a limited production variant of the A-12. Lockheed convinced the U.S. Air Force that an aircraft based on the A-12 would provide a less costly alternative to the recently canceled North American Aviation XF-108, since much of the design and development work on the YF-12 had already been done and paid for. Thus, in 1960 the Air Force agreed to take the seventh through ninth slots on the A-12 production line and have them completed in the YF-12A interceptor configuration.Landis and Jenkins 2005, pp. 40–41.

===M-21===

The M-21 variant carried and launched the Lockheed D-21, an unmanned, faster and higher-flying reconnaissance drone. The M-21 had a pylon on its back for mounting the drone and a second cockpit for a Launch Control Operator/Officer (LCO) in the place of the A-12's Q bay.Landis and Jenkins 2005, pp. 22–24. The D-21 was autonomous; after launch, it would fly over the target, travel to a predetermined rendezvous point, eject its data package, and self-destruct. A C-130 Hercules would catch the package in midair.Donald 2003, pp. 154–155.
The M-21 program was canceled in 1966 after a drone collided with the mother ship at launch. The crew ejected safely, but the LCO drowned when he landed in the ocean and his flight suit filled with water."MD-21 crash footage." YouTube. Retrieved: 13 October 2010.  The D-21 lived on in the form of a B-model launched from a pylon under the wing of the B-52 bomber.  The D-21B performed operational missions over China from 1969 to 1971.Donald 2003, pp. 155–156.
