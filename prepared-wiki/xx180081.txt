==Influences on the Civil War==

Her diary is very beneficial in aiding research about women during the Civil War. In her diary she discusses the war, her feelings toward the war, her opinions on the issue of slavery and she gives insights into being a woman in the United States in the 1800s. Peake shows a devotion to her state, Virginia, not her country or even the Confederacy. She also describes her inner conflict of following her husband and their friends in their thoughts on slavery or to follow her own instincts about slavery being outdated and wrong. She confesses the need for some change in the South, but she also expresses fears about losing her way of life. Cornelia Peake McDonald's diary is very insightful about a woman's role during the Civil War and the conflicts women were facing during that time.
It is crucial to recognize that the Women's Right's Movement was in its beginning stages while she was writing her diary. Many women during this time found the war to be liberating. Change was taking place in the both the South and the North, Blacks were gaining freedom and women were left to care for finances, farms and families while men went to war and sometimes never returned. These new responsibilities linked with the new independence movement pushed women to question their ideas and stations in life. In Cornelia Peake McDonald's diary, a perfect example of this is seen, she starts to question herself and her ideas.
Cornelia Peake McDonald is a good example of how women began to progress starting during the Civil War.
