Margaret Patricia Hughes (1 October 1919 – 30 January 2005) was a sportswriter.
Her first book, All On A Summer's Day (1953), was described by Neville Cardus in his foreword to the book as "the first book on first-class cricket not written by a man".
Margaret was brought up in Kent, one of four children of Dorothy Maude and Arthur Hughes.  She worked for the advertising department of the Star newspaper, taking the job "to see the cricket scores before the general public".  During World War II she served as a Wren.  She then resumed her newspaper career and became a close friend of Cardus.  He bequeathed her his copyrights.
Following All On A Summer's Day, she covered the Ashes series of 1954–55 for the Sydney Daily telegraph, the only woman ever to cover an Ashes series for a daily newspaper until Chloe Saltau did so in 2005.  Her tour diary was published as The Long Hop (1955).
