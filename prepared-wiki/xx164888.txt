Spanish Music Producers (Spanish: Productores de Música de España, shortened as Promusicae, sometimes stylised PROMUSICAE) is a trade group representing the Spanish recording industry. It is the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry group for Spain.

==History==

Promusicae born in the 1958s as representative of the IFPI in Spain under the name of the Spanish Group of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ([tpl]lang|es|Grupo Español de la Federación Internacional de la Industria Fonográfica[/tpl]), although not officially an association, since Spanish law during the Franco regime did not recognize the right of association until 1977. In 1978, it was registered as an association under the name Spanish Phonographic Association ([tpl]lang|es|Asociación Fonográfica Española[/tpl]) (AFE). In 1982, with the emergence and popularization of the music video, the AFE changed its name to Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain ([tpl]lang|es|Asociación Fonográfica y Videográfica de España[/tpl]) (AFYVE). Finally, in 2004, AFYVE partners by General Assembly decided to change to its current name, Spanish Music Producers ([tpl]lang|es|Productores de Música de España[/tpl]) (Promusicae, which is also a pun with the Latin expression "pro musicae", which means "for / in favor of the music").
Since April 30, 2003, Antonio Guisasola is the president of Promusicae, replacing Carlos Grande.

==Charts==

The charts are calculated once every week on Sundays. They are based on retail music sales within Spain for the week from the preceding Saturday to the Friday prior to calculation. The new charts are usually uploaded to the Promusicae website on Sunday night Spanish continental time.
Promusicae provides the following charts:

==Certifications==

Certifications have existed in Spain since the mid-1970s. During this period, both singles and albums had to sell 100,000 copies to qualify for a Gold disk, the only certification awarded at the time.[tpl]cite journal|title=Billboard Vol. 86, No. 52|url=http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=hAkEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22spain%22+%22no+Silver+or+platinum+disks%22 |publisher=Billboard|page=40|date=1974-12-26|accessdate=2013-04-29[/tpl]
Promusicae is currently in charge of certifying records in Spain. It certifies Gold and Platinum recordings based on the shipment of albums and the sales of digital downloads.

===Albums===

Until November 01, 2005, the certification-levels for albums in Spain were 50,000 for Gold and 100,000 for Platinum. The current levels; however, are 20,000 for Gold and 40,000 for Platinum.

===Singles===

In January 2008, due to a decline in Physical singles, Promusicae replaced the charts of the physical singles with two separate Top 20 charts, one for Digital downloads and the other for Original Tones (similar to Ringtones). The change was reflected to the certifications as well, and allowed each single title to receive two separate types of certification awards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130509052544/http://promusicae.es/files/listastonos/historial/TOP%2050%20CANCIONES%2008_01.pdf|title=SEMANA 01: del 31 de diciembre de 2007 al 6 de enero de 2008|work=Productores de Música de España|accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl] The two certification formats were combined together in January 2009, reflecting, again, the charts becoming a single chart. In the meantime, Promusicae raised the certification-levels to 20,000 for Gold and 40,000 for Platinum from the previous 10,000/20,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130509065733/http://promusicae.es/files/listastonos/historial/TOP%2050%20CANCIONES%2009_01.pdf|title=SEMANA 01: del 29.12.08 al 04.01.09|work=Productores de Música de España|accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl]

==Piracy==

As a member of IFPI, one of the main missions of Promusicae is lobbying for tougher intellectual property laws and stopping music copyright violations. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Promusicae has monitored P2P networks gathering data about its users downloading music. In April 2005, Promusicae claimed that they were monitoring the Kazaa P2P network and they had sent "messages" containing warnings and legal threats to more than 10.000 users[tpl]cite web | title = Promusicae envía 'advertencias' a miles de usuarios de redes P2P | author = El Mundo (Europa Press) | url = http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2005/04/13/cultura/1113407969.html | date = 2005-04-17 | accessdate = 2009-05-12 | language = Spanish[/tpl] In early 2008, Promusicae started a judicial process against Telefónica, the biggest Spanish Internet service provider, demanding that personal data of Kazaa users they monitored should be handed over to Promusicae, so they can start suing them. The Promusicae v. Telefónica case continued until the European Court of Justice, who sentenced that Telefónica has no obligation of handing user data over to Promusicae.[tpl]cite web | title = Bruselas considera que las telefónicas no tienen obligación de identificar a los usuarios del P2P | author = El País | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internet/Bruselas/considera/telefonicas/tienen/obligacion/identificar/usuarios/P2P/elpeputec/20080129elpepunet_5/Tes | date = 2008-01-30 | accessdate = 2009-05-11 | language = Spanish[/tpl]
In June 2008, Promusicae sued Pablo Soto, developer of Manolito P2P, Blubster and Piolet.
