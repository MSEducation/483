 Page 277.</ref>  The major suits are of prime importance for tactics and scoring as they outrank the [[minor suit]]s while bidding and also outscore them (30 per contracted trick for major suitsâ€”compared to 20 for minor suits).  Much of the tactics of bidding in bridge revolves around the attempt by partners to find a "fit" in one of the major suits that will allow them to easily make a game contract.  Of the two major suits, spades ([tpl]Spades[/tpl]) rank higher than hearts ([tpl]Hearts[/tpl]).

==Suit combinations==

Fundamentally, there are three ways to divide four suits into pairs: by color, by rank and by shape resulting in six possible suit combinations.
In the event of widespread introduction of four-color decks, it has been suggested that the red/black distinction could be replaced by rounded tops and pointed tops (the [tpl]gcb|pip[/tpl]s on hearts and diamonds have rounded tops, whereas on the spades and clubs they are pointed).
