The winner of the Festival was the song "Aprite le finestre" (Open The Windows), sung by Franca Raimondi, and the second place was the song "Amami se vuoi" (Love Me If You Want To), sung by Tonina Torrielli, which went on to perform at the international Eurovision Song Contest.

==At Eurovision==

There were seven participating countries, and each was drawn to perform two songs in the same order via two rounds, with Italy being drawn to perform last in each round. Each country's delegation decided which of its song will be performed first and which second. "Aprite le finestre" was performed seventh, and "Amami se vuoi" was performed fourteenth as the last song of the evening.
Only one of Switzerland's songs was declared as the winner after the private counting of the votes by the juries, with the scores and placings of all the songs not being revealed and not confirmed to date, and so the scores and placings of the two Italian songs are unknown.
