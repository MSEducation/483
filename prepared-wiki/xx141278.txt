[[Ohigashi schism]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhism in Japan, Pure Land Buddhism

The Ohigashi schism (お東騒動) was a religious schism in the Higashi Honganji subsect of the Japanese Buddhist sect Jodo Shinshu, which occurred in 1969 after a reformist group created internal divisions in the subsect.
The Dobokai Movement (同朋会運動), a reform group within Higashi Honganji, officially began on the 700th memorial of Shinran Shonin in 1962, though its roots were in a movement started in 1947 by a group of practitioners calling themselves the shinjinsha, or, 'true person community'.Popular Buddhism In Japan: Shin Buddhist Religion & Culture by Esben Andreasen, pp. 26, 69-73 / University of Hawaii Press 1998, ISBN 0-8248-2028-2 Two of its major leaders were Akegarasu Haya and Kiyozawa Manshi. 
The goal of the movement was to awaken and unite members of Higashi Honganji in the tradition of Mahayana Buddhism as laid forth by Shinran Shonin due to internal conflict over differences of  doctrinal opinion; such as over the idea of shinjin, and whether the Pure Land was to be entered in death or in this life. The Dobokai movement based itself largely on the Tannisho (a collection of sayings attributed to Shinran Shonin with commentaries by Yuien-bo, one of Shinran's disciples), and the idea of cutting through spiritual differences. 
The movement split Higashi Honganji into four different groups. Higashi Honganji-ha no longer owns the physical property of Higashi Honganji, which has been seized by another religious group entirely called Otani-ha that changed the temple's name to "Shinshū Mausoleum". Meanwhile, the treasure of Higashi Honganji-ha at the time, amounting to about $200 million in donations, was seized for use by a "nonprofit organization" which does not maintain any temples. In 2012 a court ruled that this money must be returned.
