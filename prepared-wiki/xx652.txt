Croatian agricultural sector subsists from exports of blue water fish, which in recent years experienced a tremendous surge in demand, mainly from Japan and South Korea. Croatia is a notable producer of organic foods and much of it is exported to the European Union. Croatian wines, olive oil and lavender are particularly sought after.
Tourism is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as skiing. With over 10 million foreign tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of €7 billion. Croatia is ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist destinations in the world, and was voted world's top tourism destination in 2005 by Lonely Planet.Top Destinations for 2005
Trade plays a major role in Croatian economic output. In 2007 Croatia's exports were valued at USD 12.84 billion (24.7 billion including service exports). According to Healy Consultants, trade in Croatia is bolstered by its low trade-weighted average tariff of just 1.2%.[tpl]cite web|title=Croatia Company Formation|url=http://www.healyconsultants.com/company-incorporation/croatia-company-formation.html|publisher=Healy Consultants|accessdate=3 September 2013[/tpl]  Croatia has a stable market economy accompanied by a strong and stable currency, the Kuna.
Croatia and Slovenia, the two westernmost republics in what was formerly SFR Yugoslavia, accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall standard of living which in Croatia's case was more than 50% above Yugoslav average, and close to 90% in Slovenia. Nevertheless, since the late 1980s and the beginning of economic transition, Croatian economy experienced difficulties due to deindustrialization, war destruction and the loss of Yugoslav and Comecon markets.
Persistent economic problems still remain and include a rather high unemployment rate (9.6% in 2007),Ekonomski Indikatori and the slow progress of necessary economic reforms. Of particular concern is the heavily backlogged judiciary system, combined with inefficient public administration, especially regarding the issues of land ownership and corruption in the public sector. Unemployment is regionally uneven: it is very high in eastern and southern parts of the country, nearing 20% in some areas, while relatively low in the north-west and in larger cities, where it is between 3 and 7%. Unemployment has been constantly declining by 5% over the last 7 years.stat inf 78 do 117.cdr

==History==

===Pre-1990===

In an economy traditionally based on agriculture and raising of livestock, peasants accounted for more than half of Croatia's population until after World War II. Pre-1945 industrialization was slow and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants.
Rapid industrialization and diversification occurred after World War II. Decentralization came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous tourist industry. Profits gained through Croatia's industry were used to develop poor regions in other parts of former Yugoslavia, leading to Croatia contributing much more to the federal Yugoslav economy than it gained in return[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]. This, coupled with austerity programs and hyperinflation in the 1980s, led to discontent in both Croatia and Slovenia which eventually fuelled political movements calling for independence. Foreign remittances contributed $2 billion annually to the economy by 1990.Europa Publications Limited. Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1999: 1999. Routledge, 1999. (pg. 279)
Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, SR Croatia was the second most prosperous and industrialized area (after SR Slovenia), with a per capita output more than one-third above Yugoslav average. Privatization under the new Croatian government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. Economic infrastructure was directly affected by the Croatian War of Independence and sustained massive damage, particularly in 1991 and 1992.

===The Tuđman years===

By the end of the 1990s, Croatia faced considerable economic problems stemming from:
Croatia, along with the remainder of the former Yugoslavia, experienced a serious depression. President Franjo Tuđman initiated the process of privatization and de-nationalization in Croatia; however, it was far from transparent. The new government's inefficient and slow legal system, combined with the wider context of the Yugoslav wars, led to numerous cases of mishandled privatization efforts, collectively known as the Croatian privatization controversy. Nepotism was endemic, with the president devising a concept of "200 families" which would control all property in Croatia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/63969/ivic-pasalic-tajni-ortak-hypo-banke|language=Croatian|publisher=Nacional|title=Ivić Pašalić tajni ortak Hypo banke|trans_title=Ivić Pašalić is a silent partner of Hypo Banka|author=Berislav Jelinić|quote=Polovinom 90-ih Tuđman je odobrio projekt Ivića Pašalića baziran na Tuđmanovoj ideji o 200 obitelji koje bi vladale hrvatskom imovinom|date=3 August 2009|accessdate=23 July 2012|archivedate=23 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69NVrINZv[/tpl] and during this period many influential individuals with the backing of the authorities acquired state-owned property and companies at extremely low prices, afterwards selling them off piecemeal to the highest bidder for much larger sums. This, along with the sudden loss of access to former Yugoslav markets, led to mass bankruptcies, and swelled the ranks of the unemployed by thousands, a problem Croatia still struggles with to this day. Miroslav Kutle was one of the leading businessmen in these endeavours, and he was subsequently incarcerated on multiple counts of embezzlement.
This was all helped by the inadequacy of legal restrictions in place and by the apparently active support of Croatia's authorities,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] which were ultimately controlled by President Tuđman. In the end this shed an increasingly negative light, and cast a shadow on his notable successes as a strategist and wartime statesman. Excluding the mostly rural rebel-occupied areas in the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, in the last two years of Tuđman's first presidential term the detrimental effects of uncontrolled capitalism had become strikingly visible, with more than 400,000 unemployed and a significant drop in GDP per capita,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] problems that Croatia struggles with to this day.
Inflation and unemployment rose sharply and the kuna fell,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] prompting the national bank to tighten its fiscal policy. A new banking law passed in December 1998 gave the central bank more control over Croatia's 53 commercial banks and Croatia became dependent on international debt to finance its deficit.
Despite the successful value-added tax program, planned privatization of state controlled businesses, and a revised budget with a 7% cut in spending across that board, the government still projected a $200 million deficit for 1999.
Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, is a significant factor in the further development of the economy. The government has been successful in some reform efforts — partially macroeconomic stabilization policies — and it has normalized relations with its creditors.
In 1998 the government founded The Business Innovation Center of Croatia – BICRO, in order to implement technology development and innovation support programs, as an important paradigm of future development.
The recession that began at the end of 1998 continued through most of 1999, and GDP in 1999 was flat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] Inflation remained in check and the kuna was stable. However, consumer demand was weak and industrial production decreased. Structural reform lagged and problems of payment arrears and a lack of banking supervision continued.
Due to the upcoming elections, the ruling HDZ government promised two salary increases to public-sector employees before the end of the year which further increased the fiscal deficit.

===After Tuđman===

The death of President Tuđman in December 1999 and the defeat of his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in the January 2000 elections ushered in a new government committed to economic reform and halting the economic decline.
The new government led by Ivica Račan carried out a large number of structural reforms. With tourism as the main contributing factor the country emerged from recession in 2000. Due to overall increase in stability, the economic rating of the country improved and interest rates dropped.  As a result of coalition politics and resistance from the unions and the public, many reforms are still overdue, especially in the legal system.
Unemployment reached a peak of around 22% in late 2002 due to many overdue bankruptcies. It has been steadily declining, powered by growing industrial production and rising GDP, rather than only seasonal changes from tourism, until the global crisis of 2008. During this time, Croatia turned away from domestic ownership of manufacturing and focused more on empowering the economy by taking loans from foreign resources.  In 2003, the nation's economy would officially recover to the amount of GDP it had in 1990.http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/2f_adams.pdf  Between the years 2003 and 2007, Croatia’s private-sector share of GDP increased from 60% to 70%http://www.qfinance.com/country-profiles/croatia
Most economic indicators remained positive in this period, except for the external debt. The Croatian National Bank had to take steps to curb further growth of indebtedness of local banks with foreign banks.  The dollar debt figure is quite adversely affected by the EUR/USD ratio — over a third of the increase in debt since 2002 is due to currency value changes.
Tourism is a notable source of income during the summer. With over 10 million foreign tourists a year (as of 2006), Croatia is ranked as the 18th major tourist destination in the world.untitled
The Croatian economy is heavily interdependent on other principal economies of Europe, and any negative trends in these larger EU economies also have a negative impact on Croatia as they are its biggest trade partners. The country is a candidate for membership in the European Union. During the accession, it is expected that agricultural policy will be the biggest stumbling block, as with other recent applicant countries.
By the early 2005, the foreign debt of the Government declined in growth, and was surpassed in size by the foreign debt of the banking sector, prompting further interventions by the central bank.
Since the global crisis hit the country in 2009, the unemployment has been steadily rising, resulting in the loss of more than 100,000 jobs.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatia-loses-battle-with-crisis While the unemployment was 9.6% in the late 2007, as of January 2014 it peaked at 22.4%. Gini coefficient is 0,32.http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/publication/2011/14-01-02_01_2011.htm As of September 2012, Fitch ratings agency unexpectedly improved Croatia's economic outlook from negative to stable, reafirming Croatia's current BBB rating.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/fitch-unexpectedly-improves-croatian-economic-outlook
