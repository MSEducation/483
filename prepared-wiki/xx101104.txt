[[Political groups of the European Parliament]]

CATEGORIES: European Parliament party groups

The political groups of the European Parliament are the parliamentary groups of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is unique among supranational assemblies in that its members (MEPs) organise themselves in such ideological groups like in traditional national legislatures. Instead, the members of other supranational assemblies form national groups. The political groups of the European Parliament are sometimes the formal representation of a European political party ("Europarty") in the Parliament. In other cases, they are political coalitions of a number of European parties, national parties, and independent politicians.
These groups are not parties, but looser coalitions. They are strictly forbidden to campaign during the European elections since this is the exclusive responsibility of the Europarties. Each political group is assumed to have a set of core principles, and political groups that cannot demonstrate this may be disbanded (see below).

==Requirements and privileges==

Working together in Groups benefits European political parties: for example, the European Free Alliance (5 MEPs in sixth Parliament) and the European Green Party (37 MEPs in sixth Parliament) have more power by working together in the European Greens–European Free Alliance Group (42 MEPs) than they would have as stand-alone parties, bringing their causes much-needed additional support. Further incentives for co-operating in Groups include financial subsidies from the Parliament and guaranteed seats on committees which are not afforded to Independent MEPs.
For a Group to be formally recognised in the Parliament, it must fulfil the conditions laid down in the relevant European Parliament Rule of Procedure."Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 7th parliamentary term – July 2009, Rule 30: Formation of political groups" 1 July 2009, from http://www.europarl.europa.eu/"Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, 16th edition – March 2009, Rule 29: Formation of political groups" 6 April 2009, from http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ That Rule lays down the minimum criteria a Group must meet to qualify as a Group. Provided those criteria are met, MEPs can theoretically create any Group they like. This was put to the test when MEPs attempted to create a far-right Group called "Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty" (ITS). This generated controversy and there were concerns about public funds going towards a far-right Group.[tpl]cite web|last=Brunwasser|first=Matthew|title=Bulgaria and Romania bolster far right profile in EU Parliament|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/14/news/right.php|date=14 January 2007|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2007-07-07[/tpl] Attempts to block the formation of ITS were unsuccessful, but ITS were blocked from leading positions on committees, a privilege usually afforded to all Groups.[tpl]cite web|title = Far-Right Wing Group Sidelined in European Parliament|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2335201,00.html|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=2007-07-07[/tpl]
These events spurred MEPs, mainly from the largest two groups, to approve a rise in the threshold for groups for the 2009–2014 term to a minimum of 25 MEPs from at least seven states. This was opposed by many MEPs, including the Liberal group, for being detrimental to democracy and the two other smallest groups in Parliament, whilst supporters argued that the change made it harder for the far right to claim EU funds whilst still enabling 2.5% of MEPs to form a group.[tpl]cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|title=New rules to make it harder for MEPs to form political groups|url=http://euobserver.com/9/26468|date=9 July 2008|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-10[/tpl]

==Organisation==

Groups may be based around a single European political party (e.g. the European People's Party, the Party of European Socialists) or they can include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents[tpl]cite web|title = Party Politics in the EU|publisher = civitas.org.uk|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/download/CIT.3.EU%20Political%20Parties.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 [/tpl] (e.g. the Liberal Group).
Each Group appoints a leader, referred to as a "president", "co-ordinator" or "chair", who decides which way the Group should vote in Parliament. The chairs of each Group meet in the Conference of Presidents to decide what issues will be dealt with at the plenary session of the European Parliament. Groups can table motions for resolutions and table amendments to reports.

==Composition of the 7th European Parliament==

This is a summary of the composition of the 7th European Parliament, whose mandate runs from 2009 to 2014.
Major changes compared to the period 2004–2009 are:

==Composition of the 6th European Parliament==

The mandate of previous European Parliament ran from 2004 and 2009. It was composed of the following political groups.

==Party relations==

The Parliament does not form a government in the traditional sense and its politics have developed over consensual rather than adversarial lines. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament.[tpl]cite web|last = Kreppel|first=Amie|title = The European Parliament and Supranational Party System|publisher =Cambridge University Press|year=2002|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/06251/sample/9780521806251ws.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 [/tpl] Historically, the two largest parliamentary formations have been the EPP Group and the PES Group, which are affiliated to their respective Europarties, the European People's Party (EPP) and the Party of European Socialists (PES). These two Groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats together. The Socialists were the largest single party grouping up to 1999, when they were overtaken by the centre-right EPP.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=History|publisher=Socialist Group website|url=http://www.socialistgroup.eu/gpes/history.do?lg=en|format=|accessdate = 2007-11-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=EPP-ED Chronology – 1991–2000|publisher=EPP-ED Group website|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology06.asp|accessdate = 2007-11-07[/tpl]
In 1987 the Single European Act came into force and, under the new cooperation procedure, the Parliament needed to obtain large majorities to make the most impact. So the EPP and PES came to an agreement to co-operate in the Parliament.[tpl]cite web|title=EPP-ED Chronology – 1981–1990|publisher=EPP-ED Group website|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology05.asp|accessdate = 2007-11-07[/tpl] This agreement became known as the "grand coalition" and, aside from a break in the fifth Parliament, it has dominated the Parliament for much of its life, regardless of necessity. The grand coalition is visible in the agreement between the two Groups to divide the five-year term of the President of the European Parliament equally between them, with a socialist president for half the term and a People's president for the other half, regardless of the actual election result.[tpl]cite web|last=Settembri|first=Pierpaolo|title = Is the European Parliament competitive or consensual ...

===Position of the liberals===

Liberal Group leader Graham Watson MEP has denounced the grand coalition and has described the aim for the liberals in the following terms: "the challenge for us is not only to break the inherent conservatism of the grand coalition, where a failing EPP Europe is propped up by a Socialist poodle pinching the crumbs from the table" also expressing a desire to ensure that the posts of Commission President, Council President, Parliament President and High Representative are not carved up in an agreement between the two groups to the exclusion of third parties.[tpl]cite web|title=Speech by G.

During the fifth term it was the liberals who were involved in a break in the grand coalition when they entered into an alliance with the European People's Party, to the exclusion of the Socialists.[tpl]cite web|title = Interview: Graham Watson, leader of group of Liberal Democrat MEPs |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/elections/interview-graham-watson-leader-group-liberal-democrat-meps/article-128543|publisher=Euractiv|date=15 June 2004|accessdate=2007-11-01[/tpl] This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and PES[tpl]cite news|title = European Parliament elects new president |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/398892.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 July 1999|accessdate=2007-11-01[/tpl] as before. In the following term the liberals grew to 88 seats becoming the "Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe". This was the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.[tpl]cite web|title=The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is born|date=14 July 2004|publisher=Graham Watson MEP website|url=http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000017/the_alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_is_born.html|accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl]

===Break in the coalition===

However liberal intervention has not been the only cause for a break in the grand coalition. There have been specific occasions where real left-right party politics have emerged, notably the resignation of the Santer Commission. When the initial allegations against the Commission Budget emerged, they were directed primarily against the PES Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín. PES supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. EPP disagreed. Whilst the Parliament was considering rejecting the Community budget, President Jacques Santer argued that a "No" vote would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. PES leader Pauline Green MEP attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two Groups adopted a government-opposition dynamic, with PES supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.[tpl]cite web| last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher =University of Pittsburgh  |date=February 2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-07 [/tpl]
In 2004 there was another notable break in the grand coalition. It occurred over the nomination of Rocco Buttiglione as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security. The EPP supported the appointment of Buttiglione, while the PES, who were also critics of the President-designate Jose Manuel Barroso, led the parties seeking Buttiglione's removal following his rejection (the first in EU history) by a Parliamentary committee. Barroso initially stood by his team and offered only small concessions, which were rejected by the PES. The EPP demanded that if Buttiglione were to go, then a PES commissioner must also be sacrificed for balance.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowley|first=Graham|title=Socialists vow to oppose incoming team: Barroso optimistic on commission vote|publisher=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/26/union_ed3__11.php|date=26 October 2004|accessdate = 2007-11-23[/tpl] In the end, Italy withdrew Buttiglione and put forward Franco Frattini instead. Frattini won the support of the PES and the Barroso Commission was finally approved, albeit behind schedule.[tpl]cite web|last=Bowley|first=Graham|title=SEU Parliament likely to accept commission: Barroso set to win with new team|publisher=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/17/union_ed3__6.php|date=17 November 2004|accessdate = 2007-11-23[/tpl] Politicisation such as the above has been increasing, with Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noting in 2007 that[tpl]cite web|title = Professor Farrell: "The EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world"|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-7838-162-06-24-901-20070615IPR07837-11-06-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm|date=18 June 2007|accessdate = 2007-07-05[/tpl]

==Academic analyses==

The political groups of the European Parliament have been around in one form or another since September 1952 and the first meeting of the Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly. The groups are coalitions of MEPs and the European political party and national parties that those MEPs belong to. The groups have coalesced into representations of the dominant schools of European political thought and are the primary actors in the Parliament.
Some of the groups (such as PES/S&D Group) have become homogeneous units coterminous with their Europarty, some (such as IND/DEM) have not. But they are still coalitions, not parties in their own right, and do not issue manifestos of their own. It may therefore be difficult to discern how the groups intend to vote without first inspecting the party platforms of their constituent parties, and then with limited certainty.
Additionally, national media focus on the MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Transnational media coverage of the groups per se is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver or theParliament.com) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs make it easy to find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.
As a result, the only bodies providing analysis of the voting patterns and Weltanschauung of the groups are academics.
