[[Vermiform appendix]]

CATEGORIES: Digestive system, Organs

The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal caecal appendix; also vermix) is a blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops embryologically. The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon. The appendix is located near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine.
The term "vermiform" comes from Latin and means "worm-shaped".

==Structure==

The human's appendix averages 11 cm in length but can range from 2 to 20 cm. The diameter of the appendix is usually between 7 and 8 mm. The longest appendix ever removed measured 26 cm from a patient in Zagreb, Croatia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/human_body/body_parts/largest_appendix_removed.aspx |title=Guinness world record for longest appendix removed |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl] The appendix is usually located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, near the right hip bone. Its position within the abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as McBurney's point (see below). Some identical twins, however, known as mirror image twins occasionally have a mirror-imaged anatomy with the appendix located on the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.[tpl]cite web|title=Unusual Types of Twins|url=http://www.nomotc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=54|publisher=Multiples of America|accessdate=30 April 2014[/tpl] 

===Variation===

While the base of the appendix is at a fairly constant location, 2 cm below the ileocecal valve, the location of the tip of the appendix can vary from being retrocecal (behind the cecum) (74%)[tpl]Cite book|author=Paterson-Brown, S. |chapter= 15.

==Function==

===Vestigiality===

The human appendix has been proposed to be a vestigial structure, a structure that has lost all or most of its original function through the process of evolution. The vermiform appendix has been proposed to be the shrunken remainder of the cecum that was found in a remote ancestor of humans, but a 2013 study refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between cecum size and appendix size and presence. Ceca, which are found in the digestive tracts of many extant herbivores, house mutualistic bacteria which help animals digest the cellulose molecules that are found in plants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/animalstructure.html |title=Animal Structure & Function |publisher=Sci.waikato.ac.nz |accessdate=2011-10-03[/tpl]
It is widely present in the Euarchontoglires and has also evolved independently in the diprotodont marsupials, monotremes, and is highly diverse in size and shape.[tpl]cite journal | author = Smith H.

A possible scenario for the progression from a fully functional cecum to the current human appendix was put forth by Charles Darwin.Darwin, Charles (1871) "Jim's Jesus". The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. John Murray: London. He suggested that the appendix was used for digesting leaves as primates. It may be a vestigial organ of ancient humans that has degraded to nearly nothing over the course of evolution. The very long cecum of some herbivorous animals, such as found in the horse or the koala, appears to support this theory. The koala's cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage. As people began to eat more easily digested foods, they may have become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. As the cecum became less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations have survived. It's suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary cecum  degraded to be the appendix of today.

===Maintaining gut flora===

Although it was long accepted that the immune tissue, called gut associated lymphoid tissue, surrounding the appendix and elsewhere in the gut carries out a number of important functions, explanations were lacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack of importance as judged by an absence of side effects following appendectomy.[tpl]Cite book|author=Kumar, Vinay; Robbins, Stanley L.; Cotran, Ramzi S. |title=Robbins' pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1989 |pages=902–3 |isbn=0-7216-2302-6 |edition=4th[/tpl]
William Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at Duke University proposed in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines.Associated Press.

==Clinical significance==

The most common diseases of the appendix (in humans) are appendicitis and carcinoid tumors (appendiceal carcinoid).[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2010-05-19 |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/a/appendix_disorders/intro.htm |title=Appendix disorders Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatments and Causes  |work=Wrongdiagnosis.com[/tpl] Appendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies. In rare cases, adenomas are also present.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2010-05-19 |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/a/appendix_disorders/stats.htm |title=Statistics about Appendix disorder |work= Wrongdiagnosis.com[/tpl]

===Appendicitis===

Appendicitis (or epityphlitis) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix. Pain often begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix's development as part of the embryonic midgut. This pain is typically a dull, poorly localized, visceral pain.[tpl]Cite book|author=Miller R., Kenneth |coauthor=Levine, Joseph |title=Biology |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=0-13-050730-X |accessdate=2010-05-19 |pages=92–98[/tpl]
As the inflammation progresses, the pain begins to localize more clearly to the right lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes inflamed. This peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure). In particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as well. Fever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.
Appendicitis usually requires removal of the inflamed appendix, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Untreated, the appendix may rupture, leading to peritonitis, followed by shock, and, if still untreated, death.

===Surgery===

The surgical removal of the vermiform appendix is called an appendectomy, or appendicectomy."appendicectomy - definition of appendicectomy". Farlex Incorporation. This removal is normally performed as an emergency procedure when the patient is suffering from acute appendicitis. In the absence of surgical facilities, intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis. In some cases, the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the appendix. This is a relative contraindication to surgery.
The appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit, in an operation known as the Mitrofanoff procedure,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Mingin G.C., Baskin L.S. |title=Surgical management of the neurogenic bladder and bowel |journal=Int Braz J Urol |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |year=2003 |pmid=15745470 |doi=10.1590/S1677-55382003000100012 |url=http://www.brazjurol.com.br/january_february_2003/Baskin_ing_53_61.htm[/tpl] in people with a neurogenic bladder.
The appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. The appendix is brought out to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach a catheter and easily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using an appropriate solution.http://www.healthpoint.co.nz/default,169125.sm;jsessionid=1CD66A058B10550C51041E477C8E7075

==History==

Dr. Heather F. Smith of Arizona State University explained:
 Recently... improved understanding of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science, pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies without modern medicine. This function is potentially a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix.
 Three morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be described among mammals based primarily on the shape of the cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like cecum (as in many primate species),an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat), and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). In addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between the cecum and appendix- like structure (as in the koala). A cecal appendix has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix has apparently been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.
In a more recent paper, the appendix was found to have evolved at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six times. This suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.[tpl]cite journal | author = Laurin M., Everett, M.L.

Such a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and healthcare practice, where diarrhea may be prevalent. Current epidemiological data on the cause of death in developed countries collected by the World Health Organization in 2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-related death in developing countries (data summarized by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Two of the other leading causes of death are expected to have exerted limited or no selection pressure.Needs CitationEvolution of the Appendix: A Biological 'Remenant' No More; By Duke Medicine News and Communications; Published: Aug. 20, 2009 Updated: Aug. 21, 2009, http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/evolution_of_the_appendix_a_biological_remnant_no_more
