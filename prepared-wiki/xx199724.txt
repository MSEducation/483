Neurotransmitter-stress syndrome is the proposed name by mental health professionals in the United States to replace schizophrenia.  The rationale for changing the name of schizophrenia to Neurotransmitter-stress syndrome is to prevent stigma and mispreceptions regarding the nature of the mental disorder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intervoiceonline.org/tags/schizophrenia|title=Intervoice: - The international community for hearing voices|publisher=Intervoice|accessdate=2009-05-10[/tpl]

==Concept==

Layman language uses the term "schizophrenic" loosely, such as economists referring to economy as being schizophrenic. The media pushes the notion that schizophrenia means a  split personality, for instance Hollywood movies like Me, Myself and Irene perpetuate this misconception.  The careless misusage of the term schizophrenia has been discouraged and written about by professionals.[tpl]cite book|last=Berren|first=Micheal |title=A Sourcebook for Families Coping with Mental Illness |year=2004|edition=Second Edition|isbn= 0-9646238-1-1[/tpl]
