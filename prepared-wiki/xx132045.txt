Petrus Leonardus Rijke (July 11, 1812, Hemmen, Gelderland â€“ April 7, 1899, Leiden) was a Dutch physicist, and a professor in experimental physics at the University of Leiden. Rijke spent his scientific career exploring the physics of electricity, and is known for the Rijke tube.
On July 1, 1852 he was married to Johanna Hamaker. They had 6 sons and 6 daughters.

==Early years and education==

Rijke was born in Hemmen, (now Overbetuwe municipality), Gelderland.  His father, Dirk Rijke, was a pastor. His mother was Elisabeth Pieternella Beausar. 
From 1830 Rijke studied physics under P.J. Uijlenbroek at the University of Leiden, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1836. The title of his Ph.D. thesis was "De origine electricitatis Voltaicae".

==Academic career==

In 1835 he was appointed professor of physics at the Royal Athenaeum in Maastricht. In 1845 he became extraordinary professor and in 1854 he was promoted to full professor of physics at the University of Leiden.
There he started a physics laboratory with a large collection of scientific instruments. His most important students were H.A. Lorentz and J.D. van der Waals. He retired in 1882, and was succeeded by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes as professor of experimental physics at the University of Leiden.
