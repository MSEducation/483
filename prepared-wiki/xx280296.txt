Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company was an American manufacturer of electrical stage lighting products in the 20th century. The company had a significant influence in the development of theatrical, cinema, television, and specialty lighting. It equipped many major performing venues in the United States and its products were used in several other countries as well. Their eponymous product, the Klieglight, was the trade name for two quite different production lights manufactured by the company, and survives today in both industry argot and in popular idiom as a synonym for "spotlight" or "center of attention".[tpl]cite journal |last1=Morgan |first1=Frederick |last2=Hellman |first2=Geoffrey |date=July 13, 1957 |title=Kleig-Light Kleigl |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1957/07/13/1957_07_13_020_TNY_CARDS_000256713 |journal=The New Yorker |location=New York City |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Klages |first=Bill |date=January 5, 2012 |title=What's a Klieg Light? |url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/insight/0083/whats-a-klieg-light/211147 |journal=TV Technology |publisher=NewBay Media |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/klieg+light |title=Klieg light|website=Thesarus.com |accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://wordsmith.org/words/klieg_light.html |title=Klieg light |website=Wordsmith.org |accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=The Klieg Light Magazine|url=http://theklieglight.com/ |journal= |location= |publisher= |date= |accessdate= January 7, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=Klieg Magazine |url=http://kliegmagazine.blogspot.com/ |journal= |location= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etiquettehell.com/?p=3272 |title=Dimming The Klieg Lights On Drama Queens And Kings |date=May 16, 2012 |website=Etiquette Hell |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=THE CONGRESS: Duel under the Klieg Lights|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853157,00.html |journal=Time Magazine |location=New York City |publisher=Time Inc.  |date=August 18, 1947 |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Gallo |first=Bill |date=December 21, 2000 |title=Klieg Lights in Vermont|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-12-21/film/klieg-lights-in-vermont/ |journal=Phoenix New Times|location=Phoenix, Arizona |publisher=Kurtis Barton |accessdate=January 7, 2014 [/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

The company was founded in 1896 in New York City when a Bavarian immigrant, Anton Kliegl, in
partnership with A. H. Guendel,  purchased the Myerhofer Electric Stage Lighting Company, and
renamed it the Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company. A year later his older brother Johann Kliegl replaced Guendel, and the firm became known as the Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company. From its infancy as a firm so small that its proprietors also worked as stagehands to supplement their income,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=92034 |title=Kliegl Brothers |date= |website=Internet Broadway Database |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |quote=Lists 16 shows produced between 1901 and 1917 with the Kliegl Brothers listed as either stage electrician or lighting designer.[/tpl] it grew to be one of the largest, if not the largest, firms in North America manufacturing lighting and control equipment for the theatre and television stage.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |date=October 1933 |title=Unpublished manuscript |encyclopedia=Dr. Joel E.

===Factories===

In the beginning, the firm occupied the Meyerhofer facilities in the old Star Theatre at 842 Broadway, New York City.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year=1898 |title=Earliest published catalog |encyclopedia=Dr. Joel E.

By 1966 an annex had been opened two blocks away to meet the press of business. By 1966 "NY/LA" appeared on drawing title blocks, denoting their last expansion, the opening of a branch sales/engineering office in Los Angeles under George Howard. By 1979 "LA" had vanished from the title blocks.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year= |title=Theatre Lighting Drawings Collection.

===Management===

Johann Kliegl was born in Bad Kissingen, Bavaria, German Empire in 1869, and his brother Anton in 1872.[tpl]cite book|first=Gerhard |last=Wulz |title=Der Kapellenfriedhof in Bad Kissingen.

There they both started working in a factory which manufactured electric arc lamps.
Throughout their lives, the two brothers maintained close ties to Bad Kissingen, and endowed there a school, still extant, and grown to encompass grade, middle and high school divisions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anton-kliegl-mittelschule.de/ |title=Anton-Kliegl-Mittelschule Bad Kissingen|date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl] Many of their employees were brought over from Bad Kissingen, such that the "patois" on the factory floor was known to the staff as "50th Street Deutsch". Anton, in fact, died in Bad Kissengen on May 19, 1927.
Management was retained by the Kliegl family throughout the history of the firm. Johann remained active until a few days prior to his death on September 30, 1959. His son, Herbert Kliegl, was by that time the managing head of the firm, and remained so until a few weeks before his death on October 3, 1968.[tpl]cite news |title=Obituary of Herbert Kliegl |url= |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City, New York |publisher= |date=October 9, 1968 |accessdate= [/tpl] Control then passed to Herbert's son John H.

At the time of the firm's founding, electric lighting for the stage was in its infancy. Held finds no catalog of stage lighting equipment earlier than Kliegl's catalog of 1898.[tpl]cite journal |last=Held |first=McDonald Watkins |year=1955 |title=A History of Stage Lighting in the United States in the Nineteenth Century|url= |journal=Doctoral dissertation |publisher=Northwestern University [/tpl] as cited in Rubin[tpl]cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Joel Edward |year=1960 |title=The technical development of stage lighting apparatus in the United States, 1900-1950 |url=http://dissexpress.umi.com/dxweb/results.html?QryTxt=&By=&Title=&pubnum=6001373 |journal=Doctoral dissertation |publisher=Stanford University [/tpl][tpl]page numbers|page 72, note 39[/tpl]. Indeed, it may be inferred that the use of "Electric" in the company's name was intended to distinguish its products from the illuminating gas or acetylene fueled equipment they would replace. Many of what became common devices, such as the stage "shoe" or thrust plug and the disappearing footlight were patented by the Kliegls, and many others were developed into the forms still familiar today[tpl]Citation| inventor-last =Kliegl| inventor-first =John H.| publication-date =July 22, 1907| issue-date =July 05, 1910| title =Plug-switch| country-code =US| description =| patent-number =963733| ref =[/tpl][tpl]Citation| inventor-last =Kliegl| inventor-first =Anton T.| publication-date =May 25, 1914| issue-date =June 01, 1915| title =Stage-footlights| country-code =US| description =| patent-number =1141122| ref =[/tpl]
Initially they continued the Myerhofer business as "contractors and manufacturers", as noted in their Catalog G of 1913.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.klieglbros.com/ |title=Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company Collectors Society |date= |website=klieglbros.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl] In 1903 they furnished and installed the complete stage lighting system for the Metropolitan Opera Company's new home on West 37th Street (John was at the time an electrician for the Met).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www3.northern.edu/wild/LiteDes/ldhist.htm |title=A Brief Outline of the History of Stage Lighting |last=Wild |first=Larry |date= |website= |publisher=Northern State University |location=Aberdeen, South Dakota |accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl]as cited in[tpl]page numbers|page93[/tpl] In 1933 they would be again called to provide a complete new stage lighting system, although not as installers. Catalog G also displayed the carbon arc floodlight, developed by the firm in 1911, as the iconic Klieglight. A diverse assortment of lighting and electrical products were also cataloged, such as exit signs, backup batteries, dimmer boards, connectors, effect projectors, chandeliers, marquee lights (and complete marquees), charging outlets for electric cars, switchboards, etc. Featured was a "Skyrocket" sign for Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.For illustrations of the company's products from the early era of incandescent lighting, see [tpl]cite book |last=Izenour |first=George C. |title= Theater Technology |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BQWXvNVyNI4C&pg=PR15&dq=Kliegl+Bros.+Universal&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9wvPUrOpG4r4oASxjYKQBw&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Kliegl%20Bros.%20Universal%20Stage%20Lighting%20catalog&f=false |page=127 |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University |edition=2nd |year=1996 |isbn= 9780300067668 [/tpl]
The development of electrical standards was spurred, in part, by the Iroquois Theatre fire of 1903. Kliegl Brothers' Catalog E states that "plugs and receptacles are in accordance with Underwriter's requirements and pass city inspections"[tpl]page numbers|page 10[/tpl]. The Kliegls maintained a direct interest in the development of standards for theatre electrical systems. From 1950 to his death, Herbert Kliegl was a member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code making panel No. 115.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year= |title= |encyclopedia=Archives |publisher=National Fire Protection Association |location= |id= [/tpl]
A precursor of today's spotlights, the "baby spotlight", their first using an incandescent lamp, was introduced in their Catalog E of 1906 as cited in Rubin [tpl]page numbers|page 84[/tpl]. The takeover of the incandescent lamp would be inexorable.[tpl]cite journal |date=July 14, 1917 |title=Replacing the Arc Lamps in Stage Lighting |url= |journal=Electrical Review |publisher= |volume=LXXI |issue=2 |pages= |doi= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |date=August 1917 |title=Kliegl Stage Lamp Designed to Use 1000-Watt Gas Filled Lamps |url= |journal=Electrical Record |publisher= |volume=XXI |issue=2 |pages= |doi= [/tpl] as cited in Rubin [tpl]page numbers|page93, note 66[/tpl] From about 1908, motion picture studios were using the company's floor-stand arc lamps, which allowed for point-source lighting, including some of the first low-light effects; the shadow produced by the two pairs of carbon rods can be seen in some early films.[tpl]cite book |editor-last=Abel |editor-first=Richard |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hFxwX-dM008C&pg=PA385&dq=Kliegl+Bros.+characteristic+shadow&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EQ7PUuGpBM3aoASojoDYCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Kliegl%20Bros.%20characteristic%20shadow&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Early Cinema |page=385 |location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn= 9780415234405 [/tpl]
In their 1922 catalog, the company was still featuring its motion picture studio equipment, but by 1926, references to motion picture applications had dwindled to a single line of type on the first page. In 1924 they introduced the use of glass rondels as color media in border and footlights, eliminating coloring of individual lamps.[tpl]cite journal |date=January 1924 |title=Detachable color globes: A new feature embodied in stage lighting equipment|url= |journal=Architecture and Building |publisher= |volume=LVI |issue=1 |pages= |doi= [/tpl]
Kliegl Brothers introduced its Fresnel lens spots in 1929, and by 1935 were ordering their own Fresnel lenses from Corning. as cited in Rubin[tpl]page numbers|page 171[/tpl]
Pages devoted to Kliegl products in the 1928/29 catalogs of retailers such as Holzmueller on the west coast and wholesalers like Marle in Stamford, Connecticut, showed that their sales now extended well beyond their own factory. The condensed catalog of 1929 for the first time lists a broader range of "Mazda" (incandescent lamps) than arc spots. By 1930, the "Mazda" name has vanished, yielding to "incandescents".
In 1932, the Kliegl brothers installed their new ellipsoidal reflector spotlights in the Center Theatre in Radio City.[tpl]cite book |last=Burris-Meyer |first=Harold |year=1949 |title=Theatres & auditoriums|url=http://www.archive.org/details/theatres00burr  |location=New York |publisher=Reinhold Pub. Corp  |isbn= |accessdate=January 10, 2014 [/tpl] Based on the new GE T14 medium bipost lamps, these had triple the efficiency of the standard plano convex spots. They were demonstrated to a meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society on April 19, 1933[tpl]page numbers|page 186[/tpl]  and introduced as a standard product in Catalog B of 1933 as "Klieglights" [tpl]page numbers|page 187, note 75[/tpl] and billed on pages 42–45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as "The New Klieglight".
Catalog 40 of 1936 introduced a full line of architectural downlights (individual architectural products had been made for some time), the autotransformer dimmer (originally dubbed the "Transtat", the catalog was overstamped, changing the trade name to "Autrastat"), motor operated dimmers, fresnel lens spots, etc. At the same time, the more obsolete and exotic products began to disappear.
This catalog also introduced "Alzak" reflectors, Alzak being a proprietary process for producing a mirror-like finish on aluminium. Under agreement with the process owner, Alcoa, Kliegl Brothers created reflectors using the Alzak process for their own use and for sale at the Kliegl Reflector Company, a separate subsidiary plant located on 11th Avenue between 33rd and 34th streets (opposite the location of the present Javits Center). Major was the only other licensee for stage lighting reflectors.[tpl]page numbers|page 205[/tpl]
An interesting specialty, prominently featured in this catalog, but dating to the first catalog, was the effect projector, in which rotating, hand painted, transparent discs rotated before projector spots. Precise optical lenses spread the image to beam lighted patterns or images, ranging from a simple snowfall to the elaborate "Christ Rising to Heaven with Three Angels", onto a stage backdrop. Six artists sat before the tall 50th Street windows on the third floor hand painting the tiny images which would be magnified many times when in use.[tpl]page numbers|pagees 10-11[/tpl] These were used not only on stage, but also in architectural applications.[tpl]cite news |date=October 27, 2002 |title= |url= |newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal |location=Akron, Ohio |publisher= |section=1 STAR|page=F7 |accessdate= [/tpl] By 1960, effect projectors had been made obsolete by film, and later, computer-generated projections.
By catalog T61, issued in 1954, the arc spots were represented by a single model, while the Klieglight line offered models ranging from 250 watt to 3000 watt spots. The company was also offering their "Dynabeam" lensed follow spot, and fresnels from 100 to 2000 watts. In that era of patch panels and small numbers of high wattage dimmers, Kliegl Brothers
offered its "Safpatch" patch panels, and "Rotolector" rotary power switches, both developed by Herbert Kliegl. Both products interlocked the electrical contacts with a circuit breaker, preventing arcs while switching or patching.[tpl]Citation | inventor-last =Kliegl| inventor-first =Herbert A.| publication-date = May 25, 1954 | issue-date = March 08, 1955 | title = Trademark serial number 71667038, registration number 0602956 | description = Safpatch | url = http://trademarks.justia.com/716/67/safpatch-71667038.html [/tpl][tpl]Citation | inventor-last =Kliegl| inventor-first =Herbert A.| publication-date = December 22, 1950 | issue-date = September 11, 1951 | title = Trademark serial number 71608009, registration Number 0548015 | description = Rotolector | url = http://trademarks.justia.com/716/08/rotolector-71608009.html [/tpl][tpl]Citation | inventor-last =Kliegl | inventor-first =Herbert A. | publication-date =Jul 29, 1950 | issue-date =Apr 22, 1952 | title =Selector switch | country-code =US | description = | patent-number =2594181 | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2594181[/tpl]
From the beginning of the firm's operations, custom products were readily available. Indeed, the craft shop system used throughout its history made little differentiation between custom and standard products.  High-end lighting designers regularly sought out Kliegl Brothers, who could design and produce the hardware that would fulfill their visions. Often, the custom product made its mark on the industry, such as the wall washers designed for the UN General Assembly room, or the fluorescent wall washers for New York's Pan American (now Met Life) building lobby, both designed by Herbert Kliegl. A custom oddity was the scoreboard designed for Madison Square Garden, across 50th Street from the factory. This remained in use until the relocation of the Garden to its current home atop Penn Station.
Until 1959 Kliegl provided controls as an assembler of equipment purchased or licensed from others. Resistance plates and variable brush autotransformers were largely purchased from Ward Leonard; magnetic amplifiers from General Electric. Thyratron dimmers were manufactured under license from Strand Electric of England. All this started to change in 1958.
In 1959 the first commercially viable solid state theatre dimmer, Kliegl's SCR(R), was introduced as model R59.[tpl]Citation | inventor-last =Kliegl | inventor-first =Herbert A. | publication-date =November 28, 1958 | issue-date =March 15, 1960 | title =Trademark serial number 72063321, registration number 0694481 | country-code = | description =Brightness Controls for Electrical Lighting | url =http://www.tmquest.com/72063321.htm [/tpl][tpl]Citation | inventor-last =Sutherland| inventor-first =Macklem F | publication-date =Dec 8, 1958| issue-date =Jan 5, 1960 | title =Theater lighting control system | country-code =US | description = | url =http://www.google.com/patents/US2920240 | patent-number =2920240[/tpl] Improved models followed. Within two years, the solid state dimmer had, as a practical matter, swept away all other dimming systems.
In the 1960s, like other theatrical suppliers, the company was making more from amateur theatre companies than from either film or professional theatre.[tpl]cite news |last=Dusseault |first=Norm |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19620610&id=uNwqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LFIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3199,5111149 |title=Cuelines: Amateur theatre is big—and it's getting bigger |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=June 10, 1962 [/tpl] In 1977, the company received permission to start a Toronto subsidiary.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19770708&id=cJcuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2095,1509378 |title=FIRA approves sale of two clothing firms |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |date=July 8, 1977 [/tpl] But by the 1978 series of catalog brochures, product development had significantly slowed down. An attempt to build a modern control console had failed, and the control systems had been largely outsourced. Luminaire and accessory lines had further narrowed, and the trend was inexorable. Unable to compete in a world of low-cost mass production, the firm finally ceased operations in 1996.

===Klieglight===

The first "Klieglight" was a powerful carbon arc light designed for the motion picture industry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/klieg%20light |title= Definition of klieg light|date= |website=Merriam-Webster dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=January 9, 2014[/tpl] It was not the first arc light offered by the company (arc floods are offered in their bulletin "Stage Lighting Apparatus and Effects of Every Description", published prior to 1906), and nor was it a spotlight.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year= |title=Item 11 |encyclopedia=Dr. Joel E. Rubin Collection |publisher=Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Library |location=Ohio State University [/tpl] Its first listing is in Catalog G of 1913, where it is shown as a horizontal wide flood. None of the surviving catalogs, through to its disappearance from the company's product line, describe any other lighting instrument as a "Klieglight", with all arc spotlights uniformly described as "arc spotlights". "Klieglight", however, reappears on pages 42–45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as the name of their new line of ellipsoidal reflector incandescent spotlights, and this usage continued as long as the company was in existence. Oddly enough, the company apparently did not attempt to trademark the name, although there was a filing for a logo that was never carried through.[tpl]Citation| inventor-last =| inventor-first =| publication-date =April 24, 1986| issue-date =| title =Filing for logo.
