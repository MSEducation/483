The Jaguar XK150 is a sports car produced by Jaguar between 1957 and 1961. It replaced the XK140.
Initially it was available in Fixed Head Coupé (FHC) and Drophead Coupé (DHC) versions. The Roadster (XK150 OTS - Open Two-Seat) was launched in 1958. Minimal rear seats were fitted in the coupés.

==History==

Although bearing a family resemblance to the XK120 and XK140, the XK150 was radically revised. A one-piece windscreen replaced the split screen, and the wing line no longer dropped so deeply at the doors. The widened bonnet opened down to the wings, and on the Roadster the windscreen frame was moved back [tpl]convert|4|in|mm|0[/tpl] to make the bonnet longer. The car was available at various times in Red, Pearl Grey, White, Indigo Blue, Claret, Cotswold Blue, Black, Mist Grey, Sherwood Green, Carmen Red, British Racing Green, Cornish Grey, and Imperial Maroon.
The XK140's walnut dashboard was replaced by one trimmed in leather. On the early Drophead Coupés, the aluminium centre dash panel, which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. On the front parking lights, which were located atop the wings (fenders), a little red light reminded the driver the lights were on.[tpl]cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0-7894-0159-2[/tpl]
Suspension and chassis were very similar to the XK140, and steering was by rack and pinion; power steering was not offered. The standard engine, the similar to the XK140, but with an new "B" type cylinder head, was the 3.4 litre DOHC Jaguar straight-6 rated at 180 SAE bhp at 5750 rpm but most cars were fitted with the SE engine whose modified cylinder head (B type) and larger exhaust valves boosted the power to 210 SAE bhp at 5500 rpm. Twin [tpl]convert|1.75|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] SU HD6 carburettors were fitted.
While the first XK150s were slower than their predecessors, the deficit was corrected in the spring of 1958 with a 3.4-litre "S" engine whose three [tpl]convert|2|in|mm|sing=on[/tpl] SU HD8 carburettors and straight-port cylinder head increased power to a claimed 250 SAE bhp.
For 1960, the 3.4 litre engine was bored to 3.8 litres, rating this option at [tpl]convert|220|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in standard tune or [tpl]convert|265|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in "S" form. A 3.8 litre 150S could top [tpl]convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and go from 0–60 mph in around 7.0 seconds. Fuel economy was 18mpg. Four-wheel Dunlop [tpl]convert|12|in|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] disc brakes appeared for the first time although it was theoretically possible to order a car with drums.  When leaving the factory the car originally fitted either 6.00 × 16 inch Dunlop Road Speed tyres as standard, or you could specify 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 as a radial option on either 16 × 5K½ solid wheels (basic models) or 16 × 5K wire wheels.Paul Skilleter, Jaguar Sports Cars, pp.312 ISBN 0-85429-166-0.

==Performance==

A 250 bhp 3.4 litre XK150S Fixed-Head Coupé with limited slip differential was tested by The Motor in 1959. It had a top speed of [tpl]convert|132|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] and could accelerate from 0–[tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 7.8 seconds. Fuel consumption of [tpl]convert|22.0|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus[/tpl] was recorded. The test car cost £2110 including taxes of £623. It was at the time the fastest closed car the magazine had ever subjected to a full road test.[tpl]cite journal | authorlink = Unsigned |title = The Jaguar XK150S Fixed-head Coupé| journal =The Motor| volume = | pages = | date = 10 June 1959[/tpl]
