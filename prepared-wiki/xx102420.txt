So What is the third album by Joe Walsh, released in 1974 (see 1974 in music).  It contains hard rock such as "Welcome To The Club" and a remake of the Barnstorm track, "Turn To Stone".  It also contains more introspective material such as "Help Me Through The Night" and "Song For Emma", a tribute to Walsh's daughter who had been killed in a car accident the previous year.http://www.linter.org/stories/walsh.html On a few tracks, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and Randy Meisner of the Eagles contributed background vocals. Over a year and a half later, Walsh would be drafted into the Eagles to replace Bernie Leadon.  So What was originally released by ABC Records in 1974 and re-issued by MCA Records in 1979.  

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Ben Davies wrote of the album "A number of classic Walsh tracks are featured, including a more polished version of "Turn to Stone," originally featured on his debut album, Barnstorm, in a somewhat more riotous style... Most of the nine tracks feature solos of unquestionable quality in his usual rock style. The classic rock genre that the man so well defined with his earlier albums is present here throughout, and it is pulled off with the usual unparalleled Joe Walsh ability."
