CATEGORIES: Julian Alps, Natura 2000 in Slovenia

The Julian Alps ([tpl]lang-sl|Julijske Alpe[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|Alpi Giulie[/tpl]) are a mountain range of the Southern Limestone Alps that stretches from northeastern Italy to Slovenia, where they rise to 2,864 m at Mount Triglav, the highest peak in Slovenia and former Yugoslavia. They are named after Julius Caesar, who founded the municipium of Cividale del Friuli at the foot of the mountains. A large part of the Julian Alps is included in Triglav National Park. The second highest peak Jôf di Montasio or slovenian Montaž 2755 m lies in neighbouring Italy.
Julian Alps cover an estimated  4400 km² (of which 1542 km² lies in Slovenia). They are located between Sava valley and Kanalska Dolina.  They are divided into Eastern  and Western Julian Alps.
