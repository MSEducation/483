Reno is a city in the US state of Nevada. Known as "The Biggest Little City in the World",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/ |title=City of Reno : Home |publisher=Reno.gov |accessdate=2013-01-16 [/tpl] Reno is famous for its casinos. The city is situated in the northwestern part of the state and is the county seat of Washoe County. Reno is the most populous Nevada city outside of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 225,221 making it the fourth most populous city in the state after Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas.[tpl]cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Reno city, Nevada| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 15, 2013[/tpl] The city sits in a high desert valley at the foot of the Sierra Nevada.
Reno is the birthplace of Caesars Entertainment Corporation.The Reno–Sparks metropolitan area is informally called the Truckee Meadows and consists of nearly 500,000 residents.[tpl]cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Reno-Sparks-Fernley, NV CSA| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 15, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric Martis people in the Reno area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sagehen.ucnrs.org/CSFRS/petros.htm |title=North Fork petroglyphs |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |last=Brauman |first=Sharon K. |date=October 6, 2004 |publisher=ucnrs.org[/tpl]
As early as the 1850s a few pioneers settled in the Truckee Meadows, a relatively fertile valley through which the Truckee River made its way from Lake Tahoe to Pyramid Lake. In addition to subsistence farming, these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the California Trail, which followed the Truckee westward, before branching off towards Donner Lake, where the formidable obstacle of the Sierra Nevada began.
Gold was discovered in the vicinity of Virginia City in 1850, and a modest mining community developed, but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the Comstock Lode led to a mining rush.
To provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River in 1859. A small community that would service travelers soon grew up near the bridge. After two years, Fuller sold the bridge to Myron C. Lake, who continued to develop the community with the addition of a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it "Lake's Crossing". In 1864, Washoe County was consolidated with Roop County, and Lake's Crossing became the largest town in the county. Lake had earned himself the title "founder of Reno".Guy Louis Rocha, "Reno's First Robber Baron," Nevada Magazine 40,2(March–April 1980), p. 28.
By January 1863, the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from Sacramento, California, eventually connecting with the Union Pacific Railroad at Promontory, Utah, to form the First Transcontinental Railroad. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for its promise to build a depot at Lake's Crossing. Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] CPRR construction superintendent Charles Crocker named the community after Major General Jesse Lee Reno, a Union officer killed in the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain.
In 1871, Reno became the county seat of the newly expanded Washoe County, replacing the previous county seat, located in Washoe City. However, political power in Nevada remained with the mining communities, first Virginia City and later Tonopah and Goldfield.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
The extension of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to Reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city's economy.  In the following decades, Reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between Sacramento and Salt Lake City.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
As the mining boom waned early in the 20th century, Nevada's centers of political and business activity shifted to the non-mining communities, especially Reno and Las Vegas, and today the former mining metropolises stand as little more than ghost towns. Despite this, Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after South Africa and Australia; the state yielded 6.9 percent of the world's supply in 2005 world gold production.[tpl]cite web|author=John_O'Neill_100001295309124 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/gold-hits-record-high |title=ReviewJournal.com – News – Gold hits record high |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=January 9, 2008 [/tpl]
The "Reno Arch" was erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the upcoming Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927. The arch included the words "Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition" and the dates of the exposition. After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch. No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929, with "Reno, The Biggest Little City in the World".http://isgreaterthan.net/2010/07/sign-of-the-times-the-history-of-the-reno-arch/Barbara Land, "A Short History of Reno",http://books.google.com/books?id=Qnd10DuA37MC&source=gbs_navlinks_s, 2005
Reno took a leap when the state of Nevada legalized open-gambling in 1931, along with the passage of even more liberal divorce laws than places like Hot Springs, Arkansas, offered. No other state offered what Nevada did in the 1930s, and casinos like the Bank Club and Palace were popular.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
Within a few years, the Bank Club, owned by George Wingfield, Bill Graham, and Jim McKay, was the state's largest employer and the largest casino in the world. Wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits, along with his rent.Moe, Al W. The Roots of Reno, http://www.amazon.com/Roots-Reno-Al-W-Moe/dp/143921199X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1322253439&sr=1-1Booksurge, 2008, p.153
Ernie Pyle once wrote in one of his columns, "All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were obviously there to get divorces." In Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead, published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, "I am going to Reno," which is taken as a different way of saying "I am going to divorce my husband." Among others, the Belgian-French writer Georges Simenon, at the time living in the U.S., came to Reno in 1950 in order to divorce his first wife.
The divorce business eventually died as the other states fell in line by passing their own laws easing the requirements for divorce, but gambling continued as a major Reno industry. While gaming pioneers like "Pappy" and Harold Smith of Harold's Club and Bill Harrah of the soon-to-dominate Harrah's casino set up shop in the 1930s, the war years of the 1940s cemented Reno as the place to play for two decades.Moe, Al W. Nevada's Golden Age of Gambling, Puget Sound Books, 2002, p.68 Beginning in the 1950s, the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation.
A disaster occurred on the afternoon of February 5, 1957, when an explosion ripped through the heart of downtown. At 1:03 pm, two explosions, caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city, and an ensuing fire destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of Sierra and First streets along the Truckee River. Forty-nine people were injured in the disaster, and two were killed. The first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of Sierra Street (now the site of the Century Riverside), the second, across Sierra Street, now the site of the Palladio.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
The presence of a main east-west rail line, the emerging interstate highway system, favorable state tax climate, and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
In the 1980s, Indian gaming rules were relaxed, and starting in 2000 Californian Native casinos began to chip away at Reno's casino industry.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/with-gambling-in-decline-reno-struggles-to-reinvent-itself.html | work=The New York Times | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | title=With Gambling in Decline, Reno Struggles to Reinvent Itself | date=July 14, 2012[/tpl] Major new construction projects have been completed in the Reno and Sparks areas. A few new luxury communities were recently built in Truckee, California, approximately [tpl]convert|28|mi[/tpl] west of Reno on Interstate 80. Reno also is an outdoor recreation destination, due to its close proximity to the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe, and numerous ski resorts in the region.[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]
In more recent years, the city has gained some notoriety as the subject of the comedy series Reno 911! (which is not, however, filmed in the city).[tpl]citation needed|date = August 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

===Environmental factors===

Wetlands are an important part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home for over 75% of the species in the Great Basin. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.
The Truckee River serves as Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with [tpl]convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out[/tpl] of water a day during the summer, and [tpl]convert|40|e6U.S.gal[/tpl] of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two water treatment plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. As an attempt to save water, golf courses in Reno, like Arrow Creek Golf Course, have been using treated effluent water instead of treated water from one of Reno's water plants.
The Reno-Sparks wastewater treatment plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30 million U.S. gallons (70 to 110 million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, nitrogen, and phosphorus, aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of Pyramid Lake. Local agencies working with the Environmental Protection Agency have developed a number of watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded effluent discharge; to accomplish this successful outcome, the DSSAM Model was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River in order to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. 1987. Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River, Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C.  The resulting management strategies included a package of measures such as land use controls in the Lake Tahoe basin, urban runoff controls in Reno and Sparks, and best management practices for wastewater discharge.
The Reno area is frequently subject to wildfires, causing property damage and sometimes loss of life. In August 1960, the Donner Ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days.[tpl]cite book| title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region: Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology Special Publication 34| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA53| year=2007| publisher=NV Bureau of Mines & Geology| isbn=1-888035-11-0|page=53|accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl] In November 2011, arcing from powerlines caused a fire in Caughlin in southwest Reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one older man, and only two months later in January 2012 another fire in Washoe Drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one older woman. Around 10,000 residents were evacuated, and a state of emergency was declared. The fires came at the end of Reno's longest recorded dry spell.[tpl]cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/wildfires/story/2012-01-20/reno-nevada-fire/52688260/1| title='Remorseful' man admits he caused Reno blaze| last=Magerum| first=Liz| agency=Associated Press| date=January 20, 2012| work=USA Today| accessdate=February 2, 2012[/tpl]

===Geology===

Reno is situated just east of the Sierra Nevada on the western edge of the Great Basin at an elevation of about [tpl]convert|4400|ft[/tpl] above sea level. Numerous faults exist throughout the region. Most of these are normal (vertical motion) faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.
In February 2008, an earthquake swarm began to occur, with some quakes registering between 4 and 4.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquakes were centered around the Somersett community in western Reno near the areas of Mogul and Verdi. Many homes in these areas were damaged.[tpl]cite web| title=Swarm of earthquakes shakes Reno area| date=April 30, 2008| url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/04/30/20080430renoquakes0430-ON.html| author=Ashley Powers| coauthors=Thomas H. Maugh II| work=Los Angeles Times| accessdate=August 27, 2008[/tpl]

===Climate===

Reno sits in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Annual rainfall averages [tpl]convert|7.48|in|mm|0[/tpl]. Despite this low amount of rainfall per year, Reno features a steppe climate (Köppen: BSk) due to its low evapotranspiration. Annual precipitation has ranged from [tpl]convert|1.55|in|mm|1[/tpl] in 1947 to [tpl]convert|13.23|in|mm|1[/tpl] in 1983. The most precipitation in one month was [tpl]convert|5.25|in|mm|1[/tpl] in December 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was [tpl]convert|2.29|in|mm|1[/tpl] on January 21, 1943.  Winter has snowfall which is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days, averaging [tpl]convert|21.5|in|cm|0[/tpl] annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19–23 inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the Reno–Tahoe International Airport at [tpl]convert|4404|ft[/tpl], while the foothills of the Carson Range to the west ranging from [tpl]convert|4700|to|5600|ft[/tpl] in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive up to two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the Virginia Range to the east can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above [tpl]convert|5500|ft[/tpl]. However, Snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in the city in one year was [tpl]convert|63.8|in|cm|0[/tpl] in 1971, and the most snowfall in one month was [tpl]convert|29.0|in|cm|0[/tpl] in March 1952.
Most rainfall occurs in winter and spring.  The city has 300 days of sunshine per year. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a "Washoe Zephyr", can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upwards against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.[tpl]cite web |title=Reno, NV |url=http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno %7CReno Tahoe Visitors website |accessdate=June 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA71&dq=climate+of+reno+tahoe#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Google Books |publisher=Google Books|isbn=9781888035117|date=June 2007 [/tpl]

The all-time record high temperature is [tpl]convert|108|°F|0[/tpl], which occurred on July 10 and 11, 2002, and again on July 5, 2007. The all-time record low temperature is [tpl]convert|-17|°F|0[/tpl], which occurred on January 21, 1916. In addition, the region is windy throughout the year; observers such as Mark Twain have commented about the "Washoe Zephyr", northwestern Nevada's distinctive wind.

==Economy==

Before the late 1950s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but in the last twenty years Las Vegas' rapid growth, American Airlines' 2000 buyout of Reno Air, and the growth of Native American gaming in California have reduced its business. Older casinos were either torn down (Mapes Hotel, Fitzgerald's Nevada Club, Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, Harold's Club, Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the Comstock, Sundowner, Golden Phoenix, Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into condos.
Because of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, while Las Vegas has historically served more tourists from Southern California and the Phoenix area.
Several local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the Virginia Street core. These larger hotel casinos are the Atlantis, the Peppermill and the Grand Sierra Resort. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by Casino Player and Nevada magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Hotel Casino began a $300 million Tuscan-themed expansion.
In an effort to bring more tourism to the area, Reno holds several events throughout the year, most of which have been extremely successful. They include Hot August Nights[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.hotaugustnights.net/ |title=Hot August Nights |publisher=Hot August Nights |accessdate=August 12, 2010[/tpl] (a classic car convention), Street Vibrations (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), The Great Reno Balloon Race, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, bowling tournaments (held in the National Bowling Stadium), and the Reno Air Races.
Several large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as The Summit in 2007 and Legends at Sparks Marina in 2008.
Reno is the location of the corporate headquarters for numerous companies, including Braeburn Capital, Hamilton, EE Technologies, Port of Subs, and PC-Doctor. International Game Technology, Bally Technologies and GameTech have development and manufacturing presence in Reno.

==Recreation==

Reno is home to a variety of recreation activities including both seasonal and year-round. In the summer, Reno locals can be found near three major bodies of water: Lake Tahoe, the Truckee River, and Pyramid Lake. The Truckee River originates at Lake Tahoe and flows west to east through the center of downtown Reno before terminating at Pyramid Lake to the north. The river is a major part of Artown, held in the summer at Wingfield Park. Washoe Lake is a popular kite and windsurfing location because of its high wind speeds during the summer.
Skiing and snowboarding are among the most popular winter sports and draw in many tourists. There are 18 ski resorts[tpl]cite web |title=About Reno-Sparks |url=http://www.reno-sparkschamber.org/visitation.htm |publisher=Reno Sparks Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=September 3, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] (8 major resorts) located as close as [tpl]convert|11|mi[/tpl] and as far as [tpl]convert|98|mi[/tpl] from the Reno–Tahoe International Airport, including Northstar California, Sierra-at-Tahoe, Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, Sugar Bowl, Diamond Peak, Heavenly Mountain, and Mount Rose.

==Government==

Reno has a democratic municipal government. The city council is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the primary by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the city-wide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.
There is an elected city attorney who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.
The city's charter calls for a council-manager form of government, meaning that the council appoints only two positions, the city manager, who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the city clerk. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.
In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body.[tpl]cite news |title=Combining local governments is questioned on ballot issue |first=Susan |last=Voyles |date=October 24, 2010 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20101024/NEWS19/10240345/1321/news [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] 54% of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.[tpl]cite news |title=Election Results: Nevada |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/nevada [/tpl]

===Transportation===

====Roads====

Reno was historically served by the Victory Highway and a branch of the Lincoln Highway. After the formation of the U.S. Numbered Highways system, U.S. Route 40 was routed along 4th Street through downtown Reno, before being replaced by Interstate 80. The primary north-south highway through Reno is U.S. Route 395/Interstate 580.
The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County (RTC) has a bus system that provides intracity buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rtcwashoe.com/public-transportation-5 |title=RTC Washoe |publisher=RTC Washoe |accessdate=August 12, 2010[/tpl] The bus system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at Meadowood Mall in south Reno.
Numerous shuttle and excursion services are offered connecting the Reno–Tahoe International Airport to various destinations:

====Railroads====

Reno was historically a stopover along the First Transcontinental Railroad; the modern Overland Route continues to run through Reno. Reno was historically the southern terminus of the Nevada–California–Oregon Railway (NCO) and the northern terminus of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Using the NCO depot and right of way, the Western Pacific Railroad historically provided rail service to Reno. Downtown Reno has two historic train depots, the inactive Nevada-California-Oregon Railroad Depot and the still active Amtrak depot, originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Amtrak provides daily passenger service to Reno via the California Zephyr and multiple Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches connecting to trains departing from Sacramento.

====Air====

The city is served by Reno–Tahoe International Airport, with general aviation traffic handled by Reno Stead Airport. Reno–Tahoe International Airport is the second busiest commercial airport in the state of Nevada after McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Reno was the hub and headquarters of the defunct airline Reno Air.

===Utilities===

Potable water for the city of Reno is provided by the Truckee Meadows Water Authority. The Truckee River is the primary water source, with purification being done at two plants, Chalk Bluff and Glendale. The Chalk Bluff plant's main intakes are west of Reno in Verdi, with the water flowing through a series of flumes and ditches to the plant itself. Alternative intakes are located below the plant along the banks of the Truckee River itself. The Glendale plant is sited alongside the river, and is fed by a rock and concrete rubble diversion dam a short distance upstream.[tpl]cite web| url=http://tmwa.com/| title=Truckee Meadows Water Authority[/tpl]
Sewage treatment for the majority of the Truckee Meadows region takes place at the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility at the eastern edge of the valley. Treated effluent returns to the Truckee River by way of Steamboat Creek.[tpl]cite web| url=http://cityofsparks.us/departments/community-services/tmwrf| title=Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility[/tpl]
Electrical power and natural gas are provided by NV Energy, formerly Sierra Pacific. Power comes from multiple sources, including Tracy-Clark Station to the east, and the Steamboat Springs binary cycle power plants at the southern end of town.
