[[Arcuate artery of the foot]]

CATEGORIES: Arteries of the lower limb

The arcuate artery of the foot (metatarsal artery) arises a little anterior to the lateral tarsal artery; it passes lateralward, over the bases of the metatarsal bones, beneath the tendons of the extensor digitorum brevis, its direction being influenced by its point of origin; and it anastomoses with the lateral tarsal and lateral plantar arteries. 
This vessel gives off the second, third, and fourth dorsal metatarsal arteries.
It is not present in all individuals.[tpl]cite journal |author=DiLandro AC, Lilja EC, Lepore FL, et al. |title=The prevalence of the arcuate artery: a cadaveric study of 72 feet |journal=J Am Podiatr Med Assoc |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=300â€“5 |year=2001 |pmid=11420348 |doi= |url=http://www.japmaonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11420348[/tpl]
