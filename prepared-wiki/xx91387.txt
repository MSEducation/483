[[Flag of the Kalmar Union]]

CATEGORIES: Obsolete national flags, Nordic Cross flags, Flags of Norway, Kalmar Union

The flag of the Kalmar Union was derived from the Dannebrog, bearing a Nordic Cross. It is known from only two sources, both dated 1430, in which king Eric of Pomerania tried to enforce its use by two monasteries. It remains unknown whether the flag was ever effectively introduced, and it is unknown whether 1430 was the year it was created, given the sparse textual evidence. No actual flags or depictions of it have survived to document its appearance.
The red and yellow colours are also found in the coat of arms of Norway, and they were also the colours of the Danish Archdiocese of Lund. The reconstructed flag is very similar to the flag currently used by the Swedish Church.
Both of the 1430s references refer to the banner of the realm as consisting of a red cross on yellow. In all likelihood this cross would have been set slightly to the left as known from the flag of Denmark and the (subsequent) flags of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. 
From the mid-1990s until its refashioning in 2007, an identical design was flown as an unofficial flag of Orkney.
