Fremantle Croatia H.N.K. Soccer Club is an Australian football (soccer) club from the city of Fremantle, Western Australia. It is a Croatian backed club. It recently took out the Western Australian Amateur League Division 2 title.
The club is a regular participant at the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament.  Fremantle Croatia claimed second position in the Australian-Croatian soccer tournament in 2007 held in Perth losing out to Sydney's FC Ljubuski in the final 1-0.  This runners up placing has been the clubs highest achievement to date having eclipsed a third place finish in Sydney in 2003.  In the latest instalment of this tournament held in Geelong in 2008, the club finished third in their group of 5 clubs in the newly formed division 1, narrowly missing out on a semi-final appearance.
The club has a tight-knit, loyal and ever growing fan base often known as the "Purple Dragons" although the name has no significance with regards to the club colours or name.  The club's theme song is "Croacija iz Fremantlea" (which literally translates to: "Croatia from Fremantle") and is sung to the tune of popular up-beat Croatian song "Dalmacijo".
