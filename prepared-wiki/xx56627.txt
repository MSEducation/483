[[LDraw]]

CATEGORIES: Lego, 3D graphics software

LDraw is a system of free software tools for modeling Lego creations in 3D on a computer.  The LDraw file format[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldraw.org/documentation/ldraw-org-file-format-standards.html|title=The LDraw File Format Standards|work=LDraw.org|author=OrionP|date=25 April 2004|accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl] and original program were written by James Jessiman, although the file format has since evolved. He also modeled many of the original parts in the parts library, which is under continuous maintenance and extension by the LDraw community. In 1997, Jessiman died.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldraw.org/article/222|title= James Jessiman Memorial |work=LDraw.org|quote=On July 25, 1997, James Jessiman passed away.|accessdate=30 January 2012|author=OrionP|date=8 November 2003[/tpl] Since then, a variety of programs have been written that use the LDraw parts library, and file format. LDraw models are frequently rendered in POV-Ray, a free 3D ray tracer.

==LDraw file format==

The LDraw format can divide a model into steps so that the building instructions can be incorporated into the design, and also allows for steps that rotate the camera and even move parts around in an elementary fashion. It also allows for models to be incorporated in the construction of larger models to make design easier. This also makes the file format very disk space saving: instead of specifying the polygons of every single stud of a specific brick for example, a shared stud file is included multiple times with transformation applied.
Parts, models, sub-models and polygons are all treated the same and are not specific to Lego models (only the parts library is). The format could be used to store any type of 3D model. Some have created bricks of other building systems for use with LDraw.
LDraw files specifying basic single parts or sub-primitives usually have the extension .dat, Lego models consisting of multiple bricks have the extension .ldr, models consisting of multiple parts and sub-models are called *.mpd.
The file format uses plain text data.

===Example part===

The above code defines the basic 2Ã—2 brick. It consists of a five-sided box (box5.dat, outside) and an inverted five-sided box (inside), the connection between those two, consisting of four quads (the four lines starting with 4), the four studs on top of it (stud.dat) and the long hollow stud in the inside (stud4.dat).
All lines in an LDraw file are either empty or start with a command number, where 0 means no command (though over time, some lines starting with 0 followed by specific text in capitals also got a meaning as meta commands). The command 1 for example includes a subfile. It specifies the file's path and a transformation matrix that should be applied to it, as well as its color (where 16 means "use the color that was used when including the current file"). Command 4 specifies a four-sided polygon. There are also commands that define 2D lines. Such lines give the parts a clear contour even in non-shaded orthographic renderings.

===Example model===

The following code specifies a simple pyramid model with three layers made of 2 x 4 bricks (brick # 3001) with changing color and a 2 x 2 brick on top.

==Peeron and LDraw==

The LEGO set and parts database hosted at the website www.peeron.com lists parts available as 3D CAD models in the LDraw parts library, with correctly colored images rendered from these models. The Peeron and LDraw team work together to clarify unclear part numbers, colors and names, sometimes using information provided by The LEGO Group[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldraw.org/article/383.html#2007_2008|author= Holly-Wood|date=22 August 2007|title=LDraw Steering Committee Notes 2007/2008|work=LDraw.org|accessdate=30 January 2012[/tpl]
