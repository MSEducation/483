[[Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics]]

CATEGORIES: Slavic studies, Linguistics works, Publications established in 1980

Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics (SSGL) is an academic book series that was founded in 1980 by A.A. Barentsen, B.M. Groen and R. Sprenger and is published by Rodopi.  
SSGL is mainly devoted to the field of descriptive linguistics. Although SSGL is primarily intended to be a means of publication for linguists from the Low Countries, the editors are pleased to accept contributions by linguists from abroad. SSGL appears at irregular intervals, but the editors aim at bringing out on the average one volume a year.
