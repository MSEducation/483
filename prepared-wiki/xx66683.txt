Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is the third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. It was produced by Pierre Marchand in Montreal, released on October 22, 1993 on Nettwerk in Canada and February 5, 1994 on Arista Records in the United States.
The album was an immediate hit in Canada, where McLachlan was already an established star. Over the next two years, it became her breakthrough album internationally as well. However, in some countries, most notably the United States, the album was a steady seller that stayed in the middle ranges of the pop charts for almost two years. As of November 2003, the album has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States."Ask Billboard - FUMBLING TOWARDS SALES". Billboard. Retrieved 28 May 2009.
"Possession", the album's first single, is written from the point of view of an obsessed fan.  Following the album's release, a fan named Uwe Vandrei sued McLachlan for songwriting credit, claiming that his letters were used as the basis of the song. The case never made it to trial as Vandrei was found dead of apparent suicide in November 1994.
Some editions contain an album version of McLachlan's 1995 single used for The Brothers McMullen soundtrack, "I Will Remember You". The track's lyrics do not appear in the booklet, nor strangely does the track's crediting information.
August 5, 2008 saw the release of the 15th anniversary 3-disc edition the album. The set includes the original remastered album, The Freedom Sessions and a DVD that includes live performances, music videos and more. The album was released by Legacy Recordings.
