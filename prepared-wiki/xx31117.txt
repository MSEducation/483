==History==

CCTV Peking (Beijing) Television (北京电视台) or China People's Television Network broadcast its first program on 2 September 1958. Due to increasing demands, it soon launched its second channel in 1963 and third channel in 1969.  Starting from 1 May 1973, Peking Television began broadcasting experimentally in colour on its second channel every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday using the PAL-D system, and fully converted to colour broadcasting by 1977. The network changed its name to CCTV on 1 May 1978."About us", cctv.com, 08-05-2003
Until the late 1970s, CCTV held only evening broadcasts, usually closing down at midnight. During the summer and winter academic vacations, it occasionally transmitted daytime programming for students. In 1980 CCTV experimented with news relays from local and central television studios via microwave.Miller, T. (2003). Television: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies. Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-25502-8. By 1985, CCTV had already become a leading television network in China. In 1987 CCTV's popularity soared due to the adaptation and presentation of Dream of the Red Chamber.  The 36-episode TV series—the first Chinese television drama to enter the global market—Kops, M. & Ollig, S. Internationalization of the Chinese TV Sector. LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2007. pp. 33. ISBN 978-3-8258-0753-5. still remains popular in the international market. In the same year, CCTV exported 10,216 programmes to 77 foreign television stations.
Initially, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued directive censorship of programs. During reform in the 1990s, the Party adopted new standards for CCTV, "affordability" and "acceptability", loosening the previous government control.Kops & Ollig, pp. 34. Affordability refers to purchasing ability of programs, while acceptability requires that a programme has acceptable content, preventing broadcasts of material that contains inappropriate content or holds against the Communist Party of China.Kops & Ollig, pp. 35.
On 2 September 2008 the new CCTV Headquarters was opened on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of CCTV.
In July 2009 CCTV expanded its coverage and target audience by launching CCTV-العربية, its international channel in Arabic language."About Chinese pragmatism"
Today, CCTV has 24 channels, most of them airing 24 hours a day. On 17 June 2013, CCTV announce General channel, News channel, and other 24 public channels starting broadcast on the new site of CCTV.

The organisation has relationships with regional television stations run by local governments, which must reserve up to two channels for the national broadcaster.CCTV: One Network, 1.2 Billion Viewers, Adweek, 5 February 2007.
The organization is considered one of the "big three" media outlets in China, along with the People's Daily and Xinhua.Li, J. & Lee, C. (2000). Power, Money, and Media: Communication Patterns and Bureaucratic Control in Cultural China. Northwestern University Press. ISBN 978-0-8101-1787-7.

CCTV produces its own news broadcasts three times a day and is the country's most powerful and prolific television program producer.
Its thirty-minute evening news, Xinwen Lianbo ("CCTV Network News" or "CCTV Tonight", Chinese:新闻联播),  goes on air daily at 7:00 pm Beijing time. All local stations are required to carry CCTV's news broadcast. An internal CCTV survey indicates that nearly 500 million people countrywide regularly watch this program.The Chinese Media: More Autonomous and Diverse—Within Limits, CIA. However, the figure has slumped in recent years; the program now has 10% of the ratings market, compared to 40% before 1998.CCTV to revamp flagship news program, China Daily, 10 June 2009
Although news reform has been a prominent feature of CCTV networks, the Evening News has remained relatively the same since its first appearance in the early 1980s. Many important political news stories are broadcast through the program.
Focus, first introduced in 1994, is a popular programme on CCTV. This discussion programme regularly exposes the wrongdoings of local officials, which attracts serious attention from higher levels of government. The programme also exposes the Chinese Government's response to the corrupt charges.Shirk, S. L. (2007). China: Fragile Superpower. Oxford University Press US. ISBN 978-0-19-530609-5.

==Audience share==

In 2007, China's television audience rose to 1.2 billion.China's TV audience passes 1.2 billion, Advertising Age, 9 January 2008. The 2008 Summer Olympics coverage on CCTV resulted in an aggregate 41% audience share across its network.China Mass Media Announces Third Quarter 2008 Unaudited Financial Results. Forbes, 24 November 2008. As content becomes more diversified, there have been concerns about the audience share, as CCTV is losing out to cable, satellite and regional networks.Li, J. & Lee, C. Chinese Media, Global Contexts: Global Contexts. Routledge, 2003. pp. 168. ISBN 978-0-415-30334-7. In Guangzhou for example, CCTV programming only accounts for 45% of the weekly audience share,Yuan, Elaine J. (2008). Diversity of exposure in television viewing: audience fragmentation and polarization in Guangzhou Chinese Journal of Communication 1:1, 91 – 108. while in Shanghai, location stations also has  share over CCTV.Wang, J. Brand New China: Advertising, Media, and Commercial Culture. Harvard University Press, 2008. ISBN 978-0-674-02680-3. However, the CCTV New Year's Gala remains extremely popular; it acquires more than 90% audience share over the nation.

==Criticism==

The network's principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State, and so are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China; nearly all of them are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality. Editorial independence is subject to government policy considerations, and as a result, it has been charged with being "propaganda aimed at brainwashing the audience" in its history and news programmes in a letter written by a number of Chinese intellectuals who also called for a boycott of state media was posted on a US-based website and has circulated through Chinese websites.China TV faces propaganda charge, BBC News, 12 January 2009.'Boycott state media' call, The Straits Times, 14 January 2009.
Journalists working for CCTV-NEWS, the network's English-language international channel, are under constant pressure to present a positive account of China, according to Anne-Marie Brady's study published in 2008. "In August 2005, a series of items reported factually on coal mining disaster in China; soon after the channel's leaders received a warning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that its reports were harming China's international image. Following this incident, senior editorial staff and journalists were all forced to write self-criticisms."Anne-Marie Brady, Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China,  Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.
Brady says that while the channel's equipment is state-of-the-art, the employees are not well trained in how to use it, so there are frequent errors during broadcast. "The political controls on the station contribute to a general low level of morale and initiative among station staff," she writes.
A recent study done by the observer of Chinese film and television, Ying Zhu, suggests that “CCTV is full of serious-minded creators who regularly experience bouts of self-doubt, philosophical ambivalence, and in some cases, clinical depression.” During her extensive interviews with key CCTV players, Zhu notes that “Certain common themes, about ideals distorted or altogether thwarted by commercial and political pressure, emerged.”
