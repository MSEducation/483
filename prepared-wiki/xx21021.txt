Charlotte [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑr|l|ə|t[/tpl] is the largest city in the U.S. state of North Carolina and the seat of Mecklenburg County. In 2012, the estimated population of Charlotte according to the U.S. Census Bureau was 775,202, making it the 17th largest city in the United States based on population. The Charlotte metropolitan area ranks 23rd largest in the US and had a 2012 population of 2,296,569.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2012/tables/CBSA-EST2012-01.csv |title=US Census Bureau |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02[/tpl]   The Charlotte metropolitan area is part of a sixteen-county market region or combined statistical area with a 2011 U.S. Census population estimate of 2,493,040.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2008/CBSA-EST2008-02.csv|title=Table 2. Annual Estimates of the Population of Combined Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=December 18, 2008[/tpl] Residents of Charlotte are referred to as "Charlotteans". Charlotte is considered a "Gam­ma+ world city".
The city is a major U.S. financial center[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]. Both Bank of America and the East Coast operations of Wells Fargo are headquartered in the city. Charlotte is also home of the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League, the Charlotte Bobcats of the National Basketball Association, the Charlotte Hounds of Major League Lacrosse, the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Carowinds amusement park, and the U.S. National Whitewater Center.
Nicknamed the Queen City, Charlotte and its resident county received its name in honor of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who had become queen consort of Great Britain the year before the city's founding. A second nickname derives from the American Revolutionary War, when British commander General Cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents, prompting him to write that Charlotte was "a hornet's nest of rebellion", leading to the nickname The Hornet's Nest.
Charlotte has a humid subtropical climate. Charlotte is located several miles east of the Catawba River and southeast of Lake Norman, the largest man-made lake in North Carolina. Lake Wylie and Mountain Island Lake are two smaller man-made lakes located near the city.

==History==

===Before the American Revolution===

Mecklenburg County was initially part of Bath County (1696 to 1729) of New Hanover Precinct, which became New Hanover County in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into Bladen County in 1734, its western portion splitting into Anson County in 1750. Mecklenburg County formed from Anson County in 1762, with further apportionment in 1792, with Cabarrus County formed from Mecklenburg, and in 1842, with Union County formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion.  These areas were all part of one of the original six judicial/military districts of North Carolina known as the Salisbury District.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.carolana.com/NC/Revolution/patriot_militia_nc_salisbury_district.html | title = The American Revolution in North Carolina | work = | accessdate = June 25, 2011[/tpl]
The area that is now Charlotte was settled by people of European descent around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. Thomas Polk (granduncle of U.S. President James K. Polk), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two Native American trading paths between the Yadkin and Catawba rivers.[ref]
</ref>
One path ran north–south and was part of the Great Wagon Road; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street. Within decades of Polk's settling, the area grew to become "Charlotte Town", incorporating in 1768.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~ncmeckle/ |title=Mecklenburg County, North Carolina USGenWeb Project |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=July 2, 2010[/tpl] The crossroads, perched atop the Piedmont landscape, became the heart of Uptown Charlotte.
In 1770, surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development. The east–west trading path became Trade Street, and the Great Wagon Road became Tryon Street, in honor of William Tryon, a royal governor of colonial North Carolina.
The intersection of Trade and Tryon commonly known today as "Trade & Tryon" or, simply, "The Square", is more properly called Independence Square.[ref]
</ref>
While surveying the boundary between the Carolinas in 1772, William Moultrie stopped in Charlotte Town, whose five or six houses were "very ordinary built of logs".[ref]
</ref>
In 1775, local leaders came together and signed the Mecklenburg Resolves, more popularly known as the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. While not a true declaration of independence from British rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the American Revolution. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as "MecDec", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's state flag and state seal also bear the date.

===After the American Revolution===

Charlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern Presbyterianism, but in the 19th century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic, formed, eventually giving Charlotte its nickname, "The City of Churches".
In 1799, in nearby Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17-pound rock, which his family used as a doorstop. Three years later, a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50.Blanchard Online: American Rarities (Retrieved on 05–22–07) The first verified gold find in the United States set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 18th and early 19th century, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina "led the nation in gold production until the California Gold Rush of 1848",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blanchardonline.com/AmericanRarities/archive-08/char.html |title=The Charlotte Branch Mint |publisher=Blanchardonline.com |date= |accessdate=July 2, 2010[/tpl] although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.
Some groups still pan for gold occasionally in local streams and creeks. The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912. The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861, when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.
The city's first boom came after the Civil War, as a cotton processing center and a railroad hub. Charlotte's city population at the 1880 Census grew to 7,084. Population grew again during World War I, when the U.S. government established Camp Greene north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. Many soldiers and suppliers stayed after the war, launching an urban ascent that eventually overtook older city rivals along the Piedmont Crescent.
The city's modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, largely under the leadership of financier Hugh McColl. McColl transformed North Carolina National Bank (NCNB) into a formidable national player that through aggressive acquisitions became known as NationsBank, eventually merging with BankAmerica to become Bank of America. Wachovia experienced similar growth, and was acquired by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. Measured by control of assets, Charlotte is the second largest banking headquarters in the United States after New York City.
On September 22, 1989, the city took a direct hit from Hurricane Hugo. With sustained winds of 69 mph (111 km/h) and gusts of 87 mph (140 km/h) in some locations,Hurricanedisasterslive.com, Retrieved on July 30, 2009 Hugo caused massive property damage, destroyed 80,000 trees, and knocked out electrical power to most of the population. Residents were without power for weeks, schools were closed for a week or more, and cleanup took months. The city was caught unprepared; Charlotte is [tpl]convert|200|mi|km[/tpl] inland, and residents from coastal areas in both Carolinas often wait out hurricanes in Charlotte.
In December 2002, Charlotte and much of central North Carolina were hit by an ice storm (which some dubbed "Hugo on Ice"[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]) that resulted in more than 1.3 million people losing power. During an abnormally cold December, many were without power for weeks. Much of the damage was caused by Bradford pear trees, splitting apart under the weight of the ice.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|297.68|sqmi[/tpl], of which [tpl]convert|297.08|sqmi[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.6|sqmi[/tpl] is water. Charlotte lies at an elevation of [tpl]convert|748|ft[/tpl], as measured at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.
Charlotte constitutes most of Mecklenburg County in the Carolina Piedmont. Charlotte center city sits atop a long rise between two creeks, Sugar Creek and Irwin Creek and was built on the gunnies of the St. Catherine's and Rudisill gold mines.
Though the Catawba River and its lakes lie several miles west, there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center. Consequently, development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size. The lack of these obstructions has contributed to Charlotte's growth as a highway, rail, and air transportation hub.

Park Road and the SouthPark area have an extensive array of shopping and dining offerings, with SouthPark essentially serving as a second urban core. Blossoming neighborhoods like Sedgefield, Dilworth and South End are great examples of that. A prominent feature of the SouthPark neighborhood is the 120‑acre Park Road Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://charlotte.about.com/od/neighborhoodsrealestate/p/southpark.htm|title=Getting to Know Charlotte's SouthPark Neighborhood|author=Addie Rising|date=September 12, 2012[/tpl] Far South Boulevard is home to a large Hispanic community. Many students, researchers, and affiliated professionals live near UNC Charlotte in the northeast area known as University City.

Temperature extremes range from [tpl]convert|104|°F|0[/tpl] on July 1, 2012, down to [tpl]convert|-5|°F|0[/tpl] as recently as January 21, 1985. Charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny, and pleasantly warm days. On average, Charlotte receives [tpl]convert|41.6|in|sigfig=3[/tpl] of precipitation annually, with summer being the wettest season. In addition, there is an average of [tpl]convert|4.4|in|cm[/tpl] of snow with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain. These storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down on power lines and make driving hazardous.

==Law, government and politics==

Charlotte has a council-manager form of government. The Mayor and city council are elected every two years, with no term limits. The mayor is ex officio chairman of the city council, and only votes in case of a tie. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, Charlotte's mayor has the power to veto ordinances passed by the council; vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the council. The council appoints a city manager to serve as chief administrative officer.
Unlike some other cities and towns in North Carolina, elections are held on a partisan basis. The most recent mayor of Charlotte was Patrick Cannon, a member of the Democratic Party. Cannon was sworn in as mayor on December 2, 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/24109381/patrick-cannon-to-be-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-charlotte-monday-night|title=Cannon sworn in as Mayor |publisher=''WBTV' |date=December 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 2, 2013[/tpl] On March 26, 2014 Mayor Patrick Cannon was arrested on public corruption charges.

Charlotte tends to lean Democratic, but voters are friendly to moderates of both parties. Republican strength is concentrated in the southeastern portion of the city, while Democratic strength is concentrated in the south-central, eastern and northern areas.
The city council comprises 11 members (7 from districts and 4 at-large). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all four of the at-large seats in the November 2013 municipal election. While the city council is responsible for passing ordinances, many policy decisions must be approved by the North Carolina General Assembly as well, since North Carolina municipalities do not have home rule. Since the 1960s, however, municipal powers have been broadly construed.
Charlotte is split between three congressional districts on the federal level—the 8th, represented by Republican Richard Hudson; the 9th, represented by Republican Robert Pittenger; and the 12th, which is currently vacant, but formerly represented by Democrat Mel Watt who resigned in 2014 to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency. A special election will be held November 4, 2014 to replace Watt.[tpl]ref|http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/Candidates%20Library/Government%20at%20a%20Glance.pdf[/tpl]

All locations provide free access to Internet-enabled computers and WiFi, and a library card from one location is accepted at all 20 locations.
Although the Library's roots go back to the Charlotte Literary and Library Association, founded on January 16, 1891,[tpl]cite web|title=Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County: A century of service | work=cmstory.org Web Site | url=http://cmstory.org/exhibit/plcmc/1.htm | publisher=Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County | accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl] the state-chartered Carnegie Library which opened on the current North Tryon site of the Main Library was the first non-subscription library opened to members of the public in the city of Charlotte.  The philanthropist Andrew Carnegie donated $25,000 dollars for a library building on the condition that the city of Charlotte donate a site, and $2500 per year for books and salaries,[tpl]cite web| title=Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County: A century of service | work=cmstory.org Web Site | url=http://cmstory.org/exhibit/plcmc/2.htm | publisher=Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County | accessdate=October 25, 2008[/tpl] and that the state grant a charter for the library. All conditions were met, and the Charlotte Carnegie Library opened in an imposing classical building on July 2, 1903.
The 1903 state charter also required a library be opened for the disenfranchised African-American population of Charlotte. This was completed in 1905, with opening of the Brevard Street Library for Negroes, an independent library
in Brooklyn, a historically black area of Charlotte, on the corner of Brevard and East Second Street (now Martin Luther King Boulevard).[ref]
