Louis IV (10 September 920 – 30 September 954), called d'Outremer or Transmarinus (both meaning "from overseas"), reigned as King of Western Francia from 936 to 954. He was a member of the Carolingian dynasty, the son of Charles III and Eadgifu of England, a daughter of King Edward the Elder.Donald A.

==Early years across the sea==

Louis was only two years old when his father was deposed by his nobles. They set up Robert I in his place. When Louis was three years old, Robert died and was replaced by Rudolph, duke of Burgundy. Rudolph's ally, Count Herbert II of Vermandois, himself a Carolingian, took Charles captive by treachery.  The young Louis' mother, Eadgifu of Wessex, took the boy "over the sea" to the safety of England, hence his nickname. He lived in exile in the household of King Athelstan.

==Return to France==

Charles III died in 929, and Rudolph ruled until 936. Upon the death of Rudolph, Louis was summoned back to France with the unanimous support of the nobles. Hugh the Great was especially supportive of his return and probably organized it to prevent Herbert II or Rudolph's brother Hugh the Black from taking the throne. Louis was crowned king at Laon by Artald, Archbishop of Rheims, on Sunday 19 June 936.Pierre Riche, The Carolingians, Transl. Michael Idomir Allen, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), 256. The chronicler Flodoard records the events as follows:
Effectively, Louis' sovereignty was limited to the town of Laon and to some places in the north of France; he displayed a keenness beyond his years in obtaining the recognition of his authority by his feuding nobles. Nonetheless, his reign was filled with conflict, in particular with Hugh the Great, count of Paris.
Louis IV fell from his horse and died on 30 September 954 at Rheims, in the Marne, where he is interred at Saint Rémi Basilica.
