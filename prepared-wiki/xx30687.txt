The Siberian Rubythroat (Luscinia calliope) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called  chats.
It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in mixed coniferous forest with undergrowth in Siberia.  It nests near the ground. It winters in India and Indonesia. It is an extremely rare vagrant to Western Europe, having occurred on a very few occasions as far west as Britain. It is also an extremely rare vagrant to the Aleutian Islands, most notably on Attu Island.[tpl]cite web|title=The British List|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/recbrlst1.html|publisher=British Ornithologists' Union|accessdate=24 September 2010[/tpl]

The male has a red throat edged with a narrow black and then a broad white border. It has a strong white supercilium.  Females lack the brightly coloured throat and borders.
