USC&GS ''Lester Jones'' (ASV-79) was a survey ship that served in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1940 to 1967.
Lester Jones was built by Astoria Marine Company at Astoria, Oregon in 1940 and entered Coast and Geodetic Survey that year. She served in the Pacific during her Survey career, mostly in Alaskan waters.
Lester Jones was retired in 1967 and sold at auction.  Since that time, she has been in private hands and operated as a liveaboard and cruising yacht.  She is currently based in Seattle and is called the Summer Wind.  The original Cooper-Bessemer direct reversing main propulsion engines are still operating and in excellent shape.
