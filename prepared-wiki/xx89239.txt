[[Stub Series Terminated Logic]]

CATEGORIES: Computer memory, JEDEC standards

Stub Series Terminated Logic (SSTL)  is a group of electrical standards for driving transmission lines commonly used with DRAM based DDR memory IC's and memory modules. SSTL is primarily designed for driving the DDR (double-data-rate) SDRAM modules used in computer memory; however, it is also used in other applications, notably some PCI Express PHYs and other high-speed devices.Jaci Chang Design Considerations for the DDR3 Memory Sub-system. Jedex, 2004, p. 4. http://www.jedex.org/images/pdf/samsung%20-%20jaci_chang.pdf
Four voltage levels for SSTL are defined:
SSTL_3 uses a reference of .45*VDDQ(1.5V). SSTL_2 and SSTL_18 reference a voltage that is exactly VDDQ/2(1.25V and .9V respectively).Tom Granberg Handbook of Digital Techniques for High-Speed Digital Design. Pearson Education, 2004, p. 160-161.
SSTL_3 and SSTL_2 support two termination classes (50 ohm or 25 ohm load). SSTL_18 only supports one (25 ohm load).
