The Gulfstream American Hustler was a 1970s American mixed-power executive/utility aircraft designed by American Jet Industries (later Gulfstream American). The aircraft had a nose-mounted turbprop and with a tail-mounted turbofan.

==Development==

In 1974, American Jet Industries started work on a seven-seat executive transport with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 engine in the nose supplemented by a Williams Research Corporation WR19-3-1 turbofan mounted in the tail. The turbofan was originally intended to be a standby emergency power unit that could also be used if extra thrust was needed for take-off. The prototype designated Hustler 400 (N400AJ) first flew on the 11 January 1978. The Hustler was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear, and a high-mounted tailplane. 
It was originally intended to be certified as a single-engined aircraft because the Williams turbofan had not been certified. But the company (by then called Gulfstream American) decided it should be approved as a twin and the Williams turbofan was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D turbofan. To enable the engine to be fitted a 2 ft 8 in (0.81m) extension to the forward fuselage. The cabin entrance door was moved in front of the wing and other aerodynamic changes. The intake for the rear engine was also moved from the lower rear fuselage to the base of the fin.
Another change was made in 1979 when the front engine was replaced by a Garrett TPE331 turboprop and the aircraft was re-designated the 'Hustler 500. The aircraft was flown in this configuration in 1981 but the programme was suspended due to a recession in the general aviation market. Element for the design were used in the prototype jet trainer the Peregrine 600.
