[[Orchamus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Mythological kings

Orchamus was a king in Greek mythology.  He had two daughters: Leucothea and Clytia.  Leucothea was raped by Helios, the sun god. Helios disguised himself as Leucothea's mother Euronome to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Helios for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea buried alive. Helios refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grievous Clytia wilted and slowly died. Helios changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.
