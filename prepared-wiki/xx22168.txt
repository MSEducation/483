[[Melodica]]

CATEGORIES: Free reed aerophones, Keyboard instruments

The melodica, also known as the pianica, blow-organ or key-flute, is a free-reed instrument similar to the melodion and harmonica. It has a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into a hole in the side of the instrument. Pressing a key opens a hole, allowing air to flow through a reed. The keyboard is usually two or three octaves long. Melodicas are small, light, and portable. They are popular in music education, especially in Asia.
The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the 1950s,[tpl]cite web|author=Missin P|date=2004|title=A Brief History of Mouth-Blown Free Reed Instruments: Melodica Family|url=http://www.patmissin.com/history/melodica.html|accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] though similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.duskyrecords.nl/vibrandoneon.engels.html |title=Vibrandoneon |publisher=Duskyrecords.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] 
The melodica was first used as a serious musical instrument in the 1960s by composers such as Steve Reich, in his piece titled Melodica (1966)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/licensing/music/Steve-Reich-Melodica/3275 |title=Steve Reich - Melodica |publisher=Boosey.com |date=1966-05-22 |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] and jazz musician Phil Moore, Jr., on his 1969 Atlantic Records album Right On.Phil Moore Jr., 1969.  Right On, 1969. Atlantic Records (SD-1530) Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal developed a technique consisting of singing while playing the melodica, resulting in a wide tonal and harmonic palette.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6maZJA0-Yc&feature=relmfu |title=Hermeto Pascoal - Rebuliço |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] It is associated with Jamaican dub and reggae musician Augustus Pablo who popularized it in the 1970s.[tpl]cite web|author=Kliment and Watchtel|date=2007|title=Augustus Pablo|url=  http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=augustus_pablo|accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] It was featured on the 1972 No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit single, "Oh Girl" by the Chi-Lites.  In the 1980s, electronic rock band New Order featured the melodica prominently, in songs such as "Truth," "Your Silent Face," "Love Vigilantes,", "Hurt" and "In A Lonely Place". Also the melodica provided the base melody line in the song "And We Danced" by The Hooters. The "virtual band" Gorillaz have used them heavily throughout their career, most notably on their first full length studio album. Melodicas have also been used in indie folk music by artists such as Rabbit of Steam Powered Giraffe and Paul Duncan of Warm Ghost, and Emmanuel Del Real of Café Tacvba. Additionally, the melodica is used by pop, alternative and electronica multi-instrumental and vocal artists such as Happy Tom.

==Types==

Melodicas are classified primarily by the range of the instrument. Melodicas with different ranges have slightly different shapes.

===Wooden melodicas===

Although the majority of melodicas are made of plastic, some are made primarily of wood. The Sound Electra corporation makes the MyLodica, a wooden melodica designed "...to produce a warmer richer sound than that of its plastic relatives."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.melodicas.com/mylodica.htm |title=Mylodica |publisher=Melodicas.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03[/tpl] The Victoria Accordion company in Castelfidardo, Italy, produces a range of wooden melodicas and accordinas that they market under the name Vibrandoneon.

==Alternative names==

The melodica is known by various names, often at the whim of the manufacturer. Melodion (Suzuki), Melodika (Apollo), Melodia (Diana), Pianica (Yamaha), Melodihorn (Samick) and Clavietta are just some of the variants. This can lead to some confusion, as many people[tpl]who|date=April 2013[/tpl] will use different names as a blanket term to describe all of these instruments. The melodica may colloquially be referred to as a "hooter". This was the source of the name for Philadelphia band, The Hooters.[tpl]cite book|title=What's in a Name?: The Book of Bands|first=John|last=Darling|year=2000|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sIUs9GwfMVIC&pg=PT31&dq=hooters+the+band+name+came+about&hl=en&ei=8badTreZBKXRiAL08_mTCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hooters%20the%20band%20name%20came%20about&f=false|publisher=Writers Club Press|isbn=978-0-595-09629-9[/tpl]

==Comparison with traditional woodwind instruments==

Melodicas are unusual because unlike most conventional woodwind instruments, they make use of a piano keyboard rather than a specialized fingering system using holes and/or buttons. This allows the player to use a single finger to play any one note of the instrument's range, rather than requiring several fingers to play individual notes, as is the case with most other woodwinds. The player can then play chords by using their remaining fingers to press additional keys, and thus, sound additional notes. In other words, whereas most woodwind instruments such as saxophones or clarinets are monophonic when played by trained musicians, the melodica is polyphonic.
Additionally, for a beginner, a melodica can play accidentals more easily than a woodwind, which may require extra keys or cross-fingering to reach any notes outside of its key.
These two factors give the melodica an unusual degree of flexibility and contribute to its wide usage in music education.
