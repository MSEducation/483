==Plot==

Alan (Jon Cryer) goes to a church to attempt to have his sins forgiven, after scamming Charlie (Charlie Sheen), Herb (Ryan Stiles), Evelyn (Holland Taylor), and Berta (Conchata Ferrell) out of thousands of dollars. However, when Father Shaunassey (Dakin Matthews) suggests he tell his family, Alan rejects the offer. Meanwhile, Charlie has grown tired of having to sneak around during his controversial affair with his stalker, Rose (Melanie Lynskey), despite the fact that her husband, Manny, will arrive home that evening. Charlie suggests that he can take a weekend away with Rose, much to her delight. Alan continues to see his evil side which encourages him to continue collecting money from his relatives. Alan attempts to admit the truth to Charlie, but Charlie reveals that Rose is willing to invest and Alan decides to continue lying.
Alan allows Rose to invest, but is surprised when Rose shows up at his office and realizes the scam. Alan fears that Rose will tell on him and decides to blackmail her about her cheating on Manny. While at Rose's house attempting to blackmail her, Alan discovers that Manny is a mannequin and that Rose is playing Charlie along. Rose offers to give Alan enough money to pay everyone back, but Alan refuses to betray Charlie and leaves. Alan returns home, only to find Berta wanting her money back. While Alan ponders whether to take Rose's money with his evil side, Charlie arrives announcing his intention to propose to Rose in Paris. Charlie insults Alan about moving out after Alan tells Charlie it is a bad idea. Alan decides to take Rose's money and keeps the truth to himself. Despite a close call with Charlie finding Manny in Rose's closet, Charlie fails to realize that Manny is Rose's husband. The episode ends when Charlie departs for Paris with Rose, while Alan pays back the money that he scammed after he received payment from Rose. While talking with his dark side again, Alan is outraged when his light side, a version of himself wearing women's clothes, appears in the toaster and starts criticizing his dress sense. When Alan asks his light side if there are anymore versions of himself, the light side asks: "What more do you need?".
