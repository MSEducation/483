The Jin River ([tpl]zh|c=锦江|p= Jǐn Jiāng[/tpl]) is a river of Sichuan, China. It flows through the provincial capital of Chengdu and joins the Min Jiang at Pengshan.
The river has a history of serious pollution which in the past has led to the river choking and flooding. The Anshun Bridge in Chengdu was once destroyed in the 1980s during a period of flooding and was only rebuilt in 2003, after the Chengdu Municipal People's Government undertook an extensive river-cleaning project in 1997. The Municipal People's Government was awarded a prize for improving the environment of the river, from the United Nations. Chengdu Time
