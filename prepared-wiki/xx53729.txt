Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company was the manufacturer of Sharps Rifle. It was organized by Samuel Robbins and Richard S. Lawrence as a holding company in Hartford, Connecticut on October 9, 1851 with $100,000 in capital.  John C. Palmer was president, Christian Sharps an engineer, and Richard S. Lawrence as master armorer and superintendent.  Samuel Robbins and Richard Lawrence each acquired 250 sharesâ€”approximately 13% of the company. 

==History==

Christian Sharps (1810 - 1874), patented his rifle in 1848.   The first contract for 5,000 rifles was in 1850 and manufacturing started in 1851. The Model 1851 "box-lock" was developed Christian Sharps, Rollin White, and Richard Lawrence at Robbins & Lawrence of Windsor, VT. 
The second contract for 15,000 rifles was so large that no suitable land was available in Windsor, VT.  The holding company advanced Robbins & Lawrence $40,000 to purchase [tpl]convert|25|acre|m2[/tpl] of land in Hartford, CT and to erect a brick factory building.  
Christian Sharps left the Company in 1853. He later formed a partnership with William Hankins in 1862, known as Sharps & Hankins. In 1855, manufacturing was moved to Hartford and continued until 1876. Operations were then moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut. 
In 1872, Sharps introduced the .50-90 Sharps hunting cartridge.

The Sharps Rifle Co. closed down in 1881. 
Reproductions of the paper cartridge Sharps 1863 Rifle, the metallic cartridge 1874 Sharps Rifle, and Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 are manufactured today. They are used in hunting and target shooting. A number of companies, among them Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company and C. Sharps Arms Inc., both of Big Timber, Montana, and the Italian gunmaker Davide Pedersoli & Co. of Brescia, offer a line of Sharps reproductions.
