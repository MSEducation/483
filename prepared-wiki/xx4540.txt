[[Hasdingi]]

CATEGORIES: Vandals, Ancient Germanic peoples

The Hasdingi were the southern tribes of the Vandals, an East Germanic tribe.  They lived in areas of today's southern Poland, western Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary. They were part of the migratory movements of the Vandals, into the Iberian peninsula and later on to North Africa.
Having crossed the Rhine in 406 AD, the Hasdingi settled as foederati in Gallaecia (today Galicia, Asturias and the north of Portugal) along with the Suebi.in 409 AD.
Gunderic, king of the Hasdingi, lost his kingdom to king Hermeric of the Suebi after the Battle of the Nervasos Mountains against an allied force of Suebi and Romans in 419. He fled to Baetica with his army where he also became king of the Silingi Vandals and of the Alans. Gunderic was succeeded by his brother Genseric in 428 AD, who subsequently fled from Iberia to North Africa where he established a kingdom at Carthage.
