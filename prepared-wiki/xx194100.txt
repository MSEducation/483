==Biography and Club career==

Weissel was born in Temora in 1903. He died in 1972.
Weissel played his entire club football career in his home area of the Riverina in southern New South Wales. He rejected offers from Sydney and England clubs, choosing instead to stay in the district he called home, and turned out with five different clubs during an 18-year career: Cootamundra, Temora, Barmedman, Narrandera and Wagga Wagga.Daniel Lewis, "How Kelly the bush ranger helped to hold up league's country riches", smh.com.au, 24 November 2009  With Cootamundra he was captain during two years when they retained the regional Maher Cup with an unbeaten record.

After being selected for New South Wales in 1928, Weissel made his international representative debut against a touring British side that same year, featuring in two Tests. He made the Australian squad for the 1929–30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, playing in three Tests and 17 tour matches. He topped the tour scoring tally with five tries and fifty-six goals on the tour. In the First Test at Hull, Weissel featured in the 31-8 Australian victory scoring a try and kicking five goals.
He played in three Tests of the 1932 Domestic Ashes series against Great Britain, including the brutal 'Battle of Brisbane' Test where a battered and bruised Australian team lost the fight to a thuggish English side, but won the match 15-6.left|thumb|400px|Weissel eighth from left, Kangaroos 1st Test 6 Jun 1932right|thumb|400px| Run-on side plus mgrs 6 Jun 1932 Weissel seated 2nd from left
