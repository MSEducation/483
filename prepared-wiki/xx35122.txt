Hamlet (also referred to as Hamlet 2000) is a 2000 American film written and directed by Michael Almereyda, set in contemporary New York City, and based on the Shakespeare play of the same name. Ethan Hawke plays Hamlet as a film student, Kyle MacLachlan co-stars as Uncle Claudius, Gertrude by Diane Venora, Laertes by Liev Schreiber, Ophelia by Julia Stiles, Rosencrantz by Steve Zahn, and Hamlet's father by Sam Shepard.
In this version of Hamlet, Claudius becomes King and CEO of "Denmark Corporation", having taken over the firm by killing his brother, Hamlet's father.
This adaptation keeps the Shakespearean dialogue but presents a modern setting, with technology such as video cameras, Polaroid cameras, and surveillance bugs. For example, the ghost of Hamlet's murdered father first appears on closed-circuit TV.

The reaction to Hawke's performance as the title role is also mixed. The Los Angeles Times described him as a "superb Prince of Denmark - youthful, sensitive, passionate but with a mature grasp of the workings of human nature." New York magazine, however, thought Hawke's performance was only "middling."[tpl]cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/3173/|title=Get Thee to Moomba |last=Rainer|first=Peter|date=May 22, 2000|accessdate=December 27, 2009|work=New York[/tpl]
