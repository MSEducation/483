==Former terminals==

===Terminal C===

This terminal was built in 1965, before jet bridges (elevated corridors that connect planes to the terminal) became common at airports. Instead of using jet bridges, Terminal C mostly used airstairs. Some airlines, including Alaska AirlinesService improvement benefits Alaska passengers. Airport Report. Vol. 3, No. 1. Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport. June 2004. and SkyWest Airlines, used turboway ramps.  In preparation for construction of Terminal B, the north end of Terminal C, previously home to gates C14â€“C16, which housed Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air, and Frontier Airlines, was closed for demolition in December 2007. The remaining portion of the terminal was reconfigured, including the addition of a new, larger, consolidated security checkpoint. The demolition of the north end occurred in February 2008, officially clearing the way for construction of Terminal B.Airport Construction Update 12/14/07
In December 2009, United Airlines, Continental Airlines, and JetBlue Airways moved to new or reconstructed gates in Terminal A, as the area within Terminal C containing the three airlines' gates was demolished. Other airlines operating at that time within Terminal C remained in the terminal until the North Concourse of Terminal B opened in June 2010.
The Terminal C baggage claim was closed for demolition on February 2, 2010. This allowed for completion of the airport's new roadways. The terminal was officially closed on June 30, 2010. The remaining portions of the terminal were torn down in July 2010, and the space the terminal occupied now serves as a surface parking lot.

==General aviation==

Private and corporate aircraft are based on the opposite side of the runway from Terminals A and B, off Coleman Avenue.
The former General Aviation services were previously located, on the South end of what is now 30R, and was, in fact, the place for plane spotters and photographers with the San Jose State University Aviation Department formerly located at the corner of Coleman Avenue and Airport Blvd, which was at a cost of only $ 1.00 per year, paid to the airport administration.

===Public transit connections===

The free VTA Route 10 Airport Flyer bus connects the airport to the Santa Clara Station for Caltrain and ACE commuter rail services as well as numerous local buses; and to the Metro/Airport Light Rail Station for VTA's light rail service.
The Silicon Valley BART extension is planned to have its terminus at an expansion of the existing Santa Clara train station, where it will serve SJC.
