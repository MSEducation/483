Kültəpə (also, Aşağı Gültəpə, Gültəpə, and Kyul’tepe) – is a settlement dated from the Eneolithic epoch, a village and municipality in the Babek Rayon of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan.  It has a population of 1,859.
In 1951, archeologist Osman Habibulla began excavations in the settlement. The stratigraphy and cultural strata were clarified. The tell was much disturbed in the past.
As excavators had found, the town features a cultural layer with the total depth of 22 m. The earliest 9 m of this belongs to the Copper Age. On top of that are the remains of the Bronze Age, and then the Early Iron Age.
At each of these layers were found pottery dishes, cattle-breeding and agricultural implements, adornments, weapons etc.
In the Eneolithic layer were discovered remains of constructions, as well as burial places. Constructions were round as well as rectangular-shaped, and were made of mudbrick. Diameter of round constructions is ca 6–8 m. The rectangular ones are about 15 sq. m in size. These structures were typically connected with agriculture.
85 burial places were investigated in the Eneolithic layer. In 31 of those where found out pottery dishes, items made of bones and stone, and beads.
The Soviet scientists decided that Kultepe is the place, where firstly in the South Caucasus items made of copper-arsenic alloys which are dated back to the 4th millennium BC, were found out.Всеобщая история химии. М.: Наука, 1980, 399
Local character of arsenic copper production was confirmed by results of chemical investigation and casting forms and remains of casting found out there.И. Р., Торосян Р. M. Металлографический анализ древнейших металлов в Закавказье.- Советская археология, 1969, ј 3, с. 229-294
