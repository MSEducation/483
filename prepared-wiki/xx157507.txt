==Song information==

"Let It Go" is about female empowerment and failed relationships. It is about "letting go" of a relationship if one partner is not there for the other, and is not interested in showing love or respect. The song "Let It Go" was originally intended for Fantasia for her self-titled album, but she had too many songs on that album, and Cole wanted it after Elliott played it for her. According to 50 Cent in a Hot 97 interview the song was also offered to G-Unit artist Oliva who picked another Missy Elliott track instead. Lil' Kim appears on the record to pay homage to Biggie, as the song is similar to his hit "Juicy".[tpl]cite web | title="The Making of Keyshia Cole's "Let It Go""| work=Vibe| url=http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2007/06/keyshia_let_go_vid/| accessdate=2007-06-25[/tpl]
