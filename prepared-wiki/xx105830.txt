[[Dragon's breath]]

CATEGORIES: Shotgun shells, Magnesium

Dragon's breath is an exotic incendiary round for a 12 gauge shotgun. Dragon's breath consists primarily of magnesium pellets/shards. When the round is fired, sparks and flames can shoot out to about 100 ft. Dragons breath is normally chambered in 12 gauge 2 3/4" shot shell. The rounds are safe to fire out of an improved cylinder bore as well as a modified choke barrel, common on many shotguns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_9_50/ai_n6125526 |title=Of Dragon's Breath and hammer-shells |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl]
While its actual professional combat or tactical usage remains undocumented, the visual effect it produces is impressive and entertaining, similar to that of a short-ranged flamethrower or fireworks, making it popular among gun enthusiasts. Also undocumented, it has been claimed by enthusiasts that the rounds are often used as a distress signal, similar to a very short duration emergency flare gun, though some would argue a flare would be better fitted for such. The round has also been used for intimidation purposes.  The pyrotechnic shell is expensive compared to other shells, costing $5 (USD) per round.  There is little or no record of its use in actual combat. Because it is a very low-power round, it cannot be used in an auto-loading shotgun or semi-automatic shotgun; it does not produce enough recoil energy to cycle the action, causing the mechanism to fail to cycle. An additional reason to use the round only in a manually operated firearm is that the round shoots at least a little flame for 3–5 seconds.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] It would be hazardous if a shell still emitting flame were to be ejected from a semi-automatic shotgun.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Legality==

Dragon's breath rounds are banned in many locations, due to their inherent fire hazard. Even in areas where the round may be shipped, an extra fee for hazardous materials may be charged.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=981503 |title=exotic shotgun ammo |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2001-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl]

===United States===

Illinois law states that a dragon's breath round is any round that "contains exothermic pyrophoric misch metal as the projectile and is designed for the purpose of throwing or spewing a flame or fireball to simulate a flame-thrower".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/pubact92/acts/92-0423.html |title=Public Act 92-0423 |publisher=Ilga.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl] This shotgun round is banned for use by anyone who is not authorized to possess, manufacture, or sell by the law. The wording is very similar in Florida law as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/florida/crimes/790.31.html |title=Florida Crimes Code Section 790 |publisher=Law.onecle.com |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl]
