The Cost of Loving is the third album by the band The Style Council, released in 1987. This album saw the group concentrating on the R&B styles that had been growing in America during the eighties. Its urban contemporary feel was a jolt to listeners who had grown accustomed to the continental mix of soul music, jazz, and European folk styles that the band had displayed on their previous two albums. United States label Geffen Records heard the tracks and promptly dropped The Style Council from their roster. Polygram records would eventually issue the album Stateside without its much-maligned International Orange jacket design.  Socially conscious soul music pioneer Curtis Mayfield was asked to mix some of the material on the album, which displays hints of being influenced by house music and the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis sound. The initial British pressings of the album were conceived and issued as two 12" EPs in a gatefold sleeve (designed by Simon Halfon with ideas from Paul Weller). Tracks from the album were included in a 37 minute film, Jerusalem, about the band.
Due to the famous original album cover, the album gained the nickname The Orange Album. Today, the album is generally seen as a turning point in the band's career, giving to the sounds later explored on Confessions of a Pop Group and Modernism: A New Decade, whilst the start of the band's declining commercial and critical success. The album received mixed reviews.
