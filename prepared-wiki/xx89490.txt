==History==

Wales shares its name with the country of Wales, and the derivation may well be the same: the name Wales coming from a Germanic root meaning foreigner and inferior.  The suggestion, therefore, is that there was a continued Celtic presence here following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons at the turn of the 6th century. The earliest reference to Wales is in 1002, when Wolfric Spot, a Saxon thegn, is recorded as owning Walesho.
Sir William Hewet, Lord Mayor of London in 1559, was born in Wales, and his descendants, the Dukes of Leeds, would come to dominate the area.
