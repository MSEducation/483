Mobile began as the first capital of colonial French Louisiana in 1702. During its first 100 years, Mobile was a colony of France, then Britain, and lastly Spain. Mobile first became a part of the United States of America in 1813, with the annexation of West Florida under President James Madison. It then left that union in 1861 when Alabama joined the Confederate States of America, which collapsed in 1865.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2255.html|title= United States History|accessdate = May 5, 2007[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The city gained its name from the Mobile tribe that the French colonists found in the area of Mobile Bay.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 17–20. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7  Although debated by Alabama historians, they may have been descendants of the Native American tribe whose small fortress town, Mabila, was used to conceal several thousand native warriors in preparation for an attack on the expedition of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 12–13. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7  The Mobile tribe, along with the Tohome, obtained permission from the colonists, about seven years after the founding of the Mobile settlement, to settle near the fort.Thomason, Michael.

==History==

===Colonial===

The European settlement of Mobile, then known as Fort Louis de la Louisiane, started in 1702, at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River, as the first capital of the French colony of Louisiana. It was founded by French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to establish control over France's Louisiana claims. Bienville was made governor of French Louisiana in 1701. Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20, 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec.Higginbotham, Jay. Old Mobile: Fort Louis de la Louisiane, 1702–1711, pages 106–107. Museum of the City of Mobile, 1977. ISBN 0-914334-03-4. The parish was the first established on the Gulf Coast of the United States. In 1704 the ship Pélican delivered 23 French women to the colony, along with yellow fever which passengers had contracted at a stop in Havana.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city,pages 20–21. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 Though most of the "Pélican girls" recovered, numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans died from the illness. This early period was also the occasion of the arrival of the first African slaves, transported aboard a French supply ship from Saint-Domingue. The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708, yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease.
These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods caused Bienville to order the town relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay in 1711.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city,pages 17–27. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 A new earth and palisade Fort Louis was constructed at the new site during this time."Other Locations: Historic Fort Conde" (history), Museum of Mobile, Mobile, Alabama, 2006 By 1712, when Antoine Crozat took over administration of the colony by royal appointment, the colony boasted a population of 400 persons. The capital of Louisiana was moved to Biloxi in 1720, leaving Mobile in the role of military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon and prince of Condé.[tpl]cite web|title=Historic Fort Conde|work="Museum of Mobile"|url=http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php|accessdate=October 18, 2007[/tpl]
In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the French and Indian War. The treaty ceded Mobile and the surrounding territory to Great Britain, and it was made a part of the expanded British West Florida colony.[tpl]cite web|title=Early European Conquests and the Settlement of Mobile|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.alabamamoments.state.al.us/sec02qs.html|accessdate=October 20, 2007[/tpl] The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte, after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, King George III's queen.[tpl]cite web|title=Mobile: Alabama's Tricentennial City|work="Alabama Department of Archives and History"|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/mobile/mobile3.html|accessdate=October 20, 2007[/tpl]
The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists, ultimately 112 French Mobilians remained in the colony.Thomason, Michael. Mobile: the new history of Alabama's first city,pages 44–45. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 The first permanent Jewish presence in Mobile began in 1763 as a result of the new religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders, and added to the commercial development of Mobile.Zietz, Robert (1994). The Gates of Heaven : Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim, the first 150 years, Mobile, Alabama, 1844–1994. Mobile, Alabama: Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim . pp7-39 In 1766 the population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than they had been during the French colonial efforts. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.Delaney, Caldwell. The Story of Mobile, page 45. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0-940882-14-0
While the British were dealing with their rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast, the Spanish entered the war as an ally of France in 1779. They took the opportunity to order Bernardo de Galvez, Governor of Louisiana, on an expedition east to retake Florida.[tpl]cite book | title = The Fort Barrancas Story | author = David P. Ogden | publisher = Eastern National Parks | isbn = 978-1-888213-15-7 | page = 2[/tpl] He captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780, as part of this campaign. The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies, partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress, and due to the fact that Mobile and West Florida, for the most part, remained loyal to the British Crown. The fort was renamed Fortaleza Carlota, with the Spanish holding Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813, when it was seized by United States General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.[tpl]cite web|title=James Wilkinson|work="War of 1812"|url=http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/wilkinson.html|accessdate=October 20, 2007[/tpl]

===19th century===

By the time Mobile was included in the Mississippi Territory in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people.[tpl]cite book|last =Thomason|first = Michael|title = Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city| page = 65|publisher = Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8173-1065-7[/tpl] The city was included in the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819; Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time. As the river frontage areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by farmers and the plantation economy became established, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with these upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.
From the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton trade. A building boom was underway by the mid-1830s, with the building of some of the most elaborate structures the city had ever seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics.[tpl]cite book|last = Thomason|first = Michael|title = Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city| pages = 69–71|location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama|publisher = University of Alabama Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8173-1065-7[/tpl] The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.
With the economy so focused on one crop, Mobile's fortunes were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Though Mobile had a relatively small slave-owning population compared to the inland plantation areas, it was the slave-trading center of the state until surpassed by Montgomery in the 1850s.[tpl]cite book|last = Thomason|first = Michael|title = Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city|pages =79–80|location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama|publisher = University of Alabama Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8173-1065-7[/tpl] The last slaves to enter the United States were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde; among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade."Cudjo's Own Story of the Last African Slaver", Journal of Negro History 12 (1927), 648 Jstor
By 1853, there were fifty Jewish families living in Mobile, including Philip Phillips, an attorney who was elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress.Zietz, Robert (1994). The Gates of Heaven : Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim, the first 150 years, Mobile, Alabama, 1844–1994. Mobile, Alabama: Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim. pp. 7–39 By 1860 Mobile's population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people; it was the 27th largest city in the United States and 4th largest in what would soon be the Confederate States of America.[tpl]cite web|title=Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1860 |work=United States Bureau of the Census |url=http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab09.txt |accessdate=November 2, 2007 |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070808203809/http://www.census.gov/population/documentation/twps0027/tab09.txt |archivedate = August 8, 2007[/tpl] The free population in the whole of Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 citizens, of which 1195 were free people of color.[tpl]cite web|title=Census Data for the Year 1860|work="Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research"|url=http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/censusbin/census/cen.pl?year=860|accessdate=November 13, 2007[/tpl] Additionally, 1785 slave owners held 11,376 people in bondage, for a total county population of 41,130 people.
During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. The first submarine to successfully sink an enemy ship, the H. L. Hunley, was built in Mobile.[tpl]cite web|title=H. L. Hunley|work="Naval Historical Center"|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-3.htm|accessdate=October 20, 2007[/tpl] One of the most famous naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking possession of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, page 113. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely.
On May 25, 1865, the city suffered great loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a [tpl]convert|30|ft|m|0|sing=on[/tpl] deep hole at the depot's location, sunk ships docked on the Mobile River, and the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.Delaney, Caldwell. The Story of Mobile, pages 144–146. Mobile, Alabama: Gill Press, 1953. ISBN 0-940882-14-0
Federal Reconstruction in Mobile began after the Civil War and effectively ended in 1874 when the local Democrats gained control of the city government.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, page 153. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3 million in 1882.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, page 145. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7

===20th century===

The turn of the 20th century brought the Progressive Era to Mobile and saw Mobile's economic structure evolve, along with a significant increase in population.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 154–169. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels in the harbor. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important.
During this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened, however. In 1902 the city government passed Mobile's first segregation ordinance, one that segregated the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain dominance.
The red imported fire ant was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off of South American cargo ships, where they lived in the soil used as ballast on those ships.http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/documents/FACT/RedImportedFireAntsJusttheFacts-Sep2007.pdf
World War II led to a massive military effort causing a considerable increase in Mobile's population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to Mobile to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 213–217. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries. Mobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, Fletcher class destroyers, and minesweepers.
The years after World War II brought about changes in Mobile's social structure and economy. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand, and most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, African Americans stepped up their efforts to achieve equal rights and social justice. The police force and Spring Hill College were integrated during the 1950s. Unlike the rest of the state, buses and lunch counters had been voluntarily desegregated by the early 1960s.
In 1963 three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 260–261. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8173-1065-7 The court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system. The Civil Rights Movement led to the end of legal racial segregation with passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Mobile's economy was dealt a severe blow in 1969 with the closing of Brookley Air Force Base. The closing left 10% of the workforce without employment. This and other factors ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s.
The Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949 allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind its creation. The existing Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, considering itself better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, saw the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.Bill Patterson, "The Founding of the Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile: The Port City's Reluctant Use of Subsidies", Gulf South Historical Review 2000 15(2): 21–40,

==Culture==

Mobile is home to an array of cultural influences with its mixed French, Spanish, Creole and Catholic heritage, in addition to British and African, distinguishing it from all other cities in the state of Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration is perhaps the best illustration of this. Mobile is the birthplace of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period."Mardi Gras in Mobile" (history), Jeff Sessions, Senator, Library of Congress, 2006, webpage: LibCongress-2665 Carnival in Mobile evolved over the course of 300 years from a beginning as a sedate French Catholic tradition into the mainstream multi-week celebration that today bridges a spectrum of cultures.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Mardi Gras|work="Mobile Bay Convention & Visitors Bureau"|url=http://www.mobile.org/vis_mardigras_history.php|accessdate=November 29, 2007[/tpl] Mobile's official cultural ambassadors are the Azalea Trail Maids, meant to embody the ideals of Southern hospitality.[tpl]cite news|last=Starling|first=Bill|title=Trail Maids are proud ambassadors for Mobile, state|newspaper=Mobile Press Register|pages=2C|date=January 16, 2009|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/press-register/editorials.ssf?/base/opinion/1232117116172200.xml&coll=3|accessdate=March 20, 2010[/tpl]

===Carnival and Mardi Gras===

Carnival balls in the city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5.[tpl]cite web|title=Mardi Gras FAQS|work=Mobile Carnival Museum |url=http://www.mobilecarnivalmuseum.com/MardiGras.aspx |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070911025505/http://www.mobilecarnivalmuseum.com/MardiGras.aspx |archivedate=September 11, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Mardi Gras Terminology |work=Mobile Bay Convention & Visitors Bureau |url=http://www.mobile.org/vis_mardigras_terms.php |accessdate=November 18, 2007[/tpl] Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, signifying Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent.[tpl]cite web|title=Mardi Gras – Mobile's Paradoxical Party |work=The Wisdom of Chief Slacabamorinico |url=http://jacksonsnyder.com/arc/slac/MardiGras/paradox.htm |accessdate=November 18, 2007[/tpl] In Mobile, locals often use the term Mardi Gras as a shorthand to refer to the entire Carnival season, although this is a misnomer. During the Carnival season the mystic societies build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown with masked society members tossing small gifts, known as throws, to parade spectators.[tpl]cite news |first=Susan |last=Houston |title=Mobile; It Has History |work=The News & Observer |publisher=News & Observer Publishing Company, (Raleigh, North Carolina) |date=February 4, 2007[/tpl] The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also give formal masquerade balls, usually invitation only, and oriented to adults.
Mobile first celebrated Carnival in 1703 when colonial French settlers began the Old World celebration at the Old Mobile Site site, prior to the 1711 relocation to the current site. Mobile's first Carnival society was established in 1711 with the Boeuf Gras Society (Fatted Ox Society).[tpl]cite web|title=History|work="Mobile Carnival Museum"|url=http://www.mobilecarnivalmuseum.com/History.aspx|accessdate=November 17, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010041322/http://www.mobilecarnivalmuseum.com/History.aspx |archivedate = October 10, 2007[/tpl]
In 1830 Mobile's Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade. The Cowbellions got their start when Michael Krafft, a cotton factor from Pennsylvania, began a parade with rakes, hoes, and cowbells. The Cowbellians introduced horse-drawn floats to the parades in 1840 with a parade entitled, "Heathen Gods and Goddesses". The Striker's Independent Society was formed in 1843 and is the oldest surviving mystic society in the United States.
Carnival celebrations in Mobile were canceled during the American Civil War. In 1866 Joe Cain revived the Mardi Gras parades when he paraded through the city streets on Fat Tuesday while costumed as a fictional Chickasaw chief named Slacabamorinico. He celebrated the day in front of the occupying Union Army troops.[ref]
