CATEGORIES: National flags, National symbols of Liechtenstein, 1937 introductions

The flag of Liechtenstein ([tpl]lang-de|Flagge Liechtensteins[/tpl]) consists of two equal horizontal bands of blue (top) and red with a gold ducal crown on the hoist side of the blue band. The colours are likely to have been derived from the livery colours of the Principality's royal household in the eighteenth century.[tpl]cite web | title = Geography, Merriam-Webster's Atlas | publisher = Merriam-Webster| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/nytmaps.pl?liechtenstein | accessdate = 2012-01-28[/tpl]
