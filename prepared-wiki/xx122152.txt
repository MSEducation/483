Monte Veronese is an Italian cheese made from cow’s milk which is produced in the northern part of the Province of Verona. It is regarded as the great cheese of the Lessini mountains or the Veronese prealps and was awarded Italian Denominazione di Origine status in 1993 and EU PDO ([tpl]lang-it|DOP[/tpl]) status in 1996. Like Asiago, the cheese comes in two versions, one fresh and one matured.
