Founded in 1653,[tpl]cite book | last = Woods | first = Silas | title = Silas Wood's sketch of the town of Huntington, L. I., from its first settlement to the end of the American revolution | publisher = F. P. Harper | date = 1898 edition | page = 16 | url = http://www.archive.org/details/silaswoodssketch00woodiala [/tpl] it is located on the north shore of Long Island in northwestern Suffolk County, with Long Island Sound to its north and Nassau County adjacent to the west.  Huntington is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the United States 2010 Census, the town population was 203,264.

==History==

In 1653, three men from Oyster Bay, Richard Holbrook, Robert Williams and Daniel Whitehead, purchased a parcel of land from the Matinecock tribe.  This parcel has since come to be known as the "First Purchase" and included land bordered by Cold Spring Harbor on the west, Northport Harbor on the east, what is now known as Old Country Road to the south and Long Island Sound to the north.  The three men immediately turned the land over to the white settlers who had already been living there.
From that initial settlement, Huntington grew over subsequent years to include all of the land presently comprising the modern Towns of Huntington and Babylon.  The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.
Because Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam.  It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.
Following the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War, British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.
The arrival of the Long Island Railroad in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting.  Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.
The end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region.  Farms and resorts gave way to homes, and Huntington has transformed into a major bedroom community for nearby New York City.
