==Career==

Cattrall began her career after graduating from high school in 1972, when she left Canada for New York City. There, she attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and upon her graduation signed a five-year film deal with director Otto Preminger. She made her film debut in Preminger's Rosebud in 1975. A year later Universal Studios bought out that contract and Cattrall became one of the last participants in the contract player system of Universal (also referenced as MCA/Universal during this period) before the system ended in 1980. The Universal system's representative in New York, Eleanor Kilgallen (sister of Dorothy Kilgallen), cast Cattrall in numerous TV guest-star roles. One of the first jobs Kilgallen got her was in a 1977 episode of Quincy, M.E. starring Jack Klugman, whom Kilgallen also represented. In 1978 Cattrall played the female lead in a two-hour episode of Columbo and also in Blindfold, one episode of the 70's TV series Starsky and Hutch  in which Starsky (played by Paul Michael Glaser) is grief-stricken since he accidentally blinded young artist Emily Harrison -her role- by a shot of his gun.  She starred in The Bastard (1978) and The Rebels (1979), two television mini-series based on the John Jakes novels of the same nmes.  In 1979 she played the role of Dr. Gabrielle White in The Incredible Hulk and would go down in TV Hulk lore as one of the few characters who knew David Banner (alter ego of the titular character) was alive and was the creature. Her work in television paid off and she quickly made the transition to cinema. She starred opposite Jack Lemmon in his Oscar-nominated film Tribute in 1980, and in Crossbar, the film about a high jumper who loses his leg and still participates in the Olympic trials, with Cattrall's help. The following year, she starred in the critically acclaimed Ticket to Heaven.
In 1982 Cattrall played P.E. teacher Miss Honeywell ("Lassie") in Porky's, followed two years later by a role in the original Police Academy. In 1985 she starred in three films: Turk 182, City Limits and Hold-Up, the last with French star Jean-Paul Belmondo. In 1986, she played Kurt Russell's brainy flame in the action film Big Trouble in Little China. In 1987, her lead role in Mannequin proved a huge success with audiences. One of her best-known film roles is that of Lieutenant Valeris in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; Cattrall assisted in developing the character by designing her own hairstyle and even helped come up with the name. Near the end of filming, Cattrall had a photographer shoot a roll of film on the Enterprise bridge set, in which she wore nothing but her Vulcan ears. After finding out about the unauthorised photo session, Leonard Nimoy had the film destroyed.[tpl]cite journal |work=Femme Fatales |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date=Summer 1992 |title=Hollywood's Most Voluptuous Vulcan |first=Mark A. |last=Altman |authorlink=Mark A.
