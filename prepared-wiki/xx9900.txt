==Botany==

Peppermint was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus from specimens that had been collected in England; he treated it as a species,Linnaeus, C. (1753). Species Plantarum 2: 576–577. but it is now universally agreed to be a hybrid.Harley, R. M. (1975). Mentha L. In: Stace, C. A., ed. Hybridization and the flora of the British Isles page 387.
It is a herbaceous rhizomatous perennial plant growing to [tpl]convert|30|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tall, with smooth stems, square in cross section. The rhizomes are wide-spreading, fleshy, and bare fibrous roots. The leaves are from [tpl]convert|4|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|1.5|-|4|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] broad, dark green with reddish veins, and with an acute apex and coarsely toothed margins. The leaves and stems are usually slightly fuzzy. The flowers are purple, [tpl]convert|6|-|8|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with a four-lobed corolla about [tpl]convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] diameter; they are produced in whorls (verticillasters) around the stem, forming thick, blunt spikes. Flowering is from mid to late summer. The chromosome number is variable, with 2n counts of 66, 72, 84, and 120 recorded.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.[tpl]Page needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. ISBN 0-340-40170-2[tpl]Page needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Peppermint is a fast growing plant once it sprouts, it spreads very quickly.

==Ecology==

Peppermint typically occurs in moist habitats including stream sides and drainage ditches. Being a hybrid, it is usually sterile, producing no seeds and reproducing only vegetatively, spreading by its rhizomes. If placed, it can grow anywhere, with a few exceptions.
Outside of its native range, areas where peppermint was formerly grown for oil often have an abundance of feral plants, and it is considered invasive in Australia, the Galápagos Islands, New Zealand,Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk: Mentha x piperita and in the United StatesUSDA Plants Profile: Mentha x piperita in the Great Lakes region, noted since 1843.[tpl]cite web |title= List of invasive species in the Great Lakes Great Lakes United / Union Saint-Laurent Grands Lacs |url= http://www.glu.org/en/node/199 |accessdate=2009-02-07[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Peppermint generally grows best in moist, shaded locations, and expands by underground stolons. Young shoots are taken from old stocks and dibbled into the ground about 1.5 feet apart.  They grow quickly and cover the ground with runners if it is permanently moist.  For the home gardener, it is often grown in containers to restrict rapid spreading. It grows best with a good supply of water, without being water-logged, and planted in areas with part-sun to shade.
The leaves and flowering tops are used; they are collected as soon as the flowers begin to open and can be dried. The wild form of the plant is less suitable for this purpose, with cultivated plants having been selected for more and better oil content. They may be allowed to lie and wilt a little before distillation, or they may be taken directly to the still.

==Chemical constituents==

Peppermint has a high menthol content.  The oil also contains menthone and menthyl esters, particularly menthyl acetate.PDR for Herbal Medicines, 4th Edition, Thomson Healthcare, page 640.  ISBN 978-1-56363-678-3 Dried peppermint typically has 0.3-0.4% of volatile oil containing menthol (7-48%), menthone (20-46%), menthyl acetate (3-10%), menthofuran (1-17%) and 1,8-cineol (3-6%).  Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Common Natural Ingredients used in food, drugs and cosmetics |first=A.

==Uses==

It is the oldest and most popular flavour of mint-flavoured confectionery and is often used in tea and for flavouring ice cream, confectionery, chewing gum, and toothpaste. Peppermint can also be found in some shampoos, soaps and skin care products.
Menthol activates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin and mucosal tissues, and is the primary source of the cooling sensation that follows the topical application of peppermint oil.[tpl]cite journal | author = R.

Peppermint flowers are large nectar producers and honey bees as well as other nectar harvesting organisms forage them heavily. A mild, pleasant varietal honey can be produced if there is a sufficient area of plants.

===Medicinal use===

Peppermint has a long tradition of medicinal use, with archaeological evidence placing its use at least as far back as ten thousand years ago.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]

==Peppermint oil==

Peppermint oil has a high concentration of natural pesticides, mainly pulegone (Found mainly in Mentha arvensis var. piperascens  Cornmint, Field Mint, Japanese Mint and to a lesser extent-6,530 ppm in Mentha x piperita subsp. nothosubsp. piperitaDuke's Data Base http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/duke/highchem.pl) and menthone.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Irving Krieger|title=Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology: Principles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ib8Qhju9EQEC&pg=PA823|accessdate=11 October 2010|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-426260-7|page=823[/tpl]
The chemical composition of the essential oil from peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC-MS. The main constituents were menthol (40.7%) and menthone (23.4%). Further components were (+/-)-menthyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, limonene, beta-pinene and beta-caryophyllene.Schmidt E., Bail S., Buchbauer G., Stoilova I., Atanasova T., Stoyanova A., Krastanov A., Jirovetz L."Chemical composition, olfactory evaluation and antioxidant effects of essential oil from Mentha x piperita."

In 2007, Italian investigators reported that 75% of the patients in their study who took peppermint  oil capsules for four weeks had a major reduction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, compared with just 38% of those who took a placebo.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Cappello |first1=G |last2=Spezzaferro |first2=M |last3=Grossi |first3=L |last4=Manzoli |first4=L |last5=Marzio |first5=L |title=Peppermint oil (Mintoil) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial |journal=Digestive and Liver Disease |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=530–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17420159 |doi=10.1016/j.dld.2007.02.006[/tpl] A second study in 2010, conducted in Iran, found similar results.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Shahin |last1=Merat |first2=Shadi |last2=Khalili |first3=Pardise |last3=Mostajabi |first4=Anahita |last4=Ghorbani |first5=Reza |last5=Ansari |first6=Reza |last6=Malekzadeh |title=The effect of enteric-coated, delayed-release peppermint oil on irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Digestive diseases and sciences |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=1385–90 |year=2010 |pmid=19507027 |doi=10.1007/s10620-009-0854-9[/tpl]  2011 research showed that peppermint acts through a specific anti-pain channel called TRPM8 to reduce pain sensing fibres.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] The authors feel that this study provides information that  is potentially the first step in determining a new type of mainstream clinical treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110419101234.htm |title=How Peppermint Helps to Relieve Irritable Bowel Syndrome |date=April 20, 2011 |work=ScienceDaily [/tpl]
According to the German Commission E monographs, peppermint oil (as well as peppermint leaf) has been used internally as an antispasmodic (upper gastrointestinal tract and bile ducts) and to treat irritable bowel syndrome, catarrh of the respiratory tract, and inflammation of the oral mucosa. Externally, peppermint oil has been used for myalgia and neuralgia. According to the German Commission E, peppermint oil may also act as a carminative, cholagogue, antibacterial, and secretolytic, and it has a cooling action.Keifer D., Ulbricht C., Abrams T., Basch E., Giese N., Giles M., DeFranco Kirkwood C., Miranda M., Woods J."Peppermint (Mentha xpiperita): An evidence-based systematic review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration." Journal of Herbal Pharmacotherapy. 7 (2) (pp 91-143), 2007.
Enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules (Colpermin) been used as an orally administered antispasmodic premedication in colonoscopy. The capsules were found beneficial in reducing total procedure time, reducing colonic spasm, increasing endoscopist satisfaction and decreasing pain in patients during colonoscopy.Shavakhi A, Ardestani SK, Taki M, Goli M, Keshteli AH.,"Premedication with peppermint oil capsules in colonoscopy: a double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial study".  Acta Gastroenterol Belg. 2012 Sep;75(3):349-53
Similarly, some poorly designed earlier trials found that peppermint oil has the ability to reduce colicky abdominal pain due to IBS with an NNT (number needed to treat) around 3.1,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/AT022.html |title=Peppermint oil for irritable bowel syndrome |work=Bandolier[/tpl] but the oil is an irritant to the stomach in the quantity required and therefore needs wrapping for delayed release in the intestine.  This could also be achieved by using the whole herb or leaves rather than the volatile components alone.
Due to the menthol constituent, topical use of peppermint oil around the facial or chest areas of infants and young children, especially around the nose, can induce apnea, laryngeal and bronchial spasm, acute respiratory distress with cyanosis, or respiratory arrest.-www.naturalstandard.com ib id It is also used in construction and plumbing to test for the tightness of pipes and disclose leaks by its odor.[tpl]cite book|title=Culinary Herbs: Their Cultivation Harvesting Curing and Uses|year=1912|publisher=Orange Judd Company|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21414/21414-h/21414-h.htm#Page_120|author=M.

Peppermint oil may cause or worsen heartburn.

==Toxicology==

The toxicity studies of the plant have received controversial results.  Some authors reported that the plant may induce hepatic diseases (liver disease), while others found that it protects against liver damage that is caused by heavy metals.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1191/0960327104ht412oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=Ozguner |first2=M |last3=Aydin |first3=G |last4=Gokalp |first4=O |title=Investigation of biochemical and histopathological effects of Mentha piperita Labiatae and Mentha spicata Labiatae on liver tissue in rats |journal=Human & Experimental Toxicology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=21–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15027812[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Sharma |first1=A |last2=Sharma |first2=MK |last3=Kumar |first3=M |title=Protective effect of Mentha piperita against arsenic-induced toxicity in liver of Swiss albino mice. |journal=Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=249–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17371529 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.00030.x[/tpl]  In addition to that, the toxicities of the plant seem to vary from one cultivar to another[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1191/0960327103ht332oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=Kilinç |first2=I |last3=Oncu |first3=M |last4=Karaoz |first4=E |last5=Delibas |first5=N |title=Investigation of biochemical and histopathological effects of Mentha piperita L. and Mentha spicata L. on kidney tissue in rats |journal=Human & Experimental Toxicology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=213–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12755472[/tpl] and are dose dependent.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1191/0748233704th206oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=Gultekin |first2=F |last3=Yontem |first3=M |title=Effect of Mentha piperita (Labiatae) and Mentha spicata (Labiatae) on iron absorption in rats |journal=Toxicology and industrial health |volume=20 |issue=6–10 |pages=119–22 |year=2004 |pmid=15941008[/tpl]  This is probably attributed from the content level of pulegone.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Farley |first1=Derek R. |last2=Howland |first2=Valerie |title=The natural variation of the pulegone content in various oils of peppermint |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=31 |pages=1143–51 |year=1980 |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740311104 |issue=11[/tpl]
With the limitation that the concentration of pulegone  should not exceed 1%, it has been concluded that Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaves, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Water are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.Nair B."Final report on the safety assessment of Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf, and Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Water."
