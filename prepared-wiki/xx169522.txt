==Early life==

Terius Nash was born on September 20, 1977,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14WlsHLQKW0 in Rockingham, North Carolina. He moved with his mother to Atlanta when he was three years old. After first learning to play trumpet in elementary school, Nash learned how to play the drums and guitar.[tpl]cite web|last=Cordor|first=Cyril|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dream-mn0001028077/biography|title=The-Dream : Biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] His mother died in 1992 when Nash was fifteen years old, an event which would inspire him to write songs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/66998/|title=Rhythm and Blues|last=Raftery|first=Brian|work=NY Mag|date=2010-07-04|accessdate=2011-01-14[/tpl] He states that the death of his mother gave him a "soft spot" for women, which he credits to his desire to write songs about female empowerment such as Rihanna's "Umbrella". He moved in with his grandfather, a concrete mason who instilled a strong work ethic in young Nash. Of his grandfather, Nash recalls "He came out of a bad time for blacks in the South, but even though we lived in the hood, we had a boat, some cars and a house that was paid for. So I’ve always had a different outlook on life. There’s nothing I can’t do."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2009/03/09/2003437949/3|title=Terius Nash's high art is ghetto-friendly (Pg. 3)|last=Maerz|first=Melissa|work=Taipei Times|publisher=New York Times News Service|date=2009-03-09|accessdate=2011-01-14[/tpl]

==Personal life==

After dating for six months, Nash married his girlfriend Nivea in 2004. Together they had three children, daughter Navy Talia (on May 10, 2005) and twin sons London and Christian (April 19, 2006). Nivea filed for legal separation on December 10, 2007. Nash said that although he was in love with Nivea, his lack of experience in a family growing up meant he was "not taught how much more than love takes to run a relationship. Like, 'cause love isn't just where it's gonna end. It can't start and stop with love. There has to be a certain amount of knowledge and patience that's acquired in order to keep it going and keep it straight, and I found out the hard way."[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.bet.com/Music/News/thedreamtalksabouthisrelationship_MUSICNEWS_4.3.htm| title = The Dream Talks About His Relationship| accessdate = 2009-07-09 | last = Osorio | first = Kim| date = 2009-04-03| work = BET.com music | publisher = Black Entertainment Television[/tpl] Their divorce was finalized on June 15, 2008.
