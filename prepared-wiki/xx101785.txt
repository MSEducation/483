The Liberal Party of Sweden ([tpl]lang-sv|Sveriges Liberala Parti[/tpl]) was a political party in Sweden. It was formed in 1923 by the anti-prohibition minority of the Free-minded National Association as a consequence of the split over the issue on alcohol prohibition.
In 1934 the two parties reunited in the form of the People's Party.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1861 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7
