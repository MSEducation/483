Neil "Neilly" Gibson (born 23 February 1873 in Larkhall, Scotland) was a Scottish footballer who played for Rangers, Partick Thistle and the Scotland national team.
Gibson joined Rangers in 1894 from junior side Royal Albert. During his time at Ibrox, he won four consecutive league titles (1898-99, 1899-1900, 1900-01 and 1901-02) as well as the Scottish Cup in 1897, 1898 and 1903.
He moved to Partick Thistle in 1904 where he remained for five years. 
He was capped 14 times by Scotland between 1895 and 1905, scoring one goal. Gibson also represented the Scottish League XI 11 times.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/aaplayersbyapp.html|title=Scotland FL Players by Appearances|work=Londonhearts.com|publisher=London Hearts Supporters' Club|accessdate=27 November 2011[/tpl]
His three sons, Neil, Willie and James, were also footballers, the latter a Scottish international.
Former Hibernian manager Willie McCartney stated that Gibson was "The greatest of my, and any generation following, in Scottish football", Steve Bloomer of Derby County and England described him as "The greatest footballer I ever saw", and Gibson's artistry led Harry Wood to dub him "Pavlova in football boots".Rangers The Complete Record, Breedon Books, ISBN 1 85983 481 7
