==Criticism==

Although based in Singapore, Pug Jelly has received criticism because not a single band member is a Singapore national.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Additionally, as the band has not been able to make it to the wider music market, they have remained unknown.

==Current status==

Pug Jelly is inactive now due to Sam and Masashi's decision to go in a new direction, Dallas's alcoholism rehab and Matt's school commitments. Masashi (backup vox/guitar) and Sam(vox/bass) have started a new band, Saw Loser with 4 other members and have released an EP and an LP (Long Distance Phone Calls). The band recently parted with 2 of its members and welcomed back Matt. The band, with the addition of new blood, hopes to be able to rocket onto the world market as the next top Asian rock band.
In 2007, the band went on hiatus.
In December 2009, the band went back together again but had their band name changed to The Dirt Radicals. Current members are Sam, Matt and Masashi.
