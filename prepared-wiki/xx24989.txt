Waylon J. Smithers, Jr., usually referred to as simply Smithers, is a recurring fictional character in the long-running American animated sitcom The Simpsons, who is voiced by Harry Shearer. Smithers first appeared in the episode "Homer's Odyssey", although he could be heard in the series premiere "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's owner Montgomery Burns.
Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads. The name Waylon was first used in "I Married Marge" and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers. In his first visual appearance in "Homer's Odyssey", Smithers was mistakenly drawn as an African American by Gyorgi Peluci, the color stylist.
Smithers' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. In many ways, Smithers represents the stereotype of the closeted gay man, and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made, though some of the show's producers instead refer to him as a "Burns-sexual".

==Role in The Simpsons==

Waylon Smithers is Mr Burns' devoted executive assistant. His father Waylon Smithers Sr., worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown, when Waylon was a baby.[tpl]cite episode |title=The Blunder Years|episodelink=The_Blunder_Years |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=2001-12-09 |season=13 |number=05[/tpl] Although he is not openly gay, Smithers frequents Springfield's gay village[tpl]cite episode |title=Three Gays of the Condo|episodelink=Three_Gays_of_the_Condo |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Warburton, Matt; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=2003-04-13 |season=14 |number=17[/tpl] and goes on a vacation to a male-only resort.[tpl]cite episode |title=Homer the Smithers|episodelink=Homer_the_Smithers |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=1996-02-25|season=7 |number=17[/tpl] It was revealed in a flashback that he was involved with a woman, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them.[tpl]cite episode |title=Secrets of a Successful Marriage|episodelink=Secrets_of_a_Successful_Marriage| series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=1994-05-19 |season=05 |number=22[/tpl] Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as "Burns-sexual".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=2007-10-24|date=2007-07-26|author=Carroll, Larry|publisher=MTV[/tpl] Smithers has occasional fantasies about Burns: when his computer is turned on, it shows a seemingly nude Burns with an audio montage saying: "Hello Smithers.

Burns has remained largely ignorant of Smithers' devoted adoration, much to Smithers' frustration. In later episodes, however, Burns appears to be somewhat wary of these gestures.[tpl]cite episode |title=Little Big Girl|episodelink=Little_Big_Girl |series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Payne, Don; Persi, Raymond S.|network=Fox |airdate=2007-02-11 |season=18 |number=12[/tpl] Burns himself has been involved with several women and in "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Burns starts looking for a female companion.[tpl]cite episode |title=A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love|episodelink=A_Hunka_Hunka_Burns_in_Love |series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=2001-12-02 |season=09 |number=08[/tpl] Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence.

In "Homer the Smithers", Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Burns' assistant and eventually gets his job back. For all his sycophantic devotion to Mr. Burns, Smithers has been willing to challenge him on at least two occasions, most significantly in the "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" episodes, where he opposed his employer's various evil schemes and was fired. As a result of his firing, Smithers became a "hideous drunken wreck"[tpl]cite episode |title=Who Shot Mr. Burns?#Part One|episodelink=Who_Shot_Mr._Burns?_(Part_One) |series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-21 |season=06 |number=25[/tpl] and when Mr. Burns was shot later in the episode, Smithers thought he might have done it while he was intoxicated. When it was proven that he had not, Smithers seemingly forgave Burns and demanded that the culprit be brought to justice, offering a reward for the capture of the perpetrator.[tpl]cite episode |title=Who Shot Mr. Burns?#Part Two |episodelink=Who_Shot_Mr._Burns?_(Part_Two) |series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1995-09-17 |season=07 |number=01[/tpl]

Smithers made his first appearance in "Homer's Odyssey", which was the third episode of the first season, although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire BBC.co.uk. Retrieved on March 2, 2007 In his first visual appearance in "Homer's Odyssey", Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made an African American by Gyorgi Peluci, the color stylist. David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be "Mr Burns' white sycophant,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050126165556/http://www.hurtwoodmedia.com/mckenzie/pdf/simpsons.pdf|title=Background Guide to The Simpsons|accessdate=2007-10-25|date=September 2002|publisher=Hurtwood Media|format=PDF[/tpl] and the staff thought it "would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character" and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode. The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was "There's No Disgrace Like Home", the fourth episode of the first season.

===Development===

Smithers' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers' true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode "The Telltale Head". Smithers' sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a "Burns-sexual" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=296[/tpl] During the Bill Oakley/Josh Weinstein era, they still tried to keep his sexuality mysterious and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. Al Jean, who thinks of Smithers as being a "Burns-sexual",[tpl]cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Blood Feud"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay.[tpl]cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer the Smithers"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] David Silverman, a former supervising director has said, "Smithers seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that. than being gay, he's sort of 'Burns-sexual.'" In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian, but Smithers was not included.  A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.glaad.org/eye/ontv/2008/broadcast.php|title=LGBT Characters for 2008-2009 |author=Finn, Natalie|accessdate=2008-11-06|publisher=Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081008152204/http://www.glaad.org/eye/ontv/2008/broadcast.php |archivedate=2008-10-08[/tpl] Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson's lesbian sister, was included on both lists.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news//article/index.jsp?uuid=fd0da574-316b-4300-80a7-8662f9a096b2&entry=index|title="Simpsons'" Smithers Part of Shrinking Minority?|author=Finn, Natalie|accessdate=2006-08-22|date=2007-11-07|publisher=E! News[/tpl]
The debate is referenced in "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", when the episode host, Troy McClure is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is "What is the real deal with Mr. Burns' assistant Smithers? You know what I'm talking about." A montage of various clips that shows Smithers' lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says "as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!"[tpl]cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episodelink=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=10[/tpl]
Several of the allusions to Smithers' sexuality have turned into battles with the censors. For example, in Smithers' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in "Rosebud", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is "Marge Gets a Job", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed "Mr. Burns landing in a particular position on Smithers anatomy".[tpl]cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] There were also issues with "the lump in his bed", which the animators said had drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.[tpl]cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
Mostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and Burns would ask, "Who is that man?", to which Smithers would reply, "That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your organ banks, carbon blobs, etc. from sector 7G." Burns would invariably respond, "Simpson, eh?"[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=164[/tpl]

==Reception==

In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.[tpl]cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpson and Delilah"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
