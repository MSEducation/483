==History==

===Origins===

Weber Shandwick was formed in 2001 by merging the Weber Group, Shandwick International and BSMG (formerly Bozell Sawyer Miller GroupBarry Siegel, Los Angeles Times, November 24, 1991, Spin Doctors To The World : The Sawyer Miller Group Uses The Tricks Of Political Campaigns To Change The Way You Think About Foreign Governments, Big Business And Any Client In Need Of An Image Lift). Shandwick International acquired consumer PR firm Mona, Meyer, McGrath & Gavin in 1988. Shandwick was in-turn sold to Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) in 1998. It was renamed to Weber Shandwick. BSMG merged with Shandwick that October. The firm had acquired large accounts like Coca-Cola and the insurance company Cigna, but by 2001 the company was going through layoffs due to the loss of a $12 million anti-smoking campaign and the general economic outcome of the September 11th terrorist attacks.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)|date=December 24, 2001|title=Weber Shandwick hopes for a happier new year; The public relations firm's Bloomington office is eager to put 2001 behind, after client cutbacks, a hiring freeze, layoffs and merger integration efforts|first=Ann|last=Merrill|coauthors=David Phelps; Staff Writers|pp=1D[/tpl]
