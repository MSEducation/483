The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians are a range of mountains forming an arc roughly [tpl]convert|1500|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long across Central and Eastern Europe, making them the second-longest mountain range in Europe (after the Scandinavian Mountains, [tpl]convert|1700|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]). They provide the habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Baer.JPG |title=Braunbären (Ursus arctos) in Europa |author=Peter Christoph Sürth |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 March 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071008020531/http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Baer.JPG |archivedate= 8 October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Wolf.JPG |title=Wolf (Canis lupus) in Europa |author=Peter Christoph Sürth |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 March 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071008020550/http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Wolf.JPG |archivedate= 8 October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Luchs.JPG |title=Eurasischer Luchs (Lynx lynx) in Europa |author=Peter Christoph Sürth |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=10 March 2011 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20071008020605/http://www.human-wildlife.info/images/Europa+Luchs.JPG |archivedate= 8 October 2007[/tpl] as well as over one third of all European plant species.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Carpathian_montane_conifer_forests |title=Carpathian montane conifer forests - Encyclopedia of Earth |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010[/tpl]  The Carpathians and their piedmont also concentrate many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having over one-third of the European total.Bucureşti, staţiune balneară – o glumă bună? in Capital, January 19th, 2009.

The Carpathians consist of a chain of mountain ranges that stretch in an arc from the Czech Republic (3%) in the northwest through Slovakia (17%), Poland (10%), Hungary (4%) and Ukraine (11%) to Romania (53%) in the east and on to the Iron Gates on the River Danube between Romania and Serbia (2%) in the south. The highest range within the Carpathians is the Tatras, on the border of Poland and Slovakia, where the highest peaks exceed [tpl]convert|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The second-highest range is the Southern Carpathians in Romania, where the highest peaks exceed [tpl]convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The Carpathians are usually divided into three major parts: the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia), the Central Carpathians (southeastern Poland, eastern Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania), and the Southern Carpathians (Romania, Serbia).
The most important cities in or near the Carpathians are: Bratislava and Košice in Slovakia; Kraków in Poland; Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu and Braşov in Romania; and Miskolc in Hungary.

==Name==

The name "Carpathian" may have been derived from Carpi, a Dacian tribe. According to Zosimus, this tribe lived until 381 on the eastern Carpathian slopes. The word could come from an Indo-European word meaning "rock". In Thracian Greek Καρπάτῆς όρος (Karpates oros) means "rocky mountain",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Carpathian |title=Carpathian |author=Douglas Harper |date= |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=10 March 2011[/tpl]
The range is called Karpaty in Czech, Polish, Slovak and Ukrainian, Carpați [tpl]IPA-ro|karˈpat͡sʲ|[/tpl] in Romanian, Karpaten in German and Dutch, Kárpátok in Hungarian (kárpátok means "Carpaths", kárpáti means "Carpathian"), Karpati in Serbian and Карпати in Bulgarian .
The name Carpates may ultimately be from the Proto Indo-European root *sker-''/''*ker-, from which comes the Albanian word kar'''pë'' (rock), and the Slavic word '''skála''' (rock, cliff), perhaps via a Dacian cognate[tpl]Which|date=March 2011[/tpl] which meant ''mountain,'' ''rock'', or ''rugged'' (cf. Germanic root ''*skerp-'', Old Norse ''harfr'' "harrow", Middle Low German ''scharf'' "potsherd" and Modern High German ''Scherbe'' "shard", Old English ''scearp'' and English ''sharp'', Lithuanian ''kar~pas'' "cut, hack, notch", Latvian ''cìrpt'' "to shear, clip"). The archaic Polish word karpa'' meant "rugged irregularities, underwater obstacles/rocks, rugged roots or trunks". The more common word skar'pa means a sharp cliff or other vertical terrain. The name may instead come from Indo-European *kwerp "to turn", akin to Old English hweorfan "to turn, change" (English warp) and Greek καρπός karpós "wrist", perhaps referring to the way the mountain range bends or veers in an L-shape.Room, Adrian. Placenames of the World''. London: MacFarland and Co., Inc., 1997.
In late Roman documents, the Eastern Carpathian Mountains were referred to as Montes Sarmatici (meaning Sarmatian Mountains). The Western Carpathians were called Carpates, a name that is first recorded in Ptolemy's Geographia (2nd century AD).
In the Scandinavian Hervarar saga, which relates ancient Germanic legends about battles between Goths and Huns, the name Karpates appears in the predictable Germanic form as Harvaða fjöllum (see Grimm's law).
"Inter Alpes Huniae et Oceanum est Polonia" by Gervase of Tilbury, has described in his Otia Imperialia ("Recreation for an Emperor") in 1211. Thirteenth to 15th century Hungarian documents named the mountains Thorchal, Tarczal or less frequently Montes Nivium.

==Geography==

The Carpathians begin on the Góra Świętego Marcina 384 m. in Tarnów - northern edge of Pogórze Ciężkowickie. They surround Transcarpathia and Transylvania in a large semicircle, sweeping towards the southeast, and end on the Danube near Orşova in Romania. The total length of the Carpathians is over [tpl]convert|1500|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the mountain chain's width varies between [tpl]convert|12|and|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The highest altitudes of the Carpathians occur where they are widest. The system attains its greatest breadth in the Transylvanian plateau and in the south of the Tatra group – the highest range, in which Gerlachovský štít in Slovakia is the highest peak at [tpl]convert|2655|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The Carpathians cover an area of [tpl]convert|190000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and, after the Alps, form the next most extensive mountain system in Europe.
Although commonly referred to as a mountain chain, the Carpathians do not actually form an uninterrupted chain of mountains. Rather, they consist of several orographically and geologically distinctive groups, presenting as great a structural variety as the Alps. The Carpathians, which attain an altitude of over [tpl]convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in only a few places, lack the bold peaks, extensive snowfields, large glaciers, high waterfalls, and numerous large lakes that are common in the Alps. It was believed that no area of the Carpathian range was covered in snow all year round and there were no glaciers, but recent research by Polish scientists discovered one permafrost and glacial area in the Tatra Mountains.[tpl]cite web|last=Gądek, Gradiecz|first=Bogdan, Mariusz|title=Glacial Ice and Permafrost Distribution in the Medena Kotlina (Slovak Tatras): Mapped with Application of GPR and GST Measurements|url=http://www.igipz.pan.pl/tl_files/igipz/ZGiHGiW/sgcb/sgcb_42/sgcb_42_01.pdf|work=Landform Evolution in Mountain Areas|publisher=Studia Geomorphologica Carpatho-Balcanica|accessdate=3 February 2013[/tpl] The Carpathians at their highest altitude are only as high as the middle region of the Alps, with which they share a common appearance, climate, and flora.thumb|210px|Portrait of Hutsuls, living in the Carpathian mountains, c. 1872
The Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the Danube. The two ranges meet at only one point: the Leitha Mountains at Bratislava. The river also separates them from the Balkan Mountains at Orşova in Romania. The valley of the March and Oder separates the Carpathians from the Silesian and Moravian chains, which belong to the middle wing of the great Central Mountain System of Europe. Unlike the other wings of the system, the Carpathians, which form the watershed between the northern seas and the Black Sea, are surrounded on all sides by plains, namely the Pannonian plain to the southwest, the plain of the Lower Danube (Romania) to the south, and the Galician plain to the northeast.

The area now occupied by the Carpathians was once occupied by smaller ocean basins.

The mountains take the form of a fold and thrust belt with generally north vergence in the western segment, northeast to east vergence in the eastern portion and southeast vergence in the southern portion.
The external, generally northern, portion of the orogenic belt is a Tertiary accretionary prism of a so-called Flysch belt created by rocks scraped off the sea bottom and thrust over the North-European plate. The Carpathian accretionary wedge is made of several thin skinned nappes composed of Cretaceous to Paleogene turbidites. Thrusting of the Flysch nappes over the Carpathian foreland caused the formation of the Carpathian foreland basin.Nehyba, S., Šikula, J., 2007, Depositional architecture, sequence stratigraphy and geodynamic development of the Carpathian Foredeep (Czech Republic). Geologica Carpathica, 58, 1, pp. 53-69 The boundary between the Flysch belt and internal zones of the orogenic belt in the western segment of the mountain range is marked by the Pieniny Klippen Belt, a narrow complicated zone of polyphase compressional deformation, later involved in a supposed strike-slip zone.Mišík, M., 1997, The Slovak Part of the Pieniny Klippen Belt After the Pioneering Works of D.

Iron, gold and silver were found in great quantities in the Western Carpathians. After the Roman emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia, he brought back to Rome over 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver.[tpl]cite web|title=Dacia-Province of the Roman Empire|publisher =United Nations of Roma Victor|url =http://www.unrv.com/province/dacia.php|accessdate=2010-11-14[/tpl]
