Giorgio Cavazzano (born October 19, 1947) is an Italian comic strip artist. 
Cavazzano was born in Venice.  He started his career at age 14, as an inker for Romano Scarpa. He produced stories about Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck and others.
Cavazzano's work is known for combining the traditional rubbery appearance of Disney characters with realistic illustration of technological gadgets and machinery. This style has had a big influence on many Disney illustrators of the new generation, especially the Italians. Recently, Cavazzano illustrated the epic Disney fantasy comic World of the Dragonlords, which was written by Byron Erickson.
He has received numerous awards for his work in comics. Apart from Disney, he has also been involved in drawing other, less known, comics and has done work in advertisement.
