[[Yipes]]

CATEGORIES: 1983 introductions, Roll-and-move board games

Yipes is a pop-o-matic board game similar to Trouble in which players compete to be the first player to the end of the board, thus turning into the "Monster."  The game adds a twist by having all players reverse direction when this occurs, with the "Monster" attempting to pass (thus "eating") the remaining players.
