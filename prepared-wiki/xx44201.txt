Frederick Lincoln "Link" Wray Jr (May 2, 1929 – November 5, 2005) was an American rock and roll guitarist, songwriter and vocalist who first came to popularity in the late 1950s.
Building on the overdriven, distorted electric guitar sound of early electric blues records, his 1958 instrumental hit "Rumble" by Link Wray and his Ray Men invented "the power chord, the major modus operandi of modern rock guitarists,"Cub Koda & Steve Leggett (2008).

==Early life==

Wray was born in Dunn, North Carolina, to Fred Lincoln Wray,Sr. and his wife Lillian M. Coats.Deborah Wray: daughter-in-law[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/wrayl.html |title=Ancestry of Link Wray |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24[/tpl] With half Shawnee Indian ancestry, Wray frequently spoke of this in performances and interviews. Three songs he performed were named for American Indian tribes: "Shawnee", "Apache", and "Comanche." "Apache" was an instrumental composed by Jerry Lordan; it was a hit in the United Kingdom for The Shadows in 1960. Wray recorded a cover version 30 years later, when it was also associated with The Ventures and the Incredible Bongo Band.
Wray served in the US Army during the Korean War, and contracted tuberculosis, which laid him up in a hospital for a year. His stay concluded with the removal of a lung, which doctors predicted would mean he would never be able to sing again.[tpl]cite news |title= Link: Doing it his Way |first=Dick |last=Meadows |newspaper=Sounds |publisher= Spotlight Publications |date= 28 August 1971|page= 8[/tpl]

==Career==

After his initial hits, Wray's career had periods of retirement followed by renewed popularity, particularly in Europe. To escape the "trap" of big business involvement in music, he began recording albums using a three-track studio he converted from a chicken shack.
While living in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, Wray was introduced to Quicksilver Messenger Service guitarist John Cipollina by bassist James Hutchinson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bayareabands.com |title=The Leading Bands Site on the Net |publisher=BayAreaBands.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] He subsequently formed a band initially featuring special guest Cipollina along with the rhythm section from Cipollina's band Copperhead, bassist Hutch Hutchinson, and drummer David Weber. They opened for the band Lighthouse at The Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles from May 15–19, 1974.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl] He later did numerous concerts and radio broadcasts in the Bay Area including KSAN (FM) and the Bill Graham venue, Winterland Ballroom with Les Lizama later replacing Hutchinson on bass.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/link-wray/ |title=Link Wray |publisher=wolfgangsvault.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24[/tpl] He toured and recorded two albums with retro-rockabilly artist Robert Gordon in the late 1970s.Prown, Pete & Newquist, HP (1997).
