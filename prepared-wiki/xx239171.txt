The clothing and design label, which started out as a t-shirt line, began by selling at boutiques in Michigan. The name Vividbraille was created with the idea that the ideal company or individual not only puts emphasis on the exterior but also the interior; this is explained by the companies mantra “Seen & Felt” which is featured on a number of ads and garments by Vividbraille.[tpl]cite news | first=Susan | last=Howes | coauthors= | title=Best of Detroit | date=June 2006 | publisher=Kathleen Kennedy Publisher | url =http://www.hourdetroit.com | work =Hour Detroit Magazine | pages =56 | accessdate = 2009-10-27 | language = [/tpl]  The clothing label features conceptual designs, each titled with an idea or explanation attached.[tpl]cite news | first=sham | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=1-of a-Kind | date=2003-03-01 | publisher= | url =http://lateboots.blogspot.com/2008/03/1-of-kind-vividbraille-part-2.html | work =Lateboots.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-10-27 | language = [/tpl]  The majority of the line features the word Vividbraille in actual braille.
