==Archaeological sites==

Joub Jannine I is a small surface site brought to the surface through erosional activity of a stream. It is 8 km northeast of Qaraoun in a range of foothills, 1 km north of a small village called Jebel Gharbi, between two tracks, west of cote 878 by about 200 m. The site was found by Dubertret with a collection made by Henri Fleisch and Maurice Tallon that is now in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at the Saint Joseph University. Flint tools found on the site included bifaces and rough pieces that were suggested to date to the Acheulean.[tpl]cite book|author1=L. Copeland|author2=P.

Joub Jannine II was first discovered by M. Billaux in 1957. It was described by Henri Fleisch as Neolithic in 1960.Fleisch, Henri., Les industries lithiques récentes de la Békaa, République Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1. Paris, 1960. It is located on the right bank of the Litani River northwest of the village, 100 m from the river and 100 m east of cote 861. An abundant amount of flint was collected including nine hundred and forty four tools and one hundred and fifty two cores.[tpl]cite book|author1=Michael D.

Little has been said about this industry or the ancient people that would have used these huge rock mauls[tpl]dn|date=March 2014[/tpl] in this area, at the dawn of agriculture, or what they would have been using them for.[tpl]cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P.

The material from Joub Jannine II was described by Lorraine Copeland as [tpl]cquote|Unique in Lebanon, except for isolated pieces at other sites, and consists of core-tools evidently made for a special purpose. (see Trihedral lithic pictured)[/tpl]
Joub Jannine III (The Gardens) is a Heavy Neolithic site of the Qaraoun culture, [tpl]convert|1.5|km|mi[/tpl] south of the village along steep slopes and around the houses. It was discovered by Henri Fleisch and Maurice Tallon in 1957. An abundant amount of material was recovered, which included several large flakes and blades along with a finer series of rabots and scrapers that is now held in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at the Saint Joseph University. No large bifaces were found at this site. The site may extend through the areas now turned into gardens. It was covered in crops in 1966.[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=444–446|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/185.html[/tpl]
