The use of a circle as both the organizational structure and descriptive metaphor for a meeting of equals is likely to have been a part of our history for as long as fire has. The learning circle is a mechanism for organizing and honoring the collective wisdom of the group and is present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in early native councils of elders came together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in “wisdom circles.” The term Learning Circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change . Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learning circles to empower their members to make choices and take action. The web can help locate the many ways both present and past that groups have used the term   Study circle or  Learning Circle as a form of adult and student education. For example, Educators for Community Engagement,http://www.e4ce.org/ Educators for Community Engagement find that learning circles—with their principles of equal participation, reciprocity, and honoring of collective wisdom -embody the democratic principles of effective service-learning partnerships. They use learning circles, rather than more traditional forms of group meetings, to structure their annual conferences. Primary teachers use a simple form of learning circles when they gather the students at the rug for "circle time." However many educators are using learning circles to connect students from around the world.http://www.iearn.org/circles IEARN Learning Circles Australian Model of Learning Circles in Educationhttp://globalteenager.org The Global Teenagers Project uses Learning Circleshttp://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/action-research-learning-circles Action Research Learning Circles  Among the goals of this activity are helping students to develop the trust and respect for diversity of experience, and fostering both listening and speaking skills among peers. Researchers have used learning circles as a form of professional development to improve their practice. A similar term, "Quality circle" was used in the 80's to characterize the successful practice in corporate settings in which the hierarchical boundaries between workers and managers are flattened to encourage participatory management and team leadership.  Quality circles,  originally associated with Japanese management and manufacturing techniques developed in Japan after world war II, based on lectures of W. Edwards Deming (Joel & Ross, 1982). The goal was to encourage everyone to develop a strong sense of ownership over the process and products of the group.

==Models of Learning Circles==

Learning Circles have been used for centuries with students and adults in many different contexts.  Two models are described here but others may exist.

===Model 1: OpenAgile Learning Circle===

OpenAgile is an agile system of project and team management. In the OpenAgile system, the Learning Circle "is a simple and practical model of effective learning".http://wiki.openagile.org/wiki/Learning_Circle Official page about the OpenAgile Learning Circle at wiki.OpenAgile.org.  The Learning Circle was adapted by Garry Bertieg from a development model in the "Building Momentum" document issued by the Baha'i World Center around 2003.http://www.agileadvice.com/2006/09/19/uncategorized/learning-circle-interview-with-garry-berteig-updated/ An interview with Garry Berteig about the OpenAgile Learning Circle  The Learning Circle is one of OpenAgile's three foundations, alongside Truthfulness and Consultative Decision-making.
This model describes learning as a series of four steps, four capacities for us to develop, and the pivotal importance of Guidance.

====The Four Steps====

The four steps in the Learning Circle are Reflection, Learning, Planning, and Action, and are followed one after another, over and over.  It is possible to begin an endeavour with any of the four steps.  The diagram below shows the Learning Circle Model:

====The Four Capacities====

Each of the four capacities in the Learning Circle are prerequisites for taking the next step.  At the same time, as we exercise these capacities through the use of the Learning Circle, we develop these capacities within ourselves, in our teams and in our organizations.  Our inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on our environment which in turn then has an effect on us.  By going through the Learning Circle, we use and develop these four capacities:
Guidance is the act of assisting an individual, team, or organization to reach a destination by accompanying, giving directions, or supplying with them advice.  Guidance plays a pivotal role in developing our capacity and can be applied to all four steps and all four capacities.  For individuals, teams, and organizations, Guidance is critical to be able to progress in the development of knowledge, skills or capacities.  Guidance can come from within - a team member who has expertise can share it with the other team members.  And Guidance can come from outside - we can bring experts into the organization, we can read books or web sites.  Inspiration can also be thought of as a form of Guidance, for example a team member suddenly has a bright idea.  Being open to receiving Guidance ensures that the Learning Circle is both organic and disciplined.

===Model 2: Distributed Leadership and Collaboration in Online Learning Circles===

In this model, Learning circles are described as a structure or distributed leadership in collaborative learning contexts Riel, 2010http://sites.google.com/site/onlinelearningcircles/Home/learning-circles-defined A description of the model of distributed leadership and collaboration learning circles "A learning circle is a highly interactive, participatory structure for organizing group work.  The goal is to build, share, and express knowledge though a process of open dialogue and deep reflection around issues or problems with a focus on a shared outcome." provides a more detailed view of the distributed leadership and collaborative  learning circle model. This model is described by a (1) set of defining dimensions, (2) norms that support the interaction; and  (3) the phase structure that guides the process. Many of these features also describe learning circles in face to face settings.
