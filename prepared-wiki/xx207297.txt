The Lucy Mackintosh gallery is a commercial contemporary art space located in Lausanne, Switzerland, that exhibits Swiss and international contemporary art and artists. The gallery also regularly invites designers to present their work. 

==History==

The Lucy Mackintosh gallery opened in Lausanne in 2004 in premises previously occupied by the EPFL architecture department. The architecture studio Jean-Gilles DÃ©costerd & Philippe Rahm designed the exhibition space using the concept of the "white canvas" for the refurbishing of the gallery. Gallery Director Cyril Veillon said, "The architect's response to an existing space and the brief for a contemporary art gallery was to create territories using thermal distortions rather than partitions. Elaborate plumbing runs through the main space, whose temperature can be attenuated according to the gallery function. "Basar, Shumon, Parag Sharma and Joshua Bolchover.
