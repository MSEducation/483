Water Power is a pornographic film released c. 1976 directed by Shaun Costello. It was loosely based on the real-life exploits of the Illinois "Enema bandit", Michael H. Kenyon, who administered forced enemas to female college students in the 1960s and 70s. The film starred Jamie Gillis as a disturbed loner in the mode of Travis Bickle from Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In preparing for his role, Gillis reportedly asked to be flown to Illinois to interview the man his character was based upon (his request was denied).
