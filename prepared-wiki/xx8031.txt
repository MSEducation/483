Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman; September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band the Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname "the rhythm devils".

==Career==

Before joining the Grateful Dead, Hart and his father, Leonard Hart, a champion rudimental drummer, owned and operated Hart Music, selling drums and musical instruments in San Carlos, California.
Hart joined the Grateful Dead in September 1967 and left in February 1971 when he extricated himself from the band due to conflict between band management and his father.[tpl]cite web|last=Planer |first=Lindsay |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rolling-thunder-r102792/review |title="Rolling Thunder Review" AllMusic |publisher=Allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl] During his sabbatical in 1972 he recorded the album Rolling Thunder. He returned to the Dead in 1974 and remained with the group until their official dissolution in 1995. Collaboration with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead continued under the name The Dead, however the group has since stopped performing.
Alongside his work with the Grateful Dead, Hart has flourished as a solo artist, percussionist, and the author of several books. In these endeavors he has pursued a lifelong interest in ethnomusicology and in world music. His travels and his interest in all things percussion-related led him to collect percussion instruments, and to collaborate with percussion masters the world over.
Hart became interested in percussion as a grade-school student. A few months out of high school he discovered the work of Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji.Hart, Mickey, with Stevens, Jay, and Lieberman, Fredric. Drumming at the Edge of Magic, Harper, 1990. p. 127. Olatunji later taught Hart and collaborated with Hart and the Grateful Dead on a regular basis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://africanmusic.org/artists/olatunji.html |title=African Music Encyclopedia |publisher=Africanmusic.org |date=2003-04-06 |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
Hart was influential in recording global musical traditions on the verge of possible extinction, working with archivists and ethnomusicologists at both the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian Institution. He is on the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center and has been a spokesperson for the "Save Our Sounds" audio preservation initiative. He also serves on the Library of Congress National Recorded Sound Preservation Board and is known for reissues and other recordings with historical and cultural value.
In 1991, Hart produced the album Planet Drum, which remained at #1 on the Billboard World Music chart for 26 weeks,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=3709 |title=Smith, E. "Doc". "Planet Drum Comes to the Masonic", BeyondChron, September 22, 2006 |publisher=Beyondchron.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl] and received the first ever Grammy Award for Best World Music Album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D91438F934A15751C0A964958260 |title="The Grammy Winners", New York Times, February 27, 1992 |publisher=New York Times |date=1992-02-27 |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
Hart has written books on the history and traditions of drumming throughout history. His solo recordings (featuring a variety of guest musicians) are percussive but verge on New Age. His enthusiasm for world music traditions and preservation and collaborative efforts is comparable to that of guitarist Ry Cooder.
In 1994, Mickey Hart was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees
In 2000, Hart became a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is "to seek to establish new knowledge and develop more effective therapies which awaken, stimulate and heal through the extraordinary power of music"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bethabe.org/Our_Mission212.html |title=Mission of the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function |publisher=Bethabe.org |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl] – continuing his investigation into the connection between healing and rhythm, and the neural basis of rhythm. In 2003, he was honored with the organization's Music Has Power Award, recognizing his advocacy and continuous commitment to raising public awareness of the positive effect of music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bethabe.org/Past_MHP_Honorees187.html |title=Past Music Has Power Awards Honorees |publisher=Bethabe.org |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
Hart was also a judge for the 3rd annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Independent Music Awards – Past Judges |publisher=Independentmusicawards.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
After the death of Jerry Garcia and the consequent dissolution of the Grateful Dead in 1995, Hart continued to play music with various groups including members of the Grateful Dead. In the 1996 Furthur Festival, Mickey Hart's Mystery Box played, as did Bob Weir's band Ratdog.
In 2005, Hart and the members of the band Particle joined to create the Hydra Project.
During 2006, Hart teamed up with fellow Grateful Dead bandmate Bill Kreutzmann, Phish bassist Mike Gordon and former The Other Ones lead guitarist Steve Kimock, to form the Rhythm Devils, a nickname that refers to Hart and Kreutzmann's drum duets and improvisation. The band features songs from their respective repertoires as well as new songs written by Jerry Garcia's songwriting companion Robert Hunter. The Rhythm Devils announced their first tour in 2006, which ended at the popular Vegoose festival in Las Vegas, Nevada over the Halloween weekend.
In June and July 2008, Hart led the Mickey Hart Band on a US concert tour. The band consists of Hart, Steve Kimock on guitar and pedal steel guitar, George Porter, Jr. on bass, Kyle Hollingsworth on keyboards, Sikiru Adepoju on talking drum, Walfredo Reyes, Jr. on drums, and Jen Durkin on vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044927/hart-the-dead-happy-to-rock-again-for-obama |title=Graff, Gary.

In 2010 Hart debuted "Rhythms of the Universe," a composition based on a variety of astrophysical data. The composition represents a collaboration between scientist and artist, using their own sophisticated tools. Nobel Laureate in physics George Smoot from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and Keith Jackson, a computer scientist and musician also from LBNL, are providing some of the data for the project. The final result will be a "musical history of the universe", from the Big Bang onwards through galaxy and star formation, up until modern times, including images from the Hubble Space Telescope and rhythms derived from the cosmic background radiation, supernovae, quasars, and many other astrophysical phenomena. The work premiered at the conference "Cosmology on the Beach" in Playa de Carmen in January 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/41727/3 |title=Faces and Places (page 3) |publisher=CERN Courier |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
