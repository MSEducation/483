==Career==

===Norwich City===

Shackell is a product of the youth academy at Norwich City of which he joined in 2000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/shackell.htm |title=Jason Shackell |publisher=Flown from the Nest |accessdate=27 November 2012[/tpl] He made his senior debut for on 5 April 2003 in a 2–1 defeat at Derby County, when he played at left-back following an injury to Adam Drury. Although Shackell's preferred – and best – position is central defender, his first few appearances were at left-back when Drury was either injured or suspended.
He added further experience the following season as Norwich won the First Division championship. He did not feature in the club's opening months in the Premier League but returned to the team in February 2005 in a home game against Manchester City. Although Norwich lost 3–2, he acquitted himself well and kept his place in the centre of defence for the remainder of the season, but could not prevent relegation.
The scene was set for Shackell to continue his progress in the 2005–06 season. However, a pre-season illness and a subsequent run of injuries caused him to miss four months of the campaign. However, the season brought him his first goal for Norwich on 17 October 2006 against Birmingham City, proving to be the winning goal. He scored two further goals that season, against Preston North End and Luton Town, but the club were unable to challenge for an immediate return to the top division.
After undergoing another ankle operation during Summer 2006, he returned to be a virtual ever-present in the next season. With the arrival of Peter Grant as manager during the season, Shackell was appointed captain at the start of the 2007–08 season. In October 2007, he signed a new contract that was due to have kept him at Carrow Road until 2010. However, his season took a downturn in December, when new manager Glenn Roeder relieved him of the captaincy.
Shackell lost his place in the Norwich side at the start of the new season after several new defensive signings arrived. On 1 September 2008, he left for fellow Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, signing a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £1 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wolves.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1381376,00.html |title=Shackell Completes Wolves Move |publisher=wolves.co.uk |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2008[/tpl]

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

However, he was unable to stake a regular place in the Molineux side, and fell down the pecking order. He returned to his former club Norwich on 10 February 2009, for the remainder of the 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1551897,00.html |title=Shackell Returns To Norwich on Loan |publisher=wolves.co.uk |date=10 February 2009[/tpl] The season proved unique for Shackell as he was relegated from the Championship, but having played 12 games earlier in the season for Wolves before his loan to Norwich, had done enough to earn a winners' medal when Wolves won the Championship on 25 April. 
Out of favour at Wolves, he spent the 2009–10 season on loan at Championship side Doncaster Rovers.[tpl]cite news |title=Shackell stays |url=http://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10329~1919407,00.html|publisher=doncasterroversfc.co.uk |date=31 December 2009[/tpl]

On 12 May 2010 he left Molineux, when he signed for Barnsley for an undisclosed fee.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnsley/8677175.stm |title=Barnsley sign Wolves defender Jason Shackell |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2010[/tpl] He served as club captain, replacing Stephen Foster. Shackell's first goal for the club came in the 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough at Oakwell on 28 August 2010. Shackell headed home to give Barnsley a 1–0 lead in the 28th minute.

Derby enjoyed their best start to a season for over 100 years, winning their first four games, and were in the top three going into the start of the October international break.
