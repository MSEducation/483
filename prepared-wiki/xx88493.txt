[[Mac OS Roman]]

CATEGORIES: Character sets, Mac OS character encodings, Articles with unsupported PUA characters

Mac OS Roman is a character encoding primarily used by Mac OS to represent text. It encodes 256 characters, the first 128 of which are identical to ASCII, with the remaining characters including mathematical symbols, diacritics, and additional punctuation marks. It is suitable for English and several other Western languages. Mac OS Roman is a superset of the original Macintosh character set, used in System 1. 
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority identifies this encoding using the string "macintosh". The MIME Content-Type for this encoding is therefore "text/plain; charset=macintosh". Mac OS Roman is also referred to as MacRoman or the Apple Standard Roman character set. The Microsoft Windows code page number is 10000.

==Codepage layout==

The following table shows how characters are encoded in Macintosh Roman. Each character is shown with its Unicode equivalent right below and its decimal code at the bottom.

==Application notes==

With the release of OS X, Mac OS Roman and all other "scripts" (as the Mac OS called them) were replaced by UTF-8 as the standard character encoding for the Macintosh operating system. However, default character encoding in Java for OS X is still MacRoman (see Mac Dev Center), and the keyboard layout with its combination of control, option, and dead keys still map to the original characters in MacRoman. The default character encoding for Java can be changed to UTF-8 by adding the following line to .bashrc:
 export set JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dfile.encoding=UTF8"
