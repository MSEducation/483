CATEGORIES: Lists of cities in Canada

This is a list of incorporated cities in Canada, in alphabetical order categorized by province or territory. More thorough lists of communities are available for each province.

==Capitals==

== Alberta == 
To qualify as a city in Alberta, a sufficient population size (10,000 people or more) must be present and a majority of the buildings must be on parcels of land smaller than [tpl]nts|1850[/tpl] square metres.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=m26.cfm&leg_type=Acts&isbncln=9780779745739 | publisher=Alberta Queen's Printer | title=Municipal Government Act - Revised Statutes of Alberta 2000, Chapter M-26 (Section 82) | date=January 1, 2010 | accessdate=June 3, 2010[/tpl] A community is not always incorporated as a city even if it meets these requirements. The urban service areas of Fort McMurray and Sherwood Park are hamlets recognized as equivalents of cities, but remain unincorporated.  Nine towns are also eligible for city status but remain incorporated as towns.
Alberta has 17 cities.
Notes:

== British Columbia == 
In British Columbia, a community can be incorporated as a city if its population exceeds 5,000.Government of British Columba - Local Government Act Once so incorporated, a city does not lose this status even if its population later declines; the once-larger city of Greenwood, for example, now has a population of just 708 people.
British Columbia has 49 cities. In March 2014, residents of the District of Maple Ridge voted in favour of changing to city status. The District of Maple Ridge has since requested the province to make the change official by September 14, 2014.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.mapleridgenews.com/news/252342341.html | title=Maple Ridge votes to become city | newspaper=Maple Ridge News | publisher=Black Press Community News Media | author=Phil Melnychuk | date=March 26, 2014 | accessdate=April 19, 2014[/tpl]
Notes:
== Manitoba == 
A community in Manitoba may seek city status once reaching a population of 7,500. Manitoba's newest city is Morden, which changed from town to city status on August 24, 2012.[tpl]cite web | url=http://mordenmb.com/morden-gets-city-status | title=Morden Gets City Status | publisher=City of Morden | date=August 27, 2012 | accessdate=October 31, 2012[/tpl]
Manitoba has 10 cities.
Notes:

== New Brunswick == 
New Brunswick has eight cities.
Notes:

==Newfoundland and Labrador==

Newfoundland and Labrador has three cities.
Notes:

==Northwest Territories==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in the Northwest Territories is its capital, Yellowknife.

==Nova Scotia==

Nova Scotia no longer has any incorporated cities, as they were amalgamated into regional municipalities in the 1990s.

==Nunavut==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in Nunavut is its capital, Iqaluit.
== Ontario == 
In Ontario, city status is conferred by the provincial government, generally upon the request of the incorporated municipality. A municipality may apply for city status anytime after its population surpasses 10,000. This status is not automatically conferred on a community that reaches this population target, but must be requested by the municipality and granted by the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Not all municipalities which reach this population target have pursued city designation. For example, Ajax, Oakville, Richmond Hill and Whitby, which all had populations greater than 10,000 in 2011, are still designated as towns. Once designated a city, however, a municipality does not lose this status even if its population later falls back below 10,000 (as, for example, Dryden). Ontario's newest city is Markham, which changed from town to city status on July 1, 2012.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/05/30/toronto-markham-city.html | title=Markham to change from town to city | publisher=CBC News | date=May 30, 2012[/tpl]
Ontario has 51 cities.
Notes:

==Prince Edward Island==

Prince Edward Island has two cities.
Notes:

== Quebec == 
In Quebec, provincial law does not currently distinguish between towns and cities — one designation, ville, covers both types of communities regardless of size. A ville might be informally referred to as a town or a city in English, but this is an arbitrary and subjective distinction. Quebec does, however, distinguish between villes and municipalités.
Quebec has 222 villes.
Notes:

== Saskatchewan == 
In Saskatchewan, Section 39(1) of The Cities Act indicates a town must have a population of 5,000 or more[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/Statutes/Statutes/c11-1.pdf | publisher=Saskatchewan Queen's Printer | title=The Cities Act (Chapter C-11.1 of The Statutes of Saskatchewan, 2002) | accessdate=June 4, 2010[/tpl] and meet other criteria in order to incorporate as a city, although in the early 20th century several centres such as Saskatoon and Regina were granted city status despite having a smaller population. The City of Melville retains its city status despite dropping below 5,000 people in the 1990s. Kindersley has expressed an interest in applying for city status upon reaching the 5,000 milestone.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.kindersley.ca/archives/73/May%202011%20Newsletter.pdf | title=Town of Kindersley May 2011 Newsletter | publisher=Town of Kindersley | date=May 2011 | accessdate=May 29, 2012[/tpl] Saskatchewan's newest city is Warman, which changed from town to city status on October 24, 2012.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gov.sk.ca/news?newsId=9cf836b6-afac-4ef0-9e06-f6d499fb8af3 | title=Warman joins Saskatchewan's family of cities | publisher=Government of Saskatchewan | date=October 27, 2012 | accessdate=October 31, 2012[/tpl]
Saskatchewan has 16 cities.
Notes:

==Yukon==

As in the other two Canadian territories, the only incorporated city in the Yukon is its capital, Whitehorse. Dawson was also previously incorporated as a city, but when the criteria were changed in the 1980s, its status was reduced to that of a town due to population. Through special provision, however, it is officially the town of the city of Dawson.
