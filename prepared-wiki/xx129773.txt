==History==

thumb|left|Narvaez marker in Jungle Prada Park The Jungle Prada—Mound Site is reputedly the 1528 landing site of the Spanish explorer Panfilo de Narvaez's Florida expedition to explore and expand colonial New Spain into North America. The remaining site of buildings set upon earthen mounds by the Tocobaga indigenous peoples of Florida predates the Spanish passing. 
In September 2012 a few miles north in Largo, St Jerome Catholic Church unveiled three historically accurate murals depicting the Narvaez landing, the first Mass celebrated in Florida, and early interaction between the Spanish and the Tocobaga.
