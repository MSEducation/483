[[Breach and clear]]

CATEGORIES: Assault tactics

Breach and Clear is a tactical name for a common room clearing method. It is used when capturing a room or area with guards, enemies, or hostile civilians near the entrances to the area. An explosive charge such as C4 or another similar device is placed over the door / entrance, then detonated. This allows free movement inside a heavily guarded area, as mostly all conventional locks would be incinerated by the explosion.
Breach and Clear can also be executed by opening a door first, then throwing an explosive similar to a grenade inside. This can be performed with a smoke grenade or a flashbang in order to incapacitate the enemy. This is often called Smoke & Clear, Frag & Clear, or Flash & Clear.
