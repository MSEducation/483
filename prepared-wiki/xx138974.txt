==History==

The original hospital was built at The Octagon in 1851, and moved to the site of the present hospital in 1865.[tpl]cite web| title=Hospitals| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MedicalServices/Hospitals/en|work=1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand| accessdate=2007-11-16[/tpl]
The hospital uses coal-fired boilers to generate steam, for cooking and cleaning. These are currently managed by Energy For Industry Energy for Industry Limited (EFI) is New Zealandâ€™s leading provider of energy solutions for industry and a subsidiary of Pioneer Generation Ltd  with surplus steam sold to the University of Otago and Cadbury Confectionery for heating.
In March 2007 two wards of the hospital were closed due to a suspected outbreak of norovirus, thought to have been brought in by a patient.[tpl]cite web|title=Bug closes two Dunedin hospital wards|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=500846&objectid=10430298|work=New Zealand Herald|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-16[/tpl] On 16 August 2008 the hospital was put in lockdown for one week due to a norovirus outbreak affecting 73 patients and nearly 100 staff, blocking most visitors for the duration, and postposting 2,300 procedures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/18130/norovirus-restricts-access-hospital|title=Norovirus restricts access to hospital|last=McLean|first=Elspeth|date=16 August 2008|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=2008-08-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10527489|title=Hospital still in lockdown amid seven new cases|date=August 17, 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2008-08-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/19034/dunedin-hospital-lift-lockdown|title=Dunedin Hospital to lift lockdown|last=Schofield|first=Edith|date=22 August 2008|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=2008-08-25[/tpl]

==Helipad==

The Ward Block building has a helipad on the roof of the northeast corner [tpl]airport codes||NZDH[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aip.net.nz/pdf/NZDH.pdf|title=Dunedin Hospital Heliport aerodrome chart|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=2009-03-16[/tpl] The building was designed with consideration for a helipad, after substantial fundraising one was built on the roof in circa 2000. The hospital helipad improves patient care, reducing the need for ambulance transfers between a remote helipad and the hospital. Due to CAA safety requirements, only "Performance Class One" (twin-engined) helicopters are allowed to land on the hospital.
