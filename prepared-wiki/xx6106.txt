K2 (also known as Chhogori/Qogir, Ketu/Kechu, and Mount Godwin-Austen) is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest. It is located on the borderText of border agreement between China and Pakistan between Baltistan, in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of northern Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China. With a peak elevation of [tpl]convert|28251|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=in[/tpl], K2 is the highest point of the Karakoram Range and the highest point in Pakistan.
K2 is known as the Savage Mountain due to the extreme difficulty of ascent and the second-highest fatality rate among the eight thousanders. For every four people who have reached the summit, one has died trying.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/download.html?func=startdown&id=161|title=K2 list of ascents and fatalities |format=PDF |publisher=8000ers.com |accessdate=2010-01-23[/tpl] It is more difficult and hazardous to reach the peak of K2 from the Chinese side; thus, it is usually climbed from the Pakistani side. Unlike Annapurna, the mountain with the highest fatality-to-summit rate, K2 has never been climbed in winter.

==Name==

The name K2 is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometric Survey. Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some [tpl]convert|130|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=in[/tpl] to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them K1 and K2.Curran, p. 25
The policy of the Great Trigonometric Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possibleThe most obvious exception to this policy was Mount Everest, where the Tibetan name Chomolungma (Qomolongma) was probably known, but ignored in order to pay tribute to George Everest. See Curran, pp. 29–30 and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, the last village to the south, or from the nearest habitation to the north, and is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured.Curran, p. 30 The name Chogori, derived from two Balti words, chhogo ("big") and ri ("mountain") (شاہگوری) has been suggested as a local name,[tpl]cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/243567/place-names--ii/|title=Place names – II|publisher=The Express Tribune|date=2011-09-02|accessdate=2011-09-04[/tpl] but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a compound name invented by Western explorersH. Adams Carter, "A Note on the Chinese Name for K2, 'Qogir'", American Alpine Journal, 1983, p. 296. Carter, the long-time editor of the AAJ, goes on to say that the name Chogori "has no local usage. The mountain was not prominently visible from places where local inhabitants ventured and so had no local name ... The Baltis use no other name for the peak than K2, which they pronounce 'Ketu'. I strongly recommend against the use of the name Chogori in any of its forms." or simply a bemused reply to the question "What's that called?" It does, however, form the basis for the name Qogir ([tpl]zh|s=乔戈里峰|t=喬戈里峰|p=Qiáogēlǐ Fēng[/tpl]) by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including Lamba Pahar ("Tall Mountain" in Urdu) and Dapsang, but are not widely used.
Lacking a local name, the name Mount Godwin-Austen was suggested, in honor of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area, and while the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society it was used on several maps, and continues to be used occasionally.[tpl]CIA World Factbook link|pk|Pakistan[/tpl]H. Adams Carter, "Balti Place Names in the Karakoram", American Alpine Journal, 1975, pp. 52–53. Carter notes that "Godwin Austen is the name of the glacier at its eastern foot and is only incorrectly used on some maps as the name of the mountain."
The surveyor's mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known. It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as Kechu or KetuCarter, op cit. Carter notes a generalisation of the word Ketu: "A new word, ketu, meaning 'big peak', seems to be entering the Balti language." ([tpl]lang-ur|کے ٹو[/tpl]). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain. He concluded that it was ...[tpl]cite book |title=Karakoram: the ascent of Gasherbrum IV |last=Maraini |first=Fosco |authorlink=Fosco Maraini |year=1961 |publisher=Hutchinson |location= |isbn= |pages= [/tpl] Quoted in Curran, p. 31.

==Geographical setting==

K2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China.[tpl]efn|name=India's claim[/tpl] The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from vast glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply. The Karakoram Range lies along the southern edge of the Eurasian tectonic plate and is made up of ancient sedimentary rocks (more than 390 million years old). Those strata were folded and thrust-faulted, and granite masses were intruded, when the Indian plate collided with Eurasia, beginning more than 100 million years ago.[tpl]Include-NASA|article=STS106-705-9|url=http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/debrief/STS106/topFiles/STS106-705-9.htm[/tpl]
K2 is only ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature, because it is part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalaya) as Mount Everest, in that it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than [tpl]convert|4594|m|ft[/tpl], at Mustang Lo. Many other peaks which are far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense.
K2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft|-1[/tpl] above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over [tpl]convert|3200|m|ft[/tpl] above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft[/tpl] of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over [tpl]convert|2800|m|ft[/tpl] of vertical relief in less than [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft[/tpl].Jerzy Wala, The Eight-Thousand-Metre Peaks of the Karakoram, Orographical Sketch Map, The Climbing Company Ltd/Cordee, 1994.
A 1986 expedition led by George Wallenstein made an inaccurate measurement incorrectly showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world. A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by that point the meme that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1467/which-is-taller-mt-everest-or-k2|title=Which is taller, Mt. Everest or K2?|author=Ian|work=The Straight Dope|accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]

==Climbing history==

===Early attempts===

The mountain was first surveyed by a European survey team in 1856. Thomas Montgomerie was the member of the team who designated it "K2" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4 and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II and Gasherbrum I respectively.Kenneth Mason (1987 edition) Abode of Snow p.346 In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached "Concordia" on the Baltoro Glacier.Charles S. Houston (1953) K2, the Savage Mountain. McGraw-Hill.
The first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge.  In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist: It took "fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain".
After five serious and costly attempts, the team reached [tpl]convert|6525|m|ft[/tpl]—although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that "neither man nor beast was injured" highlights the pioneering spirit and bravery of the attempt.  The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.Booth, pp. 152-157 in chapter "Rhythms of Rapture"
[tpl]anchor|Notable2[/tpl]The next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around [tpl]convert|6250|m|ft[/tpl] on the South East Spur, now known as the Abruzzi Spur (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within [tpl]convert|150|m|ft[/tpl] of the summit before being driven back by a storm.Curran, pp. 65–72
The next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when an American expedition led by Charles Houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route, and reached a height of around [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft[/tpl] before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[tpl]cite book |title=Five Miles High|author1=Houston, Charles S|authorlink=Charles Snead Houston |year=1939 |publisher=Dodd, Mead|location= |isbn=978-1-58574-051-2|pages= |author2=Bates, Robert [/tpl] Reprinted (2000) by First Lyon Press with introduction by Jim WickwireCurran, pp.73–80
The following year an expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within [tpl]convert|200|m|ft[/tpl] of the summit, but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[tpl]cite book |title=K2: The 1939 Tragedy|last1=Kaufman|first1=Andrew J.|authorlink=|year=1992 |publisher=Mountaineers Books|location= |isbn=978-0-89886-323-9|pages=|author2=Putnam, William L.[/tpl]Curran pp. 81–94
Charles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition. The expedition failed due to a storm that pinned the team down for ten days at [tpl]convert|7800|m|ft|-1[/tpl], during which time Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall, and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. In spite of the failure and tragedy, the courage shown by the team has given the expedition iconic status in mountaineering history.[tpl]cite book |title=K2 – The Savage Mountain|last=Houston|first=Charles S|authorlink=Charles Snead Houston |year=1954 |publisher=Mc-Graw-Hill Book Company Inc|location= |isbn=978-1-58574-013-0|pages= |author2=Bates, Robert [/tpl] Reprinted (2000) by First Lyon Press with introduction by Jim WickwireMcDonald, pp. 119–140Curran, pp. 95–103

===Success and repeats===

An Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, and the two climbers who reached the summit were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition were Walter Bonatti and Pakistani Hunza porter Amir Mahdi, who both proved vital to the expedition's success in that they carried oxygen to [tpl]convert|8100|m|ft[/tpl] for Lacedelli and Compagnoni.
On 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur, and used more than 1,500 porters.Curran, Appendix I
The third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge. The top of the route traversed left across the East Face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the Abruzzi route. This ascent was made by an American team, led by James Whittaker; the summit party was Louis Reichardt, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, and Rick Ridgeway. Wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about [tpl]convert|150|m|ft[/tpl] below the summit, one of the highest bivouacs in history. This ascent was emotional for the American team, as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier.American Alpine Journal, 1979, pp. 1–18
[tpl]anchor|Notable1[/tpl]Another notable Japanese ascent was that of the difficult North Ridge on the Chinese side of the peak in 1982. A team from the Mountaineering Association of Japan led by Isao Shinkai and Masatsugo Konishi put three members, Naoe Sakashita, Hiroshi Yoshino, and Yukihiro Yanagisawa, on the summit on 14 August. However Yanagisawa fell and died on the descent. Four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day.American Alpine Journal, 1983, p. 295
The first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj. Rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 Italian expedition led by Francesco Santon, which made the second successful ascent of the North Ridge (31 July 1983). Three years later, on 5 July 1986, he reached the summit via the Abruzzi Spur (double with Broad Peak West Face solo) as a member of Agostino da Polenza's international expedition.
In 2004 the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Fontán became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65.
The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a much more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more inclement weather and comparatively greater height from base to peak. The mountain is believed by many to be the world's most difficult and dangerous climb, hence its nickname "the Savage Mountain". It, and the surrounding peaks, have claimed more lives than any others.BBC, Planet Earth, "Mountains", Part Three [tpl]As of|2010|7[/tpl], only 302 people have completed the ascent,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/climbers.html|title=Climber Lists: Everest, K2 and other 8000ers[/tpl] compared with over 2,700 who have ascended Everest. At least 80 (as of September 2010) people have died attempting the climb.  Thirteen climbers from several expeditions died in 1986 in the 1986 K2 Disaster, five of these in a severe storm.

==Climbing routes and difficulties==

There are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties. First, is the extreme high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level.
Second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days' duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. Third is the steep, exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts there have been no successful winter ascents. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side, which is also where base camp is located.

===Abruzzi Spur===

The standard route of ascent, used far more than any other route, is the Abruzzi Spur, located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the southeast ridge of the peak, rising above the Godwin Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of [tpl]convert|5400|m|ft[/tpl], where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, "House's Chimney" and the "Black Pyramid." Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult to navigate slopes lead to the easily visible "Shoulder", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the "Bottleneck", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs which form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers summitted the peak in 2002 and 2003.
On 1 August 2008, a number of climbers went missing when a serac in the Bottleneck snapped and broke their ropes.
Survivors were seen from a helicopter, but rescue efforts were impeded by the high altitude. Eleven were never found, and presumed dead.

===North Ridge===

Almost opposite from the Abruzzi Spur is the North Ridge, which ascends the Chinese side of the peak. It is rarely climbed, partly due to very difficult access, involving crossing the Shaksgam River, which is a hazardous undertaking.American Alpine Journal, 1991, pp. 19–32 In contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the Abruzzi basecamp, usually at most two teams are encamped below the North Ridge. This route, more technically difficult than the Abruzzi, ascends a long, steep, primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain—Camp IV, the "Eagle's Nest" at [tpl]convert|7900|m|ft[/tpl]—and then crosses a dangerously slide-prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse, to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit.
Besides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.

===Other routes===

===Use of bottled oxygen===

For most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with bottled oxygen, and small, relatively lightweight teams were the norm.Andy Fanshawe and Stephen Venables, Himalaya Alpine-Style, Hodder and Stoughton, 1995, ISBN 0-340-64931-3Audrey Salkeld, editor, World Mountaineering, Bulfinch Press, 1998, ISBN 0-8212-2502-2 However the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen: 28 of 47 summitteers used oxygen in that year.American Alpine Journal, 2005, p. 351–353
Acclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness.
K2's summit is well above the altitude at which high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) can occur. In mountaineering, when ascending above an altitude of [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft[/tpl], the climber enters what is known as the death zone.
