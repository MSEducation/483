The European Union used the Units of Measure Directive to attempt to achieve a common system of weights and measures and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in road markings, and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of draught beer sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods, and to allow dual metric-imperial marking to continue indefinitely.
Other countries using the imperial system completed official metrication during the second half of the 20th century or the first decade of the 21st century.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] The most recent to complete this process was the Republic of Ireland, which began metric conversion in the 1970s and completed it in early 2005.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In January 2007 NASA decided to use metric units for all future moon missions, in line with the practice of other space agencies.
The United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada have some active opposition to metrication, particularly where updated weights and measures laws would make obsolete historic systems of measurement.  Other countries, like France and Japan, that once had significant popular opposition to metrication now have complete acceptance of metrication.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]

==Before the metric system==

The Roman empire used the pes (foot) measure. This was divided into 12 unciae ("inches"). The libra ("pound") was another measure that had wide effect on European weight and currency long after Roman times, e.g. lb, £. The measure came to vary greatly over time. Charlemagne was one of several rulers who launched reform programmes of various kinds to standardise units for measure and currency in his empire, but there was no real general breakthrough.
In medieval Europe, local laws on weights and measures were set by trade guilds on a city-by-city basis. For example, the ell or elle was a unit of length commonly used in Europe, but its length varied from 40.2 centimetres in one part of Germany to 70 centimetres in The Netherlands and 94.5 centimetres in Edinburgh. A survey of Switzerland in 1838 revealed that the foot had 37 different regional variations, the ell had 68, there were 83 different measures for dry grain, 70 measures for fluids and 63 different measures for "dead weights". When Isaac Newton wrote Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, he quoted his measurements in Parisian feet so readers could understand the size. Examples of efforts to have local intercity or national standards for measurements include the Scottish law of 1641, and the British standard Imperial unit system of 1845, which is still commonly used in the United Kingdom. At one time Imperial China had successfully standardised units for volume throughout its territory, but by 1936 official investigations uncovered 53 dimensions for the chi varying from 200 millimetres to 1250 millimetres; 32 dimensions of the cheng, between 500 millilitres and 8 litres; and 36 different tsin ranging from 300 grams to 2500 grams. However, revolutionary France was to produce the definitive International System of Units which has come to be used by most of the world today.
The desire for a single international system of measurement came from growing international trade and the need to apply common standards to goods. For a company to buy a product produced in another country, they need to ensure that the product would arrive as described. The medieval ell was abandoned in part because its value could not be standardised. One primary advantage of the International System of Units is simply that it is international, and the pressure on countries to conform to it grew as it became increasingly an international standard. However, it also simplified learning as the units are based on the metre, just using decimal based prefixes to cover all dimensions, instead of different names with ratios of 3, 12 etc. As the figures are decimal they are easy to add or multiply. Also scientific measurement and calculation are greatly simplified as units for electricity, force etc. are part of the SI system (e.g. 1 J = 1 kg·m2·s−2 = 1 V·A·s). Standardisation of measures has contributed significantly to the industrial revolution and technological development in general[tpl]According to whom|date=August 2012[/tpl]. SI is not the only example of international standardisation; several powerful international standardisation organisations exist for various industries, such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

==Forerunners of the metric system==

Decimal numbers are an essential part of the metric system, with only one base unit and multiples created on the decimal base, the figures remain the same. This simplifies calculations. Although the Indians used decimal numbers for mathematical computations, it was Simon Stevin who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes in his booklet De Thiende (old Dutch for 'the tenth').  He also declared that it would only be a matter of time before decimal numbers were used for currencies and measurements. His notation for decimal fractions was clumsy, but this was overcome with the introduction of the decimal point, generally attributed to Bartholomaeus Pitiscus who used this notation in his trigonometrical tables (1595).[tpl]MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004[/tpl]
In his Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, published in 1668, John Wilkins proposed a system of measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system.  He proposed retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that the length of a pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length.  This length, for which he proposed the name "standard", would have been 994 mm.  His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater.  The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.[ref]Reproduction (33 MB):
[/ref]Transcription: Wilkins
In 1670, Gabriel Mouton published a proposal that was in essence similar to Wilkins' proposal, except that his base unit of length would have been 1/1000 of a minute of arc (about 2.04 m) of geographical latitude.  He proposed calling this unit the virga.  Rather than using different names for each unit of length, he proposed a series of names that had prefixes, rather like the prefixes found in SI.[tpl]MacTutor|id=Mouton|date=January 2004[/tpl]
In 1790, Thomas Jefferson submitted a report to the United States Congress in which he proposed the adoption of a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures.  His proposed calling his base unit of length a "foot" which he suggested should be either 3/10 or 1/3 of the length of a pendulum that had a period of one second – that is 3/10 or 1/3 of the "standard" proposed by Wilkins over a century previously.  This would have equated to 11.755 English inches (29.8 cm) or 13.06 English inches (33.1 cm). Like Wilkins, the names that he proposed for multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.

==Conversion process==

The metric system was officially introduced in France in December 1799. In the 19th century, the metric system was adopted by almost all European countries: Portugal (1814),Fátima Paixão, Fátima Regina Jorge, Success and constraints in adoption of the metric system in Portugal, The Global and the Local: History of Science and the Cultural Integration of Europe, 2006 Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg (1820), Switzerland (1835), Spain (1850s), Italy (1861), Germany (1870, legally from 1 January 1872),[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][/ref] and Austria-Hungary (1876, but the law was adopted in 1871). Thailand did not formally adopt the metric system until 1923, but the Royal Thai Survey Department used it for cadastral survey as early as 1896. Denmark adopted the metric system in 1907.

===Chronology and status of conversion by country===

Notes
There are three common ways that nations convert from traditional measurement systems to the metric system. The first is the quick, or "Big-Bang" route which was used by India in the 1960s and several other nations including Australia and New Zealand since then. The second way is to phase in units over time and progressively outlaw traditional units. This method, favoured by some industrial nations, is slower and generally less complete. The third way is to redefine traditional units in metric terms. This has been used successfully where traditional units were ill-defined and had regional variations.
The "Big-Bang" way is to simultaneously outlaw the use of pre-metric measurement, metricate, reissue all government publications and laws, and change education systems to metric. India's changeover lasted from 1 April 1960, when metric measurements became legal, to 1 April 1962, when all other systems were banned. The Indian model was extremely successful and was copied over much of the developing world.
The phase-in way is to pass a law permitting the use of metric units in parallel with traditional ones, followed by education of metric units, then progressively ban the use of the older measures. This has generally been a slow route to metric. The British Empire permitted the use of metric measures in 1873, but the changeover was not completed in most Commonwealth countries until the 1970s and 1980s when governments took an active role in metric conversion. Japan also followed this route and did not complete the changeover for 70 years. In the United Kingdom, the process is still incomplete. By law, loose goods sold with reference to units of quantity have to be weighed and sold using the metric system. In 2001 the EU directive 80/181/EEC stated that supplementary units (imperial units alongside metric including labelling on packages) would become illegal from the beginning of 2010. In September 2007 a consultation process was started which resulted in the directive being modified to permit supplementary units to be used indefinitely.
The third method is to redefine traditional units in terms of metric values. These redefined "quasi-metric" units often stay in use long after metrication is said to have been completed. Resistance to metrication in post-revolutionary France convinced Napoleon to revert to mesures usuelles (usual measures) and to some extent the names remain throughout Europe. In 1814, Portugal adopted the metric system but with the names of the units substituted by Portuguese traditional ones. In this system the basic units were the mão-travessa (hand) = 1 decimetre (10 mão-travessas = 1 vara (yard) = 1 metre), the canada = 1 liter and the libra (pound) = 1 kilogram. In the Netherlands, 500 g is informally referred to as a pond (pound) and 100 g as an ons (ounce), and in Germany and France 500 g is informally referred to respectively as ein Pfund and une livre ("one pound").[ref]

 [tpl]fr icon[/tpl] "1 zeste de citron par livre (500g) de rhubarbe"[/ref] In Denmark, the re-defined pund (500 g) is occasionally used, particularly among older people and (older) fruit growers, since these were originally paid according to the number of pounds of fruit produced. In Sweden and Norway a mil (Scandinavian mile) is informally equal to 10 km, and this has continued to be the predominantly used unit in conversation when referring to geographical distances. In the 19th century, Switzerland had a non-metric system completely based on metric terms (e.g. 1 Fuss (foot) = 30 cm, 1 Zoll (inch) = 3 cm, 1 Linie (line) = 3 mm). In China the jin now has a value of 500 g and the liang is 50 g.
It is difficult to judge the degree to which ordinary people change to using metric in their daily lives. In countries that have recently changed, older segments of the population tend to still use the older units. Also, local variations abound in which units are round metric quantities or not. In Canada, for example, ovens and cooking temperatures are usually measured in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. Except for in cases of import items all recipes and packaging includes both Celsius and Fahrenheit so Canadians are typically comfortable with both systems of measurement. This extends to manufacturing where companies are able to use both imperial and metric since major export is for the U.S. but metric is required for both domestic and for nearly all other export. This may be due to the overwhelming influence of the neighbouring United States; similarly, still many English Canadians[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] (unlike most French Canadians[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]) often use non-metric measurements in day-to-day discussions of height and weight, and for clothing sizes, which are invariably measured in inches, though most driver's licences and other official government documents record weight and height only in metric (Saskatchewan driver licences, prior to the introduction of the current one-piece licence, indicated height in feet and inches but have switched to centimetres following the new licence format[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]). In Canadian schools though metric is the standard except when it comes up in recipes, where both are included, or in practical lessons involving measuring wood or other materials for manufacturing. In the United Kingdom, Fahrenheit is seldom encountered (except when some people talk about hot summer weather) while other metric units are often used in conjunction with older measurements, and road signs use miles rather than kilometres. Another example is "hard" and "soft" metric. Canada converted liquid dairy products to litres, 500 mL and 250 mL sizes, which caused some complaining at time of conversion, as a litre of milk is slightly over 35 imperial fluid ounces, while the former imperial quart used in Canada was 40 ounces. This is a "hard" metric conversion. Conversely, butter in Canada is sold primarily in a 454 g package, which converts to one Imperial pound. This is considered "soft" metric. Such countries could be said to be "semi-metric". However unlike in the rest of Canada, metrication in the Francophone province of Quebec has been more implemented and metric measures are more consistently used in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada.

==Exceptions==

As of 2007, in most countries of the world the metric system officially dominates; but traditional units are still used in many places and industries. For example:
In some countries (such as Antigua, see above), the transition is still in progress. The Caribbean island nation of Saint Lucia announced metrication programmes in 2005 to be compatible with CARICOM.[ref]

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom some of the population continue to resist metrication to varying degrees. The traditional imperial measures are preferred by a majority and continue to have widespread use in some applications.[tpl]cite news|title=Will British people ever think in metric?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16245391|accessdate=24 February 2012|work=News Magazine|publisher=The BBC|date=21 December 2011|author=Jon Kelly|quote=...but today the British remain unique in Europe by holding onto imperial weights and measures. ...the persistent British preference for imperial over metric is particularly noteworthy...[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=In the merry old land of lb and oz|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Times|date=10 May 2007|author=Melanie McDonagh|quote=A survey from the British Weights and Measures Association, admittedly a partial source, suggested that 80 per cent of people prefer imperial to metric and 70 per cent, including, remarkably, 18–24 year olds, can make sense of weights only in imperial measurements.[/tpl] The metric system is used by most businesses and is used for most trade transactions.

See paragraph 31  These units consist of the recommendations of the General Conference on Weights and Measures[tpl]SIBrochure8th[/tpl] supplemented by some additional units of measure that may be used for specified purposes.
Metric units could be legally used for trading purposes for nearly a century before metrication efforts began in earnest.
The government had been making preparations for the conversion of the Imperial unit since the 1862 Select Committee on Weights and Measures recommended the conversion[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][/ref] and the Weights and Measures Act of 1864 and the Weights and Measures (Metric System) Act of 1896 legalised the metric system.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][/ref] In 1965, with lobbying from British industries and the prospects of joining the Common Market, the government set a 10-year target for full conversion and created the Metrication Board in 1969. Metrication did occur in some areas during this time period, including the re-surveying of Ordnance Survey maps in 1970, decimalisation of the currency in 1971, and teaching the metric system in schools. No plans were made to make the use of the metric system compulsory, and the Metrication Board was abolished in 1980 following a change in government.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][/ref]
The United Kingdom avoided having to comply with the 1989 European Units of Measurement Directive (89/617/EEC), which required all member states to make the metric system compulsory, by negotiating derogations (delayed switchovers), including for miles on road signs and for pints for draught beer, cider, and milk sales.
In popular conversation, the stone unit is still used for body weight and feet and inches are used to describe height.

===United States and Canada===

===Air and sea transportation===

Air and sea transportation commonly use the nautical mile. This is about one minute of arc of latitude along any meridian arc and it is precisely defined as 1852 metres (about 1.151 statute miles). It is not an SI unit (although it is accepted for use in the SI by the BIPM). The prime unit of speed or velocity for maritime and air navigation remains the knot (nautical mile per hour).
The prime unit of measure for aviation (altitude, or flight level) is usually estimated based on air pressure values, and in many countries, it is still described in nominal feet, although many others employ nominal metres.  The policies of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) relating to measurement are:
Consistent with ICAO policy, aviation has undergone a significant amount of metrication over the years. For example, runway lengths are usually given in metres. The United States metricated the data interchange format (METAR) for temperature reports in 1996. Metrication is also gradually taking place in cargo weights and dimensions and in fuel volumes and weights.

==Accidents and incidents==

Confusion over units during the process of metrication can sometimes lead to accidents. One of the most notable examples was during metrication in Canada. In 1983, an Air Canada Boeing 767, nicknamed the "Gimli Glider" following the incident, ran out of fuel in midflight. The incident was caused, in a large part, by the confusion over the conversion between litres, kilograms, and pounds, resulting in the aircraft receiving 22,300 pounds of fuel instead of the required 22,300 kg.
During the reconstruction of Ypres after World War I, British Army engineers drew up the plans for rebuilding a bombed house in feet. However, the Belgian builders interpreted the numbers in metres. As a result the house had enormous doors and windows. It still exists today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
While not strictly an example of national metrication, the use of two different systems was a contributing factor in the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1998. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) specified metric units in the contract. NASA and other organisations worked in metric units, but one subcontractor, Lockheed Martin, provided thruster performance data to the team in pound force-seconds instead of newton-seconds. The spacecraft was intended to orbit Mars at about [tpl]convert|150|km|mi[/tpl] in altitude, but the incorrect data meant that it descended to about [tpl]convert|57|km|mi[/tpl]. It probably burned up in the Martian atmosphere.
On September 25, 2009, the British Department for Transport published a draft version of legislation to amend its road signs legislation for comment. Among the proposed changes is an amendment to existing legislation to make dual-unit height and width warning and restriction signs mandatory. This is justified in Paragraph 53 of the Impact Analysis by the text "... Based on records from Network Rail's incident logs since April 2008, approximately 10 to 12 percent of bridge strikes involved foreign lorries. This is disproportionately high in terms of the number of foreign lorries on the road network."  This proposal was shelved with the change of government in 2010, though many bridges are now signed both ways.

==Opposition==

Only the United States continues to see significant popular opposition to metrication, the main objections being based in localism, tradition, cultural aesthetics, economic impact, or distaste for measures viewed as "foreign". Popular opposition in the United Kingdom exists to a lesser degree and can be associated with anti-European Union sentiment.  In Canada, a change in government led to the abolition of the Metric Commission in 1985 before the metric conversion program could be completed.  France, where the measures were largely invented, saw popular opposition during the early 19th century, though not for long. Thus, with the exception of the United States, metrication is now accepted in all countries.
