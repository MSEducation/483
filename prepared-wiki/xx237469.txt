CATEGORIES: Languages of Togo

Togo is a multilingual country. According to one count, 39 languages are spoken.Ethnologue, "Languages of Togo" (accessed Oct. 31, 2010) Of these, the official language is French. Two of the most spoken indigenous languages were designated as national languages in 1975: Ewé ([tpl]lang-ee|Èʋegbe[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Evé[/tpl]) and Kabiyé.
Among the other languages in Togo, Mina (the dialect of Ewé spoken in Lomé) serves as the working language in the south of the country, Mobaa, Tem (also called Kotokoli) and Fula ([tpl]lang-ff|Fulfulde[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Peul[/tpl]). Most of the indigenous languages of the country can be divided into two groups: the Gur languages in the north, and the Kwa languages in the south.
The two national languages tend to be used regionally: Ewé in the south from Lomé to Blitta, and Kabiyé in the north.
According to the Délégation générale à la langue française et aux langues de France, 30% of the population have a working knowledge of French, 37% according to the French Ministère des affaires étrangères in 2007.
According to Couchoro [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] "The notable fact is that in the past 15 years, through developmental factors, and particularly to increased education, there has been a vast expansion in the use of French. The consequence has been an appropriation of French like never seen before". (Lafage, 1985, 551).
According to Isabelle Anzorge [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] "This is just an imported language, but it gradually assumes a Togolese identity, freeing itself from all normative constraints, thereby integrating the cultural realities of the country."
The latter noted the existence of a French dialect:Isabelle Anzorge 1988, Le parler français du Togo aujourd’hui, étude lexicale, DEA, Paris III. since the fall of conscription due to economic and political upheaval (the collapse of phosphates, devaluation of the CFA, university strikes following the general strike of 1992, climate of civil war since 1991), French has become a tool or a means of communication of most Togolese, educated or not.

==Written languages==

French is the main written language.  But they also speak English, Arabic, Latin and Spanish.  In the past, there was a language called the "Lululmangant" which was both spoken and written frequently, until the pirates attacked and took their homeland.

==Language policy==

French, which was inherited from the period of French mandate rule over the area, was made the official language at independence.
The decision to give Ewe and Kabiye status as national languages was as decided in 1975 by President Eyadéma.
