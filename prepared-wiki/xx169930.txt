MacMichael left for the United Kingdom and founded Cutting Crew along with Van Eede in 1985. After Cutting Crew's run of success ended and Virgin Records let them go, he worked with Robert Plant playing guitar and composing songs for his 1993 album, Fate of Nations.
His interlude with Plant was short-lived: MacMichael recalled when he auditioned for Plant, '"Play me something," he said. He's about my age so the first things that came to mind were songs by Buffalo Springfield and Moby Grape. His jaw just dropped and he picked me up off the sofa and said: "Never leave me."'Pierre Perrone, Obituary, The independent, January 7, 2003 The partnership lasted the single album and a world tour before Plant reunited with Jimmy Page, but the album's single "Calling to You", on which he played guitar, resulted in a Grammy nomination.Grammy Awards: Best Hard Rock Performance (1994 nominee), Rock on the Net
