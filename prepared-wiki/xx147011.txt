==Biography==

Maurice Devereaux (pronounced Morris Devro) was born in Montreal, Canada, and showed an interest in movies at an early age. He writes, produces, directs and edits his own films ever since he studied cinema at Ahuntsic College. Devereaux's self-description was featured on the Slashers DVD: 
 "Mine is a typical film-geek heritage; tons of Spielberg, Lucas and comic book superheroes as a kid. Superman the Movie, Star Wars, Close Encounters, Empire and Raiders are the movies that made me want to become a movie maker. In my teens, Carpenter, Kubrick, Raimi, Coppola, Romero and Argento were a huge influence. I also learned a lot reading Starlog and Fangoria magazines. In my twenties Lynch, Von Trier, the Coens, Jodorowsky, Rohmer, Allen and Scorsese had become a big part of my cinephile diet. Gigs directing and editing commercials and music videos, co-writing, editing and assistant-directing various shorts and features for filmmaker friends kept me alive during the long years trying to complete my own features."[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
