Federico Marchetti ([tpl]IPA-it|fedeˈriko marˈketti[/tpl]; born 7 February 1983 in Bassano del Grappa) is an Italian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Lazio.

==Club career==

===Torino===

A Torino youth system trainee, Marchetti made his professional debut on loan to Pro Vercelli, being then loaned to a number of other Serie C1 and Serie C2 teams in the following years: he spent the 2003–04 season as second choice keeper with Crotone and later Treviso, without making a single appearance with any of these teams. He started the 2004–05 season as third-choice keeper Torino, making a single appearance in his time with the granata as a substitute; he then asked[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] to be transferred in January 2005, after Torino signed another keeper, Gianluca Berti, and he was subsequently loaned to Pro Vercelli for the remainder of the season.

===AlbinoLeffe===

In mid-2005, Torino which originally promoted to Serie A, went bankrupt and a new team started again in Serie B as successor, and all of the old Torino player were allowed to leave for free. He was signed by AlbinoLeffe and left for Biellese in co-ownership deal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/torino/?action=read&idnotizia=6651 |publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=3 June 2009 |title=Marchetti, l'eterna preghiera[/tpl]
On June 2006, he was bought back by Serie B club AlbinoLeffe, initially as reserve to Paolo Acerbis. In his first season with the celeste, he made 13 appearances,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.lega-calcio.it/it/Serie-A-TIM/Giocatore.page?idplayer=357FC7D1-1D1C-5050-1BD0-BA22D14C9201 |publisher=Lega Calcio |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-06-21 |title=Marchetti Federico[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] being successively promoted as first choice keeper the following season. 
During the 2007–08 season, his performances proved to be instrumental in AlbinoLeffe's historic first qualification to the promotion playoffs, where his club narrowly missed promotion to Lecce. He subsequently won the Serie B best goalkeeper award, thus raising significant interest from top flight teams.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/cagliari/?action=read&idnotizia=1349 |publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=17 November 2008 |title=I protagonisti – Marchetti, la stagione della maturità[/tpl]

===Cagliari===

In July 2008, Cagliari agreed a loan bid with AlbinoLeffe for the goalkeeper, with Cagliari having an option to buy 50% of players' rights to an agreed price.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.realsports.it/index.php?method=section&action=zoom&id=68822 |publisher=RealSports.it |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=15 June 2009 |title=Calciomercato – "Marchetti è dell'Albinoleffe" parola di Andreoletti[/tpl]
In his first season in the Serie A, Marchetti confirmed his performances, firmly ensuring a place in the starting lineup, his performances being praised by several football pundits, being also defined by Gianluigi Buffon as his favourite Italian young goalkeeper.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Primo_Piano/2008/11/17/buffonchat.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=17 November 2008 |title=Buffon: "Juve seconda pelle Ma ero quasi del Milan"[/tpl] On 1 February 2010, Cagliari bought the remain rights from AlbinoLeffe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/8799/marchetti-e-tutto-del-cagliari.html|title=Marchetti è tutto del Cagliari|date=1 February 2010|accessdate=3 April 2011|work=Cagliari Calcio|language=Italian[/tpl]
However, he was frozen by the club in 2010–11 season, as his transfer request denied[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11854_6350619,00.html|title=Cagliari deny Marchetti talk|date=31 August 2010|accessdate=3 April 2011|work=Sky Sports[/tpl] He became the third keeper, behind Michael Agazzi and Ivan Pelizzoli. He was unfrozen on 3 April 2011, winning Genoa as unused bench.

===Lazio===

Following the departure of their Uruguay international Fernando Muslera at the end of the 2010–11 season, Marchetti joined Lazio. President Claudio Lotito activated Marchetti's €5.2 million release clause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sslazio.it/images/stories/documenti/pdf/investor_relator/relazione_finanziaria%20al%2031-12-11.pdf|title=	relazione_finanziaria al 31–12–11|date=29 February 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012|publisher=SS Lazio|language=Italian[/tpl] Marchetti arrived in Rome on 5 July to undertake a medical and sign a five-year contract. He described his move to Lazio as "the end of a nightmare".Marchetti: «Grazie Lazio. È la fine di un incubo»
Marchetti played a terrific season for Lazio and his presence and command over the defence together with his numerous saves helped Lazio achieve two consecutive Europa League qualifications placing Lazio on 5th and 4th spot respectively in 2010–11 and 2011–12 season campaigns.
Federico Marchetti has continued on with his form early in the 2012–13 season and is proving to be one of the protagonists in Lazio once again. Italian national squad selectors have once again focused their attention onto the former Italian International.
On May 26th 2013 he wins the Coppa Italia with Lazio in a historic derby against Roma, the first ever to assign a trophy, entering into the Pantheon of Lazio's players.

==International career==

In May 2009, following his impressive performances with Cagliari, Marchetti received his first call-up to Marcello Lippi's Italian national team for a friendly game versus Northern Ireland.[tpl]cite news |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/news/italy/31705/default.aspx |publisher=FourFourTwo|accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=28 May 2009 |title=Italy squad for Northern Ireland friendly[/tpl] He was featured in the game as a starter, and played the whole match, also keeping a clean sheet in a clear 3–0 win for the azzurri.[tpl]cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/9653896/Italy-beats-Northern-Ireland-3-0-in-friendly|publisher=FoxSports.com|accessdate=2009-06-21 |date=6 June 2009 |title=Italy beats Northern Ireland 3–0 in friendly[/tpl] Marchetti surprisingly made his World Cup debut in South Africa when he replaced the injured Gianluigi Buffon at half time during Italy's Group F clash with Paraguay. Marchetti kept a clean sheet, as Italy were already 1–0 down at the time of his introduction. In Marchetti's next two matches, he allowed in four goals out of five shots on goal.
Marchetti played only one game under new coach Cesare Prandelli, in the national team, during 2010-2012. In 2013 Marchetti was recalled by Prandelli to represent Italy in a friendly match against Netherlands. Marchetti was also selected in Italy squad to Confederations Cup 2013. Confederations Cup 2013 will be Marchetti's second major tournament with Italy, besides of World Cup 2010. He also was called in the second half of the friendly match, in honour of Pope Francis, between Italy and Argentina played in Rome.
