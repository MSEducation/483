==History==

The clan claims descent from Kusakabe-ōji (662-689) who was the son of Emperor Temmu (631-686).
The family was a line of daimyō (feudal lords) which, along with the Azai clan, opposed Oda Nobunaga in the late 16th century. 
The Asakura were defeated by Nobunaga at the Battle of Anegawa in 1570; the family's home castle of Ichijōdani was taken in 1573.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Asakura Nobumasa (1583–1637), nephew of Asakura Yoshikage, was allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi and with Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1625, he was granted Kakegawa Domain (25,000 koku) in Totomi Province.  In 1632, he was implicated in a plot; and he was dispossessed and banished to Koriyama where he died.
