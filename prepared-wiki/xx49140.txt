==History==

The Academy was founded by Lord Burghersh in 1822 with the help and ideas of the French harpist and composer Nicolas Bochsa. The Academy was granted a Royal Charter by King George IV in 1830.
The Academy's first building was in Tenterden Street, Hanover Square[tpl]cite web | author= | title= Key Dates| url=http://www.ram.ac.uk/history | publisher=Royal Academy of Music | date= | accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl] and in 1911 the institution moved to the current premises (which include the 450-seat Duke's Hall),  built at a cost of £51,000 on the site of an orphanage.[tpl]cite web | author=Pearl Adam | title=The Arts.

The Academy again expanded its facilities in the late 1990s, with the addition of 1-5 York Gate, designed by John Nash in 1822,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.culture24.org.uk/am28105 |title= Royal Academy of Music Museum, Culture 24 |work= |accessdate=2010-01-30[/tpl] to house the new museum, a musical theatre studio and several teaching and practice rooms.  To link the main building and  1-5 York Gate a new underground passage and the underground barrel-vaulted 150-seat David Josefowitz recital hall were built on the courtyard between the mentioned structures.[tpl]cite news | author= | title= Royal Academy of Music, new recital room, Marylebone Road, London | url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5379/is_200210/ai_n21320366/ | publisher= | date= Oct 2002  | accessdate=30 January 2010 | work=Concrete[/tpl]

==Campus and location==

The Academy's current facilities are situated on Marylebone Road in central London"Royal Academy of Music", Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music, ed., Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2004) ISBN 978-0-19-860884-4 adjacent to Regent's Park.

==Teaching==

The Royal Academy of Music offers training from infant level (Junior Academy), with the senior Academy awarding the LRAM diploma, B.Mus. and higher degrees to Ph.D.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Royal Academy of Music Marshall Scholarships| url=http://www.marshallscholarship.org/studyuk/ram| publisher=Marshall Scholarships| date= | accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl] The former Graduate Diploma GRSM, equivalent to a university honours degree and taken by some students, was phased out in the 1990s.  All undergraduates now take the University of London degree of BMus.
Most Academy students are classical performers: strings, piano, vocal studies including opera, brass, woodwind, conducting and choral conducting, composition, percussion, harp, organ, accordion, guitar. There are also departments for musical theatre performance and jazz.
The Academy collaborates with other conservatoires worldwide, including participating in the SOCRATES student and staff exchange programme. In 1991, the Academy introduced a fully accredited degree in Performance Studies, and in September 1999, it became a full constituent college of the University of London, in both cases becoming the first UK conservatoire to do so.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=University of London Council agrees withdrawal arrangement for Imperial College London | url=http://www.london.ac.uk/search.html?&no_cache=1| publisher=University of London | date= | accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl]
The Academy has students from over 50 countries, following diverse programmes including instrumental performance, conducting,  composition, jazz, musical theatre and opera. The Academy has an established relationship with King's College London, particularly the Department of Music, whose students receive instrumental tuition at the Academy. In return, many students at the Academy take a range of Humanities choices at King's, and its extended academic musicological curriculum.
The Junior Academy, for pupils under the age of 18, takes place every Saturday.
