The league is recreational, with divisions ranging from Division 1 (colloquially referred to as "Div 1", it is for the most skilled/experienced players) to Division 8 (or "Div 8", for new & inexperienced players). All teams are co-ed, with a minimum of 3 of each gender required to be on the field at all times.
Touring Teams
The VUL supports Touring (Club) teams, Furious George, Blackfish, Traffic, Zephyr and more. The primary goal of these teams is to compete in elite ultimate tournaments, especially provincial, national and international championships. Vancouver teams have had significant success at these events, winning multiple medals on the national and international stage. As a result in large part due to Vancouver players in the team of Furious George, Canada is currently ranked number one in the world, according to the World Flying Disc Federation.[tpl]cite web|title=WFDF|url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/world-rankings/175#Open|work=World Ultimate Ranking|accessdate=January 4, 2013[/tpl]
