Marshall Clagett (January 23, 1916, Washington DC – October 21, 2005, Princeton, New Jersey) was an American historian of science who specialized in medieval science.  John Murdoch describes him as "a distinguished medievalist" who was "the last member of a triumvirate Henry Guerlac and I. Bernard Cohen, who … established the history of science as a recognized discipline within American universities"[tpl]cite journal | last = Murdoch | first = John E. | authorlink = | last2 = Grant | first2 = Edward | author2-link = Edward Grant | last3 = Constable | first3 = Giles | author3-link = | title = Memoirs of Fellows and Corresponding Fellows of the Medieval Academy of America: Marshall Clagett | journal = Speculum | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | page = 811 | year = 2007 | url =[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Murdoch | first = John E. | authorlink = | title = In Memoriam Marshall Clagett (1916–2005) | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 34 | page = 261 | year = 2007[/tpl] while Edward Grant ranks him "among the greatest historians and scholars of the twentieth century."[tpl]cite journal | last = Grant | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Grant | title = Eloge: Marshall Clagett, 23 January 1916 – 21 October 2005 | journal = Isis | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | page = 332 | year = 2006 | jstor = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Grant | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Grant | title = Marshall Clagett, 23 January 1916 • 21 October 2005 | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 152 | issue = 1 | pages = 125 | year = 2008 | jstor = 25478473[/tpl]
