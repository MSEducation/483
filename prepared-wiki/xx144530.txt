==Early history: Meadows Lane temporary campus==

The Meadows School was conceived in the early 1980s by founder Carolyn G. Goodman, the current mayor of Las Vegas.  In 1984, she established a board of trustees and purchased [tpl]convert|5000|sqft[/tpl] of temporary prefabricated buildings.  These portable classrooms were set up on a [tpl]convert|7.5|acre|sing=on[/tpl] parking lot donated by Fletcher Jones, Jr., and the school opened on September 4, 1984 with Dr. LeOre Cobbley as Head of School.  At the time, the school supported 140 students in grades K-6.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

The development of a permanent campus has been an ongoing process that started when the school first opened on its temporary campus in 1984.  In 1985, Mrs. Goodman met William Lummis, nephew of Howard Hughes and Chairman of the Board for the parent company of the Howard Hughes Properties. He and his company were developing land in the Northwest Las Vegas Valley in an area to be called Summerlin.  Mr. Lummis and the Hughes family donated [tpl]convert|40|acre[/tpl] for a permanent campus. Construction on the new Summerlin campus began in the fall 1987. Lower school students moved into the LeOre Cobbley Lower School at the beginning of the 1989 school year, and the Middle and Upper school moved that December into the modular classrooms from the old campus after they were relocated and installed at the new campus.  The following facilities have been added since then.

===Richardson-Beckely Gymnasium (1992)===

The school gymnasium has three locker rooms and is home court for Middle and Upper School volleyball, basketball, and middle school P.E.  The Upper School basketball team just completed its 4th 2A State Championship League win this year (2007).  Also in the fall of 2007 there was a leak in the gym, and it had to be repaired.  The repairs finished in December 2007, and are very nicely done. After the 2008-2009 school year, the School began construction on the gymnasium once again, this time extending the gym to have a better weight room and more locker room space. The construction is scheduled to end post-graduation in 2010.

===LeOre Cobbley Lower School (1988)===

Dr. LeOre Cobbley founded the Lower School with her highly regarded Cobbley Program which stresses the "Three Rs: Reading, Writing, and 'Rithmetic'." (Even though only one of those is actually an R).  Students start Spanish, science, library skills, music and P.E. in Kindergarten and progress through successive levels of reading, research, math facts, and more from their home classroom.

===Upper School (1993)===

The Upper School, equivalent to a High School, offers a comprehensive curriculum of which students pick 7 classes per year.  Students are able to participate in 2A sports, clubs, and student council.

===Plaster Baseball Diamond (1993)===

The Meadows School's Baseball Diamond had its first inaugural game opened by Tom Glavine in 1993.

===Levin-Richardson Track (1995)===

The track at the Meadows is a full-sized high school track with 2A competition meets in addition to hosting a Track & Field Invitational every year.  At the 2007 State Track and Field Tournament, TMS was awarded many medals, and the Girl's Track Team placed an overall 4th at state, despite their small size.

===Creel (Football) Field (1995)===

Dedicated and opened in 1995.  The Meadows Upper School football team has the longest standing state record of 51 consecutive team wins and five state consecutive championships.  The 2009 season will be the first season played on turf grass since the stadium in use today was built

==TMS in the 21st century==

Completing the "PK-12" principle, the Beginning school (typically known as a Pre-Kindergarten) was opened in 1999 and founded by the matriarch of the school herself.  Wanda Lamb Peccole Center for the Arts opened in 2000.  The Fertitta-Sturm Middle School most recently opened in August 2005, which finally gave all teachers room to have their own classrooms.

==Administration Changes==

Mr. William R. Richardson, headmaster of The Meadows School for over 17 years, retired at the end of the 2005-2006 school year. In his place, two positions were created: Head of School (filled by Mr. Robert Ryshke), and Head of the Upper School (filled by Dr. Laura Roth).
However, in November 2006, Dr. Laura Roth, resigned from her position as Head of the Upper School.  On December 15, 2006,  Mr. Robert Ryshke, the Head of School, turned in his resignation to the Board of Trustees, and Mrs. Carolyn Goodman was elected by the Board of Trustees as Head of School effective December 16, 2006.
Mr. Henry Chanin, English teacher in the Upper School, was appointed Director of Upper School.  Mrs. Hilson, the most recent English Department Chairman, replaced Mrs. Lorna Ramsey as Director of Middle School.
