[[Tannin (demon)]]

CATEGORIES: Demons in Judaism, Mythical aquatic creatures

In the Bible, Tannin is the Hebrew term for Leviathan or sea dragon (Isaiah 27:1). Sometimes he is compared with Rahab, another sea monster who is especially associated with the Red Sea. Some scholars associated Tannin with Tiamat, as it happened with Rahab.  It is unclear in Jewish literature the differentiation between Tannin, Rahab, and Leviathan, but Tannin and Rahab are more easily confused with one another.  Tannin, as well as Rahab, was a name applied to Egypt after the exodus of the Israelites from that country.
In modern Hebrew the word tannin (תנין) literally means crocodile.
