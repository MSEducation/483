Nijinsky (21 February 1967 – 15 April 1992), usually known in the United States as Nijinsky II, was a Canadian-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was the outstanding two-year-old in Europe in 1969 when he was unbeaten in five races. In the following season he became the first horse for thirty-five years to win the English Triple Crown.
He was also historically important for establishing the international reputation of his sire Northern Dancer. Retired to stud he became the Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland and the Leading broodmare sire in North America.

==Background==

Nijinsky, a bay horse with a white star and three white feet, was bred at E. P. Taylor's Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Northern Dancer, the winner of the 1964 Kentucky Derby who went on to become one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. His dam, Flaming Page, by Bull Page, was a highly successful racemare, winning the 1962 Queen's Plate. At stud, she produced only two other foals, but one of these was Fleur, who produced the 1977 Epsom Derby winner The Minstrel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chef-de-race.com/classic_winners/english_derby/nijinsky_ii.htm |title=English Derby Winner: Nijinsky II |publisher=Chef-de-race.com |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] Nijinsky was a big, powerful horse standing 16.3 hands high, resembling his dam rather than his sire in stature.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1V6kJSUgd54C&pg=PA81&dq=Nijinsky+%22Triple+Crown%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aaYFT7nKF8P0-ga9wcl8&sqi=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Nijinsky%20%22Triple%20Crown%22&f=false |title=Great breeders and their methods ... – Frank J. Mitchell – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]
He was offered for sale at the Windfields Farm's annual yearling auction where he was bought for $84,000 by the American minerals magnate and industrialist Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., acting on the advice of the Irish trainer Vincent O'Brien. It was Engelhard's wife Jane who decided that the colt should be named after the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=37302882 |title=Nijinsky (1967–1992) – Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] Nijinsky was shipped to Ireland, where he was trained by O'Brien at Ballydoyle, County Tipperary.

==Racing career==

===1969: two-year-old season===

Nijinsky's first four races were all at the Curragh. In June he started at odds of 4/11 and won a six furlong maiden race by half a length. He followed up with easy wins in the Anglesey Stakes and the Railway Stakes. On his fourth appearance he was extended for the first time in the Beresford Stakes. He won decisively from Decies, a colt who went on to win the Irish 2000 Guineas in 1970. Having proved himself the best of the Irish two-year-olds, he was sent to England in October to contest the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Ridden for the first time by Lester Piggott he was held up at the back of the six horse field before moving through to take the lead inside the final furlong. He was an easy and impressive winner, earning himself top rating in the British Free Handicap.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Mortimer | first1 = Roger |last2=Onslow|first2=Richard|last3=Willett|first3=Peter| title = Biographical Encyclopedia of British Flat Racing| publisher=Macdonald and Jane's | year = 1978| isbn = 0-354-08536-0[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/16/sports/horse-racing-nijinsky-ii-destroyed-at-claiborne-farm.html |title=Nijinsky II Destroyed at Claiborne Farm – |work=The New York Times |date=16 April 1992 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]

===1970: three-year-old season===

====Spring====

On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Nijinsky won his prep race by beating Deep Run[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QMFDJfYT2UEC&pg=PA154&dq=Nijinsky+%22Deep+Run%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U6wFT_C3BNSGhQeQkYXYDQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nijinsky%20%22Deep%20Run%22&f=false |title=Encyclopedia of British horseracing – Wray Vamplew, Joyce Kay – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] in the Gladness Stakes at the Curragh in April and was then sent back to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas over one mile. He started the 4/7 favourite against thirteen opponents. Nijinsky took the lead two furlongs from the finish, and without being put under any pressure by Piggott,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lpJAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DaUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4106,6488917&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky promoted Derby favourite |publisher=Glasgow Herald |date=30 April 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] he pulled clear to win by two and a half lengths from Yellow God.

====Summer====

Nijinsky's opposition in the Derby at Epsom was stronger and he started at odds of 11/8. His rivals were headed by the French-trained colt Gyr.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dwkyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080,315723&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=It looks like Nijinsky's year |work=The Age |date=3 June 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] The veteran French trainer Etienne Pollet had delayed his retirement for a year to guide Gyr, a son of his champion Sea-Bird, through his three-year-old season. Nijinsky was held up by Piggott as usual before moving forward in the straight by which time Gyr was in front and moving clear. Two furlongs from the finish Piggott was forced to use his whip on Nijinsky. The favourite responded immediately, catching Gyr in a few strides and then pulling ahead to win by two and a half lengths. The winning time of 2:34.68 was the fastest Epsom Derby since 1936.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q0oNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Cm0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7272,642253&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky cops Derby |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=4 June 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] Piggott claimed that he was "always cantering" while Bill Williamson, who rode Gyr said that "Nijinsky was just too good."[tpl]cite web|last=Classic |first=Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2007/jun/01/nijinskioneofthegreatest |title=Nijinsky, one of the greatest | The Guardian. |work=The Guardian |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]
On 27 June Nijinsky followed up his Epsom win by taking the Irish Derby at the Curragh. Ridden by Liam Ward, he started at odds of 4/11 and produced impressive late acceleration to win by three lengths from Meadowville.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KmxGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C-kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=882,6367289&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky captures Irish Sweepstakes |work=Schenectady Gazette |date=29 June 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] In July, Nijinsky raced against older horses for the first time in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. His five opponents included winners of major races including Blakeney (1969 Epsom Derby), Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes), Crepellana (Prix de Diane) and Caliban (Coronation Cup). Without having to be extended, Nijinsky moved through to take the lead a furlong from the finish and won by two lengths from Blakeney despite being eased down to a canter in the closing stages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k-NKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CSINAAAAIBAJ&pg=6766,5549203&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky wins 10th |publisher=The Press-Courier |date=26 July 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]
In August, Nijinsky contacted ringworm,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_ZZlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3ooNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6466,1399402&dq=nijinsky+ringworm&hl=en |title=Nijinsky heads for U.S. |work=The Sun |date=19 October 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] which delayed his training schedule.

====Autumn====

Nijinsky appeared to recover fully after being placed on a "rich" diet including raw eggs and Irish Stout,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pJwgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JmgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1415,5131055&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky goes on rich diet |publisher=Lewiston Daily Sun |date=18 August 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] and was sent to Doncaster for the St. Leger in September. In the one mile and six furlongs race, he was attempting to become the first horse since Bahram 35 years earlier to complete the English Triple Crown. He started the 2/7 favourite and won comfortably,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ooRWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=suUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4724,5440536&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Triple feat to Nijinsky |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=14 September 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] although his margin of victory over Meadowville was only one length. As of 2012, he is the last horse to accomplish the feat of sweeping the English Triple Crown: since 1970 only Reference Point (1987), Nashwan (1989), Sea The Stars (2009) and Camelot (2012) have won two of the three races, but Oh So Sharp won the filly's version of the Triple Crown in 1985.
In his next race, Nijinsky was sent to France for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris in October. Piggott produced Nijinsky in the straight to make his challenge on the wide outside and 150m from the finish he caught the front runners Miss Dan and Sassafras and took a slight lead. In the last strides however, Nijinsky appeared to veer left away from Piggott's whip,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B5IuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OKEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2462,1042267&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky's unbroken string snapped in French classic |work=The Gazette|location=Montreal |date=5 October 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] and Sassafras, ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, produced a renewed effort to regain the advantage and win by a head. While some felt that Piggott had given Nijinsky too much ground to make up and had left his challenge too late,[tpl]cite web|author=Whitney Tower |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084221/index.htm |title=Nijinsky's defeat after 11 straight victories raised – 10.26.70 – SI Vault |work=Sports Illustrated |date=26 October 1970 |accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] the jockey responded by saying that in his opinion Nijinsky was past his peak for the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FJIuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OKEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1222,5229241&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |author=Dink Carroll |title=Playing the field |work=The Gazette|location=Montreal |date=20 October 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]
Less than two weeks after his defeat in the Arc, Nijinsky ran his last race in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket. Although he had been known to sweat freely before some of his previous races, Nijinsky on this occasion appeared to become particularly nervous and anxious before the start. In the race itself he ran well below his best form and was beaten 3/4 length at odds of 4/11 by the five-year-old English horse Lorenzaccio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I-FUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1987,4233678&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky beaten |work=The Age |date=19 October 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] O'Brien on this occasion concurred with Piggott, saying that Nijinsky appeared to have "lost his fire." Nijinsky was retired to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky having been syndicated in August for $5,440,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=akQsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=28wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6030,2392646&dq=nijinsky&hl=en |title=Nijinsky will stand in Kentucky |work=Herald-Journal |date=16 August 1970 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]

==Assessment and honours==

Nijinsky was given a rating of 138 by Timeform, the second highest for a winner of the Epsom Derby up to that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chef-de-race.com/articles/timeform_highweights.htm |title=Dosage |publisher=Chef-de-race.com |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] He was Timeform's Horse of the Year for 1970.

In 1970, a film was made about his racing career entitled A Horse Called Nijinsky. Narrated by Orson Welles, it was released in British cinemas and in 1988 released on VHS video.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430194/ The Nijinsky team also was voted the 1970 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/spoty_teams.shtml |title=Press Office – Sports Personality of the Year: team winners key facts |publisher=BBC |date=10 February 2004 |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] In a poll in 2000, readers of the UK newspaper The Sun voted Nijinsky their "Horse of the Millennium."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookmakers1.com/nijinsky.HTML |title=Nijinsky II Derby Winner |publisher=Bookmakers1.com |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] Among the more unusual tributes, a Cabernet Sauvignon wine[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wineonline.ie/cgi-local/browse.pl?view_wine=916 |title=L'Esprit de Nijinsky |publisher=Wineonline.ie |accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl] and a variety of winter wheat[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.limagrain.co.uk/news/52/index.phtml |title=Two New Outstanding Nickerson Wheat Varieties Added to the Hgca List!
