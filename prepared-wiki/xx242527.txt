====Ill-fated 'CB' logo helmet logo design====

In 1965, NFL Creative Services designed a brown "CB" logo for the Browns' helmet. It was never used in any games

==Jersey changes made through the years==

* 2006 - They also unveiled a throwback jersey that has been worn once a year since 2006 that features the black numbers on the sides of the helmets, along with a single white stripe on the helmet, removal of the shoulder numbers from the jersey tops, thinner stripes on the pants, and a different variation of striping on the socks.
* 2008–present - The Browns wore brown pants for the first time in team history on August 18, 2008, preseason game against the New York Giants. The pants contain no stripes or markings. The team had the brown pants created as an option for their away uniform in 2006 and appeared as the away default uniform choice in Madden 08 (2007 season).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699|title=Cleveland Browns | Brown out |publisher=Clevelandbrowns.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822033723/http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/article.php?id=8699  |archivedate = 2008-08-22[/tpl] They have not been worn in a regular-season game, however, at a Browns scrimmage on August 9, 2009, the Browns unveiled the brown pants with the white jerseys but switched out the all-brown socks with the white striped ones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/scrimmage_shows_offense_still.html |title=Scrimmage shows Cleveland Browns' offense still needs work |publisher=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl]  The Plain Dealer reported that head coach Eric Mangini may have the team wear the brown pants for all road games during the 2009 season.[tpl]Citation|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nfl/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1248597145139770.xml&coll=2 |title=Cleveland Browns might wear brown pants for all road games during 2009 NFL season |publisher=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl] Ohio native Brady Quinn has also gone on record to support the team's move to wearing the brown pants full-time; claiming the stripes on the white pants "prohibits mobility".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2009/08/cleveland_browns_scrimmage_ans.html |title=Cleveland Browns' scrimmage answers some Brady Quinn concerns; WR Leggett impresses|publisher=The Plain Dealer |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]
