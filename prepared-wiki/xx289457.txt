==Reception==

Joe Corey, of Inside Pulse, wrote, "The movie gets weird with a rather arty finale about cinema and reality. This isn’t so much Grotesque as Perplexed".[tpl]cite web |url=http://insidepulse.com/2011/10/31/dvd-review-roger-cormans-cult-classics-vampires-mummies-and-monsters/ |title=DVD Review: Roger Corman’s Cult Classics – Vampires, Mummies and Monsters |last=Corey |first=Joe |date=October 31, 2011 |website=Inside Pulse |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] Stuart Galbraith IV, writing for DVD Talk, said that "the picture is a time-wasting jumble of half-baked ideas, overcooked performances (the actors playing punks are ridiculously overwrought throughout), and herky-jerky pacing".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/50463/vampires-mummies-and-monsters-collection/ |title=Vampires, Mummies and Monsters Collection (Lady Frankenstein / The Velvet Vampire / Time Walker / Grotesque) |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |date=September 22, 2011 |website=DVD Talk |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl]
Paul Pritchard, of DVD Verdict, wrote that "Grotesque makes yet another shift as it becomes an early entry into the torture porn genre, before ending in total farce, as it makes one final genre shift into comedy".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/vampiresmummiesandmonsters.php |title=Vampires, Mummies, And Monsters |last=Prtichard |first=Paul |date=September 9, 2011 |website=DVD Verdict |accessdate=August 14, 2013[/tpl] A review in VideoHound's Cult Flicks & Trash Pics said that the film is "played too straight to be funny and too badly to be shocking".

==Home media==

Grotesque was released in a DVD set with three low-budget films - Lady Frankenstein, The Velvet Vampire, and Time Walker. While the other films in the set have special features, this film does not. It is the only film in the set that is full frame, which a reviewer for DVD Talk said that it "appears to be an ancient video transfer, one that might even pre-date the dawn of DVD".
