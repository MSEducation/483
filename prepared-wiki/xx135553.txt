==History==

"When settlers came to southeast Alberta during the great land rush of the early years of the 20th century, the village of Carlstadt was born. There was abundant hope of prosperity, and the new settlement, formerly a train whistle stop named Langevin, came to be known as the “Star of the Prairies.” But Carlstadt, later to be known as Alderson, was to become the centre of one of Canada’s worst agriculture disasters; victim of just about every imaginable calamity, including drought, fires, flies, grasshoppers and even marauding rabbits."
