The Fujairah F2 IWPP is an integrated water and power plant project in Fujairah, the United Arab Emirates. When construction is finished, it will be the world's second largest IWPP project.

==Technical description==

The Fujairah F2 IWPP will have an installed power capacity of 2,000 MW and it will produce 591,500 cubic meter of water per day.  GT26 heavy-duty gas turbines to the power plant will be distributed by Alstom, while desalination plant will be built by Sidem.
For the water desalination, the plant will use a combination of two different desalination technologies. 455,000 cubic meter of water per day will be produced using multiple-effect distillation (MED) technology and 136,500 cubic meter of water per day is produced using reverse osmosis technology (RO). The project is expected to be operational by the end of 2010 and it is expected to cost US$2.8 billion.
