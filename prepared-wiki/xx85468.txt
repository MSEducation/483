Charni Road (Old spellings: Churney Road and Charney Road)[tpl]cite book|last=D'Cunha|first=Jose Gerson|title=The Origins of Bombay|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=Bombay|year=1900|edition=3|pages=212|chapter=IV The Portuguese Period|isbn=81-206-0815-1|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=miD5YO05jpUC&dq=the+origins+of+bombay|accessdate=2008-12-29[/tpl] is a railway station on the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. The main significance of Charni Road station is that it is near the Girgaum Chowpatti beach and Marine Drive promenade, a major destination for tourists in Mumbai. It is also important because of the diamond trading industry located here, mainly in the Panchratna building near the railway station. 
The station derives its name from the fact that grazing lands for cattle and horses were located nearby in earlier days (Charne in Marathi means to graze)[tpl]cn|date=February 2012[/tpl] In 1838, the British rulers introduced a 'grazing fee' which several cattle-owners could not afford.[tpl]cn|date=February 2012[/tpl] Therefore, Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy spent [tpl]INR[/tpl]20,000 from his own purse for purchasing some grasslands near the seafront at Thakurdwar and saw that the starving cattle grazed without a fee in that area.[tpl]cn|date=February 2012[/tpl] In time the area became to be known as "Charni" meaning grazing. When a railway station on the BB&CI railway was constructed there it was called Charni Road. The BB&CI line from Back Bay to Virar opened in 1867.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xRsoAAAAMAAJ | page=170 | title=Eastern Economist  | volume= 64 | publisher = R.P.
