[[Logit]]

CATEGORIES: Categorical data, Functions and mappings

The logit ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|oʊ|dʒ|ɪ|t[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LOH|jit[/tpl]) function is the inverse of the sigmoidal "logistic" function used in mathematics, especially in statistics.  When the function's parameter represents a probability [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl], the logit function gives the log-odds, or the logarithm of the odds [tpl]mvar|p[/tpl]/(1-[tpl]mvar|p[/tpl]).http://itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/logoddra.htm

==Definition==

The logit of a number p between 0 and 1 is given by the formula:
The base of the logarithm function used is of little importance in the present article, as long as it is greater than 1, but the natural logarithm with base e is the one most often used.
If p is a probability, then p/(1 − p) is the corresponding odds; the logit of the probability is the logarithm of the odds. Similarly, the difference between the logits of two probabilities is the logarithm of the odds ratio (R), thus providing a shorthand for writing the correct combination of odds ratios only by adding and subtracting:

==History==

The logit model was introduced by Joseph Berkson in 1944, who coined the term. The term was borrowed by analogy from the very similar probit model developed by Chester Ittner Bliss in 1934.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/resources/0521815886/1208_default.pdf|author=J.

Barnard in 1949 coined the commonly used term log-odds; the log-odds of an event is the logit of the probability of the event.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

==Comparison with probit==

As shown in the graph, the logit and probit functions are extremely similar, particularly when the probit function is scaled so that its slope at y=0 matches the slope of the logit.  As a result, probit models are sometimes used in place of logit models because for certain applications (e.g. in Bayesian statistics) the implementation is easier.
