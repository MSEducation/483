[[HMCS St. Croix (DDE 256)]]

CATEGORIES: Restigouche-class destroyers, 1957 ships

HMCS ''St. Croix'' (DDE 256) was a [tpl]sclass|Restigouche|destroyer|1[/tpl] that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and later the Canadian Forces from 1958-1974. The fourth ship commissioned of a class of seven, St. Croix was laid down on 15 October 1954 at Marine Industries Ltd., Sorel and launched on 17 November 1956. She commissioned into the RCN on 4 October 1958 and thereafter carried pennant number 256 as a destroyer escort. She was the second ship named [tpl]HMCS|St. Croix[/tpl] to serve in the RCN.
St. Croix, along with [tpl]HMCS|Columbia|DDE 260[/tpl] and [tpl]HMCS|Chaudiere|DDE 235[/tpl], was one of three Restigouche class DDEs not selected by the RCN for modernization in the Improved Restigouche (IRE) project of the late 1960s.  All three paid off to reserve in 1974 (St. Croix on 15 November 1974) as economies required by government reductions in authorized strength. Her weapons and screws were removed and she was used primarily as an engineering training hulk while alongside at CFB Halifax until sent to the breakers in 1991.
St. Croix was not refitted as IRE, did not have ASROC, maintained 4Ã—3 inch armament until decommissioned in 1974 after transit from Esquimalt.
