[[La Bible d'Alexandrie]]

CATEGORIES: Bible translations into French

La Bible d'Alexandrie is a collection of fresh translations and commentaries in French devoted to the Greek Old Testament, the Septuagint. The first volume, devoted to Genesis, was edited by Marguerite Harl in 1986. Since then another eighteen volumes have appeared, and several others await publication. The series is edited by the French publishing house, Editions du Cerf.
In some respects the series responds to the earlier publication by the same publisher of the works of Philo of Alexandria.
The title strictly refers to the Pentateuch only, but has been extended to the whole of the Septuagint for the purposes of this edition, which is being prepared by a team of French scholars.
