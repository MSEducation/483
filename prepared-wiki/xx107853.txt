David Crutcher (born 1940, Burley, England) is a politician and small business man from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He graduated from Brunel University in England in 1962 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
In 1994 David Crutcher founded Ramatek Inc. a company that specializes in detecting engine wear in heavy machinery by analyzing the composition of motor oils. 
In the 2004 Alberta general election Crutcher ran for the Alberta Alliance Party in the provincial constituency of Calgary-Egmont.  He was  backed by the Progressive Group for Independent Business. He finished third with 14% of the vote.
On May 28, 2005, Crutcher became a candidate for the leadership of the right-wing Alberta Alliance Party, running against Paul Hinman, Ed Klop and Marilyn Burns.  The leadership convention was held on November 18 to 19, 2005.  On the first ballot he finished behind Hinman, the eventual winner, and Burns.  He withdrew following the second ballot. 
In July 2007, Crutcher left the Alliance Party and joined the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party and was later elected President of the party's Calgary-Egmont association by one vote.  In November 2007, he was impeached from this position because the Board of Directors felt he acted improperly as the President by supporting Craig Chandler during a candidate nomination.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/11/30/crutcher-turfed.html
