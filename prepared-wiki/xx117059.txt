Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), 1987 2 S.C.R. 84 is a leading case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada on sexual harassment under the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Court found that a corporation can be found liable for the discriminatory conduct of its employees who are acting "in the course of their employment". In looking at the purpose of the Act the court found that it was necessary to impose liability, as the employer is the only one in the position to remedy the discriminatory conduct.
