Asia has many of the highest mountain ranges in the world. These mountains form the boundary between the Indian subcontinent and rest of Asia, lying to the north of the subcontinent and the south of the rest of Asia. 
These mountains were formed millions of years ago in the collision between the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate. The Indian Plate is still mobile and  these mountain ranges continue to rise in elevation every year; of these the Himalayas are rising quickest. 
The Kashmir region, divided and disputed between India and Pakistan to the north of the Indian subcontinent is the point of confluence of almost all these mountains, viz. Himalayas, Karakoram, Hindu Kush, Pamir and Tian Shan. The Tibetan Plateau, divided between India and China is the region surrounded by all of these mountains, viz. Himalayas all along its south, Karakoram and Hindu Kush on the south-west, Pamir to the west, Tian Shan to the north-west and Kunlun to its north.
