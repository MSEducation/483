[tpl]For|uses of Dacian|Dacian (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Dacian[/tpl]
The Dacians ([tpl]lang-la|Daci[/tpl], [tpl]lang-grc|Δάκοι,[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12[/tpl] Δάοι,[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12[/tpl] Δάκες[/tpl]) were an Indo-European people, part of or related to the Thracians. Dacians were the ancient inhabitants of Dacia, located in the area in and around the Carpathian Mountains and west of the Black Sea. This area includes the present-day countries of Romania and Moldova, as well as parts of Ukraine,[tpl]sfn|Nandris|1976|p=731[/tpl] Eastern Serbia, Northern Bulgaria, Slovakia,[tpl]sfn|Husovská|1998|p=187[/tpl] Hungary and Southern Poland.[tpl]sfn|Nandris|1976|p=731[/tpl] The Dacians spoke the Dacian language, believed to have been closely related to Thracian, but were somewhat culturally influenced by the neighbouring Scythians and by the Celtic invaders of the 4th century BC.[tpl]sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica - Dacia[/tpl]

==Name and etymology==

===Name===

The Dacians were known as Geta (plural Getae) in Ancient Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) or Getae in Roman documents,[tpl]sfn|Appian|165 AD|loc=Praef. 4/14-15|ps=, quoted in [tpl]sfn|Millar|2004|p=189|ps=: "the Getae over the Danube, whom they call Dacians"[/tpl][/tpl] but also as Dagae and Gaete as depicted on the late Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana. It was Herodotus who first used the ethnonym Getae in his Histories.[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl] In Greek and Latin, in the writings of Julius Caesar, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, the people became known as ‘the Dacians’.[tpl]sfn|Fol|1996|p=223[/tpl] Getae and Dacians were interchangeable terms, or used with some confusion by the Greeks.[tpl]sfn|Nandris|1976|p=730|ps=: Strabo and Trogus Pompeius "Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt"[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Crossland|Boardman|1982|p=837[/tpl] Latin poets often used the name Getae.[tpl]sfn|Roesler|1864|p=89[/tpl] Virgilius called them Getae four times, and Daci once, Lucian Getae three times and Daci twice, Horace named them Getae twice and Daci five times, while Juvenal one time Getae and two times Daci.[tpl]sfn|Zumpt|Zumpt|1852|pp=140 & 175[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Roesler|1864|p=89[/tpl] In AD 113, Hadrian used the poetic term Getae for the Dacians.[tpl]sfn|Everitt|2010|p=151[/tpl] Modern historians prefer to use the name Geto-Dacians.[tpl]sfn|Fol|1996|p=223[/tpl] Strabo describes the Getae and Dacians as distinct but cognate tribes, but also states that they spoke the same language.[tpl]sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=150[/tpl] This distinction refers to the regions they occupied.[tpl]sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=150[/tpl] Strabo and Pliny the Elder also state that Getae and Dacians spoke the same language.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=44[/tpl]
By contrast, the name of Dacians, whatever the origin of the name, was used by the more western tribes who adjoined the Pannonians and therefore first became known to the Romans.[tpl]sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=151[/tpl] According to Strabo's Geographica, the original name of the Dacians was [tpl]lang|grc|Δάοι[/tpl] "Daoi".[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Riley|2007|p=107[/tpl] The name Daoi (one of the ancient Geto-Dacian tribes) was certainly adopted by foreign observers to designate all the inhabitants of the countries north of Danube that had not yet been conquered by Greece or Rome.[tpl]sfn|Fol|1996|p=223[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fol|1996|p=223[/tpl]
The ethnographic name Daci is found under various forms within ancient sources. Greeks used the forms [tpl]lang|grc|Δάκοι[/tpl] "Dakoi" (Strabo, Dio Cassius, and Dioscorides) and [tpl]lang|grc|Δάοι[/tpl] "Daoi" (singular Daos).Garašanin, Benac (1973) 243[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Parvan|Vulpe|Vulpe|2002|p=158[/tpl]Dioscorides’s book (known in English by its Latin title De Materia Medica ‘Regarding Medical Materials’) has all the Dacian names of the plants preceded by [tpl]lang|grc|Δάκοι[/tpl] Dakoi i.e. [tpl]lang|grc|Δάκοι[/tpl] Dakoi προποδιλα Latin Daci propodila "Dacians propodila"Tomaschek (1883) 397[tpl]sfn|Riley|2007|p=107[/tpl] The form [tpl]lang|grc|Δάοι[/tpl] "Daoi" was frequently used according to Stephan of Byzantium.[tpl]sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170[/tpl]
Latins used the forms Davus, Dacus, and a derived form Dacisci (Vopiscus and inscriptions).Mulvin (2002)59 "...A tombstone inscription from Aquincum reads M. Secundi Genalis domo Cl. Agrip /pina/ negotiat. Dacisco. This is of a second century date and suggests the presence of some Dacian traders in Pannonia..."[tpl]sfn|Petolescu|2000|loc=p. 163: "...patri incompa- rabili, decep to a Daciscis in bel- loproclio ..."[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Groh|2000|loc=p. 43: "...CIL V 3372 inscription at Verona Papirio Marcellino, decepto a Daciscis in bello proelio.."[/tpl]Gibbon (2008) 313 "...Aurelian calls these soldiers Hiberi, Riparienses, Castriani, and Dacisci " conform to "Vopiscus in Historia Augusta XXVI 38"[tpl]sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170[/tpl] The same name is often used in the geographical vocabulary of Ancient Persia,[tpl]sfn| Kephart|1949|loc=p. 28: The Persians knew that the Dahae and the other Massagetae were kin of the inhabitants of Scythia west of the Caspian Sea[/tpl] where Pliny names among the people of Sogdians the Dahae (Greek [tpl]lang|grc|Δάσαι, Δάαι[/tpl]; Latin Daci).[tpl]sfn| Chakraberty|1948 |p=34 "Dasas or Dasyu of the RigVeda are the Dahae of Avesta, Daci of the Romans, Dakaoi (Hindi Dakku) of the Greeks"[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pliny (the Elder)| Rackham|1971|p=375[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170[/tpl] By the end of the first century AD, all the inhabitants of the lands which now form Romania were known to the Romans as Daci, with the exception of some Celtic and Germanic tribes who infiltrated from the west, and Sarmatian and related people from the east.[tpl]sfn|Crossland|Boardman|1982|p=837[/tpl]

===Etymology===

The name Daci, or "Dacians" is a collective ethnonym.[tpl]cite book | title=Dacia: Land of Transylvania, Cornerstone of Ancient Eastern Europe[/tpl] Dio Cassius reported that the Dacians themselves used that name, and the Romans so called them, while the Greeks called them Getae.[tpl]sfn| Sidebottom |2007|p = 6[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Florov|2001|p = 66[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p = 434[/tpl] Opinions on the origins of the name Daci are divided. Some scholars consider it to originate in the Indo-European *dha-k-, with the stem *dhe- "to put, to place", while others think that the name Daci originates in *daca — "knife, dagger" or in a word similar to daos, meaning "wolf" in the related language of the Phrygians.[tpl]sfn| Barbulescu| Nagler |2005|p=68[/tpl]
One hypothesis is that the name Getae originates in the Indo-European *guet- 'to utter, to talk'.[tpl]sfn|Vraciu|1980|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn| Barbulescu| Nagler |2005|p=68[/tpl] Another hypothesis is that "Getae" and "Daci" are Iranian names of two Iranian-speaking Scythian groups that had been assimilated into the larger Thracian-speaking population of the later "Dacia".[tpl]sfn|Lemny|Iorga|1984|p=210[/tpl][tpl]sfn| Toynbee |1961|p=435[/tpl]

====Early history of etymological approaches====

In the 1st century AD, Strabo suggested that its stem formed a name previously borne by slaves: Greek Daos, Latin Davus (-k- is a known suffix in Indo-European ethnic names).[tpl]sfn| Crossland|Boardman|1982|p=8375[/tpl] In the 18th century, Grimm proposed the Gothic dags or "day" that would give the meaning of "light, brilliant". Yet, dags belongs to the Sanskrit word-root dah- and a derivation from Dah to [tpl]lang|grc|Δάσαι[/tpl] "Daci", is difficult.[tpl]sfn|Van Den Gheyn|1886|p=170[/tpl] In the 19th century, Tomaschek (1883) proposed the form "Dak", meaning those who understand and can speak, by considering "Dak" as a derivation of the root da("k" being a suffix) cf. Sanskrit dasa, Bactrian daonha.Tomaschek (1883) 404 Tomaschek also proposed the form "Davus", meaning "members of the clan/countryman" cf. Bactrian daqyu, danhu "canton".

====Modern times====

In the Proto-Indo-European language, where *dhe-, 'to set, place' from where dheua > dava 'settlement' and Dhe-k > Daci 'Dacian' is supported by Russu (1967).[tpl]sfn|Russu |1967|p=133[/tpl] "Daos" was suggested in 1957 by Decev as a possible connection with the Phrygian daos, meaning "wolf".[tpl]sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77[/tpl] The Phrygian meaning is supported by Hesychius's notes.[tpl]sfn|Eisler|1951|p=136[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Parvan|Vulpe|Vulpe|2002|p=149[/tpl] This hypothesis has had a large diffusion due to historian Mircea Eliade.[tpl]sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77[/tpl] The identification or connection with wolves is not unique to Dacians but also present for other ancient Indo-European tribes, including the Luvians, Lycians, Lucanians, Hyrcanians, and Dahae.[tpl]sfn|Eisler|1951|p=33[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Eliade|1995|p=12[/tpl] The assumption of Daoi (wolf) may also be supported by one of the Dacian standards, the Dacian Draco, prominently featuring a wolf head. Phrygii was another name used within the region, and in later times, some Roman auxiliaries recruited from the area were referred to as Phrygi. The German linguist Paul Kretschmer explained "daos" with the root dhau, meaning to press, to gather, or to strangle (as wolves often use a neck bite to kill their prey).[tpl]sfn|Alecu-Călușiță|1992|p=19[/tpl] According to Romanian historian and archaeologist Alexandru Vulpe, the Dacian etymology explained by daos (wolf) has little plausibility, as the draco was not unique to Dacians, while the transformation of daos into dakos is phonetically improbable. He thus dismisses it as folk etymology.[tpl]cite book |last1=Vulpe |first1=Alexandru |editor= Romanian Academy |title=Istoria Românilor |volume=1|year= 2001|publisher=Univers Enciclopedic |location=Bucharest |language=Romanian |isbn=973-45-0381-2|pages=420–421 |chapter=Dacia înainte de romani[/tpl] The form "Daus" or "Davus" could be also compared to a similar ethnonym in Old Persian "Daos" and to a Phrygian deity also called "Daos".[tpl]sfn|Paliga|1999|p=77[/tpl]

===Mythological theories===

Mircea Eliade attempted, in his book From Zalmoxis to Genghis Khan, to give a mythological foundation to an alleged special relation between Dacians and the wolves:[tpl]sfn|Eliade|1995|p=11[/tpl]

==Origins and ethnogenesis==

Evidence of proto-Thracians or proto-Dacians in the prehistoric period depends on the remains of material culture. It is generally proposed[tpl]by whom|date = January 2014[/tpl] that a proto-Dacian or proto-Thracian[tpl]clarify|date = January 2014[/tpl] people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans[tpl]clarify|date = January 2014[/tpl] from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age (3,300–3,000 BC)Hoddinott, p. 27. when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples.Casson, p. 3. The indigenous people were Danubian farmers, and the invading people of the BC 3rd millennium were Kurgan warrior-herders from the Ukrainian and Russian steppes.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=58[/tpl]
Indo-Europeanization was complete by the beginning of the Bronze Age. The people of that time are best described as proto-Thracians, which later developed in the Iron Age into Danubian-Carpathian Geto-Dacians as well as Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula.[tpl]sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=53[/tpl]
Between BC 15th–12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors who were on their way through the Balkans to Anatolia.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59[/tpl] When the La Tene Celts arrived in BC 4th century, the Dacians were under the influence of the Scythians.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59[/tpl]
Alexander the Great attacked the Getae in BC 335 on the lower Danube, but by BC 300 they had formed a state founded on a military democracy, and began a period of conquest.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59[/tpl] More Celts arrived during the BC 3rd century, and in BC 1st century the people of Boii tried to conquer some of the Dacian territory on the eastern side of the Teiss river. The Dacians drove the Boii south across the Danube and out of their territory, at which point the Boii abandoned any further plans for invasion.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59[/tpl]

==Identity and distribution==

North of the Danube, Dacians occupied[tpl]when|date = October 2013[/tpl] a larger territory than Ptolemaic Dacia,[tpl]Clarify|need to explain exactly what Ptolemaic Dacia is - the area shown as Dacian in Ptolemy's maps? They aren't mentioned until later in the article|date=July 2012[/tpl] stretching between Bohemia in the west and the Dnieper cataracts in the east, and up to the Pripyat, Vistula, and Oder rivers in the north and northwest.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=279[/tpl][tpl]better source|date = October 2013[/tpl] In BC 53, Julius Caesar stated that the Dacian territory[tpl]clarify|date = November 2013[/tpl] was on the eastern border of the Hercynian forest.[tpl]sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59[/tpl] According to Strabo's Geographica, written around AD 20,[tpl]sfn|Strabo|Jones|Sterrett|1967|p=28[/tpl] the Getes (Geto-Dacians) bordered the Suevi who lived in the Hercynian Forest, which is somewhere in the vicinity of the river Duria, the present-day Vah (Waag).[tpl]sfn|Abramea|1994|p=17[/tpl] Dacians lived on both sides of the Danube.[tpl]sfn|Dio|2008|loc=Volume 3[/tpl] [tpl]sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=67[/tpl] According to Strabo, Moesians also lived on both sides of the Danube.[tpl]sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=434[/tpl] According to Agrippa,[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=221|ps=Agrippa comments “Dacia, Getico finiuntur ab oriente desertis Sarmatiae, ab occidente flumine Vistula, a septentrione Oceano, a meridie flumine Histro. Quae patent in longitudine milia passuum CCLXXX, in latitudine qua cogitum est milia passuum CCCLXXXVI”[/tpl] Dacia was limited by the Baltic Ocean in the North and by the Vistula in the West.[tpl]sfn | Schütte| 1917 | p=109 [/tpl] The names of the people and settlements confirm Dacia’s borders as described by Agrippa.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=221[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Schütte| 1917 | pp=101 and 109 [/tpl] Dacian people also lived south of the Danube.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=221[/tpl]

===Linguistic affiliation===

The Dacians and Getae were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo and Pliny the Elder), and were both said to speak the same Thracian language.[tpl]sfn|Treptow |1996|p=10[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ellis|1861|p=70[/tpl] The linguistic affiliation of Dacian is uncertain, since the ancient Indo-European language in question became extinct and left very limited traces, usually in the form of place names, plant names and personal names. Thraco-Dacian (or Thracian and Daco-Mysian)[tpl]which|date=November 2013[/tpl] seems to belong to the eastern (satem) group of Indo-European languages.[tpl]why|date=November 2013[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Brixhe|2008|p=72[/tpl] There are two contradictory theories: Some scholars (such as Tomaschek 1883; Russu 1967; Solta 1980; Crossland 1982; Vraciu 1980) consider Dacian to be a Thracian language or a dialect thereof. This view is supported by R. G. Solta, who says that Thracian and Dacian are very closely related languages.[tpl]sfn | Fisher | 2003 | p=570[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rosetti |1982|p=5[/tpl] Other scholars (such as Georgiev 1965, Duridanov 1976) consider that Thracian and Dacian are two different and specific Indo-European languages which cannot be reduced to a common language.[tpl]sfn|Duridanov|1985|p=130[/tpl] Linguists such as Polomé and Katičić expressed reservations[tpl]clarify|date=November 2013[/tpl] about both theories.[tpl]sfn|Polomé|1982|p=876[/tpl]
The Dacians are generally considered[tpl]by whom|date=November 2013[/tpl] to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity[tpl]specify|date=November 2013[/tpl] from earlier Iron Age communities loosely termed[tpl]by whom|date=November 2013[/tpl] Getic.[tpl]sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=215[/tpl] Since in one interpretation, Dacian is a variety of Thracian, for the reasons of convenience, the generic term ‘Daco-Thracian” is used, with "Dacian" reserved for the language or dialect that was spoken north of Danube, in present-day Romania and eastern Hungary, and "Thracian" for the variety spoken south of the Danube. [tpl]sfn|Price|2000|p=120[/tpl] There is no doubt that the Thracian language was related to the Dacian language which was spoken in what is today Romania, before that area was occupied by the Romans.[tpl]sfn|Renfrew|1990|p=71[/tpl] Also, both Thracian and Dacian have one of the main satem characteristic changes of Indo-European language, *k and *g to *s and *z.[tpl]sfn | Hainsworth| 1982 | p=848[/tpl] With regard to the term "Getic" (Getae), even though attempts have been made to distinguish between Dacian and Getic, there seems no compelling reason to disregard the view of the Greek geographer Strabo that the Daci and the Getae, Thracian tribes dwelling north of the Danube (the Daci in the west of the area and the Getae further east), were one and the same people and spoke the same language.[tpl]sfn|Price|2000|p=120[/tpl]
Another variety that has sometimes been recognized[tpl]by whom|date=November 2013[/tpl] is that of Moesian (or Mysian) for the language of an intermediate area immediately to the south of Danube in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romanian Dobruja: this and the dialects north of the Danube have been grouped together as Daco-Moesian.[tpl]sfn|Price|2000|p=120[/tpl] The language of the indigenous population has left hardly any trace in the anthroponymy of Moesia, but the toponymy indicates that the Moesii on the south bank of the Danube, north of the Haemus Mountains, and the Triballi in the valley of the Morava, shared a number of characteristic linguistic features[tpl]specify|date=November 2013[/tpl] with the Dacii south of the Carpathians and the Getae in the Wallachian plain, which sets them apart from the Thracians though their languages are undoubtedly related.Polomé (1983) 540
Vladimir Georgiev disputes that Dacian and Thracian were closely related for various reasons, most notably that Dacian and Moesian town names commonly end with the suffix -DAVA, while towns in Thrace proper (i.e. South of the Balkan mountains) generally end in -PARA (see Dacian language). According to Georgiev, the language spoken by the ethnic Dacians should be classified as "Daco-Moesian" and regarded as distinct from Thracian.Georgiev (1960) 39-58 Georgiev also claimed that names from approximately Roman Dacia and Moesia show different and generally less extensive changes in Indo-European consonants and vowels than those found in Thrace itself. However, the evidence seems to indicate divergence of a Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not so different as to qualify as separate languages.[tpl]sfn | Crossland|Boardman| 1982 | p=838[/tpl] Polomé considers that such lexical differentiation ( -dava vs. para) would, however, be hardly enough evidence to separate Daco-Moesian from Thracian.[tpl]sfn|Polomé|1982|p=876[/tpl]

===Tribes===

An extensive account of the native tribes in Dacia can be found in the ninth tabula of Europe of Ptolemy’s Geography.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46[/tpl] The Geography was probably written in the period AD 140–150, but the sources were often earlier; for example, Roman Britain is shown before the building of Hadrian’s Wall in the AD 120s.[tpl]sfn|Koch J.|Koch J.T.|2007|p=1471[/tpl] Ptolemy's Geography also contains a physical map probably designed before the Roman conquest, and containing no detailed nomenclature.[tpl]sfn|Schütte|1917|p=88[/tpl] There are references to the Tabula Peutingeriana, but it appears that the Dacian map of the Tabula was completed after the final triumph of Roman nationality.[tpl]sfn|Schütte|1917|p=89[/tpl] Ptolemy's list includes no fewer than twelve tribes with Geto-Dacian names.[tpl]sfn|Bennett|1997|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=250[/tpl]
The fifteen tribes of Dacia as named by Ptolemy, starting from the northernmost ones, are as follows. First, the Anartes, the Teurisci and the Coertoboci/Costoboci. To the south of them are the Buredeense (Buri/Burs), the Cotense/Cotini and then the Albocense, the Potulatense and the Sense, while the southernmost were the Saldense, the Ciaginsi and the Piephigi. To the south of them were Predasense/Predavensi, the Rhadacense/Rhatacenses, the Caucoense (Cauci) and Biephi.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46[/tpl] Twelve out of these fifteen tribes listed by Ptolemy are ethnic Dacians,[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=250[/tpl] and three are Celt Anarti, Teurisci, and Cotense.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=250[/tpl] There are also previous brief mentions of other Getae or Dacian tribes on the left and right banks of the Danube, or even in Transylvania, to be added to the list of Ptolemy. Among these other tribes are the Trixae, Crobidae and Appuli.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=46[/tpl]
Some peoples inhabiting the region generally described in Roman times as "Dacia" were not ethnic Dacians.Wilcox (2000)18 The true Dacians were a people of Thracian descent. German elements (Daco-Germans), Celtic elements (Daco-Celtic) and Iranian elements (Daco-Sarmatian) occupied territories in the north-west and north-east of Dacia.Wilcox (2000)24[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|pp=222-223[/tpl] This region covered roughly the same area as modern Romania plus Bessarabia (Republic of Moldova) and eastern Galicia (south-west Ukraine), although Ptolemy places Moldavia and Bessarabia in Sarmatia Europaea, rather than Dacia.Ptolemy III.5 and 8 After the Dacian Wars (AD 101-6), the Romans occupied only about half of the wider Dacian region. The Roman province of Dacia covered just western Wallachia as far as the Limes Transalutanus (East of the river Aluta, or Olt) and Transylvania, as bordered by the Carpathians.Barrington Plate 22
The impact of the Roman conquest on these people is uncertain. One hypothesis was that they were effectively eliminated. An important clue to the character of Dacian casualties is offered by the ancient sources Eutropius and Crito. Both speak about men when they describe the losses suffered by the Dacians in the wars. This suggests that both refer to losses due to fighting, not due to a process of extermination of the whole population.[tpl]sfn | Ruscu | 2004 | p=78[/tpl] A strong component of the Dacian army, including the Celtic Bastarnae and the Germans, had withdrawn rather than submit to Trajan.Wilcox (2000)27 Some scenes on Trajan’s Column represent acts of obedience of the Dacian population, and others show the refugee Dacians returning to their own places.[tpl]sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=51[/tpl] Dacians trying to buy amnesty are depicted on Trajan's Column (one offers to Trajan a tray of three gold ingots).[tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |1975|p=90[/tpl] Alternatively, a substantial number may have survived in the province, although were probably outnumbered by the Romanised immigrants.Millar (1970) Cultural life in Dacia became very mixed and decidedly cosmopolitan because of the colonial communities. The Dacians retained their names and their own ways in the midst of the newcomers, and the region continued to exhibit Dacian characteristics.[tpl]sfn | Bunson | 2002 | p=167[/tpl] The Dacians who survived the war are attested as revolting against the Roman domination in Dacia at least twice, in the period of time right after the Dacian Wars, and in a more determined manner in 117 AD.[tpl]sfn | Pop | 2000 | p=22[/tpl] In 158 AD, they revolted again, and were put down by M. Statius Priscus.[tpl]sfn | Denne Parker | 1958 | pp=12 and 19[/tpl] Some Dacians were apparently expelled from the occupied zone at the end of each of the two Dacian Wars, or otherwise emigrated. It is uncertain where these refugees settled. Some of these people might have mingled with the existing ethnic Dacian tribes beyond the Carpathians (the Costoboci and Carpi).
After Trajan’s conquest of Dacia there was recurring trouble involving Dacian groups excluded from the Roman province, as finally defined by Hadrian. By the early third century the "Free Dacians", as they were earlier known, were a significantly troublesome group, then identified as the Carpi, requiring imperial intervention on more than one occasion.[tpl]sfn | Wilkes | 2005 | p=224[/tpl] In 214 Caracalla dealt with their attacks. Later, Philip the Arab came in person to deal with them; he assumed the triumphal title Carpicus Maximus and inaugurated a new era for the province of Dacia (July 20, 246). Later both Decius and Gallienus assumed the titles Dacicus Maximus. In 272, Aurelian assumed the same title as Philip.[tpl]sfn | Wilkes | 2005 | p=224[/tpl]
In about 140 AD, Ptolemy lists the names of several tribes residing on the fringes of the Roman Dacia (west, east and north of the Carpathian range), and the ethnic picture seems to be a mixed one. North of the Carpathians are recorded the Anarti, Teurisci and Costoboci.Ptolemy III.8 The Anarti (or Anartes) and the Teurisci were originally probably Celtic peoples or mixed Dacian-Celtic.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|pp=222-223[/tpl] The Anarti, together with the Celtic Cotini, are described by Tacitus as vassals of the powerful Quadi Germanic people.Tacitus G.43 The Teurisci were probably a group of Celtic Taurisci from the eastern Alps. However, archaeology has revealed that the Celtic tribes had originally spread from west to east as far as Transylvania, before being absorbed by the Dacians in the 1st century BC.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|pp=461-462[/tpl]

====Costoboci====

The main view is that the Costoboci were ethnically Dacian.[ref]

[/ref] Others considered them a Slavic or Sarmatian tribe.[tpl]sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=100[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=184[/tpl] There was also a Celtic influence, so that some consider them a mixed Celtic and Thracian group that appear, after Trajan's conquest, as a Dacian group within the Celtic superstratum.[tpl]sfn|Nandris|1976|p=729[/tpl] The Costoboci inhabited the southern slopes of the Carpathians.[tpl]sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=98[/tpl] Ptolemy named the Coestoboci (Costoboci in Roman sources) twice, showing them divided by the Dniester and the Peucinian (Carpathian) Mountains. This suggests that they lived on both sides of the Carpathians, but it is also possible that two accounts about the same people were combined.[tpl]sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=98[/tpl] There was also a group, the Transmontani, that some modern scholars identify as Dacian Transmontani Costoboci of the extreme north.[tpl]sfn|Shutte|1917|p=100[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Parvan |Florescu |1982|p=135[/tpl] The name Transmontani was from the Dacians' Latin,[tpl]sfn|Sir Smith|1856|p=961[/tpl] literally "people over the mountains". Mullenhoff identified these with the Transiugitani, another Dacian tribe north of the Carpathian mountains.[tpl]sfn|Shutte|1917|p=18[/tpl]
Based on the account of Dio Cassius, Heather (2010) considers that Hasding Vandals, around 171 AD, attempted to take control of lands which previously belonged to the free Dacian group called the Costoboci.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=131[/tpl] Hrushevskyi (1997) mentions that the earlier widespread view that these Carpathian tribes were Slavic has no basis. This would be contradicted by the Coestobocan names themselves that are known from the inscriptions, written by a Coestobocan and therefore presumably accurately. These names sound quite unlike anything Slavic.[tpl]sfn | Hrushevskyi | 1997 | p=100[/tpl] Scholars such as Tomaschek (1883), Shutte (1917) and Russu (1969) consider these Costobocian names to be Thraco-Dacian.[tpl]sfn | Tomaschek | 1883 | p=407[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=143[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Russu | 1969 | pp= 99,116 [/tpl] This inscription also indicates the Dacian background of the wife of the Costobocian king "Ziais Tiati filia Daca".VI, 1 801=ILS 854 This indication of the socio-familial line of descent seen also in other inscriptions (i.e. Diurpaneus qui Euprepes Sterissae f(ilius) Dacus) is a custom attested since the historical period (beginning in the 5th century BC) when Thracians were under Greek influence.VI, 16, 903 It may not have originated with the Thracians, as it could be just a fashion borrowed from Greeks for specifying ancestry and for distinguishing homonymous individuals within the tribe.[tpl]sfn |Russu| 1967 | p=161[/tpl] Shutte (1917), Parvan, and Florescu (1982) pointed also to the Dacian characteristic place names ending in '–dava' given by Ptolemy in the Costoboci’s country.[tpl]sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=101[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Parvan | Florescu| 1982| pp=142 and 152[/tpl]

====Carpi====

The Carpi were a sizeable Dacian (North Thracian) group of tribes living outside the boundaries of Roman Dacia. The majority view is that they were a Thracian tribe, a subgroup of the Dacians.[ref] 
  >^ Goffart (2006) p.205
[/ref] Some historians classify them as Slavs.[tpl]sfn | Waldman | Mason| 2006 | p=129[/tpl]
According to Heather (2010), the Carpi were Dacians from the eastern foothills of the Carpathian range – modern Moldavia and Wallachia – who had not been brought under direct Roman rule at the time of Trajan's conquest of Transylvania Dacia. After they generated a new degree of political unity among themselves in the course of the third century, these Dacian groups came to be known collectively as the Carpi.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=114[/tpl]
The ancient sources about the Carpi, before 104 AD, located them on a territory situated between the western side of Eastern European Galicia and the mouth of the Danube.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=239[/tpl] The name of the tribe is homonymous with the Carpathian mountains.[tpl]sfn | Shutte | 1917 | p=100[/tpl] Carpi and Carpathian are Dacian words derived from the root (s)ker- "cut" cf. Albanian Karp "stone" and Sanskrit kar- "cut".[tpl]sfn | Russu | 1969 | pp=114-115[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Tomaschek | 1883 |p=403[/tpl]
A quote from the 6th-century Byzantine chronicler Zosimus referring to the Καρποδάκαι (Latin: Carpo-Dacae or "Carpo-Dacians"), who attacked the Romans in the late 4th century, is seen as evidence of their Dacian ethnicity. In fact, Carpi/Carpodaces is the term used for Dacians outside of Dacia proper.[tpl]sfn | Goffart | 2006 |p=205[/tpl]
However, that the Carpi were Dacians is shown not so much by the form Καρποδάκαι (Latin: Carpo-Dacae) of Zosimus as by their characteristic place-names in –dava, given by Ptolemy in their country.[tpl]sfn | Minns | 2011 | p=124[/tpl] The origin and ethnic affiliations of the Carpi have been debated over the years; in modern times they are closely associated with the Carpathian Mountains, and a good case has been made for attributing to the Carpi a distinct material culture, "a developed form of the Geto-Dacian La Tene culture", often known as the Poienesti culture, which is characteristic of this area.[tpl]sfn| Nixon| Saylor Rodgers|1995|p=116[/tpl]

===Physical characteristics===

Dacians are represented in the statues surmounting the Arch of Constantine and on Trajan's Column.[tpl]sfn | Westropp | 2003 | p=104[/tpl] The artist of the Column took some care to depict, in his opinion, a variety of Dacian people—from high-ranking men, women, and children to the near-savage. Although the artist looked to models in Hellenistic art for some body types and compositions, he does not represent the Dacians as generic barbarians.[tpl]sfn | Clarke | 2003 |p=37 [/tpl]
Classical authors applied a generalized stereotype when describing the  "barbarians"{–}Celts, Scythians, Thracians{–}inhabiting the regions to the north of the Greek world.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl] In accordance with this stereotype, all these peoples are described, in sharp contrast to the "civilized" Greeks, as being much taller, their skin lighter and with straight light-coloured hair and blue eyes.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl] For instance, Aristotle wrote that "the Scythians on the Black Sea and the Thracians are straight-haired, for both they themselves and the environing air are moist";[tpl]cite web | last = Aristotle | first = | authorlink = Aristotle | coauthors = | title = Hair (V.3.)  | work = De Generatione Animalium (Translated by Arthur Platt) | publisher = Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library | year = 2001 | url = http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AriGene.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=all | format = | doi = | accessdate = 11-01-2014  | archiveurl = | archivedate = [/tpl] according to Clement of Alexandria, Xenophanes described the Thracians as "ruddy and tawny".[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = Clement of Alexandria | first = | authorlink = Clement of Alexandria | coauthors = | title = The heathens made gods like themselves, whence springs all superstition (VII.4.)  | work = The Stromata, or Miscellanies | publisher = Early Christian Writings | date = | url = http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book7.html | doi = | accessdate = 11-01-2014  | archiveurl = | archivedate = [/tpl] On Trajan’s column, Dacian soldiers' hair is depicted longer than the hair of Roman soldiers and they had trimmed beards.[tpl]sfn | Waldman | Mason | 2006| p=208[/tpl]
Body-painting was customary among the Dacians.[tpl]specify|date = October 2013[/tpl] It is probable that the tattooing originally had a religious significance.[tpl]sfn | Bury | Cook |Adcock|Percival Charlesworth| 1954 |p=543 [/tpl] They practiced symbolic-ritual tattooing or body painting for both men and women, with hereditary symbols transmitted up to the fourth generation.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=114[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

In the absence of historical records written by the Dacians (and Thracians) themselves, analysis of their origins depends largely on the remains of material culture. On the whole, the Bronze Age witnessed the evolution of the ethnic groups which emerged during the Eneolithic period, and eventually the syncretism of both autochthonous and Indo-European elements from the steppes and the Pontic regions.[tpl]sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166[/tpl] Various groups of Thracians had not separated out by 1200 BC, [tpl]sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166[/tpl] but there are strong similarities between the ceramic types found at Troy and the ceramic types from the Carpathian area.[tpl]sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=166[/tpl] About the year 1000 BC, the Carpatho-Danubian countries were inhabited by a northern branch of the Thracians.[tpl]sfn|Parvan|1928|p=35[/tpl] At the time of the arrival of the Scythians (c. 700 BC), the Carpatho-Danubian Thracians were developing rapidly towards the Iron Age civilization of the West. Moreover, the whole of the fourth period of the Carpathian Bronze Age had already been profoundly influenced by the first Iron Age as it developed in Italy and the Alpine lands. The Scythians, arriving with their own type of Iron Age civilization, put a stop to these relations with the West.[tpl]sfn | Parvan | Vulpe|Vulpe | 2002 | p=49 [/tpl] From roughly 500 BC (the second Iron Age), the Dacians developed a distinct civilization, which was capable of supporting large centralised kingdoms by 1st BC and 1st AD.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 [/tpl]
Since the very first detailed account by Herodotus, Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracians.[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl] Still, they are distinguished from the other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl] The first written mention of the name "Dacians" is in Roman sources, but classical authors are unanimous in considering them a branch of the Getae, a Thracian people known from Greek writings. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae who lived in the area towards the Pannonian plain (Transylvania), while the Getae proper gravitated towards the Black Sea coast (Scythia Minor).

===Relations with Thracians===

Since the writings of Herodotus in the 5th century BC,[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl] Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracian sphere of influence. Despite this, they are distinguished from other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl] Geto-Dacians and Thracians were kin people but they were not the same.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=661[/tpl] The differences from the southern Thracians or from the neighboring Scythians were probably faint, as several ancient authors make confusions of identification with both groups.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl]
In the 19th century, Tomaschek considered a close affinity between the Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians, an original kinship of both people with Iranian peoples.[tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401[/tpl] They are Aryan tribes, several centuries before Scolotes of the Pont and Sauromatae left the Aryan homeland and settled in the Carpathian chain, in the Haemus (Balkan) and Rhodope mountains.[tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401[/tpl] The Besso-Thracians and Getae-Dacians separated very early from Aryans, since their language still maintains roots that are missing from Iranian and it shows non-Iranian phonetic characteristics (i.e. replacing the Iranian "l" with "r").[tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401[/tpl] He considered that the Geto-Dacians and Besso-Thracians would represent a new layer of people that extended in the autochthonous fund, probably Illyrian or Armenian-Phrygian.[tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|pp=400-401[/tpl]
