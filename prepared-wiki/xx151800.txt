[tpl]nihongo|Kansuigyo|寒水魚|[/tpl] is the ninth studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyuki Nakajima, released in March 1982. The term ”Kansuigyo", which means opposite of [tpl]nihongo|"Nettaigyo"|熱帯魚|tropical fish[/tpl], is Nakajima's neologism.
Five months before the album came out, she produced a hit single "Bad Girl (Akujo)", which became her first chart topper since "Wakareuta (The Parting Song)" in 1977.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/al_nakajima.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Singles Chart Daijiten - Miyuki Nakajima|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] The song became one of the most commercially successful single of that year, reaching the top-10 on the year-end chart of 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/nenkan1982_a.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Singles Chart Daijiten - 1982 Oricon Year-end Singles |language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] In the following year, Sylvie Vartan covered the song in French-translated lyrics on her Danse ta vie album, under the alternative title "Ta vie de chien".
Kansuigyo begin with another interpretation of above-mentioned successful song, which features more rock-oriented arrangement and her listless vocals. Rest of the album mainly consists of the ballads that used strings effectively . "Utahime (Diva)", 8-minute long track included at the end of the album has been one of her fan favorites and also included on her later "greatest hits". Lyrics of "Keisha (The Incline)", the song which described melancholy of a solitary elderly woman who are walking on steep slope, was evaluated literarily and had been listed in a textbook on the Japanese language around the 1990s. When Nakajima recorded the Ima no Kimochi album that were constituted by new interpretations of the past materials in 2004, those two songs were picked out from Kansuigyo.
The album spent the number-one spot on the Japanese Oricon chart for six week, and became the country's best-selling LP of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/nenkan1982_a.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Albums Chart Daijiten - 1982 Oricon Year-end Albums |language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl] It has also been her album that gained biggest commercial success to date, eventually selling about 770,000 units.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~yamag/album/al_nakajima.html|title= Yamachan Land (Archives of the Japanese record charts) - Albums Chart Daijiten - Miyuki Nakajima|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl]
