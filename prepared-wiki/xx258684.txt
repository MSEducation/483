Anita Ganeri, author of Horrible Geography gave the series a rating of 3 stars. She described the books as being "straighter in tone than the genuine Horribles" and added that "inevitably the two series will be compared". The title What They Don't Tell You About World War II was deemed her favourite and she described the narrative style as being "much surer and tighter here and the straighter tone suited the subject matter", although also said that the tone "sometimes steered an uncertain path". Ganeri concluded by saying "overall, They Don't Tell You About... is a series cheap enough to suit most pockets and cheerful enough to stimulate interest in their subject."
