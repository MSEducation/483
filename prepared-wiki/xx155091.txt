==Track listing==

"I Hate Myself For Loving You" was released as the first single, backed with a live version of the Jett composition "Love Is Pain" (the original version of which appears on 1981's "I Love Rock 'n Roll").  "Little Liar" was the second single, backed with an obscure Jett/Laguna composition "What Can I Do For You", which had been recorded for a movie Jett was set to make in 1979 that was never completed. The song eventually turned up again on the Jett fan-club only CD "1979".
Two videos were shot for "Little Liar", the first of which told the dramatic story of twin Joan Jetts (one in white, one in black) fighting over a man they were both dating. It received heavy rotation on MTV, but was quickly replaced with a highly-stylized in-concert video with Ziggy Stardust-like artistic flourishes.
