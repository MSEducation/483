The color of the day is a signal used by undercover officers of some police departments in the United States.[tpl]cite book|last=Fallis|first=Greg|title=Just the Facts Ma'am: A Writer's Guide to Investigators and Investigation Techniques|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|year=1999|ISBN=0-89879-823-X|page=139[/tpl] It is used to assist in the identification of plainclothes police officers by uniformed officers. Perhaps its best known use is by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the NYPD Transit Bureau (formerly the New York City Transit Police) and the NYPD Housing Bureau (formerly the New York City Housing Authority Police Department) among other law enforcement agencies.[tpl]cite news |first=George |last=James |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Police Agencies Share Rules for Recognition |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE2DB1239F937A1575BC0A962958260 |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=24 August 1994 |accessdate=2008-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Clifford |last=Krauss |title=Subway Chaos: Officer Firing at Officer |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1239F937A1575BC0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |publisher=New York Times |date=24 August 1994|accessdate=05-10-2008[/tpl]
An undercover police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the "color of the day"; this color is told to officers at the station house before they start work. The system is for officer safety and first started during the violence of the 1970s and 1980s New York City.

==Purpose==

New York City is a very large city with a population of over 8,310,000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/census/popcur.shtml|title=The "Current" Population of New York City (2007)|publisher=New York City Department of City Planning|accessdate=09-03-2009[/tpl] with over 18,800,000 people[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/files/2007/CBSA-EST2007-alldata.csv|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007|accessdate=09-03-2009[/tpl] living in the area around it. An extra 500,000 people enter the city during a weekday.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/005822.html|title=Census Bureau Releases First-Ever Data On Daytime Populations for Cities and Counties |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=09-03-2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Many different police agencies operate in the New York area.
The color of the day system is about officer safety. With so many armed officers in the city, undercover police officers need to have an easy to use system in place to provide for discreet, but easy identification of plainclothes officers by uniformed ones. The system is in place to prevent uniformed officers from interrupting undercover operations.

==History==

The NYPD Street Crimes Unit started in 1971. From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, crime in New York City was at record levels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm|title=New York Crime Rates 1960 - 2007|accessdate=08-03-2009|publisher=The Disaster Centre[/tpl]  Undercover officers were asked to go into areas such as subways in plain-clothes or dressed as a homeless person as a decoy. Many of these officers were black and had a fear that uniformed officers would mistake them for criminals in a use-of-force situation.[tpl]cite book |title=The Black Shields |last=Abel |first=Roger L. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=AuthorHouse |location= |page=535 |isbn=1-4208-4460-1[/tpl]
Many of these officers would dress and pretend to be drunk, homeless people or as decoy victims in order to catch muggers who were attacking those at-risk groups. The color of the day system was developed to prevent friendly fire incidents. In the beginning, specifically colored headbands were given to each undercover Street Crime Unit member.
Other officers would be briefed on that color to allow them to quickly recognize the undercover officers, while the general public would not notice anything unusual.  This began the "Color of the Day" system. Later they also used wristbands in a similar manner.  Today's officers often dress in the color.
