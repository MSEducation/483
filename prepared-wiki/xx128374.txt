==Biography==

Elissa, a Canadian sensation, has been releasing hit after hit since 1995. Her debut "If Only" appeared on a couple of compilations, but it wasn't until the release of her first single "Show Me How You Love Me" that stirred the radio airwaves with her fantastic voice. As the year went by soon more of her fantastic freestyle tracks appeared on various compilations throughout Canada and the United States. They included the infectious "Forbidden Lies," "I'll Keep Searching," "Forever Love, "Something In My Heart" and "When I'm With You." More compilation only tracks followed in 1997 like the energetic "Take My Hand" and of course more freestyle tracks like "Give Me A Sign, "In My Dreams" and the Spanish version "En Mis Suenos" all recorded under the name Quasi Rhythm. 1998 proved to be a great year for Elissa, her music style broaden from freestyle to eurolatin flavored. The remake of "Bailando" was the result, recorded in English and Spanish. A few more covers also surfaced George Lamond's "Without You" also in Spanish as "Sola Sin Ti." The tracks continued to follow one after the other "Que Te Pasa," "Ritmo Caliente, "Say Goodbye," "Di Adios," "Don't Say," "When I'm Gone" and the amazing dance track "We Are Together" (la vida bonita). A second single was finally released in Canada in 1999 "Mamboleo" recorded in both English and Spanish. In early 2000 it also hit the United States, but with a new freestyle track added "Back To Me." Meanwhile in Canada "Fiesta De La Noche" and "Vamos A Bailar" surfaced on dance compilations. After five years of waiting and over 20 tracks, Elissa's debut album "I Can't Stop - Freestyle Hits" was released and only included early freestyle tracks and a couple of her latin hits, as well as her current track at that time "I Can't Stop." However Elissa continued to record, write and produce tracks for other freestyle artists at her own recording studio. "The Light" was another successful track in 2001 during the "Summer Of Love" and "For Your Love" in Italy. In 2002, Elissa amazed her fans once more with "If I Could Fly," "Who's Crying Now," "Right Here Waiting" and "Freestyle For Life" recorded with fellow freestyle artists, all of course only on various compilations. Today Elissa continues working hard on many upcoming tracks scheduled to be released in the near future.
