The cataplana was invented by Armando Luz (1927-2002), better knowned by his nickname, "Pató".
"Pató" was an artist that worked crafting copper and stainless steel, and was recognized with an award where he lived in Portugal, with the key of the town and a silver medal that was offered to him due to his contribution to the Algarve. He was also the inventor of the machine to make cataplanas using stainless steel and was the only one who produced such a product.
