==Early life, family, and occupation==

Born in Buenos Aires, the son of Sergio Jorge and Eleonora Zalewski Zivic, to a Latter-day Saint family, Zivic is a lifelong Mormon, which is not common for LDS Church members in South America born before 1950. Zivic's maternal grandmother was a Polish Jew and his paternal grandfather a German soldier who both immigrated to Argentina after World War I.  His maternal grandmother and his mother were baptized when Zivic's mother was 12 years old.
Zivic is married to Dina Noemí Álvarez, who attended the same branch (local congregation) in Argentina as a child.Church News, May 12, 2007. Both were baptized in the chapel in Liniers, the oldest in South America and the only one equipped with a baptismal font at the time.  Dina's family moved to the United States when she was nine.  When she was twelve, her father was called as a construction missionary and sent to Chile. After three years on this mission the family returned to Argentina and again attended the same congregation as Zivic.  In his youth, Zivic was a promising track athlete but gave up competition because track meets were held on Sunday.http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60364/A-Book-of-Mormon-Fiesta.html
Zivic and Dina were married in 1972 and were married in the São Paulo Brazil Temple, after its dedicationin 1978. They are the parents of five children.
