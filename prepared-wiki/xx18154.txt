==History and organization==

thumb|Focus on the Family's Visitor's Welcome Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. From 1977 to 2003, James Dobson served as the sole leader of the organization. In 2003, Donald P. Hodel became president and chief executive officer, tasked with the day-to-day operations. This left Dobson as chairman of the Board of Directors, with chiefly creative and speaking duties. Focus on the Family aims to equip families "through radio broadcasts, websites, simulcasts, conferences, interactive forums, magazines, books, and counseling."
In March 2005, Hodel retired and Jim Daly, formerly the Vice President in charge of Focus on the Family's International Division, assumed the role of president and chief executive officer.
In November 2008, the organization announced that it was eliminating 202 jobs, representing 18 percent of its workforce. The organization also cut its budget from $160 million in fiscal 2008 to $138 million for fiscal 2009.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gazette.com/news/focus_43586___article.html/lays_eliminationg.html |title=Focus on the Family eliminating 202 jobs |author=Bill Reed |work=Colorado Springs Gazette[/tpl]

===2008 Presidential campaign===

In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Focus on the Family shifted from support of Mike Huckabee to not supporting any candidate, to finally accepting the Republican ticket once Sarah Palin was added to the ticket. Prior to the election, a television and letter campaign was launched predicting terrorist attacks in four U.S. cities and equating the U.S. with Nazi Germany.

===Opposition to same-sex marriage===

Focus on the Family works to preserve its interpretation of the biblical ideals of marriage and parenthood, taking a strong stance against LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage. Dobson expressed great concern for the institution of marriage in a 2003 letter to the Christian community. In reference to the same-sex marriage movement, Dobson says that the institution of marriage “…is about to descend into a state of turmoil unlike any other in human history.” Focus on the Family believes that marriage should be defined as only being between a man and a woman. Dobson supported the failed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing courts and state legislatures from challenging this definition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.safamily.co.za/newsletter_dob?mode=content&id=20115&refto=3644 |title=Marriage on the Ropes |author=James Dobson |date=September 2003 |work=Newsletter Archive |publisher=Focus on the Family Southern Africa |authorlink=James Dobson[/tpl]
In the same letter, Dobson says that traditional marriage is the cornerstone of society, and he states that the goal of the gay and lesbian movement is not to redefine marriage but to destroy the institution itself. “Most gays and lesbians do not want to marry each other…the intention here is to destroy marriage altogether.” Dobson argues that, without the institution of marriage, everyone would enjoy the benefits of marriage without limiting the number of partners or their gender. Focus on the Family views allowing same-sex marriage as “…a stepping-stone on the road to eliminating all societal restrictions on marriage and sexuality.”
Focus on the Family asserts that the Bible lays out the correct plan for marriage and family. Dobson says that "God created Eve to complement Adam physically, spiritually, and emotionally". Dobson also uses the biblical figure Paul to affirm his views on marriage.  He states that Paul maintained that men and women mutually complete each other, and to exchange a "natural relationship for an unnatural one is sinful".
In reference to same-sex marriage and same-sex couples with children, Dobson states, “Same-sex relationships undermine the future generation’s understanding of the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood, and gender.” He also stated that the alleged destruction of what it considers to be the traditional family by permitting same-sex marriage will lead to "unstable homes for children".
Focus on the Family became more active in the same-sex marriage opposition movement after the Supreme Court of Canada declared that restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples is a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 2003.
Dobson spoke at the 2004 rally against gay marriage called Mayday for Marriage. It was here for the first time that he endorsed a presidential candidate, George W. Bush. Here he denounced the Supreme Court rulings in favor of gay rights, and he urged rally participants to get out and vote so that the battle against gay rights could be won in the Senate.[tpl]Cite news| last=KirkPatrick| first=David D. | title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: SAME-SEX MARRIAGE; Rally Against Gay Marriage Draws Thousands to Capital| newspaper=New York Times| date=October 16, 2004| page=12| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/16/national/16gays.html| accessdate=2010-01-25[/tpl]
In an interview with Christianity Today magazine, Dobson also explained that he was not in favor of civil unions. He stated that civil unions are just same-sex marriage under a different name. The main priority of the opposing same-sex marriage movement is to define marriage on the federal level as between a man and a woman and combat the passage of civil unions later.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Rutledge| first=Kathleen K.| title=Dobson on the Gay Marriage Battle| journal=Christianity Today| volume=49| issue=1 |date=January 2005| page=60| url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/january/21.60.html| accessdate=2010-01-25[/tpl]

After Elizabeth Saewyc's research on teen suicide was used by Focus on the Family to promote conversion therapy, she said that "the research has been hijacked for somebody's political purposes or ideological purposes and that's worrisome", and that research in fact linked the suicide rate among LGBT teens to harassment, discrimination, and closeting.[tpl]Cite news |agency=Canada Press |title=B.C. researcher says American group distorting her research on teen suicide |date=June 19, 2006 |first=Beth |last=Gorham[/tpl] Other scientists who have criticized Focus on the Family for misrepresenting their findings include Robert Spitzer, Gary Remafedi and Angela Phillips.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/article_p.php?article_id=5924 |last=Besen |first=Wayne |work=San Francisco Bay Times |title=Science Strikes Back |date=December 28, 2006[/tpl]

===Football advertisements===

In 2010, Focus on the Family bought ad time during Super Bowl XLIV to air a commercial featuring Heisman Trophy winning Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam. Prior to becoming pregnant with Tim, Pam had contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma. She discovered she was pregnant while recovering. Because of the medications used to treat her, the fetus experienced a severe placental abruption. Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion. The Tebows decided against it, citing their strong faith—however, in the Philippines, where the family was serving as Baptist missionaries, abortion is a criminal offense).[tpl]cite news|title=Coaching character|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071007/NEWS/710060317?p=1&tc=pg|work=The Gainesville Sun|author=Richardson, Suzy A.|date=October 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6C3RRbZ4e|archivedate=November 9, 2012|accessdate=November 10, 2007[/tpl] In the ad, Pam described Tim as a "miracle baby" who "almost didn't make it into this world", and further elaborated that "with all our family's been through, we have to be tough" (after which Pam was promptly tackled by Tim). The ad itself made no reference to abortion or Christianity, and directed viewers to the organization's website.[tpl]cite news|title=Tebow ad falls short of the hype|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/08/nation/la-na-tebow-abortion8-2010feb08|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|first=Robin|last=Abcarian|date=February 8, 2010[/tpl]
The then-unseen ad drew criticism from some women's rights groups, who asked CBS to pull the ad because they argued that it was divisive.

However, CBS stated that "we have for some time moderated our approach to advocacy submissions after it became apparent that our stance did not reflect public sentiment or industry norms on the issue."[tpl]cite news|title=CBS defends decision to run politically sensitive Tim Tebow ad during Super Bowl|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/business/la-fi-ct-cbs27-2010jan27|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|first=Meg|last=James|date=January 27, 2010[/tpl]

"God's own ZIP Code" Salon, July 9, 1998. Retrieved on September 17, 2010."How do I contact Focus on the Family?." Focus on the Family. Retrieved on September 17, 2010. The buildings consist of the Administration building, International building, Welcome Center and Operations building (currently unused), and totals 526,070 square feet.Focus on the Family.

Focus on the Family moved to its current headquarters from Pomona, California, in 1993, with 1200 employees. In 2002, the number of employees peaked at 1,400. By September, 2011, after a number of years of layoffs, they had 650 employees remaining.Draper, Electra. "http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_18912132." Denver Post. September 16, 2011. Retrieved on October 18, 2012. "Focus on the Family announces more layoffs" Christopher Ott of Salon said in 1998 that the FOTF campus has "handsome new brick buildings, professional landscaping and even its own traffic signs" and that "The buildings and grounds are well-maintained and comfortable. If there is any ostentatious or corrupt influence here, it is nowhere in sight."
While visiting the Focus on the Family complex, a couple had asked the staff if handling the sightseers in the main building was a distraction. The staff told the couple that it was a distraction; afterwards the couple donated $4 million to have a welcome center built. A visiting family donated [tpl]convert|7|mi|km[/tpl] of wood trim from the family's Pennsylvania lumber business so FOTF could build its administration building. As of 1998, James Dobson, in his welcome center film, compares his decision to build the headquarters in Colorado Springs to the founding of the temple in Jerusalem.
