CATEGORIES: Parliamentary constituencies in the Upper East Region

==Boundaries==

The seat is located within the Bawku Municipal District in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Prior to the 2004 parliamentary election, the Pusiga constituency was carved out of the pre-existing Bawku Central constituency in what was then known as the Bawku East District. The current constituency is thus smaller in area than that preceding the 2004 election.[tpl]cite web |url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/ghana/03610.pdf |title=Elections 2004 - Ghana's Parliamentary and Presidential Elections |accessdate=2010-08-23 |date=November 2005 |publisher=Electoral Commission of Ghana and Friedrich Ebert Foundation[/tpl]
