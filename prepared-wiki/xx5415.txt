</ref> In the more common ''weft knitting'', the wales are perpendicular to the course of the yarn.  In [[warp knitting]], the wales and courses run roughly parallel.  In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a [[raster scan]].  By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale.  Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine.<ref>(Spencer 1989:11-12)</ref>  Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in [[lingerie]].
Weft-knit fabrics may also be knit with multiple yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns.  The two most common approaches are intarsia and stranded colorwork.  In intarsia, the yarns are used in well-segregated regions, e.g., a red apple on a field of green; in that case, the yarns are kept on separate spools and only one is knitted at any time.  In the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in Fair Isle sweaters. Double knitting can produce two separate knitted fabrics simultaneously (e.g., two socks).  However, the two fabrics are usually integrated into one, giving it great warmth and excellent drape.

===Knit and purl stitches===

In securing the previous stitch in a wale, the next stitch can pass through the previous loop from either below or above.  If the former, the stitch is denoted as a knit stitch or a plain stitch; if the latter, as a purl stitch. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen from one side of the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.
The two types of stitches have a different visual effect; the knit stitches look like "V"'s stacked vertically, whereas the purl stitches look like a wavy horizontal line across the fabric. Patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting. Individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which is the basis for uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect. Short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.
In the simplest knitted fabrics, all of the stitches are knit or purl; this is known as a garter stitch. Alternating rows of knit stitches and purl stitches produce what is known as a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch.  Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches.  For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.
Fabrics in which the number of knit and purl stitches are not the same, such as stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl; by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) tend to lie flat and drape well. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward. Thus, the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward.  Conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches.  This is the basis of shadow knitting, in which the appearance of a knitted fabric changes when viewed from different directions.[tpl]cite book | last = HÃ¸xbro | first = Vivian | year = 2004 | title = Shadow Knitting | publisher = Interweave Press | location = Loveland, CO | isbn = 978-1-931499-41-5[/tpl]
Typically, a new stitch is passed through a single unsecured ("active") loop, thus lengthening that wale by one stitch.  However, this need not be so; the new loop may be passed through an already secured stitch lower down on the fabric, or even between secured stitches (a dip stitch).  Depending on the distance between where the loop is drawn through the fabric and where it is knitted, dip stitches can produce a subtle stippling or long lines across the surface of the fabric, e.g., the lower leaves of a flower.  The new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the present row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric.  The new loop may also be passed through two or more previous stitches, producing a decrease and merging wales together.  The merged stitches need not be from the same row; for example, a tuck can be formed by knitting stitches together from two different rows, producing a raised horizontal welt on the fabric.
Not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be left "as is" and knitted on a subsequent row. This is known as slip-stitch knitting.[tpl]cite book | last = Bartlett | first = Roxana | year = 1998 | title = Slip-Stitch Knitting: Color Pattern the Easy Way | publisher = Interweave Press | location = Loveland, CO | isbn = 978-1-883010-32-4[/tpl]  The slipped stitches are naturally longer than the knitted ones. For example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts.  This can produce interesting visual effects, although the resulting fabric is more rigid because the slipped stitch "pulls" on its neighbours and is less deformable. Slip-stitch knitting plays an important role in mosaic knitting, an important technique in hand-knitting patterned fabrics; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as Fair-Isle knitting.[tpl]cite book | last = Starmore | first = Alice | year = 1988 | title = Alice Starmore's Book of Fair Isle Knitting | publisher = Taunton | isbn = 978-0-918804-97-6[/tpl]
In some cases, a stitch may be deliberately left unsecured by a new stitch and its wale allowed to disassemble.  This is known as drop-stitch knitting, and produces a vertical ladder of see-through holes in the fabric, corresponding to where the wale had been.

===Right- and left-plaited stitches===

Both knit and purl stitches may be twisted: usually once if at all, but sometimes twice and (very rarely) thrice.  When seen from above, the twist can be clockwise (right yarn over left) or counterclockwise (left yarn over right); these are denoted as right- and left-plaited stitches, respectively.  Hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual.  By contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle.  Although they are mirror images in form, right- and left-plaited stitches are functionally equivalent.  Both types of plaited stitches give a subtle but interesting visual texture, and tend to draw the fabric inwards, making it stiffer.  Plaited stitches are a common method for knitting jewelry from fine metal wire.

===Edges and joins between fabrics===

The initial and final edges of a knitted fabric are known as the cast-on and bound/cast-off edges.  The side edges are known as the selvages; the word derives from "self-edges", meaning that the stitches do not need to be secured by anything else.  Many types of selvages have been developed, with different elastic and ornamental properties.
Vertical and horizontal edges can be introduced within a knitted fabric, e.g., for button holes, by binding/casting off and re-casting on again (horizontal) or by knitting the fabrics on either side of a vertical edge separately.
Two knitted fabrics can be joined by embroidery-based grafting methods, most commonly the Kitchener stitch.  New wales can be begun from any of the edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern.

===Cables, increases, and lace===

Ordinarily, stitches are knitted in the same order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric.  However, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern.  Cables patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic;[tpl]cite book | last = Leapman | first = Melissa | year = 2006 | title = Cables Untangled: An Exploration of Cable Knitting | publisher = Potter Craft | isbn = 978-1-4000-9745-6[/tpl] Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling.[tpl]cite book | last = Hollingworth | first = Shelagh | year = 1983 | title = The Complete Book of Traditional Aran Knitting | publisher = St. Martin's Press | isbn = 978-0-312-15635-0[/tpl]  Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric.  Knitters have developed methods for giving the illusion of a circular wale, such as appear in Celtic knots, but these are inexact approximations.  However, such circular wales are possible using Swiss darning, a form of embroidery, or by knitting a tube separately and attaching it to the knitted fabric.
A wale can split into two or more wales using increases, most commonly involving a yarn over.  Depending on how the increase is done, there is often a hole in the fabric at the point of the increase.  This is used to great effect in lace knitting, which consists of making patterns and pictures using such holes, rather than with the stitches themselves.[tpl]cite book | last = Sowerby | first = Jane | year = 2006 | title = Victorian Lace Today | publisher = XRX Books | isbn = 978-1-933064-07-9[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | last = Swansen | first = Meg | year = 2005 | title = A Gathering of Lace | edition = 2nd | publisher = Schoolhouse Press | isbn = 978-1-893762-24-4[/tpl]  The large and many holes in lacy knitting makes it extremely elastic; for example, some Shetland "wedding-ring" shawls are so fine that they may be drawn through a wedding ring.
By combining increases and decreases, it is possible to make the direction of a wale slant away from vertical, even in weft knitting.  This is the basis for bias knitting, and can be used for visual effect, similar to the direction of a brush-stroke in oil painting.

===Ornamentations and additions===

Various point-like ornaments may be added to knitting for their look or to improve the wear of the fabric.  Examples include various types of bobbles, sequins and beads.  Long loops can also be drawn out and secured, forming a "shaggy" texture to the fabric; this is known as loop knitting.  Additional patterns can be made on the surface of the knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called Swiss darning.  Various closures for the garments, such as frogs and buttons can be added; usually buttonholes are knitted into the garment, rather than cut.
Ornamental pieces may also be knitted separately and then attached using applique.  For example, differently colored leaves and petals of a flower could be knit separately and attached to form the final picture.  Separately knitted tubes can be applied to a knitted fabric to form complex Celtic knots and other patterns that would be difficult to knit.
Unknitted yarns may be worked into knitted fabrics for warmth, as is done in tufting and "weaving" (also known as "couching").

==Types==

===Flat knitting versus circular knitting===

Circular knitting (also called "knitting in the round") is a form of knitting that can be used to create a seamless tube. Knitting is worked in rounds (the equivalent of rows in flat knitting) in a helix. Originally, circular knitting was done using a set of four or five double-pointed knitting needles. Later, circular needles were invented. A circular needle resembles two short knitting needles connected by a cable between them. Flat knitting, on the other hand, is used, in its most basic form, to make flat, rectangular pieces of cloth.Differently shaped fabric may also be created using special stitches within the work. [tpl]see also|Increase (knitting)|Decrease (knitting)|Cable knitting[/tpl] It is done with two straight knitting needles and is worked in rows, horizontal lines of stitches. A circular knitting needle can also be used to create flat-knitted pieces that are too large for ordinary straight knitting needles, such as afghans and blankets.
Circular knitting is employed to create pieces that are circular or tube-shaped, such as hats, socks, mittens, and sleeves. Flat knitting is usually used to knit flat pieces like scarves, blankets, afghans, and the backs and fronts of sweater/pullovers.
There is also such a thing as finger knitting.  Instead of needles, fingers are used to produce a tube of knitted fabric.

===Felting===

Felting is the hand-knitters' term for fulling, a technique for joining knitted or woven wool fibres (only animal yarn fibres can be felted. Acrylic or any fibre that can be machine washed cannot be felted). The finished product is put in a hot wash and the yarn fibres become agitated until it starts to shrink.  While the knitted project is in the washing machine, it is important to check the progress.  Depending on the size of the project, some may felt faster than others.  The end result typically has reduced dimensions.  Bags, mittens, vests, socks, slippers and hats are just a few items that can be felted.

===Needle felting===

Needle felting is a technique used to add decoration to a knitted or felted piece, where raw roving is applied using a very sharp barbed felting needle by repeatedly piercing the roving and background together.organize-more-stress-less.com Once washed in hot water, the appliqued decoration is fused with the background. Felted knitting can be cut with scissors without concern about fraying. This is also a good method to use when attempting to give structure to what can be frail knitted fabrics.

==History and culture==

The word is derived from knot and ultimately from the Old English cnyttan, to knot.
NÃ¥lebinding (Danish: literally "binding with a needle" or "needle-binding") is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet.  That said, one of the earliest known examples of true knitting was cotton socks with stranded knit color patterns found in Egypt from the end of the first millennium AD.[ref]
</ref> Originally a male-only occupation, the first knitting trade guild was started in Paris in 1527.<ref>
