He served as the President of AIS now known as [[Election Systems & Software|Election Systems & Software, Inc.]] (ES&S) from 1979 through 1992.  Bob's brother, Todd Urosevich, is Vice President, Aftermarket Sales with ES&S, DESI's chief competitor. In 1995, Bob Urosevich started I-Mark Systems, whose product was a touch screen voting system utilizing a smart card and biometric encryption authorization technology.  Global Election Systems, Inc. (GES) acquired I-Mark in 1997, and on July 31, 2000 Mr. Urosevich was promoted from Vice President of Sales and Marketing and New Business Development to President and Chief Operating Officer.  On January 22, 2002, [[Diebold]] announced the acquisition of GES, then a manufacturer and supplier of [[electronic voting]] terminals and solutions.  The total purchase price, in stock and cash, was $24.7 million. Global Election Systems subsequently changed its name to Diebold Election Systems, Inc.
In 2006, Diebold decided to remove its name from the front of the voting machines for strategic reasons. CEO Thomas Swidarski announced he would decide in the beginning of 2007 if Diebold stays in the election business.[tpl]cite web|author=By Barney Gimbel, Fortune writer-reporter |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/11/13/8393084/index.htm |title=Rage against the machine: Diebold struggles to bounce back from the controversy surrounding its voting machines (Fortune, 3.

===O'Dell's fundraising===

In August 2003, Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold, announced that he had been a top fund-raiser for President George W. Bush and had sent a get-out-the-funds letter to Ohio Republicans. In the letters he says he is "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year."Hack The Vote. Paul Krugman, The New York Times, December 2, 2003. Accessed June 21, 2012. Although he clarified his statement as merely a poor choice of words, critics of Diebold and/or the Republican party interpreted this as at minimum an indication of a conflict of interest, at worst implying a risk to the fair counting of ballots. He responded to the critics by pointing out that the company's election machines division is run out of Texas by a registered Democrat. Nonetheless, O'Dell vowed to lower his political profile lest his personal actions harm the company. O'Dell resigned his post of chairman and chief executive of Diebold on 12 December 2005 following reports that the company was facing securities fraud litigation surrounding charges of insider trading.[tpl]cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Dangerous Ideas |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=1892 |work=Voting Fiasco, Part 279.236(a) |publisher=Criminal Brief |accessdate=2010-10-07 |date=2008-08-17 [/tpl]

===Security and concealment issues===

Avi Rubin, Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University and Technical Director of the  Information Security Institute has analyzed the source code used in these voting machines and reports "this voting system is far below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts."Analysis of an Electronic Voting System Retrieved 2012-02-15.  Following the publication of this paper, the State of Maryland hired Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to perform another analysis of the Diebold voting machines. SAIC concluded “the system, as implemented in policy, procedure, and technology, is at high risk of compromise.”Archived version of State of Maryland's Risk Assessment Report regarding Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting System and Processes. Archived on August 27, 2006. Retrieved January 6, 2009.
The company RABA did a security analysis of the Diebold AccuVote in January 2004 confirming many of the problems found by Avi Rubin and finding some new vulnerabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040325220552/http://www.raba.com/press/TA_Report_AccuVote.pdf |title=Trusted Agent Report Diebold AccuVote-TS Voting System, RABA Innovative Solution Cell (RiSC) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-03-25 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl]
In June 2005, the Tallahassee Democrat reported that when given access to Diebold optical scan vote-counting computers, Black Box Voting, a nonprofit election watchdog group founded by Bev Harris, hired Finnish computer expert Harri Hursti and conducted a project in which vote totals were altered, by replacing the memory card that stores voting results with one that had been tampered with. Although the machines are supposed to record changes to data stored in the system, they showed no record of tampering after the memory cards were swapped. In response, a spokesperson for the Department of State said that, "Information on a blog site is not viable or credible."[tpl]cite web|url=http://reclaimdemocracy.org/articles_2005/leon_florida_vote_test.php |title=Tests in Leon County, Florida, Demonstrate Ease of Vote Count Hacking |publisher=Reclaimdemocracy.org |date=2005-06-04 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl] 
In early 2006, a study for the state of California corroborated and expanded on the problem;"Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuBasic Interpreter" on page 2 the California report states that: 
"Memory card attacks are a real threat: We determined that anyone who has access to a memory card of the AV-OS, and can tamper it (i.e. modify its contents), and can have the modified cards used in a voting machine during election, can indeed modify the election results from that machine in a number of ways. The fact that the results are incorrect cannot be detected except by a recount of the original paper ballots" and "Harri Hursti's attack does work: Mr. Hursti's attack on the AV-OS is definitely real. He was indeed able to change the election results by doing nothing more than modifying the contents of a memory card. He needed no passwords, no cryptographic keys, and no access to any other part of the voting system, including the GEMS election management server." 
A new vulnerability, this time with the TSx DRE machines, was reported in May 2006. According to Professor Rubin, the machines are "much, much easier to attack than anything we've previously said... On a scale of one to 10, if the problems we found before were a six, this is a 10. It's a totally different ballgame." According to Rubin, the system is intentionally designed so that anyone with access can update the machine software, without a pass code or other security protocol. Diebold officials said that although any problem can be avoided by keeping a close watch on the machines, they are developing a fix.Experts see new Diebold flaw: They call it worst security glitch to date in state's voting machines and a 'big deal' TMCnet.com, May 12, 2006
Michael I. Shamos, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who is a proponent of electronic voting and the examiner of electronic voting systems for Pennsylvania, stated "It's the most severe security flaw ever discovered in a voting system." Douglas W. Jones, a professor of computer science at the University of Iowa, stated "This is the barn door being wide open, while people were arguing over the lock on the front door." Diebold spokesman David Bear played down the seriousness of the situation, asserting that "For there to be a problem here, you're basically assuming a premise where you have some evil and nefarious election officials who would sneak in and introduce a piece of software. I don't believe these evil elections people exist."New Fears of Security Risks in Electronic Voting Systems New York Times, May 12, 2006. Also see Security Focus in depth four page report.

On 2 November 2006, HBO premiered a documentary entitled "Hacking Democracy", concerning the vulnerability of electronic voting machines (primarily Diebold) to hacking and inaccurate vote totals. The company argued that the film was factually inaccurate and urged HBO to air a disclaimer explaining that it had not verified any of the claims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hackingdemocracy.com/downloads/hbo_letter.pdf |title=Cease and Desist letter from Diebold Elections' President David Byrd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Michael Janofsk |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/290653_diebold01.html |title=Seattle PI story on the Diebold press release regarding 'Hacking Democracy' |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=2006-10-31 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Clarke |first=Gavin |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/02/diebold_hacking_democracy/ |title=Article from 'The Register' regarding Diebold's letters to HBO |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl] However, corroboration and validation for the exploits shown in Hacking Democracy was published in a report for the state of California (see above).

A report commissioned by Ohio’s top elections official on December 15, 2007 has found that all five voting systems used in Ohio (made by Elections Systems and Software; Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold Election Systems); and Hart InterCivic) have critical flaws that could undermine the integrity of the 2008 general election.Ohio Elections Official Calls Machines Flawed
On 17 July 2008, Stephen Spoonamore made the claim that had "fresh evidence regarding election fraud on Diebold electronic voting machines during the 2002 Georgia gubernatorial and senatorial elections." Spoonamore is "the founder and until recently the CEO of Cybrinth LLC, an information technology policy and security firm that serves Fortune 100 companies." He claims that Diebold Election Systems Inc. COO Bob Urosevich personally installed a computer patch on voting machines in two counties in Georgia, and that the patch did not fix the problem it was supposed to fix.GOP cyber-security expert suggests Diebold tampered with 2002 election, The Raw Story Reports have indicated that then Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox did not know the patch was installed until after the election.Documents show Georgia's Secretary of State knew of Diebold patch, The Raw Story

===States rejecting Diebold===

In 2004, after an initial investigation into the company's practices, Secretary of State of California Kevin Shelley issued a ban on one model of Diebold voting machines in that state. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, joined the state of California into a false claims suit filed in November 2003 by Bev Harris and Alameda County citizen Jim March. Here is a copy of the original lawsuit "copy of case number RG031284" and here is the article showing it became the California false claims suit:"Vote machine maker settles over her whistle-blower suit"
The suit charged that Diebold had given false information about the security and reliability of Diebold Election Systems machines that were sold to the state.  To settle the case, Diebold agreed to pay $2.6 million and to implement certain reforms. On August 3, 2007, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen decertified Diebold and three other electronic voting systems after a "top-to-bottom review of the voting machines certified for use in California in March 2007."
In April 2007 the Maryland General Assembly voted to replace paperless touchscreen voting machines with paper ballots counted by optical scanners, effective in time for the 2010 general (November) elections. The law, signed by the Governor in May 2007, was made contingent on the provision of funding by no later than April 2008. The Governor included such funding in his proposed budget in January 2008,[ref]

In March 2009, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen decertified Diebold's GEMS version 1.18.19 after the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project discovered that GEMS had silently dropped 197 ballots from its tabulation of a single precinct in Eureka, California.[ref]
