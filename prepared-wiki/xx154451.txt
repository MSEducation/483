==History==

The original FM 270 was established in 1945 in Hopkins County as a route from Sulphur Bluff to the village of Dike. It was extended south 4.1 miles to a road intersection in 1948. The next year, it extended south to SH 11. In 1951, it extended south to a road intersection, replacing FM 1698. The next year, it extended northeastward from Dike to a road intersection. In 1955, it extended east and north to SH 11 in Pickton and north to FM 71. In 1958, it extended north 2 miles from FM 71. The route was cancelled in 1959 and the highway was transferred to FM 69 and FM 269.
The highway was reestablished in 1970, running from NASA Road 1 to FM 518 and was extended in 1987 to its current distance. In 1995, the state of Texas officially canceled the road in favor of an Urban Road designation, but the designation is only used by the state itself.[tpl]TxDOT|UR|270[/tpl]
