There are prehistoric burial sites in Changhua that date back 5000 years. The number of burials tally to 32.
The original name of Changhua was "half line", colloquially so-named by Taiwanese aboriginals. The current name Changhua is the Mandarin transliteration. Changhua was previously inhabited by the Babuza people (mostly assimilated by the Chinese today). When Qing soldiers invaded Changhua in 1644, Chunghua was one of their bases of operation. At the time, Changhua was administered as the "Tian-Hsin County" of the Qing Dynasty.
During the Japanese Colonial Period, Taiwan was subdivided into Taipei, Taiwan, and Tainan. Changhua was ruled under the Taiwan subdivision. After an administrative division replanning, Changhua and Taichung City together were combined and became Taichū Prefecture. By 1930, the population in Changhua already exceeded one million.
