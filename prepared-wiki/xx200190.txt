[[Velasco-class cruiser]]

CATEGORIES: Cruiser classes, Velasco-class cruisers

The ''Velasco'' class of unprotected cruisers was a series of eight cruisers built during the 1880s for service with the Spanish Navy.  They were named for famous Spaniards of the past.

==Description==

The Velasco class consisted of two slightly different subclasses.  The first two ships, Velasco and Gravina, built by the Thames Ironworks & Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. Ltd. at Leamouth, London in the United Kingdom, had fewer but heavier guns and were slightly faster than the next six, which were built at various yards in Spain.  The class took a long time to complete, with the two British-build ships being laid down in 1881 and the last Spanish built one not being completed until 1889. The ships had one rather tall funnel, an iron hull, and barque rigging.  They were unarmored.

==History==

The Velasco-class cruisers generally were assigned to colonial service.  They were an ill-fated class, with two lost at sea and three more sunk during the Spanish-American War.  The three survivors lasted into the early 20th century, with the last one stricken in 1927.
