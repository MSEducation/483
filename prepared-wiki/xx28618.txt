==Premise==

Goof Troop bears similarity to several early-1950s Goofy cartoon shorts which depicted Goofy as a father to a mischievous red-haired son.
Goofy, a single father, moves back to his hometown of Spoonerville with his 11-year-old son, Max. As it happens, Goofy and Max end up moving in next door to Goofy's high school friend: Pete, a used car salesman and owner of Honest Pete's Used Cars; Pete's wife Peg, a real estate agent; and their two children, 11-year-old son P.J. (Pete Jr.) and 4-year-old daughter Pistol with long red hair. Max and P.J. become best friends and do practically everything together. A large portion of humor comes from the relatively normal Max's personality sharply contrasting with his father.

==Broadcast history and feature films==

Goof Troop was originally previewed on The Disney Channel from April 20, 1992 into July of that year.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 10, no. 2, March/April 1992: pp. 2, 20, 28, 42, 50.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 10, no. 3, May/June/July 1992: pp. 40, 66. Like its predecessors DuckTales, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, TaleSpin and Darkwing Duck and its successor Bonkers, Goof Troop was previewed in syndication (on September 5, 1992) with a pilot TV movie, which later aired as a multi-part serial during the regular run. The series aired on The Disney Afternoon block of syndicated animated series during the 1992/1993 broadcast season; concurrent with the Disney Afternoon shows, another 13 episodes aired on Saturday mornings on ABC in 1992. Reruns of the series later aired on The Disney Channel (starting on September 3, 1996),The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 14, no. 4, August/September 1996: pp. 25, 28, 34. and later on sister cable channel Toon Disney. Reruns were shown on Toon Disney until January 2005. The program made a return from September 2006 until August 2008, and the Christmas Special still aired on Christmas (although it is unknown if the special will ever be shown on Toon Disney's replacement Disney XD) in the United States.
Goof Troop was adapted into the feature film A Goofy Movie (1995) and its direct-to-video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000). Both films are spin-off and take place a few years after the series. The two movies featured Bill Farmer, Rob Paulsen and Jim Cummings reprising their character roles from Goof Troop in these two movies, with Jason Marsden providing the voice of a now-teenager Max. Dana Hill, who provided the voice of Max, died on July 15, 1996, after suffering a massive stroke related to her diabetes.

==Character and place titles==

Pete's wife Peg is a play on "Peg Leg Pete," one of Pete's names in the classic Disney shorts. Likewise, his daughter Pistol is a play on another such name, "Pistol Pete."
The town of Spoonerville is named after layout artist J. Michael Spooner, who designed many of the background layouts for the series.
In "Axed by Addition," Max uses the "Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine, Doctor Howard" line to distract the doctors from performing surgery on PJ. This line was from the Three Stooges short, Men in Black.

==Characters==

===Main cast===

====Goofy====

Goofy (voiced by Bill Farmer) is the widowed, single father of Max Goof (This is mentioned briefly in one episode, where it's said that Max's mother is "...up there amongst the stars" Its loosely implied that she died when Max was a baby.). He and his son, Max, move next door to the Petes from their trailer home in the city. Goofy's biggest weaknesses are his short attention span, scatterbrain, and clumsiness. He often drives his neighbor Pete up the wall. Goofy is laid back and many times turns the other cheek when Pete insults him (or just doesn't realize he's been insulted), though seldom he does get angry and gets back at him when the offense goes too far.

====Pete====

Pete (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a used-car salesman, who lives with his beautiful wife, Peg, and two children, son PJ and daughter Pistol. He is villainous, dishonest, abrasive, obnoxious, truculent and suspicious. They live next door to Goofy and his son, Max. He often exploits his good-hearted yet addled friend, Goofy. His schemes often backfire, or he feels guilty about his oafish behavior and works to set things right. His wife, Peg, often attempts to rid Pete of his uncouth attitude, and his son PJ is a complete opposite of his father in behavior, as he is good friends with Max, in the series and the feature film A Goofy Movie and its direct-to-video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie.
As for how it is in the series, it is revealed in the show's pilot episode ("Forever Goof") that one of the reasons why Pete dislikes Goofy so much and takes pleasure in conning or undermining him is that 25 years before the start of the series when Pete was a quarterback in a big high school football game, it was Goofy who accidentally caused Pete to fumble the ball and lose the game because Goofy accidentally kicked him in the face, revealing that Goofy was on the cheerleading squad in high school. In the episode "Come Fly with Me", Pete gets zapped by Hank 5000 and then turned into a fly, which parodies The Fly and The Fly. In the series, he is the co-protagonist and antihero. From the beginning, he viscerally hates Goofy, and tries unsuccessfully to oust him from the house where he moved, which is close to him and he wants to build a fine fishing reserve. However, Pete and Goofy are much closer pals who get a lot more along in the feature film A Goofy Movie, and its direct-to-video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie.

====Max Goof====

Max Goof (voiced by Dana Hill), is the son and only child of Goofy. He is around 11 years old, active, nice, alert and friendly, and is in the same grade as his buddy, PJ. He loves his dad, but wishes he would be a little more normal. He wears baggy jeans, trademark gloves, brown  sneakers, and a red shirt. In the feature film A Goofy Movie, and its direct-to-video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie, Max (voiced by Jason Marsden) feels embarrassed by his father's demeanor. Inevitably Max realizes Goofy has his best interest in mind and wants nothing more than to connect with him.

====Peg Pete====

Peg Pete (voiced by April Winchell) is Pete's wife and the mother of both PJ and Pistol. In the pilot episode, it is revealed that Peg was a cheerleader in high school where she met Goofy and Pete. Peg works as an estate-agent in Spoonerville. She wears a pink sweater, tight white pants, pink shoes, gold hoop earrings and crimson pumps. When Goofy briefly left Spoonerville, Peg married Pete and settled down. Over the course of the series she is revealed to be cynical and loudly obnoxious at times, especially towards her husband. She often defends Goofy to Pete, even going as far as kissing him to prove a point. It is never revealed why Peg has such a loyalty towards Goofy, but she is very good friends with him and Max.

====P.J. Pete====

P.J. Pete (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is the eldest child of Pete and Peg, Pistol's older brother and best friend of Max Goof. He is around 11 to 12 years old, and is in the same grade as his buddy, Max. He is pretty laid-back, and kind of acts and talks like he is never enthusiastic about very many things, except for his friend Max when they are working together to achieve something. He sometimes questions his dad's intelligence, whenever he gets involved in any of his plans or schemes. He wears a blue jacket, a pink turtleneck, white gloves, cerulean pants, and brown sneakers.

====Pistol Pete====

Pistol Pete (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the youngest child of Pete and Peg and P.J.'s younger sister. She has long red hair in two pigtails. She is 4 1/2 years old, and is in preschool. Pistol is a very hyperactive and talkative child, where she has a tendency to shoot off her mouth and bounce up and down. She is crazy about wanting to play with everything or always be in her play area, but can be very frank, and wants to get her own way in a lot of things that involve her, and she sometimes gets competitive towards her brother PJ and his friend Max. Throughout the whole series, Pistol gets herself into a mess a few times, causing either PJ and Max, or even her father to have to bail her out. She wears a white shirt, a yellow skirt, and white ballet shoes.

====Waffles and Chainsaw====

Waffles and Chainsaw (both voiced by Frank Welker) are the pet cat and dog of Goofy and Pete's families, Talk.
