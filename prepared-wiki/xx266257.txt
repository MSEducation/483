The 2006 Gaza cross-border raid was a cross-border raid which was carried out on 25 June 2006 in which a Palestinian militant squad thought to consist of 7 to 8 militants managed to cross the border through an underground tunnel near the Kerem Shalom Crossing and attack Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military positions. In the attack, two IDF soldiersHow were Palestinian militants able to abduct Gilad Shalit? – Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News and two Palestinian militantsQ&A: Israeli soldier held in Gaza, BBC News, Monday, 25 June 2007. were killed, four IDF soldiers were wounded, and one wounded soldier Gilad Shalit was captured and taken to the Gaza Strip.
Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility, together with the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas), and a previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Islam.Palestinian groups call for prisoner release – RTÉ News
This event led to the eruption of the Operation Summer Rains. Shalit was held as a hostage in the Gaza Strip by the Hamas, and was only released as part of a prisoner swap on 18 October 2011.
The capture of Gilad Shalit was the first incident of a capture of an IDF soldier by the Palestinians since the Kidnapping of Nachshon Wachsman in 1994.

==The attack and the capture==

The day before the capture, the Israeli army had seized two Palestinian men in an overnight raid into the southern Gaza Strip, who allegedly were members of Hamas and were planning attacks on Israel. Hamas said they were sons of a member but were not involved in Hamas.[tpl]cite news | title= Israel captures pair in Gaza raid | date= 24 June 2006|publisher=BBC  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5112846.stm |accessdate=1 August 2006[/tpl]
On Sunday morning, 25 June 2006, at about 5:30 am (GMT+2) an armed squad of Palestinians militants from the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Israel via a 300-meter-long underground tunnel they dug near the Kerem Shalom border crossing.Two soldiers killed, one missing in Kerem Shalom terror attack. Mfa.gov.il. Retrieved on 2011-08-29. The militants surfaced in Israeli territory shielded by a row of trees, and came up behind IDF border positions facing Gaza. As militants from within the Gaza Strip bombarded Israeli positions with mortar and anti-tank fire, the militant squad split into three cells.
One cell aligned itself behind a Merkava Mark III tank, another behind a concrete watchtower, and another behind an armored personnel carrier. The militants simultaneously opened fire on their targets. The militants that attacked the tank blew open its rear door with an RPG. The tank's gunner, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was wounded by the RPG blast, suffering a broken left hand and a light shoulder wound. Two of the militants then approached the tank. The RPG hit caused the tank to go up in flames, and its fire extinguisher system was activated. However, the engine stopped working and the ventilation system failed to work as a result, creating suffocating conditions inside. The tank's commander and driver climbed out to escape, and were gunned down by the militants. A militant then climbed onto the tank's turret and threw grenades into the tank, wounding another crew member. Shalit climbed out of the tank to escape the suffocating conditions, and as he emerged onto the turret, he saw one of the militants climbing onto the tank, with his AK-47 strapped to his back. Shalit at this point could have easily killed the militant using the .50 caliber machine gun mounted on the turret, but instead surrendered to him. He later told IDF investigators that he was confused and in a state of shock, and thus never thought of shooting him. Shalit was then taken to Gaza with the militants.Gilad Schalit's capture, in his own words, part II An Israeli tank soon arrived on the scene and an IDF observation post witnessed their escape, although it was not known at the time that the militants had a captive Israeli soldier with them, and the tank did not open fire in time, as the commander was awaiting permission. When permission was finally granted, the tank opened fire with its machine guns.
The squad's third member was positioned near a road, and fired an RPG at an IDF jeep driven by a captain. After the captain returned fire, the militant fled towards a tunnel dug along the fence, throwing grenades. An IDF armored vehicle fired at him, but missed, and he escaped.
Two militants attacked the watchtower, raking it with RPG and small-arms fire, wounding two soldiers manning the tower. One militant crept towards the tower and placed an explosive charge next to the bottom doors. The ensuing explosion damaged the tower's communication cables. The militant then attempted to climb the stairs, while the second militant remained on the ground as backup. IDF soldiers in the tower spotted the militant climbing the stairs and opened fire, killing him in the upper part of the stairway. The second militant was spotted by an IDF lookout, and soldiers then opened fire and killed him.
The third cell attacked an empty armored personnel carrier placed as a decoy before retreating, firing an RPG which damaged it and caused it to burst into flames.Soldier kidnapped and two killed in Gaza tunnel attack – Telegraph[tpl]cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Gil, et al. | title = Shalit’s health better than first feared | publisher= Jerusalem Post | date = 29 June 2006 | url = http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885856068&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull| accessdate= 22 September 2011 [/tpl]Shay, Shaul: Islamic terror abductions in the Middle East
Later, explosive charges left behind by the militants exploded while IDF troops were combing the area, lightly injuring three soldiers.
Immediately afterwards the Palestinian militant squad made their way back into the Gaza Strip, with Shalit, through the ground after they blew an opening in the security fence and disappeared. Meanwhile, large Israeli military forces arrived at the site and began helping the wounded. When they reached the tank the soldiers discovered the two bodies and a wounded crewman. When it became clear that the fourth crew member was missing, an abduction alert was declared, and various Israeli forces entered Gaza.
The Palestinian militancy organizations responsible for raid took responsibility for the attack, for the first time, a day after the attack – the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas), the Popular Resistance Committees organization (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas) and the Army of Islam group issued a joint statement on 26 June 2006, in which they claimed responsibility for the raid and offered information on Shalit only if Israel agreed to release all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners under the age of 18, who were held without charges and tried without the right of defense.[tpl]cite news | title = Militants issue Israel hostage demands | publisher = CNN | date = 26 June 2006 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/26/israel.soldier/index.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110628202219/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/26/israel.soldier/index.html |archivedate = 28 June 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Israeli retaliation==

Following the capture of Corporal Gilad Shalit, the IDF launched Operation Summer Rains. In addition various international bodies conducted diplomatic activity, among them Egypt, in an attempt to release Shalit. Due to the fact that Shalit is a French citizen, France attempted to release him through diplomatic means. However, the captors, who operated under the orders of Khaled Mashal and the Hamas military leadership, refused to release him. According to David Siegel, a spokesman at the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C., “Israel did everything it could in exhausting all diplomatic options and gave Mahmoud Abbas the opportunity to return the abducted Israeli… This operation can be terminated immediately, conditioned on the release of Gilad Shalit.”[tpl]cite news | last = Rosenberg | first = David | title = Israeli Army Enters Gaza to Find Kidnapped Soldier (update 2) | publisher = Bloomberg.com | date = 28 June 2006 | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=avQ5sj2YpzXI| accessdate= 22 September 2011 [/tpl]
On the night of 28–29 June 2006, the IDF arrested dozens of Hamas leaders in the West bank, including 20 Palestinian parliament members and eight Palestinian ministers. This retaliation operation was reportedly planned several weeks in advance. On the same day, four Israeli Air Force aircraft flew over Syrian President Bashar Assad's palace in Latakia, as an IDF spokesperson said that Israel views the Syrian leadership as a sponsor of Hamas.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3268747,00.html |title=IAF: Aerial flight over Assad's palace |author=Hanan Greenberg |publisher=Ynetnews |date= 28 June 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080130164641/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3268747,00.html| archivedate= 30 January 2008 | deadurl= yes[/tpl]
On 1 July 2006, Shalit's captors issued another demand to the Israelis, demanding that Israel release an additional 1,000 Palestinian prisoners (in addition to all female and young prisoners, as previously demanded) and end Israel's incursions into Gaza.[tpl]cite news | title = FACTBOX—The crisis over Israel’s captured soldier | publisher = Reuters | date = 2 July 2006 | url = http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyid=2006-07-02T124159Z_01_L02487670_RTRUKOT_0_TEXT0.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsArt-L1-RelatedNews-4| accessdate= 22 September 2011 [/tpl] Two days later, the captors issued a 24-hour ultimatum for meeting their demands, threatening unspecified consequences if Israel refused.[tpl]cite news | title = Palestinian militants issue ultimatum to Israel | publisher = Reuters | date = 3 July 2006 | url = http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-07-03T072306Z_01_SCH354578_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST.xml&archived=False| accessdate= 22 September 2011 [/tpl] Hours after the ultimatum was issued, Israel officially rejected the demands, stating that: "there will be no negotiations to release prisoners".[tpl]cite news | title = Minister Ramon: IDF operations in Gaza will be ‘far far worse’ if Shalit harmed | publisher = Haaretz | date = 3 July 2006 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/733789.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110520170017/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/733789.html |archivedate = 20 May 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
On 3 July 2006 Shalit's captors made an ultimatum according to which they demanded that Israel must fulfill all of its demands by 4 July 2006 at 6:00 am. However, the captors did not specify exactly what would happen if the demands were not met. The Israeli Prime Minister's office formally rejected the ultimatum. After the ultimatum period expired the Army of Islam group announced that no more information would be released about Shalit's fate.
Operation Summer Rains, which failed to achieve its main objective (the release of Shalit), ended on 26 November 2006 when the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on a cease-fire, after the Palestinian militancy organizations agreed to stop firing rockets on Sderot and after Israel agreed to cease IDF operations in the Gaza Strip.

==Aftermath==

Hamas high-ranking commander Abu Jibril Shimali, whom Israel considers responsible for coordinating the abduction of Shalit, was killed during the violent clashes between Hamas and the al-Qaida-affiliated Jund Ansar Allah organization in Gaza in August 2009.Hamas: Head of Al-Qaida affiliate killed in Gaza, Haaretz, 18 August 2009
On 2 October 2009, Israel received a video clip of 2:42 minutes length in which Gilad Shalit was filmed. In exchange, Israel released 20 Palestinian prisoners. During the same day the video clip was broadcast on television channels world wide. The video, which was published publicly after the Shalit family approval to do so, showed Gilad Shalit in uniform reading a pre-written message, in which he urged the Israeli government to finalize the deal for his release. In addition, during the video clip Shalit stood up for a few seconds and moved towards the camera so that his health condition would be evident in the video, as much as possible. In addition, during the video clip Shalit was holding an Arab newspaper from 14 September 2009 in order to prove that the video was recorded just before its release.BBC NEWS | Middle East | Tape shows Shalit 'safe and well'
