Tracey Kibre is a fictional Homicide Bureau Chief ADA on Law & Order: Trial by Jury, portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. She also appeared in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode "Night". A tough, focused prosecutor, Kibre has worked for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for fifteen years and is a stark contrast to the Executive ADAs in the other three Law & Order series.http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20147001,00.htmlhttp://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/Law-Order-2005/episode-9-season-1/line/191616
Kibre has a black-and-white view of the law when it comes to those she prosecutes, and does take a few controversial turns in her cases. In one episode she indicated that she is not religious, unlike her partner Kelly Gaffney. Kibre always sits first chair as the lead prosecuting attorney in the cases she tries, most of which are homicides, though she once tried a high-profile rape case for the NYPD Special Victims Unit during a crossover special with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit when ADA Casey Novak was viciously attacked.
Kibre is also notable for her pathos-driven arguments. During a closing argument of a trial of a girl for causing the death of a baby from Shaken Baby Syndrome, Kibre brutally shakes a baby doll. When the judge objects, telling Kibre she will be in contempt of court, she smashes the doll's head into the barrier separating her from the jury (as she alleged the defendant had done).
Kibre also uses various means in her attempts to sway the jury to her side. In one case in which a man is prosecuted for murdering his son's girlfriend (a transsexual), Kibre has the murder victim's mother posthumously change her daughter's name to Angelina, the victim's adopted name. Kibre files a motion to have this name submitted to the court, thus necessitating the defense to refer to the victim by the preferred, female name to gain the jury's sympathy.
