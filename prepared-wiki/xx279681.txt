==History==

The Izumo service (written in hiragana as [tpl]Nihongo2|いずも[/tpl]) commenced on 29 June 1947, as a "semi-express" service operating between [tpl]Ja-stalink|Osaka[/tpl] and [tpl]Ill|ja|Taisha Station|大社駅[/tpl] (now closed).[tpl]cite book | title = 列車名鑑1995 |trans_title= Train Name Directory 1995| publisher = Railway Journal| date = August 1995 | location = Japan| page = 123| isbn = [/tpl] From 19 November 1956, this was upgraded to become an "express" service (written in kanji as [tpl]Nihongo2|出雲[/tpl]) operating between [tpl]Ja-stalink|Tokyo[/tpl] and [tpl]Ja-stalink|Hamada[/tpl]. From 15 March 1972, the train was upgraded to become a "limited express" service.
From 10 July 1998, one pair of Izumo services was replaced by new 285 series electric multiple unit trains running as the Sunrise Izumo together with the Sunrise Seto via [tpl]Ja-stalink|Okayama[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | title = こだわりの新幹線＆特急列車ガイド |trans_title= In-depth Shinkansen & Limited Express Guide| publisher = Ikaros Publishing| date = August 2000 | location = Japan| page = 195| isbn = 4-87149-284-2[/tpl] The remaining pair of services followed the original route, travelling over the Sanin Main Line west of [tpl]Ja-stalink|Kyoto[/tpl], via [tpl]Ja-stalink|Fukuchiyama[/tpl].
The last remaining Izumo services were withdrawn from the start of the revised timetable on 18 March 2006.[tpl]cite journal| title = JR車両ファイル2006|trans_title= JR Rolling Stock File 2006| journal = Japan Railfan Magazine | volume = 46| issue = 543| page = p.30| publisher = Koyusha Co., Ltd.| location = Japan |language= Japanese| date = July 2006[/tpl]
