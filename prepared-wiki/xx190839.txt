[[Homologous desensitization]]

CATEGORIES: Membrane biology, G protein coupled receptors, Signal transduction

Homologous desensitization occurs when a receptor decreases its response to a signalling molecule when that agonist is in high concentration.[tpl]cite web|title=homologous desensitization|url=http://www.drugs.com/dict/homologous-desensitization.html|work=Medical Dictionary|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=18 May 2011[/tpl] It is a process whereby after prolonged agonist exposure, the receptor is uncoupled from its signaling cascade, and thus the biological effect of receptor activation is attenuated.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fehmann|first=HC|coauthors=Habener, JF|title=Homologous desensitization of the insulinotropic glucagon-like peptide-I (7-37) receptor on insulinoma (HIT-T15) cells.|journal=Endocrinology|date=Jun 1991|volume=128|issue=6|pages=2880–8|pmid=1645253|accessdate=18 May 2011|doi=10.1210/endo-128-6-2880[/tpl]
Homologous desensitization should not be confused with heterologous desensitisation, which is a different process whereby repeated stimulation of a receptor by one agonist results in desensitivity to a range of other agonists.

==Mechanism==

The mechanism of homologous desensitization is as follows (using the β2 receptor as an example):
