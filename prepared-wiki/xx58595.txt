[[Crime in Moldova]]

CATEGORIES: Crime in Moldova

Crime in Moldova, as everywhere in former Soviet republics, has risen dramatically since the fall of the Soviet Union. Economic and drug-related crimes, the most visible and predictable results of the deteriorating economic situations in the newly independent countries, have simply overwhelmed the human and financial resources devoted to them.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Extent & reporting of crime==

Crime is often more extensive than what is acknowledged: many crimes are not registered. For example, in mid-1995, the Moldovan government stated that overall crime in Moldova had risen by 29 percent over the previous year. However, the number of motorbikes and motor vehicles "being searched for" was thirteen times the number of vehicles listed as "stolen."[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.havocscope.com/drug-trafficking-market-in-moldova/|title=Drug Trafficking in Moldova[/tpl] 
Illicit cultivation of opium poppies and cannabis is carried out in Moldova, mainly for consumption in CIS countries. According to NATO, drug trafficking in Moldova is valued between $200 million to $250 million per year.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.havocscope.com/drug-trafficking-market-in-moldova/|title=Drug Trafficking in Moldova[/tpl] 
In addition, Moldova is a transshipment point for illegal drugs to Western Europe and a source and transit nation in the trafficking in human beings, in particular women and girls into forced prostitution. The annual country human rights report from the United States Department of State pinpoints some involvement by government officials and Moldovan law enforcement in human trafficking.

The United States Department of State issued a report in 2006 on human rights violations in MoldovaMoldova: 2005 country report on human rights practices stating:
 
 "The country was a major country of origin for women and children trafficked abroad for forced prostitution and men and children who were trafficked to Russia and neighboring countries for forced labor and begging. The country was also a transit country for victims trafficked from Ukraine to Romania. Women and girls were trafficked to Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, Hungary, and the Balkan countries for prostitution. NGOs reported recent cases of victims trafficked to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Women and girls reportedly were trafficked to Italy and Greece through Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and Albania. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), victims have increasingly been directed to Asia, Russia, Turkey, Western Europe, and the Middle East. The IOM reported that the country was the main origin in Europe for women and children trafficked for forced prostitution."

==Human rights violation==

Torture and ill-treatment in Moldova remain widespread and systemic despite some initial legislative steps made by the government to change police practices in order to eradicate it, Amnesty International said on 23 October 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR59/002/2007 |title=Moldova: Police torture and ill-treatment: "It's just normal." |date=23 October 2007 |work=Amnesty International[/tpl] "Although efforts have been made to bring legislation into line with international and European standards, practice and attitudes are lagging behind. Beatings and abuse of detainees remain the norm. Channels for seeking redress stay blocked. Lack of transparency breeds impunity," Amnesty International's researcher said.[tpl]cite web |work=Amnesty International USA |title=Moldova: Urgent measures needed to stop torture or other ill-treatment |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGEUR590062007&lang=e |date=23 October 2007[/tpl]
The events during the April 2009 Moldova civil unrest have drawn criticism of human rights violations, including in regard to the deaths of Valeriu Boboc, Ion Ţâbuleac, and Eugen Ţapu.
