Windmills have historically played a major part in the Netherlands by providing an alternative to water driven mills.Blunt, Elizabeth. "Exploiting wind power in Holland." BBC News. N.p., 13 Nov. 2000. Web. 14 Oct. 2009. .

==Onshore wind power==

In December 2009, a total of 1,879 onshore wind turbines had been installed in the Netherlands, comprising a total of 1,993 MW. The largest onshore wind farm is located in Eemshaven in Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. This 204 MW wind farm contains 21 Vestas V90 3MW (known as GroWind) and 47 Enercon E 82 3MW (known as Westereems) wind turbines.Rabobank. "Proof of performance: Growind." Rabobank Group. N.p., 2009. Web. 15 Oct. 2009 .Essent. "First wind turbines at Westereems Wind Park supply power." Essent.N.p., 24 July 2008. Web. 15 Oct. 2009. . Other large wind farms are located in Delfzijl-zuid (72 MW), Lelystad (46 MW), Terneuzen, (Koegorspolder, 44 MW), and Biddinghuizen (WP Kubbeweg, 34 MW).
Most wind power is produced in the province of Flevoland.
Remarkably, wind turbines with just 2 blades are sometimes used as in Eemmeerdijk Wind Park.

==Offshore wind power==

In addition to the wind farms built onshore, two wind farms have been built out in the sea.Hudson, Alexandra. "Dutch build towering wind turbines out at sea." Reuters. In 2006, the Egmond aan Zee Offshore Wind Farm was built, consisting of 36 Vestas V90 3MW turbines, totaling 108 MW, sufficient to light 100,000 houses.The Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. "In the sea, the Netherlands finds threats, hope." The Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Oct.Q7 doesn't exist 2009.. The project cost $272 million and is cooperatively owned by Royal Dutch Shell and the Dutch utility company Nuon. In 2008, a second, somewhat larger offshore wind park was built: the Princess Amalia Wind Farm, consisting of 60 Vestas V80 2MW turbines totaling 120 MW, sufficient to power 125,000 homes and help the Netherlands cut 225,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. The wind park was developed off the coast of IJmuiden by Econcern and Eneco Energie, at a total cost of $522.3 million.
The Dutch government has expressed the aspiration to build 6,000 MW of offshore wind power by 2020,Ministry of Housing, Spacial Planning and the Environment, accessed on December 28th 2009. which will have a considerable impact on the Dutch electricity grid, operated by TenneT.Offshore Wind Power Research, WE@Sea, accessed December 28th 2009. As a first step, the government has determined 65 sites for offshore wind farms in the North Sea and IJsselmeer.
In November 2011, the Dutch government decided to no longer fund 6B€ per year to maintain subsidized wind KWh at €0.18. It sharply cut subsidies down to 1.5B€, leaving private sector to carry over windmill investments shall these be beneficial.
