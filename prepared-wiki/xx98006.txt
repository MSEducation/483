[[Consistent histories]]

CATEGORIES: Interpretations of quantum mechanics, Quantum measurement

In quantum mechanics, the consistent histories approach is intended to give a modern interpretation of quantum mechanics, generalising the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and providing a natural interpretation of quantum cosmology.F. Dowker and A. Kent, "Properties of Consistent Histories", Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 3038 - 3041 (1995) This interpretation of quantum mechanics is based on a consistency criterion that then allows probabilities to be assigned to various alternative histories of a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the Schrödinger equation. In contrast to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly the Copenhagen interpretation, the framework does not include "wavefunction collapse" as a relevant description of any physical process, and emphasizes that measurement theory is not a fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics.

==Histories==

These propositions can correspond to any set of questions that include all possibilities.
Examples might be the three propositions meaning "the electron went through the left slit", "the electron went through the right slit" and "the electron didn't go through either slit". One of the aims of the theory is to show that classical questions such as, "where are my keys?" are consistent. In this case one might use a large number of propositions each one specifying the location of the keys in some small region of space.
This definition can be extended to define projection operators that represent inhomogeneous histories too.

==Consistency==

An important construction in the consistent histories approach is the class operator for a homogeneous history:
This definition can be extended to inhomogeneous histories as well.
The set of histories is weakly consistent if

==Interpretation==

The interpretation based on consistent histories is used in combination with the insights about quantum decoherence. 
Quantum decoherence implies that irreversible macroscopic phenomena (hence, all classical measurements) render histories automatically consistent, which allows one to recover classical reasoning and "common sense" when applied to the outcomes of these measurements. More precise analysis of decoherence allows (in principle) a quantitative calculation of the boundary between the classical domain and the quantum domain covariance. According to Roland Omnès,[tpl]cite book |first=Roland |last=Omnès |year=1999 |title=Understanding Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-00435-8 |lccn=98042442 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8_bnm4qghvkC&lpg=PP179&pg=PA179 |pages=179, 257[/tpl]

In order to obtain a complete theory, the formal rules above must be supplemented with a particular Hilbert space and rules that govern dynamics, for example a Hamiltonian.
In the opinion of othersA. Kent and J. McElwaine Quantum Prediction Algorithms Phys. Rev. A, 55, 1703--1720 (1997) this still does not make a complete theory as no predictions are possible about which set of consistent histories will actually occur. That is the rules of Consistent Histories, the Hilbert space, and the Hamiltonian must be supplemented by a set selection rule. However, GriffithsR. B. Griffiths, Consistent Quantum Theory, Cambridge University Press, 2003 holds the opinion that asking the question of which set of histories will "actually occur" is a misinterpretation of the theory; histories are a tool for description of reality, not separate alternate realities.
The proponents of this Consistent Histories interpretation, such as Murray Gell-Mann, James Hartle, Roland Omnès and Robert B. Griffiths argue that their interpretation clarifies the fundamental disadvantages of the old Copenhagen interpretation, and can be used as a complete interpretational framework for quantum mechanics.  
In Quantum Philosophy,R. Omnès, Quantum Philosophy, Princeton University Press, 1999. See part III, especially Chapter IX Roland Omnès provides a less mathematical way of understanding  this same formalism.
The consistent histories approach can be interpreted as a way of understanding which sets of classical questions can be consistently asked of a single quantum system, and which sets of questions are fundamentally inconsistent, and thus meaningless when asked together. It thus becomes possible to demonstrate formally why it is that the questions which Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen assumed could be asked together, of a single quantum system, simply cannot be asked together. On the other hand, it also becomes possible to demonstrate that classical, logical reasoning often does apply, even to quantum experiments – but we can now be mathematically exact about the limits of classical logic.
