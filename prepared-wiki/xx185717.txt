CATEGORIES: Musical groups from Long Island, Rock music groups from New York

The Bell Notes were an early American rock and roll group from the East Meadow area of Long Island, New York. 
The Bell Notes were regular performers in The Bronx in the 1950s, and performed at a bar owned by the father of Ray Tabano; he and Steven Tyler (of Aerosmith) occasionally played between Bell Notes sets and covered their song "I've Had It". "I've Had It", released on Time Records, was a nationwide hit in the U.S. in 1959, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. They released four further singles in 1959 – "Old Spanish Town", "That's Right", "You're a Big Girl Now", and "White Buckskin Sneakers & Checkerboard Socks" – but only "Old Spanish Town" charted, peaking at #76.
In 1960, they signed to Autograph Records and issued "Little Girl in Blue"; two singles for Madison Records, "Shortnin' Bread" and "Friendly Star" followed. "Shortnin' Bread" hit #96 in the U.S. and was their last hit; they broke up by 1962.
In 1964, the group appeared in the series of Nu-Trading Rock 'n Roll Trading Cards.
