===Whiskeys===

Distilled from 100% of a single grain, Koval bottles each of these five grains as a white whiskey (unaged), and ages each whiskey in two types of new American oak barrels - heavy char and light char.  The unaged whiskey is sold under the "Koval" brand name, while the aged whiskey is sold under the brand name "Lion's Pride".
