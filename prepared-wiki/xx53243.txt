[[Molecular clock]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular evolution, Molecular genetics, Phylogenetics

The molecular clock  (based on the molecular clock hypothesis (MCH)) is a technique in molecular evolution that uses fossil constraints and rates of molecular change to deduce the time in geologic history when two species or other taxa diverged. It is used to estimate the time of occurrence of events called speciation or radiation. The molecular data used for such calculations are usually nucleotide sequences for DNA or amino acid sequences for proteins. It is sometimes called a gene clock or evolutionary clock.

==Early discovery and genetic equidistance==

The notion of the existence of a so-called "molecular clock" was first attributed to Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling who, in 1962, noticed that the number of amino acid differences in hemoglobin between different lineages changes roughly linearly with time, as estimated from fossil evidence.[tpl]cite book | author = Zuckerkandl, E. and Pauling, L.B. | year = 1962 | title = Horizons in Biochemistry | chapter = Molecular disease, evolution, and genic heterogeneity | editor = Kasha, M. and Pullman, B (editors) | pages = 189–225 | publisher = Academic Press, New York[/tpl]  They generalized this observation to assert that the rate of evolutionary change of any specified protein was approximately constant over time and over different lineages.
The genetic equidistance phenomenon was first noted in 1963 by E. Margoliash, who wrote: "It appears that the number of residue differences between cytochrome C of any two species is mostly conditioned by the time elapsed since the lines of evolution leading to these two species originally diverged. If this is correct, the cytochrome c of all mammals should be equally different from the cytochrome c of all birds. Since fish diverges from the main stem of vertebrate evolution earlier than either birds or mammals, the cytochrome c of both mammals and birds should be equally different from the cytochrome c of fish. Similarly, all vertebrate cytochrome c should be equally different from the yeast protein."[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.50.4.672 |author=Margoliash E |title=PRIMARY STRUCTURE AND EVOLUTION OF CYTOCHROME C |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=50 |issue= 4|pages=672–9 |date=October 1963 |pmid=14077496 |pmc=221244[/tpl] For example, the difference between the cytochrome C of a carp and a frog, turtle, chicken, rabbit, and horse is a very constant 13% to 14%. Similarly, the difference between the cytochrome C of a bacterium and yeast, wheat, moth, tuna, pigeon, and horse ranges from 64% to 69%. Together with the work of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, the genetic equidistance result directly led to the formal postulation of the molecular clock hypothesis in the early 1960s.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kumar S |title=Molecular clocks: four decades of evolution |journal=Nat.

Later Allan Wilson and Vincent Sarich built upon this work.

==Relationship with neutral theory==

==Calibration==

The molecular clock alone can only say that one time period is twice as long as another: it cannot assign concrete dates. To achieve this, the molecular clock must first be calibrated against independent evidence about dates, such as the fossil record.[tpl]cite journal |author=benton, M. J. and Donoghue, P. C. J. |year=200t |title= Paleontological evidence to date the Tree of Life|journal=Molecular Biology & Evolution|volume= 24|pages=26–53 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msl150 |pmid=17047029 |issue=1[/tpl] Alternatively, for viral phylogenetics and ancient DNA studies, two areas of evolutionary biology where it is possible to sample sequences over an evolutionary timescale, the dates of the samples themselves can be used to calibrate the molecular clock.

==Non-constant rate of molecular clock==

Sometimes only a single divergence date can be estimated from fossils, with all other dates inferred from that. Other sets of species have abundant fossils available, allowing the MCH of constant divergence rates to be tested. DNA sequences experiencing low levels of negative selection showed divergence rates of 0.7-0.8% per Myr in bacteria, mammals, invertebrates, and plants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ochman H, Wilson AC. |journal=J Mol Evol.| year=1987| pages=74–86.|title=Evolution in bacteria: evidence for a universal substitution rate in cellular genomes | volume=26|doi=10.1007/BF02111283 |pmid=3125340 |issue=1–2[/tpl]  In the same study, genomic regions experiencing very high negative or purifying selection (encoding rRNA) were considerably slower (1% per 50 Myr).
In addition to such variation in rate with genomic position, since the early 1990s, variation among taxa has proven fertile ground for research too,[tpl]cite journal |author=Douzery, E.J.P., Delsuc, F., Stanhope, M.J. and Huchon, D. |year=2003 |title= Local molecular clocks in three nuclear genes: divergence times for rodents and other mammals, and incompatibility among fossil calibrations|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume= 57|pages=S201–S213|url=  |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-0028-x |pmid=15008417[/tpl] even over comparatively short periods of evolutionary time (for example mockingbirds[tpl]cite journal |author=Hunt, J.S., Bermingham, E., and Ricklefs, R.E. |year=2001 |title=Molecular systematics and biogeography of Antillean thrashers, tremblers, and mockingbirds (Aves: Mimidae) |journal=Auk |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=35–55|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3793/is_200101/ai_n8930531 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2001)1180035:MSABOA2.0.CO;2 |issn=0004-8038 [/tpl]). Tube-nosed seabirds have molecular clocks that on average run at half speed of many other birds,[tpl]cite journal |author=Rheindt, F. E. and Austin, J. |year=2005 |title=Major analytical and conceptual shortcomings in a recent taxonomic revision of the Procellariiformes - A reply to Penhallurick and Wink (2004) |journal=Emu |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=181–186|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=MU04039.pdf |doi=10.1071/MU04039 [/tpl] possibly due to long generation times, and many turtles have a molecular clock running at one-eighth the speed it does in small mammals or even slower.[tpl]cite journal |author= Avise, J.C., Bowen, W., Lamb, T., Meylan, A.B. and Bermingham, E. |date=1 May 1992|title= Mitochondrial DNA Evolution at a Turtle's Pace: Evidence for Low Genetic Variability and Reduced Microevolutionary Rate in the Testudines |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 9|issue= 3|pages=457–473|url= http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/9/3/457 |pmid= 1584014 [/tpl] Effects of small population size are also likely to confound molecular clock analyses; cheetahs for example, having gone through at least 2 population bottlenecks, could not be adequately studied based on a molecular clock model alone.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] Researchers such as Francisco Ayala have more fundamentally challenged the molecular clock hypothesis.[tpl]cite journal |author= Ayala, F.J.|year=1999 |title=Molecular clock mirages |journal=BioEssays |volume=21|issue=1 |pages=71–75|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/60000186/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199901)21:13.0.CO;2-B |pmid=10070256[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Schwartz, J. H. and Maresca, B. |year=2006 |title=Do Molecular Clocks Run at All? A Critique of Molecular Systematics |journal=Biological Theory |volume=1 |pages=357–371|url=  |doi=10.1162/biot.2006.1.4.357|laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070210170623.htm|laysource=Science Daily |issue=4[/tpl] According to Ayala's 1999 study, 5 factors combine to limit the application of molecular clock models:
Molecular clock users have developed workaround solutions using a number of statistical approaches including maximum likelihood techniques and later Bayesian modeling. In particular, models that take into account rate variation across lineages have been proposed in order to obtain better estimates of divergence times. These models are called relaxed molecular clocks[tpl]cite journal |author=Drummond, A.J., Ho, S.Y.W., Phillips, M.J. and Rambaut A. |year=2006 |title= Relaxed Phylogenetics and Dating with Confidence|journal= PLoS Biology |volume= 4|issue=5 |pages=e88|doi=  10.1371/journal.pbio.0040088 |pmid=16683862 |pmc=1395354[/tpl] because they represent an intermediate position between the 'strict' molecular clock hypothesis and Felsenstein's many-rates model and are made possible through MCMC techniques that explore a weighted range of tree topologies and simultaneously estimate parameters of the chosen substitution model. It must be remembered that divergence dates inferred using a molecular clock are based on statistical inference and not on direct evidence.
The molecular clock runs into particular challenges at very short and very long timescales. At long timescales, the problem is saturation. When enough time has passed, many sites have undergone more than one change, but it is impossible to detect more than one. This means that the observed number of changes is no longer linear with time, but instead flattens out.
At very short time scales, many differences between samples do not represent fixation of different sequences in the different populations. Instead, they represent alternative alleles that were both present as part of a polymorphism in the common ancestor. The inclusion of differences that have not yet become fixed
leads to a potentially dramatic inflation of the apparent rate of the molecular clock at very short timescales.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msi145 |author=Ho SYW, Phillips MJ, Cooper A, Drummond AJ |year=2005 |title= Time dependency of molecular rate estimates and systematic overestimation of recent divergence times |journal= Molecular Biology & Evolution |volume= 22 |issue=7 |pages=1561–1568 |pmid=15814826[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Peterson GI, Masel J| year=2009 |title= Quantitative Prediction of Molecular Clock and Ka/Ks at Short Timescales |journal= Molecular Biology & Evolution |pmid=19661199 |volume= 26 |issue=11 |pmc=2912466 |pages=2595–2603| doi=10.1093/molbev/msp175[/tpl]

==Methods==

Bayesian methods can provide more appropriate estimates of divergence times, especially if large datasets - such as those yielded by phylogenomics - are employed.[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rspb.2012.0683[/tpl]

==Uses==

The molecular clock technique is an important tool in molecular systematics, the use of molecular genetics information to determine the correct scientific classification of organisms or to study variation in selective forces.
Knowledge of approximately constant rate of molecular evolution in particular sets of lineages also facilitates establishing the dates of phylogenetic events, including those not documented by fossils, such as the divergence of living taxa and the formation of the phylogenetic tree. But in these cases — especially over long stretches of time — the limitations of MCH (above) must be considered;  such estimates may be off by 50% or more.
