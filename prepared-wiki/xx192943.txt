Trampled – The Elefant Traks Remix Album is the first compilation remix album by Australian hip hop label, Elefant Traks and was released in August 2006. 
The album was released as an 18-track CD, with three tracks from the CD also featuring on a limited edition 7-track vinyl 12", together with four additional remixes, by Astronomy Class, F&d (Mnemonic Ascent), Fame and Pasobionic.
On the album Plutonic Lab remixes Hermitude, who in turn remix The Herd. The Herd members such as Sulo, Unkle Ho, Traksewt and Urthboy remix the likes of TZU, Sparrow Hill and Waiting for Guiness. Co-nominees of Triple J’s inaugural J Award Pivot recondition The Herd, as do Curse Ov Dialect and Combat Wombat. Count Bounce and Yerock (TZU) overhaul Urthboy, and "I Was Only 19"  is remixed by UK folktronica act Tunng. 
In addition, the album version of The Herd’s cover of "I Was Only 19"  featuring John Schumann is included, fulfilling the promise to core fans who had bought The Sun Never Sets album before it was re-released with the track.
