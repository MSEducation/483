Shebna ([tpl]Hebrew name|שֶׁבְנָא|Shevna|Šeḇnā|"tender youth"[/tpl]) was "treasurer over the house" (meaning comptroller or governor of the palace) in the reign of king Hezekiah of Judah, according to the Old Testament.  
Because of his pride he was ejected from his office, and replaced by Eliakim the son of Hilkiah as recorded in Isaiah 22:15-25. Shebna also appears to have been the leader of the party who favored an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. 
Shebna may or may not have been "Shebna the scribe", who was sent by the king to confer with the Assyrian ambassador recorded in the (2 Kings 18:18, 26, 37; 19:2; Isa. 36:3, 11, 22; 37:2).
