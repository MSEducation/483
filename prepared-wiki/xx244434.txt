[[Wentworth Point, New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Sydney

Wentworth Point  is a suburb of inner west Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Wentworth Point is located 16 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Auburn. It is on the western shore of Homebush Bay on the southern side of the Parramatta River

==History==

This suburb was once part of the suburb of Homebush, named after Homebush Bay, the bay with a natural and artificial shoreline on the southern side of the Parramatta River. Homebush was established in the 1800s by the colony's then assistant surgeon D'arcy Wentworth.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ISBN 0-207-14495-8, page 124 According to local government historian Michael Jones, "Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in Kent." Its unlikely that it was named after the village in Kent as D'Arcy Wentworth was Irish and had no links to the English county.Jones, Michael (1985).

The northern part of the peninsula had been named Wentworth Point and gazetted in 1976.[tpl]NSW GNR|id=SXckWytLIt|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=[/tpl] 
The waterfront residential area was renamed Wentworth Point on 2 October 2009,.http://www.auburn.nsw.gov.au/page.aspx?id=3946[tpl]NSW GNR|id=MnIOlMUlMa|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=[/tpl] Auburn Council sought public comment on a proposal to rename the Homebush Bay area, to remove confusion with its namesake suburb Homebush. The area encompassing Sydney Olympic Park was given autonomy as a suburb and the Carter Street industrial precinct was absorbed by the neighbouring suburb of Lidcombe. This effectively brought the suburb of Homebush Bay to an end.

===Industrial and commercial usage===

After much of the area was reclaimed from Homebush Bay, Wentworth Point was used for a variety of industrial uses. The larger and better known include Ralph Simonds, a plywood manufacturer, which used the river as a transport route for large logs, which were then moored in Homebush Bay while awaiting processing. Other activities have included McPhee Transport depot, a jeans warehouse, warehouse and office space for Hyundai (now occupied by acer) and a radio transmission tower for 2GB, a Sydney radio station.

===Residential development===

Prior to the move of the Royal Agricultural Society showgrounds from Moore Park to Homebush (as the area of Sydney Olympic Park was then known), much of Wentworth Point was bought by Payce Consolidated Limited. Most of Wentworth Point is now zoned for medium to high density residential development.

===Internet===

ADSL and ADSL2 is not available in the estate this is because the local phone exchange is 8 km away on parramatta road. All cables on hill road run to this exchange or to RIM cabinets that can only provide ADSL1. Mariners Cove does have ADSL1 but with only 150 ports in the RIM and 300 Apartments most do without the internet.
For a long time Homelinx which was owned by payce installed a fiber network and was the sole provider of internet. Net Open Access was created to hold the network owned by homelinx to open up the network to competition and give residents a choice.
Stealth Networks and W3networks now provide services and any other isp can as long as they contact net open access to start selling services as the network is open to anyone to use.

==Transport==

===Buses===

A bus route 526 services Wentworth Point and Burwood.

===Ferries===

There is a ferry service between Parramatta and Circular Quay which services Wentworth Point by the ferry wharf at the northern end of the point.

===Trains===

There is no train service to Wentworth Point, but nearby Olympic Park has a station, although services are infrequent out of major events and peak hours.

==Commercial areas==

Wentworth Point has some small shops, cafes and restaurants but there is no significant shopping centre. There is a large supermarket and shopping centre at nearby Newington and Rhodes.
NSW Maritime owns about 18 hectares of land at the northern end of the point. This land has been subject to proposals for marine related development including boat storage. It has been considered as a possible location for a primary school.

==Recreation==

Cycling and walking are well catered for by cycleways in the Millennium Parklands and Bicentennial Park. There are dedicated commuter cycleways to Sydney Olympic Park and Parramatta. Homebush Bay has potential for sailing, kayaking, rowing and dragon boating, but water access and boat storage facilities are limited. There is a recreation club in Wentworth Point called ‘Pulse’ which has a 25 meter indoor heated pool, gymnasium and tennis courts. A wide range of other recreation facilities are available at nearby Sydney Olympic Park.

==Future development==
