Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, and is also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The first of the atypical antipsychotics to be developed, it was first introduced in Europe in 1971, but was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1975 after it was shown to cause agranulocytosis, a condition involving a dangerous decrease in the number of white blood cells, that led to death in some patients.  In 1989 after studies demonstrated that it was effective in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia[tpl]cite journal|last=Kane|first=J|coauthors=Honigfeld G, Singer J, Meltzer H|title=Clozapine for the treatment-resistant schizophrenic: a double-blind comparison versus chlorpromazine/benztropine|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=September 1988|volume=45|issue=9|pages=789–796|pmid=3046553|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800330013001[/tpl] the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of clozapine solely for that use, requiring regular white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.clozapineregistry.com/insert.pdf.ashx | format = pdf | publisher = TEVA Clozapine Patient Registry | title = From Clozapine Package Insert: Frequency of Monitoring based on Stage of Therapy or Results from WBC Count and ANC Monitoring Tests | accessdate = 2012-08-18 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975910-5,00.html |title=Awakenings Schizophrenia a New Drug Brings Patients Back to Life |journal=Time |author=Wallis C & Willwerth J |date= July 6, 1992 |accessdate=2008-10-09[/tpl] The FDA also requires clozapine to carry five black box warnings for agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis, for "other adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects", and for "increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/clozapine.htm |title=Clozaril (Clozapine) drug description - FDA approved labeling for prescription drugs and medications at RxList |publisher=Rxlist.com |accessdate=2008-10-09[/tpl]  In 2002 the FDA approved clozapine for reducing the risk of suicidal behavior for patients with schizophrenia.
Clozapine is usually used only in patients that have not responded to other anti-psychotic treatments due to its danger of causing agranulocytosis as well as the costs of having to have blood tests continually during treatment.  It is, however, one of the very effective anti-psychotic treatment choices.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/mental-health-medications/what-medications-are-used-to-treat-schizophrenia.shtml | title = What medications are used to treat schizophrenia? | accessdate = 2012-08-18 | author = National Institute of Mental Health[/tpl]  Patients are monitored weekly for the first six months. If there are no low counts the patient can be monitored every two weeks for an additional six months.

Additionally, it also often causes less serious side effects such as hypersalivation and weight gain. 
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug primarily prescribed to patients who are unresponsive to or intolerant of conventional  and other atypical neuroleptics.MIMS Ireland. April 2007. It is used principally in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia,[tpl]cite journal | author = Wahlbeck K, Cheine MV, Essali A | editor1-last = Wahlbeck | editor1-first = Kristian | title = Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD000059| publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. | year = 2007 | pmid = 10796289 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab000059.html | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000059 | issn = 1464-780X[/tpl] a term used for the failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily to at least two different antipsychotics;[tpl]cite journal | author = Meltzer HY | title = Treatment-resistant schizophrenia--the role of clozapine | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–20  | year = 1997 | doi =10.1185/03007999709113338 | pmid = 9524789 [/tpl] It has been shown to be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia than the older typical antipsychotics, with more pronounced effects in those who have responded poorly to other medication; though the relapse rate is lower and patient acceptability better, this has not translated to significant observed benefits in global functioning. There is some evidence clozapine may reduce propensity for substance abuse in schizophrenic patients.[tpl]vcite journal |author = Lee M, Dickson RA, Campbell M, Oliphant J, Gretton H, Dalby JT. |title = Clozapine and substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia |journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume = 43 |pages = 855–856 |year = 1998 [/tpl] 
There has been one case report of successful use of clozapine in isolated increase in creatine kinase (in absence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome) in a patient with schizophrenia where other atypical antipsychotics were not successful.[ref]P03-358 Clozapine may be the answer: a case report of elevated serum creatine kinase in the absence of NMS. A. Mohandas, N. Talwar, A. James Langdon Hospital, Devon Partnership NHS Trust, Dawlish, UK
[/ref]
There are a number of case reports in the literature that indicate that the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine can be an effective treatment for the psychosis associated with schizophrenia, while at the same time helping to improve the physical symptoms associated with Parkinson's, such as the tremor and dyskinesia. Unlike typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, and some atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, clozapine is relatively unique in its lack of producing Parkinsonian-like symptoms, even at high doses. This is in part because clozapine binds relatively weakly to the D2 dopamine receptor compared to most other antipsychotics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=146 |title=How would you treat someone who has both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease?[/tpl]
Clozapine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia.

==Adverse effects==

Clozapine may cause side effects; most are minor, although some are serious and potentially fatal. Common side effects include extreme constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain. The risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.[tpl]cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril |title=Clozapine[/tpl]
Clozapine also carries five black box warnings, including warnings for agranulocytosis, CNS depression, leukopenia, neutropenia, seizure disorder, bone marrow suppression, dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, orthostatic hypotension (with or without syncope) and seizures.http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Monograph/monograph.aspx?cpnum=142&sec=monadve  Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures.  Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.[tpl]Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril|title=Clozapine[/tpl]
Many male patients have experienced cessation of ejaculation during orgasm as a side effect of clozapine, though this is not documented in official drug guides.[tpl]cite pmid|18338766[/tpl]

===Agranulocytosis===

Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis.  Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% of patients who take clozapine during the first few months of treatment;[tpl]cite book |last=Baldessarini |first=Ross J. |coauthors=Frank I. Tarazi |editor=Laurence Brunton, John Lazo, Keith Parker (eds.) |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2|pages= |chapter=Pharmacotherapy of Psychosis and Maa |oclc=150149056[/tpl] the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alvir JM, Lieberman JA, Safferman AZ, Schwimmer JL, Schaaf JA |title=Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis.

It has been suggested that coadministration of clozapine with an antioxidant such as vitamin C can reduce the risk of agranulocytosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hsyuanyu Y., Dunford H.B. | year = 1999 | title = Oxidation of Clozapine and Ascorbate by Myeloperoxidase. | url = | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 368 | issue = 2| pages = 412–420 | pmid = 10441395 | doi=10.1006/abbi.1999.1328[/tpl]

===Cardiac toxicity===

A more recently identified and sometimes fatal side effect is that of myocarditis, which usually develops within the first month of commencement.[tpl]cite journal | author = Haas SJ, Hill R, Krum H  | title= Clozapine-associated myocarditis: a review of 116 cases of suspected myocarditis associated with the use of clozapine in Australia during 1993-2003 | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 30 | pages = 47–57 | year = 2007| doi = 10.2165/00002018-200730010-00005 | pmid = 17194170 | issue = 1[/tpl] First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ronaldson KJ, Taylor AJ, Fitzgerald PB, Topliss DJ, McNeil JJ. | title = A new monitoring protocol for clozapine-induced myocarditis based on an analysis of 75 cases and 94 controls. | journal = Aust NZ J Psych |volume = 45 | pages = 458–465 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.3109/00048674.2011.572852[/tpl] Signs of cardiac failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ronaldson KJ, Fitzgerald PB, Taylor DJ, Topliss DJ, Wolfe R, McNeil JJ. | title = Rapid clozapine dose titration and concomitant sodium valproate increase the risk of myocarditis with clozapine: A case-control study. | journal = Schizophr Res | volume = 141 | pages = 173–8 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2012.08.018[/tpl]

===Gastrointestinal hypomotility===

Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Monitoring of bowel function is recommended, as untreated cases are occasionally fatal.[tpl]cite journal | author = Palmer SE, McLean RM, Ellis PM, Harrison-Woolrych M  | title = Life-threatening clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility: an analysis of 102 cases | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 69 | pages = 759–768 | year = 2008 |pmid=18452342 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v69n0509 | issue = 5[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Townsend G, Curtis D | title = Case report: rapidly fatal bowel ischaemia on clozapine treatment | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 6 | page = 43 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17052340 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-6-43 | pmc=1621059[/tpl]

===Hypersalivation===

While clozapine is a muscarinic antagonist at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the M4 subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the salivary gland, its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for the hypersalivation.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409612_2

===Central nervous system===

CNS side effects include drowsiness, vertigo, headache, tremor, syncope, sleep disturbances, nightmares, restlessness, akinesia, agitation, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, hyperkinesia, weakness, lethargy, ataxia, slurred speech, depression, myoclonic jerks, and anxiety. Rarely seen are delusions, hallucinations, delirium, amnesia, libido increase or decrease, paranoia and irritability, abnormal EEG, worsening of psychosis, paresthesia, status epilepticus, and obsessive compulsive symptoms. Similar to other antipsychotics clozapine rarely has been known to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome.rxlist.com / Clozapine side effects

===Urinary incontinence===

Clozapine is linked to urinary incontinence[tpl]cite pmid | 22122392 [/tpl] though its appearance may be under-recognized.[tpl]cite pmid | 22215862[/tpl]

===Withdrawal effects===

Abrupt withdrawal may lead to cholinergic rebound effects, severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers are aware of the symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = S. | last2 = Chengappa | first2 = KN. | last3 = Naidu | first3 = VR. | last4 = Baker | first4 = RW. | last5 = Parepally | first5 = H. | last6 = Schooler | first6 = NR. | title = Clozapine withdrawal-emergent dystonias and dyskinesias: a case series | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 9 | pages = 472–7 |date=Sep 1998 | doi =  10.4088/JCP.v59n0906| pmid = 9771818 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Szafrański | first1 = T. | last2 = Gmurkowski | first2 = K. | title = withdrawal.

===Weight gain and diabetes===

In addition to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wirshing DA, Wirshing WC, Kysar L, Berisford MA | year = 1999 | title = Novel antipsychotics: comparison of weight gain liabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 358–63 | pmid = 10401912 | doi=10.4088/JCP.v60n0602[/tpl] Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity have been shown to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

==Pharmacokinetics==

The absorption of clozapine is almost complete, but the oral bioavailability is only 60 to 70% due to first-pass metabolism. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food does not appear to affect the bioavailability of clozapine.
The elimination half-life of clozapine is about 14 hours at steady state conditions (varying with daily dose).
Clozapine is extensively metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites suitable for elimination in the urine and feces. The major metabolite, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well.  Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rostami-Hodjegan A, Amin AM, Spencer EP, Lennard MS, Tucker GT, Flanagan RJ | year = 2004 | title = Influence of dose, cigarette smoking, age, sex, and metabolic activity on plasma clozapine concentrations: a predictive model and nomograms to aid clozapine dose adjustment and to assess compliance in individual patients | url = | journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 70–8 | pmid = 14709950 | doi=10.1097/01.jcp.0000106221.36344.4d[/tpl]
Clozapine and norclozapine plasma levels may also be monitored, though they show a significant degree of variation and are higher in women and increase with age.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v60n0108 |author= Lane HY, Chang YC, Chang WH, Lin SK, Tseng YT, Jann MW.  |date=January 1999 |title=Effects of gender and age on plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites: analyzed by critical statistics |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=36–40 |pmid=10074876 |accessdate=2007-06-24[/tpl] Monitoring of plasma levels of clozapine and norclozapine has been shown to be useful in assessment of compliance, metabolic status, prevention of toxicity, and in dose optimization.

==History==

Clozapine was developed by Sandoz in 1961, and trials took place in 1972, when it was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crilly|first=John|year=2007|title=The history of clozapine and its emergence in the US market: a review and analysis|journal=History of Psychiatry|pmid=17580753|volume=18|issue=1|pages=39–60|doi=10.1177/0957154X07070335[/tpl] In 1975, after reports of agranulocytosis leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer.[tpl]cite book |author=Healy, David |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=238–42 |isbn=0-674-01599-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C[/tpl] Clozapine fell out of favor for more than a decade.
