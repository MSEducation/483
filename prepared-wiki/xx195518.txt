Before I'm Over You is the second studio album by American country singer, Loretta Lynn.
Before I'm Over You was released in 1964 on Decca Records. The album was the second album of Lynn's and consisted of 12 previously unrecorded tracks. The album released two singles, "Before I'm Over You" and "Wine, Women, and Song", both of which reached the Top 10 in 1964, jumpstarting Lynn's career for her breakthrough in 1967. Like most Country albums of the time, this album included cover versions of hits by other artists, including "Loose Talk" and "The End of the World". The album includes two of Lynn's own compositions, including "This Haunted House", which Lynn wrote as a tribute to friend and Country singer, Patsy Cline, who died the previous year in a plane crash.
The album peaked at #11 on the Top Country Albums chart in 1964.
