[[Phenylacetylene]]

CATEGORIES: Alkynes

Phenylacetylene is an alkyne hydrocarbon containing a phenyl group. It exists as a colorless, viscous liquid. In research, it is sometimes used as an analog for acetylene; being a liquid, it is easier to handle than acetylene gas.

==Preparation==

In the laboratory, phenylacetylene can be prepared by elimination of hydrogen bromide from styrene dibromide using sodium amide in ammonia:[tpl]OrgSynth | prep = cv4p0763 | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 763 | year = 1963 | title = Phenylacetylene | author = Kenneth N. Campbell and Barbara K. Campbell[/tpl]
It can also be prepared by the elimination of hydrogen bromide from bromostyrene using molten potassium hydroxide.[tpl]OrgSynth | prep = cv1p0438 | title = Phenylacetylene | author = John C. Hessler | year = 1941 | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 438[/tpl]
