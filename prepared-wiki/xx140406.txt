The Vermont Studio Center (VSC) is a non-profit organization located in the town of Johnson in the U.S. state of Vermont. VSC conducts the largest fine arts and writing residency program in the U.S., with a significant population of international artists in residency.  The center operates one- to three-month residencies, with 52 fine artists and writers in the residency program at a time. The programs are highly selective and include a broad variety of media, cultures, and ages. The center was founded in 1984 by Jonathan Gregg, Frederick Osborne, and Louise Von Weise. In January 2007, George Pearlman succeeded Jonathan Gregg as VSC's Executive Director. Though there is no denominational affiliation, the center offers a meditation and yoga component.

==Intercultural emphasis==

The center attracts residents from more than 40 countries and all of the U.S. states. VSC fellowships emphasize intercultural exchange, and are organized around the following cultural programs: The Triangle Arts Trust Africa/Arab World; The Freeman Foundation Asian Artists; Central America; ArtNexus Latin America Artist Award; Reed Foundation Caribbean Basin Fellowships; and CEC ArtsLink Central Europe, Russia and Eurasia. Specific international fellowships focus upon Ireland, Italy, and Mexico.

==Visiting artists, visiting writers==

More than 75 visiting artists and writers visit the center each month (approximately 700 per year). They include established writers, painters, printmakers, and sculptors. Visiting artists interact with residents on a daily basis through readings, slide presentations and one-on-one studio visits and writing conferences.

==The campus==

The campus consists of thirty studio and residence buildings clustered along the Gihon River in the village of Johnson. Several of the buildings date to the nineteenth century and their restoration have won awards from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Preservation Trust of Vermont. 
The Vermont Studio Center's residencies and fellowships are non-degree granting, however work in both fine arts and writing can be granted credit towards an M.F.A. through Johnson State College, located a short walk from the center.
