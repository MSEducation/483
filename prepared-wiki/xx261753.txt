On 26 July 1923 he married Leila, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Seely, of Ramsdale Park, Nottinghamshire, and they had four daughters, Sarah Elizma (1924–1937), Gian Katherine (1927–1929), Rachel Leila (born 1929), and Tessa Mary (born 1934). 
In 1931 he became Managing Director of Lazard Brothers & Co. During the Second World War he served as Chief Executive Officer on the British side of the Combined Production and Resources Board, from 1942 to 1944, then from 1944 to 1945 was Chairman of Supplies for Liberated Areas Official Committee. He was appointed CMG in 1943, and in 1953 and 1954 was Chairman of the Issuing Houses Association. He succeeded to his father's titles in 1958 and in 1965 became Chairman of Lazards.  
After Hampden's death on 17 October 1965 his brother David succeeded as Viscount Hampden, while his two surviving daughters were left as co-heiresses to the Barony of Dacre, which thus went into abeyance. However, the abeyance was terminated in 1970 in favour of his daughter Rachel Douglas-Home, 27th Baroness Dacre (born 1929).
