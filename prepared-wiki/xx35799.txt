[[Melba Gully State Park]]

CATEGORIES: State parks of Victoria (Australia), Otway Ranges

The Melba Gully State Park was formed to protect a small pocket of natural rainforest in the Otway Ranges near Apollo Bay in Victoria (Australia). The 48 ha park was extremely valuable as much of the rest of the Ranges has been burnt out many times by bushfires. The park now forms part of the Great Otway National Park.
The park has few facilities due to its small size, but it has a picnic ground and basic picnic facilities, with the main attraction being the 35 minute Madsens Track Nature Walk.
