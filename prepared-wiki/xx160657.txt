Łucznik Arms Factory ([tpl]lang-pl|Fabryka Broni Łucznik[/tpl], also known as Fabryka Broni Radom or Zakłady Metalowe "Łucznik") is a Polish defence industry enterprise from Radom that produces firearms. The current name of the firm is Fabryka Broni "Łucznik" - Radom. The enterprise is a part of Bumar group.
In the past it used to produce non-military equipment, most notably sewing machines and typewriters, but those branches were deemed unprofitable and were dropped in 2000.

==History==

The company was originally founded in the Second Polish Republic to produce arms for the new Polish Army.
In 1925 the main building, steel hardening shop, power plant, boiler room, woodshop, bath, and the workers’ houses were erected. On December 31, 1927, production was launched when, by an act signed by then Director of the plant Msc.Eng. Kazimierz Ołdakowski, the plant was officially taken over from the local government and became part of the Państwowe Wytwórnie Uzbrojenia concern. Ołdakowski insisted that his workers receive free health care.  He also arranged for child care services and regular leisure time, and built gymnasiums, theaters, gardens, and housing for his workers.  It was under his directorship that the Vis pistol (pistolet wz. 35 Vis) was developed.
During World War II it was captured and operated by the Germans.
After World War II the factory was renamed: Zakłady Metalowe im. gen. "Waltera" (General Walter's Metal Works). In 1990 the factory returned to its old name Zakłady Metalowe "Łucznik" (Metal Works "Łucznik"), "łucznik" meaning 'archer' or alternatively 'Sagittarius'. It became a state-owned company (S.A.). On 13 November 2000 the company was declared bankrupt, however, on 30 June 2000 a company Fabryka Broni "Łucznik" - Radom (Arms Factory Łucznik - Radom) was created by ZM Łucznik and the Industry Development Agency, which took over arms production.Official page
