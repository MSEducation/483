Bus transport in Wellington is supplied by several different operators under the banner of Metlink. Buses serve almost every part of Wellington city, with most of them running along the "Golden Mile" from Wellington Railway Station to Courtenay Place. Most of the buses run on diesel, but nine routes use trolleybuses – the only remaining public system in Oceania.
Wellington lies at the southern end of the North Island Main Trunk Railway (NIMT) and the Wairarapa Line, converging on Wellington Railway Station at the northern end of central Wellington. Two long-distance services leave from Wellington: the Capital Connection, for commuters from Palmerston North, and the Northern Explorer to Auckland. 
Four electrified suburban lines radiate to the outer suburbs – the Johnsonville Line north to the northern suburbs; the Kapiti Line along the NIMT to Porirua and to Waikanae on the Kapiti Coast; the Melling Line to Lower Hutt via Petone, and the Hutt Valley Line along the Wairarapa Line via Waterloo and Taita to Upper Hutt. A diesel-hauled carriage service, the Wairarapa Connection, connects several times daily to Masterton in the Wairarapa via the [tpl]convert|8.8|km|adj=on[/tpl] long Rimutaka Tunnel.
Wellington is the North Island port for Cook Strait ferries to Picton in the South Island, provided by state-owned Interislander and private Bluebridge. Local ferries connect Wellington city centre with Eastbourne, Seatoun and Petone.
Wellington International Airport is [tpl]convert|6|km[/tpl] south-east of the city centre. It is serviced by flights from across New Zealand, and to Australia and the Pacific Islands. Flights to other international destinations require a transfer at another airport, as larger aircraft cannot use Wellington's short ([tpl]convert|2081|m|disp=or|adj=on[/tpl]) runway, which has become an issue in recent years in regards to the Wellington region's economic performance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Calls-for-Wellington-Airport-to-extend-runway/tabid/369/articleID/281961/Default.aspx |title=Calls for Wellington Airport to extend runway |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=53371 |title=Scoop - Upper Hutt wants a longer runway at Wellington Airport, for flights to Asia |publisher=Wellington.scoop.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl] The airport is the base for Wellington Aero Club, a private not-for-profit flight school.

===Electric power===

The maximum electricity demand is forecast to grow on average by 1.4% annually over the next 15 years, from 756 MW in 2012 to 934 MW by 2027, slightly lower than the national average demand growth of 1.7% per annum. The largest source of generation in the region is Meridian Energy's West Wind wind farm, with a maximum output of 143 MW.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411415/642358|title=Makara wind farm gets the go ahead |publisher= Television New Zealand|date=21 December 2005|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl] It is a few kilometres west of Wellington's central business district, on Quartz Hill and Terawhiti Station.[tpl]cite news|title= Wind farm begins to power national grid|work=The New Zealand Herald|date = 30 April 2009|accessdate=29 July 2009|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/electricity/news/article.cfm?c_id=187&objectid=10569481[/tpl] There are some other small generators in the region, but the total peak generation is only 165 MW.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz/f4689,69348771/Chapter_14_Wellington_Region.pdf |title=Annual Planning Report 2012 - Chapter 14: Wellington Region| publisher=Transpower |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Peak demand greatly exceeds local generation, and power supply is highly dependent on the National Grid operated by Transpower.  Four 220 kV transmission circuits from Bunnythorpe, near Palmerston North, provide the main connections with the national grid.  The region is also supplied by the  North Island terminal of the HVDC link at Haywards substation, on State Highway 58 above the Hutt Valley.  A major upgrade of the HVDC link  commissioned in 2013 increased the capacity of the link from 700 MW to 1,000 MW from 2012, and 1,200 MW from 2014.
The local power distribution network is owned and managed by Wellington Electricity.
The main power supplies to the central business district come from Transpower grid exit point substations at Central Park and Wilton.  The Central Park substation is the largest grid exit point in the region, with a peak demand of over 170 MW (forecast to grow to 200 MW by 2020).  There are constraints and limitations with this substation, and alternative investment solutions are being developed to improve security of supply.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.welectricity.co.nz/disclosures/Pages/Information%20Disclosure/2012%20Asset%20Management%20Plan.aspx|title= 2012 Asset Management Plan |publisher=Wellington Electricity |accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Strong winds, advantageous for wind farms, sometimes damage power lines. In May 2009, one windstorm left about 2500 residents without power for a several hours.[tpl]cite news| work=The New Zealand Herald| date = 15 May 2009|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wellington-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=153&objectid=10572504|title = High winds cause power outages in Wellington|accessdate =29 July 2009[/tpl] Lightning strikes and occasional faults in the electric power system sometimes cause power outages.[tpl]cite news|title= Lightning blamed for Wellington blackout, gales on way|work=The New Zealand Herald|date = 14 March 2007|accessdate=29 July 2009|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/waikanae/news/article.cfm?l_id=522&objectid=10428709[/tpl]
