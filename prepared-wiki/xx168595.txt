Maryland Route 47 (MD 47) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Barrelville Road, the state highway runs [tpl]convert|1.67|mi|km[/tpl] from MD 36 in Barrelville north to the Pennsylvania state line, where the highway continues north as Pennsylvania Route 160 (PA 160).  While it is a minor route today, MD 47 was once part of the main highway between Cumberland and Somerset, Pennsylvania.  The state highway was constructed in its modern form in the early 1920s.

==Route description==

MD 47 begins at an intersection with MD 36 (Mount Savage Road) in Barrelville.  The state highway heads north as a two-lane road through the valley of the North Branch of Jennings Run, which the highway crosses three times before reaching its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line.  The highway continues north as PA 160 (Cumberland Highway), which passes through Wellersburg shortly after crossing the border.

==History==

MD 47 is part of what was once the most direct route between Cumberland and Somerset.  A road has existed along the alignment of the present state highway since at least 1804.  By 1832, there was an effort to organize a turnpike company to connect Cumberland with the Somerset and Cumberland Turnpike at the state line.  The modern MD 47 was paved by 1921.  At least two of the bridges over the North Branch of Jennings Run were built in 1923.  In 2012, the route was realigned at a bridge over the North Branch of Jennings Run.
