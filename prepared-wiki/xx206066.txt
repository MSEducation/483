Theodorus of Asine ([tpl]lang-el|Θεόδωρος Ἀσιναῖος[/tpl]; fl. 3rd–4th centuryTrevor Curnow, (2006), The philosophers of the ancient world: an A to Z guide, page 263) was a Neoplatonist philosopher, and a native of one of the towns which bore the name of Asine, probably Asine in Laconia.
He was a disciple of Porphyry, and one of the most eminent of the Neoplatonists. Proclus repeatedly mentions him in his commentaries on Plato, and frequently adds to his name some laudatory epithet,"the great," "the admirable," "the noble." He wrote a work on the soul, now lost. It is cited by Nemesius of Emesa in his De Natura Hominis.
