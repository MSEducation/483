[[Digital sundial]]

CATEGORIES: Sundials

A digital sundial is a clock that indicates the current time with numerals formed by the sunlight striking it. Like a classical sundial, the  device is purely passive and contains no moving  parts. It uses no electricity nor other artificial sources of energy. 
The digital display changes as the sun advances in its daily course.

==Technique==

There are two basic types of digital sundials. One construction uses optical waveguides, while the other is inspired by fractal geometry.

===Optical fiber sundial===

Sunlight enters into the device through a slit and moves as the sun advances. The sun's rays shine on ten linearly distributed sockets of optical waveguides that transport the light to a seven-segment display. Each socket fiber is connected to a few segments forming the digit corresponding to the position of the sun.US patent belongs to HinesLab Inc. (USA)

===Fractal sundial===

The theoretical basis for the other construction comes from fractal geometry.[ref]

====Theorem====

such that 

====Application====

Theoretically, it is possible to build a set of masks that produce shadows in the form of digits, such that the display changes as the sun moves. This is the fractal sundial.
The theorem was proved in 1987 by Kenneth Falconer. Four years later it was described in Scientific American by Ian Stewart.Ian Stewart, Scientific American, 1991, pages 104-106, Mathematical Recreations -- What in heaven is a digital sundial?. The first prototype of the device was constructed in 1994.  In 1998 for the first time a fractal sundial was installed in a public place (Genk, Belgium).Sundial park in Genk, Belgium There exist window and tabletop versions as well.US and German patent belongs to Digital Sundials International
