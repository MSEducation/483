Roseville Area Middle School (RAMS) is in the Roseville Area School District (ISD 623). It is located on E. County Rd B2 in Little Canada, Minnesota.

==General information==

Roseville Area Middle School has around 800 students. The student body consists of two grades, seventh and eighth. Each grade is divided up into "teams" (each with 5 classrooms and a variety of other rooms) with seventh graders on Pegasus, Supernova or Cosmos team and eighth graders on Red Giant, Aquarius, or Dorado.
The RAMS campus was originally home to Frank B. Kellogg High School. Kellogg High School merged with Alexander Ramsey High School in 1986 to form Roseville Area High School and the Kellogg site was converted into a middle school.

Each year the theater program produces three shows: a fall show, a winter musical, and a spring show. The theater program also produces an improv class that occurs in the fall and spring. The theater was remodeled in the summer of 2006. The remodeling included new curtains, seats, a paint job and a new lighting booth.
