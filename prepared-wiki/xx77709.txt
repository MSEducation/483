Trinoda necessitas ("three-knotted obligation" [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-198-64224-5 | last = Souter | first = Alexander | title = Oxford Latin Dictionary|date=1968[/tpl] in Latin) is a term used to refer to a "threefold tax" in Anglo-Saxon times. Subjects of an Anglo-Saxon king were required to yield three services: bridge-bote (repairing bridges and roads), burgh-bote (building and maintaining fortifications), and fyrd-bote (serving in the militia, known as the fyrd). Rulers very rarely exempted subjects from the trinoda necessitas, because these services were the lifeblood of an Anglo-Saxon kingdom.[tpl]Cite book | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | isbn = 0-631-22492-0 | last = Lapidge | first = Michael | coauthors = John Blair, Simon Keynes, Donald Scragg | title = The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England | pages = 456–457 | date = 2000-11-15 [/tpl][tpl]Cite book | edition = 3 | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | isbn = 0-19-280139-2 | last = Stenton | first = Frank M.  | title = Anglo-Saxon England: Reissue with a new cover | page = 289 | date = 2001-09-20 [/tpl] After the Norman Conquest, exemptions from the trinoda necessitas became more common.
The term "trinoda necessitas" was rarely used in Anglo-Saxon times: its only known use is in a grant of land near Pagham, Sussex from King Cædwalla of Wessex to Saint Wilfred.[tpl]cite journal|journal=The English Historical Review|title=Trinoda Necessitas|volume=29|issue=66|date=October 1914|first=W.H.|last=Stevenson[/tpl] The Wilfred grant used the term trimoda (Latin for "triple"); trinoda (Latin for "triple-knotted") was an error introduced by John Selden in 1610.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|article=Trinoda Necessitas|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1911[/tpl]
Instead of the term "trinoda necessitas", it was common for Anglo-Saxon land grants to spell out the three obligations individually. For example, the land grant of Æthelberht of Kent to a thegn in 858 was free of obligation, except explicitly for military service, bridge repair, and fortification.[tpl]cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Military Obligations on the Eve of the Norman Conquest|first=C.
