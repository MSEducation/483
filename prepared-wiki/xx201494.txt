The school's representative on the inaugural meeting of the Football Association was G.W. Shillingford. He, along with his colleagues from the other Blackheath based teams at the meeting, favoured a form of football allowing "hacking" and handling of the ball, similar to rugby; when this was rejected by the majority of the teams as they attempted to formulate one agreed set of rules, no-one from Perceval House was represented at the fifth meeting of the F.A. in December 1863 and nothing further was heard from them.[tpl]cite web |last=Curry|first=Graham|title=Football - A Study in Diffusion |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/7821/1/391137.pdf |publisher= University of Leicester|pages=80–89|format=PDF|date=May 2001|accessdate=4 March 2011[/tpl]
