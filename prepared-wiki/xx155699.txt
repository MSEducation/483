Have Heart was a straight-edge hardcore band, formed in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 2002. The band recorded a demo that was released in 2003. In 2004, they released the What Counts EP (Think Fast! Records), with their debut full-length, The Things We Carry (Bridge Nine Records) arriving in 2006. Their latest full-length, Songs To Scream At The Sun (Bridge Nine Records), has garnered much critical acclaim from hardcore critics and fans alike, winning 'album of the year' from many Hardcore-oriented websites. 
Have Heart's lyrics cover a variety of subjects from the hardcore scene to a much larger scale. Many topics include self-image and its transition to popular media, the Straight Edge lifestyle, self-control and respect, pacifism, pressure (especially youth pressure), perseverance, self-destruction, friendship, and family. Such lyrical themes have allowed Have Heart to have a commanding force in at least the positive hardcore scene, and even the scene as a whole.  

==History==

Part of the resurgent Boston hardcore scene, Have Heart formed in 2002 around the core lineup of singer Patrick Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, and bassist Ryan Briggs. Hailing from the coastal town of New Bedford, the trio moved to Boston after graduating high school. Initially working with a revolving lineup of local musicians, the band played their first show in July 2003, and in November, their debut demo was released. The demo came to the attention of Think Fast! Records, who signed them for the release of the What Counts EP in 2004. The EP showcased long-time guitarist Ben Kelley and drummer Justin Paling.
In 2005, Have Heart moved to the estimable hardcore indie Bridge Nine Records and underwent a lineup change, with Kelley and Paling replaced by Kei Yasui and Shawn Costa, respectively.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thinkfastrecords.com/haveheart |title=Have Heart profile |publisher=thinkfastrecords.com |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] The following year they released The Things We Carry, their first full length.

===Disbandment===

On May 13, vocalist Patrick Flynn told the world that Have Heart was breaking up after they completed their scheduled world tour, posting a bulletin on the group's Myspace account:
 "Once the Fall rolls around, we can't really do this band the way we would prefer to anymore. Knowing this deadline of ours and having a whole world tour already booked, we'd like to take advantage of the chance to say goodbye to all the people we have met around the world over the years.
 So, please come check us out in the remaining months on our little trip around the globe. So far Asia has been a wonderful experience and we're very happy to have had the chance to meet so many kind people and look forward to the rest of Asia.
We will be playing our last show on this year's National Edge Day on October 17, 2009 with a bunch of our friends bands and a sweet guest. It will be somewhere T accessible in the Boston area. It will also be a benefit for a women's shelter in New Bedford, MA, run by my kind mother.
It's been a nice 7 years and we'd like to thank all the unique hardcore kids and bands we have encountered. We have met so many wonderful people who we'll just never forget.
It's been so great. Take care and hope to see you over the next couple months."
The bulletin received over 400 comments from fans after it was posted.
Have Heart's final tour covered every major continent (except Antarctica) with fellow band Shipwreck. However, due to a family crisis, Flynn was absent on the first week, of shows in the European tour. In this time, Sam Yarmuth from Triple B Records filled in for Flynn, and he rejoined the tour on July 3 In Wiesbaden, Germany. On May 13, Have Heart announced after finishing their world tour and doing a final show on October 17, 2009 for National Edge Day in Massachusetts, they will split.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34906 |title=Have Heart announce final show with Bane, Shipwreck a.d. |date=August 22, 2009 |publisher=punknews.org |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]
On July 25, 2009, Pat Flynn told the audience during their set on Moshvalleyfest in Belgium that they might release a last EP later that year. However, this plan was scratched.
Bridge Nine Records posthumously released a live recording of Have Heart's final show, titled 10.17.09, on November 23, 2010.
