Moxie is a carbonated beverage that was an early example of mass-produced soft drinks in the United States. It continues to be regionally popular today.
Moxie's flavor is unique, as it is not as sweet as most modern soft drinks and is described by some as "bitter." Moxie is flavored with gentian root extract, an extremely bitter substance which was reputed to possess medicinal properties.
Moxie is closely associated with the state of Maine and was designated the official soft drink of Maine on May 10, 2005.State Symbols, maine.gov. Its creator, Dr. Augustin Thompson, was born in Union, Maine, but Moxie was invented and first produced in Lowell, Massachusetts."Moxie Soda, Created in Lowell, Massachusetts | Lowell.com"

==History==

Moxie originated as a patent medicine called "Moxie Nerve Food," which was created around 1876 by Dr. Augustin Thompson in Lowell, Massachusetts.Moxie Soda, Created in Lowell, Massachusetts | Lowell.com. Thompson claimed that it contained an extract from a rare, unnamed South American plant, which had supposedly been discovered by a friend of his, Lieutenant Moxie,Mark Pendergrast: For God, Country and Coca-Cola, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1993, ISBN 978-0-465-05468-8 who had used it as a panacea. Moxie, he claimed, was especially effective against "paralysis, softening of the brain, nervousness, and insomnia."
After a few years, Thompson added soda water to the formula and changed the product's name to "Beverage Moxie Nerve Food." By 1884 he was selling Moxie both in bottles and in bulk as a soda fountain syrup. He marketed it as "a delicious blend of bitter and sweet, a drink to satisfy everyone's taste."[ref]

A lawsuit was filed in 1907 by the Moxie Nerve Food Company of New England against the Modox Company and others, alleging that they had copied the ingredients of Moxie and were using the name "Modox,"Modox drink website which closely resembled "Moxie," and were infringing upon patents and trademarks."Moxie Nerve Food Company of New England v. Modox Co. et al. : Circuit Court, District of Rhode Island, February 20, 1907", The Federal Reporter, v.151-152, 1907, pp.493-509. The suit was dismissed by the judge, who said the court could not protect the legitimate part of the plaintiff's business in this case. In a later case in New York, the Moxie Nerve Food Company won a lawsuit against Modox, which subsequently went out of business.
President Calvin Coolidge was known to favor the drink, and Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams endorsed it on radio and in print. The company also marketed a beverage called "Ted's Root Beer" in the early sixties. Author E. B. White once claimed that “Moxie contains gentian root, which is the path to the good life.”[ref]
</ref> Currently, one of the ingredients of Moxie is “Gentian Root Extractives,” which may contribute to the drink's unique flavor.<ref name="Moxie4">[http://www.bdragon.com/moxie/moxie.shtml "Moxie For Mine: More About Moxie the Drink"]</ref>
The brand suffered a significant decline in sales during the 1930s, which is thought to have been caused by the company's decision to expand its sugar reserves at the expense of its popular advertising campaign.
The Catawissa Bottling Company in Catawissa, Pennsylvania, is one of six bottlers in the United States that produce Moxie. Catawissa has produced it since 1945. Polar Beverages also bottles Moxie in Worcester, Massachusetts.[tpl]Citation |title=Polar Bev Partner Products | url=http://www.polarbev.com/PRODUCTS/PolarPartnerProducts/tabid/62/Default.aspx | accessdate = 2011-08-18[/tpl]

===Since 1962===

Sugar-free Diet Moxie was introduced in 1962, about the same time that Mad magazine began placing the Moxie logo in the background of its articles to increase public awareness of it. As a result of Mad ’s efforts, sales of the soft drink increased 10%;[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] this led to the "Mad About Moxie" campaign.[tpl]cite book|title=Dun's Review|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KL8SAQAAMAAJ|date=January 1968|publisher=Dun and Bradstreet|page=56[/tpl]
The Moxie brand  was purchased in 1966 by the Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta. In 2007 Monarch sold it to its current owner, Cornucopia Beverages of Bedford, New Hampshire,
which is owned by the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England, a subsidiary of the Kirin Brewery Company, based in Tokyo.[ref]

In its decision to step up efforts to distribute the product, Cornucopia cited increasing requests for Moxie from fans across the country. In 2007 it launched pilot sales in Florida and in 2010 granted distribution in Florida to Florida Micro Beverage Distributors."Florida is getting some Moxie", AP via boston.com, December 8, 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-08.
In 2011 Cornucopia created the Moxie Beverage Company to market Moxie and Moxie-branded products. A website, DrinkMoxie.com, was created to promote Moxie. Drink recipes using Moxie  were created.
Demand for Moxie has waned in recent years, although the brand persists in New England and Pennsylvania.

==Advertising==

Through extensive advertising, the neologism "moxie" has entered popular American usage with the meaning "courage, daring, or spirit,"The Chambers Dictionary, 1993, ISBN 0-550-10255-8http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moxie Defined in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. as in "This guy's got moxie!"
In its advertising, Moxie used “Make Mine Moxie!” advertising jingles, the slogan “Just Make It Moxie for Mine,” and a “Moxie Man” logo. The Moxie Man had appeared on Moxie labels since the beverage was first sold. But in 2010 the Moxie Man logo was removed from labels because it was thought to be too old-fashioned. In 2011 the company's head of marketing, Ryan Savage, made the executive decision to bring the logo back in response to complaints from long-standing customers.https://sites.google.com/site/historyofmoxie/
A unique advertising tool was the Moxie Horsemobile, a modified automobile whose driver sat on a large model of a horse. The first Horsemobiles were deployed around 1918.  A 1935 Rolls-Royce Moxie Horsemobile was sold for $55,000 at the May 20, 2011, Mecum Auction in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Moxie at one time maintained about two dozen of them, and they appeared in parades and other public functions.
