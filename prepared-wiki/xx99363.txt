He works closely with the 2009 Formula One World Champion Jenson Button, Button's team-mate at McLaren Kevin Magnussen, McLaren Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ron Dennis and the McLaren Formula One team's Racing Director and Sporting Director, Eric Boullier and Sam Michael.

He took on the editorship of F1 Racing in December 1996 and left it in December 2007, by which time F1 Racing had become the world's best-selling grand prix magazine, according to its own strap-line which appears on its front cover every month.
Bishop introduced a series of celebrity columnists to F1 Racing, including Murray Walker, Damon Hill, Jenson Button and many more.
Bishop is known in Formula One circles as 'The Bish' [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] and is known for his larger-than-life wardrobe that includes a seemingly limitless number of very garish shirts.
Bishop's journalism was published in F1 Racing and Autosport.com, for which he used to write a famously trenchant fortnightly column entitled 'From the Pulpit'.[tpl]cite news|first=Biranit|last=Goren|title=McLaren appoint Bishop as head of PR |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/62731 |work=autosport.com |publisher=Haymarket |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007[/tpl]
