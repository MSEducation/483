The Capt. William Hallett House is a historic house at 570 Main Street in the Hyannis village of Barnstable, Massachusetts, USA.  This 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built c. 1800, and exhibits a distinctive combination of Federal and Queen Anne styling.  While its basic form is that of a Federal-style Cape, it was altered in the late 19th century, adding a shed-roof dormer with an eyebrow section, a porch with turned posts, and a projecting window bay.  In the mid-19th century the house belonged to William Hallett, a ship's captain, and around the turn of the 20th century by Dr. Charles Harris, a noted local physician and author of Hyannis Sea Captains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BRN.633|title=MACRIS inventory record for Capt.
