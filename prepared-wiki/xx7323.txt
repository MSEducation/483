In propositional logic, modus tollensUniversity of North Carolina, Philosophy Department, Logic Glossary. Accessdate on 31 October 2007.Copi and CohenHurleyMoore and Parker (or modus tollendo tollens and also denying the consequent)Sanford, David Hawley. 2003. If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning. London, UK: Routledge: 39 "Modus tollens is always an abbreviation for modus tollendo tollens, the mood that by denying denies." (Latin for "the way that denies by denying")Stone, Jon R. 1996. Latin for the Illiterati: Exorcizing the Ghosts of a Dead Language. London, UK: Routledge: 60. is a valid argument form and a rule of inference.
The first to explicitly state the argument form modus tollens were the Stoics."Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Ancient Logic: The Stoics"
The modus tollens rule can be stated formally as:
Modus tollens is closely related to modus ponens. There are two similar, but invalid, forms of argument: affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent.

==Formal notation==

The modus tollens rule may be written in sequent notation:
or as the statement of a functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:
or including assumptions:
though since the rule does not change the set of assumptions, this is not strictly necessary.
More complex rewritings involving modus tollens are often seen, for instance in set theory:
("P is a subset of Q. x is not in Q. Therefore, x is not in P.")
Also in first-order predicate logic:
("For all x if x is P then x is Q. There exists some x that is not Q. Therefore, there exists some x that is not P.")
Strictly speaking these are not instances of modus tollens, but they may be derived using modus tollens using a few extra steps.

==Explanation==

The argument has two premises. The first premise is a conditional or "if-then" statement, for example that if P then Q. The second premise is that it is not the case that Q . From these two premises, it can be logically concluded that it is not the case that P.
Consider an example:
Supposing that the premises are both true (the dog will bark if it detects an intruder, and does indeed not bark), it follows that no intruder has been detected. This is a valid argument since it is not possible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. (It is conceivable that there may have been an intruder that the dog did not detect, but that does not invalidate the argument; the first premise is "if the watch-dog detects an intruder." The thing of importance is that the dog detects or doesn't detect an intruder, not if there is one.)
Another example:

==Relation to modus ponens==

Every use of modus tollens can be converted to a use of modus ponens and one use of transposition to the premise which is a material implication. For example:
Likewise, every use of modus ponens can be converted to a use of modus tollens and transposition.

==Justification via truth table==

The validity of modus tollens can be clearly demonstrated through a truth table.
In instances of modus tollens we assume as premises that p → q is true and q is false. There is only one line of the truth table—the fourth line—which satisfies these two conditions. In this line, p is false. Therefore, in every instance in which p → q is true and q is false, p must also be false.

===Via Disjunctive syllogism===

===Via Reductio ad absurdum===
