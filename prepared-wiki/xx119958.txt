==Bankruptcy==

In July 2008, SemGroup ran into liquidity problems and warned that it may have to file for bankruptcy as part of a financial restructuring. Adding to SemGroup's troubles, hedge funds run by Alerian Capital Management and Elliot Associates exercised the terms of a secured loan made to SemGroup and took over the general partnership interest in SemGroup Energy Partners LP. On July 22, 2008, Semgroup, LP filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.forbes.com "Did Goldman Goose Oil?" - March 25, 2009 [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]  The company listed both debts and assets of more than $1 billion.
New York billionaire John Catsimatidis then became engaged in efforts to take over SemGroup, and he gained control over a majority of the company's management committee. He was met by opposition from the company's existing management, who argued for selling off at least some of the company's assets, while Catsimatidis stated his intention to keep the company together.Rod Walton, "Business brawler?" Tulsa World, January 25, 2009.  On February 11, 2009 Catsimatidis was sued by a group of SemGroup executives, seeking removal of Catsimatidis and his allies from the committee."SemGroup executives sue Catsimatidis; SemGroup Energy Partners also warns of asphalt meltdown", Tulsa World, February 11, 2009.  In turn, the company and its unsecured creditors committee sued former CEO Tom Kivisto and former CFO Gregory C. Wallace, seeking return of $362 million that they claim the defendants used for their own transactions and benefits.Rod Walton, "Kivisto is sued over use of funds: A lawsuit says he used SemGroup funds for his own oil trading," Tulsa World, February 19, 2009.
In April, 2009, former FBI director Louis Freeh released a report on the circumstances surrounding the SemGroup bankruptcy.http://www.tulsaworld.com//webextra/content/items/SemGroupExaminerReport.pdf
In July, Catsimatidis and the company reached a settlement, pursuant to which Catsimatidis acquired a piece of SemGroup's asphalt business and dropped his competing plan for the company's proposed reorganization.Rod Walton, "SemGroup suitor drops out: The colorful New York billionaire settles for asphalt assets", Tulsa World, July 21, 2009."Catsimatidis to support SemGroup reorganization", Reuters, July 20, 2009.

==Recovery==

On December 1, 2009, SemGroup exited bankruptcy under a new corporate structure, eliminating its master limited partnership and becoming a publicly traded company focused on asphalt manufacture and marketing and on oil and natural gas storage and transport, with about 140 employees in Tulsa and 1,000 overall.Rod Walton, "SemGroup exits Chapter 11", Tulsa World, December 1, 2009.  On the same day, the former SemGroup Energy Partners LP adopted a new name, Blueknight Energy Partners LP; Blueknight is now separate in ownership and assets (although sharing a pipeline system with SemGroup).Rod Walton, "Blueknight steps to center stage: The heir to the Tulsa energy company sheds its former name", Tulsa World, December 2, 2009.
SemGroup Corporation's common stock ([tpl]NYSE|SEMG[/tpl]) was listed on the New York Stock Exchange as of November 11, 2010,Rod Walton, "SemGroup debuts on NYSE", Tulsa World, November 12, 2010. and two of its representatives were invited to ring the NYSE opening bell on December 17, 2010,Rod Walton, "SemGroup duo ring NYSE opening bell", Tulsa World, December 17, 2010. as the company assumed what a Wall Street Journal reporter described as "a new identity as a conservative middleman to the Midwestern oil and gas industry."Brian Baskin, "SemGroup Works to Turn It Around: After a Disastrous Bet and a Bankruptcy Stay, Firm Tries to Forge New Identity", The Wall Street Journal, December 20, 2010.  
Meanwhile, global oil trader Vitol Group took control of Blueknight (the former SemGroup Energy Partners LP). In  October 2010, Vitol made a deal to add Charlesbank Capital Partners as a second general partner; this led to public charges, by an investment fund associated with billionaire Michael Dell, that the transaction was improper self-dealing intended to take money from Blueknight's existing limited partners.  Vitol denied these charges.Shira Ovide, "Michael Dell’s Investment Firm Rails Against ‘Self-Dealing’ Energy Deal", The Wall Street Journal, December 17, 2010.Rod Walton, "Blueknight investor attacks restructuring deal", Tulsa World, December 21, 2010.
