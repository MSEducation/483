Ruhollah Mostafavi Moosavi Khomeini (Persian [tpl]nastaliq|روح الله خمینی[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-fa|ruːholˈlɑːhe  χomeiˈniː[/tpl], 24 September 1902 – 3 June 1989), was an Iranian religious leader and politician, and leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution which saw the overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution as the highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death.
Khomeini was a marja ("source of emulation") in Twelver Shi'a Islam, author of more than forty books, but is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the Shi'a Usuli theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult (clerical authority)" to include theocratic political rule by the Islamic jurists.

==Early life==

===Background===

The ancestors of Ruhollah Khomeini migrated from their original home in Nishapur, North-Eastern Iran, to the kingdom of Awadh, whose rulers were Twelver Shia Muslims of Persian origin.Sacred space and holy war: the politics, culture and history of Shi'ite Islam by Juan Ricardo ColeArt and culture: endeavours in interpretation by Ahsan Jan Qaisar, Som Prakash Verma, Mohammad Habib During their rule they extensively invited, and received, a steady stream of Persian scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters.Encyclopædia Iranica,, "Avadh", E. Yarshater The Khomeini family eventually settled in the small town of Kintoor, just outside of Lucknow, the capital.Ruhollah Khomeini's brief biography by Hamid AlgarFrom Khomein, A biography of the Ayatollah, 14 June 1999, The IranianThe Columbia world dictionary of Islamism by Olivier Roy, Antoine SfeirKhomeini: life of the Ayatollah, Volume 1999 by Baqer Moin Ayatollah Khomeini's paternal grandfather, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, was born in Kintoor and was a contemporary and relative of the famous scholar Ayatollah Syed Mir Hamid Hussain Musavi. He left Lucknow in 1830 on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Imam Ali in Najaf, Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and never returned. According to Moin, this migration was to escape from the spread of British power in India.[tpl]harvnb|Moin|2000|p=18[/tpl] In 1834 Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi visited Persia, and in 1839 he settled down at Khomein. Although he stayed and settled in Iran, he continued to be known as Hindi, indicating his stay in India, and Ruhollah Khomeini even used Hindi as a pen name in some of his ghazals. There are also claims that Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi was of Kashmiri origin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php |title=Historic Personalities of Iran: Ayatollah Khomeini |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05[/tpl]

===Childhood===

Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, whose name means "inspired of God", was born on 22 or 24 September 1902 in Khomeyn, Markazi Province. He was raised by his mother Hajieh Agha Khanum and aunt Sahebeth following the murder of his father Seyed Mostafa Hindi 5 months after his birth in 1903.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ayatollah-ruhollah-khomeini-13680544 |title=Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini Biography - Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl]
Ruhollah began to study the Qur'an and elementary Persian at the age of six.[tpl]harvnb|Reich|1990|p=311[/tpl] The following year, he began to attend a local school, where he learned religion, "noheh khani" and other traditional subjects. Throughout his childhood, he would continue his religious education with the assistance of his relatives, including his mother's cousin, Ja'far, and his elder brother, Morteza Pasandideh.[tpl]harvnb|Milani|1994|p=85[/tpl]

===Education and lecturing===

After World War I arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Esfahan, but he was attracted instead to the seminary in Arak. He was placed under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi.[tpl]harvnb|Moin|2000|p=22[/tpl] In 1920, Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies.[tpl]harvnb|Brumberg|2001|p=45[/tpl]. "By 1920, the year Khomeini moved to Arak..." The following year, Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred to the Islamic seminary at the holy city of Qom, southwest of Tehran, and invited his students to follow. Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved, and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom.[tpl]harvnb|Moin|2000|p=28[/tpl]. "Khomeini's madraseh in Qom was known as the Dar al-Shafa..." Khomeini's studies included Islamic law (sharia) and jurisprudence (fiqh), but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an interest in poetry and philosophy (irfan). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini sought the guidance of Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini would continue to pursue his interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and Rafi'i Qazvini.[tpl]harvnb|Moin|2000|p=42[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Brumberg|2001|p=46[/tpl] However, perhaps Khomeini's biggest influences were yet another teacher, Mirza Muhammad 'Ali Shahabadi,[tpl]harvnb|Rāhnamā|1994|pp=70–1[/tpl] and a variety of historic Sufi mystics, including Mulla Sadra and Ibn Arabi.
Khomeini studied Greek Philosophy and was influenced by both the philosophy of Aristotle, whom he regarded as the founder of logic,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=4250 |title=Philosophy as Viewed by Ruhollah Khomeini |publisher=Imamreza.net |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] and Plato, whose views "in the field of divinity" he regarded as "grave and solid".Kashful-Asrar, p. 33 by Ruhollah Khomeini ( Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra.
Apart from philosophy, Khomeini was also interested in literature and poetry. His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. His poetry works were published in three collections The Confidant, The Decanter of Love and Turning Point and Divan.[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] 
Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at Najaf and Qom seminaries for decades before he was known in the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar of Shia Islam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/khomeini_ayatollah.shtml |title=BBC – History – Ayatollah Khomeini (1900–1989) |publisher=BBC |date=4 June 1989 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] He taught political philosophy,[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] Islamic history and ethics. Several of his students (e.g. Morteza Motahhari) later became leading Islamic philosophers and also marja. As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics.[tpl]cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045329/Ruhollah-Khomeini |title=Ruhollah Khomeini – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] He showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and mysticism that not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often an object of hostility and suspicion.[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl]

===Political aspects===

His seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical social and political issues of the day, and he worked against secularism in the 1940s. His first book, Kashf al-Asrar (Uncovering of Secrets)[tpl]cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_works.html#answer_kashf_al-asrar |title=Kashf al-Asrar |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]Moin, Baqer, Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah (2001), p.60) published in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of Asrar-e hazar salih (Secrets of a Thousand Years), a tract written by a disciple of Iran's leading anti-clerical historian, Ahmad Kasravi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ruhollah-musavi-khomeini-ayatollah/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, Ayatullah |publisher=Bookrags.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] In addition, he went from Qom to Tehran to listen to Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris, the leader of the opposition majority in Iran's parliament during the 1920s. Khomeini became a marja in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi.

==Early political activity==

===Background===

Most Iranians had a deep respect for the Shi'a clergy or Ulama,Fischer, Michael M.J., Iran, From Religious Dispute to Revolution,  Michael M.J. Fischer, Harvard University Press, 1980 p.31 and tended to be religious, traditional, and alienated from the process of Westernization pursued by the Shah. In the late 19th century the clergy had shown themselves to be a powerful political force in Iran initiating the Tobacco Protest against a concession to a foreign (British) interest.
At the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although quiescent, Shi'ah religious leader; and Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962), an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer Reza Shah Pahlavi rose to power. Reza's son Mohammad Reza Shah, instituted a "White Revolution", which was a further challenge to the Ulama.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ruhollah-musavi-khomeini-ayatollah/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, Ayatollah |publisher=Bookrags.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]

===Opposition to the White Revolution===

In January 1963, the Shah announced the "White Revolution", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as "an attack on Islam").[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.
Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.
On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the infamous tyrant Yazid and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a "wretched, miserable man," and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/rkhomeini/ayatollah_khomeini.php |title= Moin, Khomeini |year= 2000 |page= 104[/tpl]
On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vakili Zad|first=Cyrus|title=Organization, Leadership and Revolution:  Religiously-Oriented Opposition in the  Iranian Revolution of 1978-1979|journal=Conflict Quarterly|date=Spring 1990|pages=5–25|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/viewFile/14889/15958|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 112. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August."A History of Iran" by Michael Axworthy[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]

===Opposition to capitulation===

On 26 October 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States. This time it was in response to the "capitulations" or diplomatic immunity granted by the Shah to American military personnel in Iran.Khomeini's speech against capitalism, IRIB World Service.Shirley, Know Thine Enemy (1997), p. 207.  The famous "capitulation" law (or "status-of-forces agreement") would allow members of the U.S. armed forces in Iran to be tried in their own military courts. Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his release, he was brought before Prime Minister Hasan Ali Mansur, who tried to convince Khomeini that he should apologize and drop his opposition to the government. Khomeini refused. In fury, Mansur slapped Khomeini's face.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920508-5,00.html |title=The Unknown Ayatullah Khomeini – TIME |publisher=Time.com |date=16 July 1979 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] Two weeks later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of the Fadayan-e Islam were later executed for the murder.

==Life in exile==

Khomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy Shia city of Najaf, Iraq. Initially he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he stayed in the city of Bursa hosted by a colonel in Turkish Military Intelligence named Ali Cetiner in his own residence.[tpl]cite news|last=Sciolino |first=Elaine |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D9153EF934A1575BC0A9669C8B63&sec=&pagewanted=all |title=nyt.com The People's Shah |work=New York Times |date=27 August 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] In October 1965, after less than a year, he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until 1978, when he was encouraged to leave by then-Vice President Saddam Hussein.(Iran and Iraq would fight a bitter eight-year war 1980–1988 only a year after the two reached power in 1979) By this time discontent with the Shah was becoming intense and Khomeini went to Neauphle-le-Château, suburb of Paris, France on a tourist visa. During this last four months of his exile he was courted by press and politicians.According to Alexandre de Marenches, chief of External Documentation and Counter-Espionnage Service (now known as the DGSE), the shah did not ask France to expel Khomeini for fear that the cleric should move to Syria or Libya. (source: Christine Ockrent et Alexandre de Marenches, Dans le secret des princes, Stock, 1986, ISBN 2-234-01879-X, p. 254)Some sources report that president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing sent Michel Poniatowski to Tehran to propose to the Shah the elimination of Khomeini. (source: Christine Ockrent et Alexandre de Marenches, Dans le secret des princes, Stock, 1986, ISBN 2-234-01879-X, p. 156, Ms Ockrent to Mr de Marenches: "... for instance, the mission of Mr Poniatowski to Tehran to propose to the Shah to eliminate Khomeini, then a refugee in France".)
By the late 1960s, Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (model for imitation) for "hundreds of thousands" of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia world.Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.246 While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the Iranian Constitution of 1906–1907 — as evidenced by his book Kashf al-Asrar – by the 1970s he had rejected the idea. In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously Islamic Government or Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist (Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih).
This was his most famous and influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):
A modified form of this wilayat al-faqih system was adopted after Khomeini and his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic's first "Guardian" or Supreme Leader. In the meantime, however, Khomeini was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah which he worked to build and strengthen over the next decade. In Iran, a number of actions of the Shah including his repression of opponents began to build opposition to his regime.
Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah as (for example) "... the Jewish agent, the American serpent whose head must be smashed with a stone",Khomeini on a cassette tape [source: Gozideh Payam-ha Imam Khomeini (Selections of Imam Khomeini's Messages), Tehran, 1979, (Taheri, The Spirit of Allah, (1985), p.193) became common items in the markets of Iran,Parviz Sabeti, head of SAVAK's 'anti-subversion unit', believed the number of cassettes "exceeded 100,000." (Taheri, The Spirit of Allah, (1985), p.193) helped to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. Aware of the importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformist and secular enemies of the Shah, despite his long-term ideological incompatibility with them.
After the 1977 death of Ali Shariati (an Islamic reformist and political revolutionary author/academic/philosopher who greatly popularized the Islamic revival among young educated Iranians), Khomeini became the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah. Adding to his mystique was the circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kadhem. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kadhem was said to have prophesied that "A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path".Mackay, Iranians (1996), p. 277; source: Quoted in Fouad Ajami, The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 25 In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini's face could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques.Taheri, The Spirit of Allah, p. 238, see also Harney, The Priest (1998) He was perceived by many Iranians as the spiritual, if not political, leader of revolt.
As protest grew so did his profile and importance. Although thousands of kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution, urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the regime.Harney, The Priest (1998), p.? During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the spiritual leader of the revolution.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 203

===Return to Iran===

Khomeini was not allowed to return to Iran during the Shah's reign (as he had been in exile). On 17 January 1979, the Shah did leave the country (ostensibly "on vacation"), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd estimated (by BBC) to be of up to five million people.[tpl]Cite journal |title= On This Day, 1 February. 1979: Exiled Ayatollah Khomeini returns to Iran |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/1/newsid_2521000/2521003.stm |ref= harv [/tpl]

Although revolutionaries were now in charge and Khomeini was their leader, some opposition groups claim that several secular and religious groups were unaware of Khomeini's plan for Islamic government by wilayat al-faqih, which involved rule by a marja' Islamic cleric.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/269799.stm |title=World: Middle East Analysis: The forces for change |publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 1999 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] They claim that this provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic did not include the post of supreme Islamic clerical ruler.Schirazi, Asghar, The Constitution of Iran, (Tauris, 1997) p.22-3[tpl]cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/khomeini_promises_kept.html#Islamic_Clerics |title=Khomeini's REVERSALS of Promises |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] The Islamic government was clearly defined by Khomeini in his book Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih (Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist) which was published while Khomeini was in exile in 1970, smuggled into Iran, and distributed to Khomeini's supporters. This book included Khomeini's notion of wilayat al-faqih (Governance of the Jurist) as well as the reasoning and in his view, the necessity of it in running an Islamic state.
Khomeini and his supporters worked to suppress some former allies and rewrote the proposed constitution. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting the closings were attacked.Moin Khomeini, (2000), p.219 Opposition groups such as the National Democratic Front and Muslim People's Republican Party were attacked and finally banned.Bakhash, Shaul, The Reign of the Ayatollahs, p.68-9 Through popular support, Khomeini supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats of the Assembly of ExpertsSchirazi, Constitution of Iran Tauris, 1997 p.22-3 which revised the proposed constitution. The newly proposed constitution included an Islamic jurist Supreme Leader of the country, and a Council of Guardians to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic.

===Hostage crisis===

On 22 October 1979, the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. In Iran, there was an immediate outcry, with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. Revolutionaries were reminded of Operation Ajax, 26 years earlier, when the Shah fled abroad while American CIA and British intelligence organized a coup d'état to overthrow his nationalist opponent.
On 4 November, Iranian students calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days – an event known as the Iran hostage crisis. In 2005, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president, several of the hostages identified him as one of their captors, however this claim has been denied by a CIA investigation on the matter.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-08-12/us/cia.iranpresident_1_embassy-takeover-hostage-iranian-president?_s=PM:US | work=CNN | title=Iran swears in new president | date=6 August 2005[/tpl] In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of international law and aroused intense anger and anti-Iranian sentiments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2008/09/iran-ahmadinejad-government |title="Inside Iran", Maziar Bahari, Published 11 September 2008 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]Bowden, Mark, Guests of the Ayatollah, Atlantic Monthly Press, (2006)
In Iran, the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini under the slogan "America can't do a damn thing against us."p.105, Reading Lolita in Tehran : a Memoir in Books by Azar Nafisi The seizure of the embassy of a country he called the "Great Satan" helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: "This action has many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections."Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.228 The new constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month after the hostage crisis began."
The crisis had the effect of splitting of the opposition into two groups – radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates opposing it.Example of anti-theocratic support for the hostage crisis in Nafisi, Azar, Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books, Random House, 2003, p.105-6, 112 On 23 February 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran's Majlis would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a "Den of Espionage", publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.

===Relationship with Islamic and non-aligned countries===

Khomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity and the export of his revolution throughout the world. "Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution."(Resalat, 25 March 1988) (quoted on p.69, The Constitution of Iran by Asghar Schirazi, Tauris, 1997 He declared the birth week of Muhammad (the week between 12th to 17th of Rabi' al-awwal) as the Unity week. Then he declared the last Friday of Ramadan as International Day of Quds in 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/iran-s-unfinished-crisis |title=Iran's unfinished crisis Nazenin Ansari, 16–09–2009 |publisher=Opendemocracy.net |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]

===Iran-Iraq War===

Shortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions across the Muslim world, including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,1980 April 8 – Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein and his regime. Al-Dawa al-Islamiya party in Iraqi is the hoped for catalyst to start rebellion. From: Mackey, The Iranians, (1996), p.317 the one large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time Saddam Hussein, Iraq's secular Arab nationalist Ba'athist leader, was eager to take advantage of Iran's weakened military and (what he assumed was) revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran's adjacent oil-rich province of Khuzestan, and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country.
In September 1980, Iraq launched a full scale invasion of Iran, starting what would become the eight-year-long Iran–Iraq War (September 1980 – August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and, by early 1982, Iran regained almost all of the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowing him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, instead demanding reparation and the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power.Wright, In the Name of God, (1989), p.126[tpl]Cite news|last=Smith |first=William E. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |work=Time |date=14 June 1982 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SRE.htm |title=The Iran–Iraq War: Strategy of Stalemate |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] The war ended in 1988, with  320,000–720,000 Iranian soldiers and militia killedpower Kills Rudolph Rummel
Although Iran's population and economy were three times the size of Iraq's, the latter was aided by neighboring Persian Gulf Arab states, as well as the Soviet Bloc and Western countries. The Persian Gulf Arabs and the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread across the Persian Gulf, while the Soviet Union was concerned about the potential threat posed to its rule in central Asia to the north. However, Iran had large amounts of ammunition provided by the United States of America during the Shah's era and the United States illegally smuggled arms to Iran during the 1980s despite Khomeini's anti-Western policy (see Iran-Contra affair).
The war continued for another six years with mounting costs. 1988 saw deadly month-long Iraqi missile attacks on Tehran, mounting economic problems, the demoralization of Iranian troops, attacks by the American Navy on Iranian ships, oil rigs, and a commercial airplane, and the recapture by Iraq of the Faw Peninsula.
In July of that year, Khomeini, in his words, "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high cost of the war – 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and USD $300 billion(estimate by Iranian officials) Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.252 – Khomeini insisted that extending the war into Iraq in an attempt to overthrow Saddam had not been a mistake. In a 'Letter to Clergy' he wrote: '... we do not repent, nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war. Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the result is a marginal issue?'Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.285

===Rushdie fatwa===

In early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, an India-born British author. The juristic ruling (Fatwa) that claimed that Rushdie's assassination was allowed for Muslims to partake because of his alleged blasphemy against Muhammad in his novel, The Satanic Verses, published in 1988 which contains passages that many Muslims – including Ayatollah Khomeini –considered offensive to Islam and the prophet.[tpl]#tag:Ref|The fatwah required not only Rushdie's execution, but also the execution of "all those involved in the publication" of the book.[tpl]cite book|last=Woo|first=Richard|title=God Or Allah, Truth Or Bull?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vlvo5oQHSCkC|year=2011|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-60976-813-3|pages=10[/tpl][/tpl]
In the West, Khomeini's fatwā was condemned across the western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech and freedom of religion, but the fatwa has also been attacked for violating the rules of fiqh by not allowing the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because "even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence."Bernard Lewis's comment on Rushdie fatwa in The Crisis of Niggerdom (2003), Bernard Lewis, pp. 141-2
Though Rushdie publicly regretted "the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-regret.html |title=Rushdie regrets|work=The New York Times|date=19 February 1989|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] the fatwa was not revoked. Khomeini explained,
 
 Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it is incumbent on every Muslim to employ everything he has got, his life and wealth, to send him to Hell.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 284

==Life under Khomeini==

In a speech given to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile 1 February 1979, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming Islamic regime: A popularly elected government that would represent the people of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that "no one should remain homeless in this country," and that Iranians would have free telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.Moin, Baqer, Khomeini, (2000), p. 258) While these things did not come to pass, many other changes did.
Under Khomeini's rule, Sharia (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women by Islamic Revolutionary Guards and other Islamic groups[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/basij.htm |title=Gobal Security, Intelligence: Niruyeh Moghavemat Basij – Mobilisation Resistance Force |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] Women were required to cover their hair, and men were not allowed to wear shorts.

===Emigration and economy===

Khomeini is said to have stressed "the spiritual over the material".(Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001), p.125) Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints about the sharp drop in Iran's standard of living: 'I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons'(Khomeini July 1979) in The Government of God p.111. "see the FBIS for typical broadcasts, especially GBIS-MEA-79-L30, 5 July 1979 v.5 n.130, reporting broadcasts of the National Voice of Iran. On another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material prosperity: "Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world."(Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini (2001), p.125)(p.124-5 source: 'Khomeini to the Craftsmen' broadcast on Teheran Domestic Service 13 December 1979, FBIS-MEA-79-242) He is also reportedly famous for answering a question about his economic policies by declaring that 'economics is for donkeys'.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, (2006), p.134 This low opinion of economics is said to be "one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the revolution."[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zrpmm4120OUC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=%22economics+is+for+donkeys%22+khomeini |title=An Introduction to the Modern Middle East, By David S.

Due to the Iran–Iraq war, poverty is said to have risen by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of Khomeini's rule.Based on the government's own Planning and Budget Organization statistics, from: Jahangir Amuzegar, 'The Iranian Economy before and after the Revolution,' Middle East Journal 46, n.3 (summer 1992): 421) Emigration from Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time in the country's history.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.78-9 Since the revolution and war with Iraq, an estimated "two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)" have emigrated to other countries.However, a significant degree of this can attributed to Iranians fleeing during the war.Iran's Economic Morass: Mismanagement and Decline under the Islamic Republic ISBN 0-944029-67-1[tpl]Cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6240287.stm |title=Huge cost of Iranian brain drain By Frances Harrison |publisher=BBC News |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]

===Suppression of opposition===

In a talk at the Fayzieah School in Qom, 30 August 1979, Khomeini warned pro-imperialist opponents: "Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than Bani-Ghorizeh Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by God's order and God's call to prayer."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2003/August/Khomeini/ |title=Democracy? I meant theocracy By Dr. Jalal Matini |date= 5 August 2003 |publisher=Iranian.com |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]
The Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family left Iran and escaped harm, but hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military met their end in firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of "secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries", or the opportunity of the accused "to defend themselves."Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs (1984), p.61 In later years these were followed in larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini's movement—Marxists and socialists, mostly university students—who opposed the theocratic regime. Following the 1981 Hafte Tir bombing, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone violently opposed to the government, "enemies of God" and pursued a mass campaign against members of the Mojahedin, Fadaiyan, and Tudeh parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of counterrevolutionary behavior.Moin, Khomeini, 2001, p.243
In the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, following the People's Mujahedin of Iran operation Forough-e Javidan against the Islamic Republic, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner and kill those who would not repent anti-regime activities.

Despite this, freedom of speech was said to have been greatly improved as a result of the 1979 Revolution, although harsh restrictions remained on those supporting accused "terrorist groups" and opposition such as the MKO.

===Minority religions===

Life for religious minorities was mixed under Khomeini. Senior government posts were reserved for Muslims. Schools set up by Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians had to be run by Muslim principals.Wright, The Last Great Revolution, (2000), p.210 Conversion to Islam was encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents (or even uncle's) estate if their siblings (or cousins) remain non-Muslim.Wright, The Last Great Revolution, (2000), p.216 Iran's non-Muslim population has decreased. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000.Wright, The Last Great Revolution, (2000), p.207
Only four of the 270 seats in parliament were reserved for each three non-Muslim minority religions, under the Islamic constitution that Khomeini oversaw. Khomeini also called for unity between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Sunni Muslims are the largest religious minority in Iran. 4% belong to the Sunni branch.http://www.iranonline.com/iran/iran-info/people/index.html
Shortly after Khomeini's return from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering that Jews and other minorities (except Bahá'ís) be treated well.Wright, Last Revolution (2000), p.207[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/iran.html |title=IRAN: Life of Jews Living in Iran |publisher=Sephardicstudies.org |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] In power, Khomeini distinguished between Zionism as a secular political party that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of Moses.R. Khomeini 'The Report Card on Jews Differs from That on the Zionists,' Ettelaat, 11 May 1979]
One non-Muslim group treated differently were the 300,000 members of the Bahá'í Faith. Starting in late 1979 the new government systematically targeted the leadership of the Bahá'í community by focusing on the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) and Local Spiritual Assemblies (LSAs); prominent members of NSAs and LSAs were often detained and even executed by forces outside of Khomeini's direct control.[tpl]cite web| publisher = Iran Human Rights Documentation Center | title= A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran | year= 2007 | accessdate =6 October 2007|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/pdfs/Reports/bahai_report.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] "Some 200 of whom have been executed and the rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities."Turban for the Crown : The Islamic Revolution in Iran, by Said Amir Arjomand, Oxford University Press, 1988, p.169
Like most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed Bahá'í to be apostates.[ref]for example issuing a fatwa stating:

===Ethnic minorities===

After the Shah left Iran in 1979, a Kurdish delegation traveled to Qom to present the Kurds' demands to Ayatollah Khomeini. Their demands included language rights and the provision for a degree of political autonomy. Khomeini responded that such demands were unacceptable, since it involved the division of the Iranian nation. The following months saw numerous clashes between Kurdish militia groups and the Revolutionary Guards. The referendum on the Islamic Republic was massively boycotted in Kurdistan, where it was thought 85 to 90% of voters abstained. Khomeini ordered additional attacks later on in the year, and by September most of Iranian Kurdistan was under direct martial law.Gérard Chaliand, A people without a country: the Kurds and Kurdistan, Interlink Books, 1993. (p. 212-213)

==Death and funeral==

After eleven days in a hospital, Khomeini died on 3 June 1989, at the age of 86 just before midnight. At the time of his death, Khomeini was said to be suffering from prostate cancer. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei. Iranians poured out into the cities and streets in enormous numbers to mourn Khomeini's death in a spontaneous outpouring of grief.  In the scorching summer heat, fire trucks sprayed water on the crowds to cool them off.  Ten mourners were trampled to death, more than four hundred were badly hurt and several thousand more treated for injuries sustained in the ensuing pandemoniumMoin, Khomeini (2000), p. 312In the Name of God : The Khomeini Decade by Robin Wright, (1989), p. 204

In some cases, armed soldiers were compelled to fire warning shots in the air to restrain the crowds.  At one point, Khomeini's body almost fell to the ground, as the crowd attempted to tear off pieces of the death shroud, trying to keep them as if they were holy relics. The second funeral was held under much tighter security five hours later. This time, Khomeini's casket was made of steel, and heavily armed security personnel surrounded it. In accordance with Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site. In 1995, his son Ahmad was buried next to him. Khomeini's grave is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.

===Succession===

Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the Assembly of Experts in November 1985.Mackey, Iranians, (1998), p. 353 The principle of velayat-e faqih and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Leader to be a marja (a grand ayatollah), and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living in 1981 only Montazeri qualified as a potential Leader (this was either because only he accepted totally Khomeini's concept of rule by Islamic jurists,[ref]Roy, Olivier, The Failure of Political Islam, translated by Carol Volk Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 173-4. Quoted in
The Islamic Republic Will Be Run By the Most Learned Jurist[/ref]Mackay, Iranians, (1998), p.353[tpl]Verify credibility|date=January 2009[/tpl] or, as at least one other source stated, because only Montazeri had the "political credentials" Khomeini found suitable for his successor).Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p. 293 In 1989 Montazeri began to call for liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini 'your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK.'Ahmad Khomeini's letter, in Resalat, cited in The Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic Revolution, rev. ed. by Shaul Bakhash, p.282 After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him from his position as official successor.
To deal with the disqualification of the only suitable marja, Khomeini called for an 'Assembly for Revising the Constitution' to be convened. An amendment was made to Iran's constitution removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader be a MarjaRoy, Olivier, The Failure of Political Islam, translated by Carol Volk Harvard University Press, 1994, pp. 173-4 and this allowed Ali Khamenei, the new favoured jurist who had suitable revolutionary credentials but lacked scholarly ones and who was not a Grand Ayatollah, to be designated as successor.Moin, Khomeini (2000) p. 293Mackey, SandraThe Iranians (1996), p. 353 Ayatollah Khamene'i was elected Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989. Grand Ayatollah Hossein Montazeri continued his criticism of the regime and in 1997 was put under house arrest for questioning what he regarded to be an unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme leader.Profile: Iran's dissident ayatollah BBC NEWSLeader Khamenei PBS

==Political thought and legacy==

According to at least one scholar, politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran "are largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy" and that "staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity" there.[ref]The New Republic
"Khamenei vs. Khomeini" by Ali Reza Eshraghi, 20 August 2009. Retrieved 20-August-2009.[/ref]
Throughout his many writings and speeches, Khomeini's views on governance evolved. Originally declaring rule by monarchs or others permissible so long as sharia law was followed1942 book/pamphlet Kashf al-Asrar quoted in Islam and Revolution Khomeini later adamantly opposed monarchy, arguing that only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (a marja'), would insure Sharia was properly followed (wilayat al-faqih),1970 book Hukumat Islamiyyah or Islamic Government, quoted in Islam and Revolution before finally insisting the ruling jurist need not be a leading one and Sharia rule could be overruled by that jurist if necessary to serve the interests of Islam and the "divine government" of the Islamic state.[ref]Hamid Algar, 'Development of the Concept of velayat-i faqih since the Islamic Revolution in Iran,' paper presented at London Conference on wilayat al-faqih, in June 1988] p.135-8

from p.135-6 of Iran at the Crossroads, Edited by John Esposito and R.K. Ramazani, Palgrave, 2001. Quoted in
Khomeini on how Laws in Iran will strictly adhere to God's perfect and unchanging divine law[/ref]
Khomeini's concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists (ولایت فقیه, velayat-e faqih) did not win the support of the leading Iranian Shi'i clergy of the time.[ref]The Failure of Political Islam by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk Harvard University Press, 1994, p.173-4 quoted in "the vilayat-i faqih thesis was rejected by almost the entire dozen grand ayatollahs living in 1981"
][/ref] Towards the 1979 Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini's vision of a theocratic Islamic Republic.
There is much debate to as whether Khomeini's ideas are or are not compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic. According to the state-run Aftab News,Ganji, Sorush and Mesbah Yazdi(Persian) both ultraconservative (Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi) and reformist opponents of the regime (Akbar Ganji and Abdolkarim Soroush) believe he did not, while regime officials and supporters like Ali Khamenei,The principles of Islamic republic from viewpoint of Imam Khomeini in the speeches of the leader(Persian) Mohammad Khatami and Mortaza MotahhariAbout Islamic republic(Persian) believe Khomeini intended the Islamic republic to be democratic and that it is so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/14?ck=nck |title=Ayatollah Khomeini and the Contemporary Debate on Freedom |doi=10.1093/jis/etl042 |publisher=Jis.oxfordjournals.org |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to democracy.[tpl]cite web |title=Democracy?

One scholar, Shaul Bakhash, explains this disagreement as coming from Khomeini's belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution constituted a 'referendum' in favor of an Islamic republic.Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs (1984), p.73 Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected representatives.Khomeini, Islam and Revolution, (1982), p.56
Khomeini offered himself as a "champion of Islamic revival" and unity, emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon – the fight against Zionism and imperialism – and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from Sunni.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival Norton, (2006), p.137
Khomeini strongly opposed close relations with either Eastern or Western Bloc nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc, or rather converge into a single unified power.Bayan, No.4 (1990), p.8) He viewed Western culture as being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music, cinema, and literature.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4543720.stm |title=Iran president bans Western music |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] In the Western world it is said "his glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture" and "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam,"Nasr, Vali The Shia Revival, Norton, 2006, p.138 making the word 'Ayatollah' "a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-476/_nr-1103/i.html |title=A Revolution Misunderstood. Charlotte Wiedemann |publisher=Qantara.de |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] This has particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained that even at universities they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack. There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks,Wright, Sacred Rage, (2001), p.28, 33,[ref]for example the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing see:Hizb'allah in Lebanon : The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis Magnus Ranstorp, Department of International Relations University of St. Andrews
St. Martins Press, New York, 1997, p.54, 117[/ref] and which continues to apply economic sanctions against Iran.
Before taking power Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. "We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence."Sahifeh Nour (Vol.2 Page 242) However once in power Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: "I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth."in Qom, Iran, 22 October 1979, quoted in, The Shah and the Ayatollah : Iranian Mythology and Islamic Revolution by Fereydoun Hoveyda, Westport, Conn. : Praeger, 2003, p.88
Many of Khomeini's political and religious ideas were considered to be progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists prior to the Revolution. However, once in power his ideas often clashed with those of modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals:
 Yes, we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals: You intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want freedom, freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms, you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom.p.47, Wright. source: Speech at Feyziyeh Theological School, 24 August 1979; reproduced in Rubin, Barry and Judith Colp Rubin, Anti-American Terrorism and the Middle East: A Documentary Reader, Oxford University Press, 2002, p.34  
In contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and "in an utter departure from all other Islamist movements," Khomeini embraced international revolution and Third World solidarity, giving it "precedence over Muslim fraternity. From the time Khomeini's supporters gained control of the media until his death, the Iranian media "devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim revolutionary movements (from the Sandinistas to the African National Congress and the Irish Republican Army) and downplayed the role of the Islamic movements considered conservative, such as the Afghan mujahidin."Roy, The Failure of Political Islam. 1994, p.175
Khomeini's legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been expressions of concern for the mustazafin (a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived), but not always results that aided them. During the 1990s the mustazafin and disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition of their shantytowns and rising food prices, etc.In March 1992, disabled war veterans protested against the mismanagement of the Foundation of the Disinherited. January and May 1992. In January 1992 a Tehran mob attacked grocery stores in protest against rise in subsidized milk prices. In May 1992 there were protest by squatters against demolition of shantytowns in Mashhad. Government buildings were set alight. (Mackey, Sandra, The Iranians : Persia, Islam and the soul of a nation, Dutton, c1996. p.361, 362, 366). Quoted in Class Division and Poverty Will Not Be Tolerated Khomeini's disdain for the science of economics ("economics is for donkeys") is said to have been "mirrored" by the populist redistribution policies of former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly wears "his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour", and has overseen sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2008/09/iran-economic-ahmadinejad |title="Economics is for donkeys" Robert Tait. 11 September 2008 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl]
In 1963, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini wrote a book in which he stated that there is no religious restriction on corrective surgery for transgendered individuals. At the time Khomeini was an anti-Shah revolutionary and his fatwas did not carry any weight with the Imperial government, which did not have any specific policies regarding transsexual individuals.Robert Tait, A fatwa for transsexuals, and a similar article on The Guardian. Gives details on Molkara's plea.

==Appearance and habits==

Khomeini was described as "slim," but athletic and "heavily boned." His facial features bore a striking resemblance to the later film appearances of Scottish actor Sean Connery. 
He was known for his punctuality:
 He's so punctual that if he doesn't turn up for lunch at exactly ten past everyone will get worried, because his work is regulated in such a way that he turned up for lunch at exactly that time every day. He goes to bed exactly on time. He eats exactly on time. And he wakes up exactly on time. He changes his cloak every time he comes back from the mosque.According to a daughter quoted in In the Name of God by Robin Wright c1989, p.45 
Sheikh Ahmad Deedat, a Muslim Scholar from South Africa has described Imam Khomeini in his speech which he delivered on 3 March 1982:
 I saw the Imam. He delivered the Lecture to us for about half an hour, and it was nothing but the Quran, the man is like a computerized Quran. And the electric effect he had on everybody, his charisma, was amazing. You just look at the man and tears come down your cheek. You just look at him and you get tears. I never saw a more handsome old man in my life, no picture, no video, no TV could do justice to this man, the handsomest old man I ever saw in my life was this man.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inminds.com/unity.html|title=Sunni-Shia Unity, A lecture by Sheikh Ahmad Deedat|publisher=inminds.com|accessdate=6 April 2012[/tpl]
 
Khomeini was also known for his aloofness and austere demeanor. He is said to have had "variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around him."Brumberg, Reinventing Khomeini, (2001), p.53 His practice of moving "through the halls of the madresehs never smiling at anybody or anything; his practice of ignoring his audience while he taught, contributed to his charisma."Mackay, Iranians (198?) p.224
Khomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of Islamic hygienical jurisprudence holding that things like urine, excrement, blood, wine etc. and also non-Muslims were some of eleven ritualistically "impure" things that physical contact with which while wet required ritual washing or Ghusl before prayer or salat.fatwa No. 83 from A Clarification of Questions : An Unabridged Translation of Resaleh Towzih al-Masael, by Ayatollah Syed Ruhollah Moosavi Khomeini, Translated by J. Borujerdi, with a Foreword by Michael M. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, Westview Press/ Boulder and London c1984, p.48.Mottahedeh, Roy, The Mantle of the Prophet : Religion and Politics in Iran, One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.383 He is reported to have refused to eat or drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.Personal communications from Dr. Mansur Farhang, a biographer and supporter of Khomeini who was the former Iranian representative at the United Nations, with Ervand Abrahamian. Quoted in Abrahamian, Ervand, Khomeinism : Essays on the Islamic Republic'' University of California Press, (1993)

==Mystique==

Khomeini was noted by many for his mystique. Before the revolution he benefited from the widespread circulation of a Hadith attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim who is said to have prophesied shortly before his death in 799 that
 'A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path. There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by violent winds, unsparing and relying on God.'(Mackay Iranians, p.277. Source: Quoted in Fouad Ajami, The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), p.25 
Khomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as "Imam", a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early Shi'a.Moin, Khomeini (2000), p.201 He was also associated with the Mahdi or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was Na'eb-e Imam (Deputy to the Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as taghut and Mofsed-e-filarz (corrupters of the earth), religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of "fighting against the Twelfth Imam". When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini directly if he was the 'promised Mahdi', Khomeini did not answer, "astutely" neither confirming nor denying the title.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival, Norton, (2006), p.131
As the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe, called him "magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving."Harney, The Priest and the King (1998) pp. 173-4 His image was as "absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation"Benard/Khalilzad, "The Government of God", 1984, p. 121
 The Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.Moin ''Khomeini, (2000), p. 297 
Even many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his "messianic" appeal.Wright, In the Name of God, (1989) (p.21-22) Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist Afshin Molavi writes of the defenses of Khomeini he is "heard in the most unlikely settings":
 A whiskey-drinking professor told an American journalist that Khomeini brought pride back to Iranians. A women's rights activist told me that Khomeini was not the problem; it was his conservative allies who had directed him wrongly. A nationalist war veteran, who held Iran's ruling clerics in contempt, carried with him a picture of 'the Imam'.Molavi, The Soul of Iran, (2005), p. 256  Another journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who "repeatedly" makes the point "that life had been better" under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that "the Imam" — over 85 years old at the time — might be dying, the critic becomes "ashen faced" and speechless, pronouncing 'this is terrible for my country.'In the Name of God: The Khomeini Decade by Robin Wright c 1989, pp. 21-22

==Family and descendants==

In 1929, Khomeini married Khadijeh Saqafi,Taheri, The Spirit of Allah (1985), p. 90-1  the 16 year old daughter of a cleric in Tehran. By all accounts their marriage was harmonious and happy. She died in 2009.Wife of founder of Iran's Islamic republic dies. 23 March 2009[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] They had seven children, though only five survived infancy.
