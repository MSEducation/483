==History of the see==

Christianity arrived in the British Isles in the 1st or 2nd century (probably via the tin trade route through Ireland and Spain). Londinium, as it was then known, had become a city that prospered and superseded Camulodunum (Colchester) as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia. At its height in the 2nd century AD, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.  It is certain that a metropolitan bishop was working in London in the early centuries of the Christian era. The recorded antiquity of the office dates back to ancient times where sixteen named archbishops are listed by Jocelyne of Furness in his work Bishops.  It has been noted that this is the sole available source of these names, however, the earlier of the two bishops named Restitutus is known to have existed as he is named as attending the Council of Arles in 314. Nothing else is known about Restitutus, although he may have lived long enough to be part of the delegation from Britannia to the First Council of Nicaea.
