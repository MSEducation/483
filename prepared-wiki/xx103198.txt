The Banu Kaab ([tpl]lang-ar|بنو كعب[/tpl]) are an Arab tribe of Iraqi origin settled mostly in western Khuzestan and southern and central Iraq, in cities such as Basra and Nasariyah. From the early 18th century onwards, the Banu Kaab began converting from Sunni to Shia Islam.The Shi'is of Iraq By Yitzhak Nakash, pg. 27, and Haydari, ‘Unwan al-Majd, pg. 110-15, 118
In the latter part of the 1500s, the Bani Kaab settled in Khuzestan. They were powerful in the Arabistan emirate of western Khuzestan. Another branch of the Bani Kaab settled in the areas that are now Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
Individuals who are members of or are descended from the tribe often have the surname Kaabi or al-Kaabi. Those from the tribe who reside within Iran often carry the dialectal spelling variant Chaab.
Bani Kaab had their tribe flag as plain yellow banner. They have waged wars with neighbouring nations. For example, a famous naval battle, called Al-Raqah, occurred in the Persian Gulf between Bani Kaab and Kuwait. Bani Kaab were defeated by the Kuwaiti forces.
