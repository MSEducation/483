After an agreement with the Albanian authorities, in 1937, the Ecumenical Patriarchate chose a number of highly educated religious personalities for key position in the recently declared as autocephalous, Orthodox Church of Albania. Among them were Panteleimon Kotokos as metropolitan of Gjirokastër and Eulogios Kourilas, as metropolitan of Korca. When the communist regime of Enver Hoxha came to power in Albania (1945), he was declared 'enemy of the state' and was expelled from the country. He fled to Greece where together with Eulohios Kourilas became the heads of the Northern Epirus Central Committee. On November 18, 1945, he managed to organize a massive demonstration in Athens, where 150,000 people participated. The following years he became active as a member of the exiled Northern Epirus lobby propagating discrimination of the Greek minority by the Communist regime of Albania.[tpl]cite book |last=Stephanidēs Giannēs D., Stefanidis Ioannis D. |first= |title=Stirring the Greek nation: political culture, irredentism and anti-Americanism in post-war Greece, 1945-1967|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |language=2007 |year=|pages= 40–115 |ref=|isbn=978-0-7546-6059-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j4x71iWyYNkC&dq=[/tpl]
