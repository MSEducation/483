Do prostego człowieka ([tpl]lang-en|To the Simple Man[/tpl]) is a poem by Julian Tuwim. Published for the first time in the November 7, 1929 edition of Robotnik daily, it immediately became popular due to its strong pacifist and anti-war message. The poem mocks militarism, jingoistic fervour and hysteria, and suggests that it is the powerful that reap the profits of wars waged by common people.
The poem was commonly read as expressing poet's disillusionment with Józef Pilsudski's regime and increasingly militant rhetoric.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Marci Shore | coauthors = | title =Caviar and ashes: a Warsaw generation's life and death in Marxism, 1918-1968 | year =2006 | editor = | pages =74–75 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Yale University Press | location =New Haven, Conn. | isbn=978-0-300-11092-0 | url =http://books.google.pl/books?id=0nyESYH8ZnEC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22simple+man%22+Tuwim&source=bl&ots=rkOibsUkbz&sig=ocCaO36NA6T3dEGzm1VpNfq2DJg&hl=pl&ei=2bbbSojUFYLWmQOY1qzoDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22simple%20man%22%20Tuwim&f=false | format = | accessdate =2009-10-19 [/tpl]
At the same time it was openly criticised by both left and right-wing journalists. The rightists went as far as to suggest Tuwim be hanged for allegedly promoting desertion among Polish soldiers.
Despite criticism, the poem became immediately popular in Poland. One of the final lines of the poem (The oil is theirs, the blood is yours) became particularly famous and entered the Polish language as a popular expression in the form of "not my oil", meaning "it's none of my business".
In recent years the poem was translated to English by Marcel Weyland.[tpl]en icon[/tpl][tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = | year = | month = | title = To the simple man | journal =Seria poetycka; Polish poetry | volume =VIII | issue =1836 | pages = | id = | url =http://www.antoranz.net/CURIOSA/ZBIOR7/C0710/20071014-QZM02062_Tuwim.HTM | issn=1176-7545 | accessdate = [/tpl] Weyland's translation contains one distorted passage as it is based on a faulty version of the text in common circulation in which a typo led to the substitution of the "lords" ("panami", instrumental grammatical case) by "maidens" ("pannami"), the result being rather ludicrous and far from intended by the poem's author. It also gained new popularity due to numerous rock bands performing it on their concerts. One of the best-known such interpretations is by a Polish rock group Akurat.
