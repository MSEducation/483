Robinson was born in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Robinson had been a sharecropper, a soldier and a boxer. A steady position as an emcee/comedian at a Trenton, New Jersey nightclub led to his singing career. He eventually sang with B.B. King 21-piece orchestra. He and King became friends.
Robinson settled in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1959 and played in clubs, but by 2004 he was homeless. Musicians and other concerned individuals, when they learned of Robinson's situation, held a benefit concert on his behalf, making sure he was fed and clothed.Obituary from Yahoo.com
