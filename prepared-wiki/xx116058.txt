Ann-Louise Hanson (born in Kristianstad in 1944) is a Swedish singer and has been involved in the music industry for over 40 years.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Ann-Louise Hanson | encyclopedia=Nationalencyklopedin | language=Swedish | url=http://www.ne.se/ann-louise-hanson | accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl]
Many of her solo recordings from the 1960s feature Bruno Glenmarks Orkester and, following their marriage, Ann-Louise and Bruno Glenmark formed the group Glenmarks with Bruno's niece Karin and nephew Anders. Soon after, their own GlenDisc record label began producing vinyl, cassettes and eventually CDs under the banner of 'Hanson-Glenmark Production AB'.
Ann-Louise holds the dubious honour of having entered the Swedish Melodifestivalen competition thirteen times without winning once, which is a record in itself. Of those entries, the songs "Bara en enda gång" (a duet with John Ballard) and "Kärleken lever" are amongst her best remembered. Ann-Louise has also attempted to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest in the past. Having moved to France with Bruno in the late 1980s, she now remains a resident of Kristianstad in Sweden.
1986's synth-based Duva - Flyg igen (Doves - Fly Again) is Hanson's most recent studio album, upon which she shared lead vocals with her daughters Jessica and Josefin on the title track, alongside a duet with Billy Preston on "So Good, So Fine".
Ann-Louise's daughter Josefin Glenmark recently embarked upon her own musical career.
