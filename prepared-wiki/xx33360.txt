Age-related cataracts are responsible for 51% of world blindness, about 20 million people.[tpl]cite web |title=Priority eye diseases: Cataract |work=Prevention of Blindness and Visual Impairment |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/priority/en/index1.html[/tpl] WHO.int], | . Globally, cataracts cause moderate to severe disability in 53.8 million (2004), 52.2 million of whom are in low and middle income countries.[tpl]cite book|last=Organization|first=World Health|title=The global burden of disease : 2004 update.|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=9789241563710|pages=35[/tpl]
In many countries surgical services are inadequate, and cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness.  Even where surgical services are available, low vision associated with cataracts may still be prevalent as a result of long waits for, and barriers to, surgery—such as cost, lack of information and transportation problems.
In the United States, age-related lens changes have been reported in 42% between the ages of 52 and 64,[tpl]cite journal | author = Sperduto RD, Seigel D., Seigel D.

==History==

The first references to cataracts and their treatment in Ancient Rome are found in 29 AD in De Medicinae, the work of the Latin encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus.[tpl]cite book |ol=5225311W |title=De Medicinae |author=Aulus Cornelius Celsus, G.

Other early accounts are found in Sanskrit. Cataract surgery was described by the Indian physician, Suśruta (fl. ca. 200 AD).[tpl]cite book |author=Suśruta, P. V.

The Muslim ophthalmologist Ammar ibn Ali, in his Choice of Eye Diseases, written circa 1000 CE, wrote of his invention of a syringe and the technique of cataract extraction while experimenting with it on a patient.[tpl]Cite book|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514694-8|page=70|postscript=[/tpl]

===Etymology===

Cataract is derived from the Latin [tpl]lang|la|cataracta[/tpl] meaning "waterfall" and from the Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|καταρράκτης[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc-Latn|katarrhaktēs[/tpl]), "down-rushing",καταρράκτης, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from καταράσσω (katarassō) meaning "to dash down"καταράσσω, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott,A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus (from kata-, "down"; arassein, "to strike, dash").[tpl]cite web |title=cataract |date=29 October 2003 |work=Word of the Day |publisher=Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/10/29.html[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |title=cataract |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0128960#m_en_gb0128960cataract[/tpl] As rapidly running water turns white, so the term may have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, cataracta had the alternative meaning "portcullis"cataracta, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus and  the name possibly passed through French to form the English meaning "eye disease" (early 15th century), on the notion of "obstruction".Online Etymology Dictionary, etymonline.com Early Persian physicians called the term nazul-i-ah, or "descent of the water"—vulgarised into waterfall disease or cataract—believing such blindness to be caused by an outpouring of corrupt humour into the eye.Mistaken Science — Topic Powered by eve community, Wordcraft Forums, wordcraft.infopop.cc

==Research==

N-acetylcarnosine have been investigated as a medical treatment for cataracts. The drops are believed to work by reducing oxidation and glycation damage in the lens, particularly reducing crystallin crosslinking.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-5224.2006.00492.x | author = Williams DL, Munday P | year = 2006 | title = The effect of a topical antioxidant formulation including N-acetyl carnosine on canine cataract: a preliminary study | journal = Vet Ophthalmol | volume = 9 | issue = 5| pages = 311–6 | pmid = 16939459 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Guo Y, Yan H | year = 2006 | title = Preventive effect of carnosine on cataract development | journal = Yan Ke Xue Bao | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 85–8 | pmid = 17162883 [/tpl] Some benefit has been shown in small manufacturer sponsored randomized controlled trials but further independent corroboration is still required.[tpl]cite journal |author=Toh T, Morton J, Coxon J, Elder MJ |title=Medical treatment of cataract |journal=Clin.

Femtosecond laser has been used during cataract surgery. This technique known as femtosecond laser technology and originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in LASIK surgery, has been introduced to cataract surgery.  The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle and forceps are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated 3-D image of the eyes can be used to guide lasers to make these incisions,  Nd:YAG laser can also then break up the cataract as in phacoemulsification.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedman NJ, Palanker DV, Schuele G, et al. |title=Femtosecond laser capsulotomy |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1189–98 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21700099 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2011.04.022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0886-3350(11)00728-0[/tpl] as PDF The authors declare a financial interest in a company producing femtosecond laser equipment.
