==Uses==

Industry uses 270,000–360,000 tonnes (600–800 million pounds) of castor oil, annually.  Its derivatives have applications in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, hydraulic and brake fluids, paints, dyes, coatings, inks, cold resistant plastics, waxes and polishes, nylon, pharmaceuticals and perfumes.

===Food and preservative===

In the food industry, castor oil (food grade) is used in food additives,Castor Oil Facts flavorings, candy (e.g., Polyglycerol polyricinoleate or PGPR in chocolate),[tpl]Cite journal|author=Wilson R, Van Schie BJ, Howes D |title=Overview of the preparation, use and biological studies on polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) |journal=Food Chem.

In India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, food grains are preserved by applying castor oil. It stops rice, wheat, and pulses from rotting. For example the legume Toor dal is commonly available coated in oil for extended storage.

===Medicine===

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has categorized castor oil as "generally recognized as safe and effective" (GRASE) for over-the-counter use as a laxative with its major site of action the small intestine where it is digested into Ricinoleic acid.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/Offices/OTC/Ingredient_List_A-C.pdf | title=Ingredient List A-C | publisher=FDA (see page 52 of this link)| accessdate=2006-12-28|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061217173035/http://www.fda.gov/cder/Offices/OTC/Ingredient_List_A-C.pdf  |archivedate = 2006-12-17[/tpl]
Therapeutically, modern drugs are rarely given in a pure chemical state, so most active ingredients are combined with excipients or additives.  Castor oil, or a castor oil derivative such as Kolliphor EL (polyethoxylated castor oil, a nonionic surfactant), is added to many modern drugs, including:

====Alternative medicinal use====

In naturopathy castor oil has been promoted as a treatment for a variety of human health conditions. The claim has been made that applying it to the skin can help cure cancer. However, according to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that castor oil on the skin cures cancer or any other disease."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/castor-oil|title=Castor Oil|date=March 2011|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=22 September 2013[/tpl]

===Polyurethane===

Castor oil can be used as bio-based polyol in the polyurethane industry. The average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per triglyceride molecule) of castor oil is 2.7, so it is widely used as rigid polyol and coating

===Industry===

Castor oil has numerous applications in transportation, cosmetics and pharmaceutical, and  manufacturing industries, for example: adhesives, brake fluids,[tpl]cite web|url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=AD0737879|title= Castor oil as a component of brake fluid|accessdate=2007-08-03[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] caulks, dyes, electrical liquid dielectrics, humectants,[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc-oils.com/castor-oil.html|title= Multiple uses of castor oil|accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl] Nylon 11 plastics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freelin-wade.com/nylon-tubing.html|title= Nylon 11 Plastic Tubing[/tpl] hydraulic fluids, inks,  lacquers, leather treatments, lubricating greases, machining oils, paints, pigments, polyurethane adhesives,[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1590/S1516-14392006000300008|last=Azambuja |first=Maximiliano dos Anjos  |coauthors=Dias, Antonio Alves  |title=Use of castor oil-based polyurethane adhesive in the production of glued laminated timber beams |journal=Mat.

Since it has a relatively high dielectric constant (4.7), highly refined and dried castor oil is sometimes used as a dielectric fluid within high performance high voltage capacitors.

====Lubrication====

Vegetable oils, due to their good lubricity and biodegradability are attractive alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants, but oxidative stability and low temperature performance limit their widespread use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?SEQ_NO_115=166442|title= Chemical modification to improve vegetable oil lubricants|accessdate=2007-08-02[/tpl] Castor oil has better low temperature viscosity properties and high temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it useful as a lubricant in jet, diesel, and race car engines.[ref]
