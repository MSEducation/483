Capol is an old Swiss noble family from the canton of Grisons. 
The family's origin is the Swiss village of Flims.  Capol (or former named Capal) people of this family name have lived in this region since the 11th century.
Variations of the family name include "Capoll", "Cappol", "Cappoll", "Cappal", "Kapol"  and "Kapool".
Johann Gaudenz von Capol (1641–1723), a member of the leading family of Flims, built the Schlössli (Little Castle), a manor house, in 1682.
The Reiche Stübe, or "Rich Room", of this manor is visitable in the Metropolitan museum.Rich Room
On the floor of the castle the coat of arms of the Capol, a golden arrow on a black shield, is clearly visible. 
Many Capols have fought for countries other that Switzerland.
