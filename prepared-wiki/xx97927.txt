Since 1991, Kancheli has lived in Western Europe: first in Berlin, and since 1995 in Antwerp, where he became composer-in-residence for the Royal Flemish Philharmonic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sikorski.de/4362/en/0%7B20%7D/a/0/giya_kancheli_turns_75_on_10_august.html|title=Giya Kancheli turns 75 on 10 August|work=Sikorski|date=August 2010|accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl]

==Work==

In his symphonies, Kancheli's musical language typically consists of slow scraps of minor-mode melody against long, subdued, anguished string discords. These passages are occasionally punctuated with "battle scenes" involving martial brass and percussion. His music post-1990 has become more refined and generally more subdued and nostalgic in character. Some commentators [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] talk about his music in cinematic terms; one can find equivalents of the dissolve (in his ubiquitous blurred tonal transitions), zoom (such as the long crescendo a third of the way into the Sixth Symphony), abrupt cuts (jumping from very quiet to very loud, as in the opening of the Fifth Symphony), and so on. Rodion Shchedrin speaks of Kancheli as "an ascetic with the temperament of a maximalist; a restrained Vesuvius".Ainslie, Sarah. "Giya Kancheli". schirmer.com, 2006. Retrieved on 31 January 2007.
Kancheli has written seven symphonies, and what he terms a liturgy for viola and orchestra, called Mourned by the Wind. His Fourth Symphony received its American premiere, with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Yuri Temirkanov, in January 1978, not long before the cultural freeze in the United States against Soviet culture. Glasnost allowed Kancheli to regain exposure, and he began to receive frequent commissions, as well as performances within Europe and America.
Championed internationally by the likes of Dennis Russell Davies, Jansug Kakhidze, Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet, Kim Kashkashian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and the Kronos Quartet, Kancheli has seen world premieres of his works in Seattle, as well as with the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur. He continues to receive regular commissions. New CDs of his recent works are regularly released, notably on the ECM label.
His work Styx is written for solo viola, chorus and orchestra. It is a farewell to his friends Avet Terterian and Alfred Schnittke, whose names are sung by the choir at certain points.Tuttle, Raymond. "Yuri Bashmet Plays". classical.net, 2002. Retrieved 2 April 2010.
In Georgia, Kancheli's work is well known in the theatre, from which he draws much of his musical composition.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] For two decades, he served as the music director of the Rustaveli Theatre in Tbilisi. He composed an opera Music for the Living, in collaboration with Rustaveli director Robert Sturua, and in December 1999, the opera was restaged for the Deutsches National Theater in Weimar."Ghia Kancheli - Ascetic with Energy of Maximalist". davisvenot.ge, 2008. Retrieved 2 April 2010.
He has written music for dozens of films, many of them well known in the Russian-speaking world but virtually unknown outside it,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] such as Georgi Daneliya's science fiction cult hit Kin-dza-dza!.
