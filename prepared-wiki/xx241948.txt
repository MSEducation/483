 The mysterious J.J. Phillips is one of my literary heroes, and one of Exquisite Corpseâ€™s consecrated writers. We have used our best critical acumen for the small task of describing briefly what she does, but as for coming close, brighter minds are working at being born. Suffice it to say, that every one of her works is a finely machined word-machine, precise both visually and functionally.[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.corpse.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=496&Itemid=65| work=Exquisite Corpse| author=Andrei Codrescu | title=Book Reviews [/tpl]
