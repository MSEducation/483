[[Fine-structure constant]]

CATEGORIES: Electromagnetism, Concepts in physics, Fundamental constants, Dimensionless numbers

In physics, the fine-structure constant, commonly denoted α, is a fundamental physical constant, namely the coupling constant characterizing the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. Being a dimensionless quantity, it has the same numerical value in all systems of units. Arnold Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant in 1916.
The currently accepted value of α is [tpl]physconst|alpha|round=auto|after=.[/tpl]

==Definition==

Three equivalent definitions of α in terms of other fundamental physical constants are:
where:
In electrostatic cgs units, the unit of electric charge, the statcoulomb, is defined so that the Coulomb constant, ke, or the permittivity factor, 4πε0, is 1 and dimensionless. Then the expression of the fine-structure constant becomes the abbreviated
which is an expression commonly appearing in physics literature.
In natural units, commonly used in high energy physics, where ε0 = c = ħ = 1, the value of the fine-structure constant isPeskin, M.; Schroeder, D. (1995). An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory. Westview Press. ISBN 0-201-50397-2. p. 125.

==Measurement==

The 2010 CODATA recommended value of α isP.J. Mohr, B.N. Taylor, and D.B. Newell (2011), "The 2010 CODATA Recommended Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants" (Web Version 6.0). This database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. Available: http://physics.nist.gov/constants 02-Jun-2011 21:00:12 EDT. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
This has a relative standard uncertainty of 0.32 parts per billion.
For reasons of convenience, historically the value of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant is often specified. The 2010 CODATA recommended value is given by
While the value of α can be estimated from the values of the constants appearing in any of its definitions, the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a way to measure α directly using the quantum Hall effect or the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the dimensionless magnetic moment of the electron and the fine-structure constant α (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as "Landé g-factor" and symbolized as g). The most precise value of α obtained experimentally (as of 2012) is based on a measurement of g using a one-electron so-called "quantum cyclotron" apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved 12,672 tenth-order Feynman diagrams:[ref]

This measurement of α has a precision of 0.25 parts per billion. This value and uncertainty are about the same as the latest experimental results.[tpl]cite journal|author1=Rym Bouchendira|author2=Pierre Cladé|author3=Saïda Guellati-Khélifa|author4=François Nez|author5=François Biraben|title=New determination of the fine-structure constant and test of the quantum electrodynamics|year=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.080801|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=106|issue=8|arxiv=1012.3627|bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106h0801B [/tpl]

==Physical interpretations==

The fine-structure constant, α, has several physical interpretations. α is:
When perturbation theory is applied to quantum electrodynamics, the resulting perturbative expansions for physical results are expressed as sets of power series in α. Because α is much less than one, higher powers of α are soon unimportant, making the perturbation theory extremely practical in this case. On the other hand, the large value of the corresponding factors in quantum chromodynamics makes calculations involving the strong nuclear force extremely difficult.
According to the theory of the renormalization group, the value of the fine-structure constant (the strength of the electromagnetic interaction) grows logarithmically as the energy scale is increased. The observed value of α is associated with the energy scale of the electron mass; the electron is a lower bound for this energy scale because it (and the positron) is the lightest charged object whose quantum loops can contribute to the running. Therefore 1/137.036 is the value of the fine-structure constant at zero energy. Moreover, as the energy scale increases, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction approaches that of the other two fundamental interactions, a fact important for grand unification theories. If quantum electrodynamics were an exact theory, the fine-structure constant would actually diverge at an energy known as the Landau pole. This fact makes quantum electrodynamics inconsistent beyond the perturbative expansions.

===Classical considerations===

The fine-structure constant, α, expresses the strength of the electrodynamic interaction. It can already be determined with mainly classical considerations. If the electron is described in a classical model by the circulation of a massless charge on a circular track with radius r it is embedded in its own synchrotron radiation field
.
with momentum p, total energy E, circulation period T, and λ the Compton wavelength which is the wavelength of the fundamental mode of the synchrotron radiation.

==History==

Arnold Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant in 1916, as part of his theory of the relativistic deviations of atomic spectral lines from the predictions of the Bohr model. The first physical interpretation of the fine-structure constant α was as the ratio of the velocity of the electron in the first circular orbit of the relativistic Bohr atom to the speed of light in the vacuum. Equivalently, it was the quotient between the minimum angular momentum allowed by relativity for a closed orbit, and the minimum angular momentum allowed for it by quantum mechanics. It appears naturally in Sommerfeld's analysis, and determines the size of the splitting or fine-structure of the hydrogenic spectral lines.
The fine-structure constant so intrigued physicist Wolfgang Pauli that he collaborated with psychiatrist Carl Jung in an extraordinary quest to understand its significance.

==Is the fine-structure constant actually constant?==

While the fine-structure constant is known to approach 1/128 at interaction energies above 80 GeV,[ref]

</ref>
physicists have pondered for many years whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, i.e., whether or not its value differs by location and over time. Specifically, a varying α has been proposed as a way of solving problems in cosmology and astrophysics.[ref]

[/ref]  More recently, theoretical interest in varying constants (not just α) has been motivated by string theory and other such proposals for going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The first experimental tests of this question examined the spectral lines of distant astronomical objects, and the products of radioactive decay in the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor. The findings were consistent with no change.[ref]

More recently, improved technology has made it possible to probe the value of α at much larger distances and to a much greater accuracy. In 1999, a team led by John K. Webb of the University of New South Wales claimed the first detection of a variation in α.[ref]
