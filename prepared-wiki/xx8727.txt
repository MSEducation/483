Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of basketball, began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the International Netball Federation (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 national teams organized into five global regions.
Games are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold onto it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.
Netball is most popular in Commonwealth nations, specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries. Major transnational competitions take place, including the Netball Superleague in Great Britain and the ANZ Championship in Australia and New Zealand. Three major competitions take place internationally: the quadrennial World Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the yearly World Netball Series. In 1995, netball became an International Olympic Committee recognised sport.

==History==

Netball emerged from early versions of basketball and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football ball that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.[tpl]harvnb|Grundy|Shackelford|2007|p=13[/tpl] Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical Education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Jobling |first1=Ian |last2=Barham |first2=Pamela |title=The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891–1939 |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=November 1991|pages=30–48 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf |ref=harv[/tpl] The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.
Martina Bergman-Österberg introduced a version of basketball in 1893 to her female students at the Physical Training College in Hampstead, London.[tpl]harvnb|McIntosh|1968|p=292[/tpl] The rules of the game were modified at the college over several years: the game moved outdoors and was played on grass; the baskets were replaced by rings that had nets; and in 1897 and 1899, rules from women's basketball in the United States were incorporated.[tpl]harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=13[/tpl] Madame Österberg's new sport acquired the name "net ball".[tpl]cite web |author=England Netball |title=History of England Netball (1891–2008) |url=http://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] The first codified rules of netball were published in 1901 by the Ling Association, later the Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Tracy |title=Gendering Sport: The Development of Netball in Australia |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/2001/st1801/ST1801i.pdf |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=November 2001|pages=57–74 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Summers|2007|p=165[/tpl] From England, netball spread to other countries in the British Empire. Variations of the rules and even names for the sport arose in different areas: "women's (outdoor) basketball" arrived in Australia around 1900 and in New Zealand from 1906,[tpl]cite web |author=Netball New Zealand |title=History |url=http://www.mynetball.co.nz/netball-nz/about-netball/111-history.html |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] while "netball" was being played in Jamaican schools by 1909.[tpl]cite web |author=Jamaica Netball Association |title=The History of Netball |url=http://jamaicanetball.org.jm/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=74 |accessdate=13 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl]
From the start, it was considered socially appropriate for women to play netball; netball's restricted movement appealed to contemporary notions of women's participation in sports, and the sport was distinct from potential rival male sports.[tpl]harvnb|McCrone|1988|pp=148–9[/tpl] Netball became a popular women's sport in countries where it was introduced and spread rapidly through school systems. School leagues and domestic competitions emerged during the first half of the 20th century,[tpl]cite web |author=School Sport Australia |title=Netball |url=http://www.schoolsport.edu.au/about/sportinfo/netball.aspx |year=2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=International Federation of Netball Associations |year=2010e |title=Netball Weekly Roundup |url=http://www.netball.org/news.aspx?id=441 |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=5 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] and in 1924 the first national governing body was established in New Zealand. International competition was initially hampered by a lack of funds and varying rules in different countries. Australia hosted New Zealand in the first international game of netball in Melbourne on 20 August 1938; Australia won 40–11. Efforts began in 1957 to standardise netball rules globally: by 1960 international playing rules had been standardised, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball, later the International Netball Federation (INF), was formed to administer the sport worldwide.[tpl]cite web |author=International Federation of Netball Associations |title=About IFNA |url=http://www.netball.org/ifna.aspx |accessdate=23 August 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl]

In Australia, the term women's basketball was used to refer to both netball and basketball.[tpl]harvnb|Pollard|1968|p=59[/tpl] During the 1950s and 1960s, a movement arose to change the Australian name of the game from women's basketball to netball in order to avoid confusion between the two sports. The Australian Basketball Union offered to pay the costs involved to alter the name, but the netball organisation rejected the change. In 1970, the Council of the All Australia Netball Association officially changed the name to "netball" in Australia.
In 1963, the first international tournament was held in Eastbourne, England. Originally called the World Tournament, it later became known as the World Netball Championships.[tpl]harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=19[/tpl] Following the first tournament, one of the organisers, Miss R. Harris, declared,[tpl]quote|England could learn from the mistakes in the past from the empty stands at Eastbourne. To get the right publicity and the right status desired, the game must emerge from the school playground. Netball should be part of a sports centre where social events could also be held.[/tpl]
The World Netball Championships have been held every four years since, most recently in 2011. The World Youth Netball Championships started in Canberra in 1988, and have been held roughly every four years since. In 1995, the International Olympic Committee designated netball as an Olympic recognised sport. Three years later it debuted at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. Other international competitions also emerged in the late 20th century, including the Nations Cup and the Asian Netball Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org.my/museum/hof/ind/nors.htm|title=Norminshah Sabirin|publisher=Olympic Council of Malaysia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netball.org/news.aspx?id=147|title=Singapore victorious in 4 Nations Netball Cu|date=23 December 2006|publisher=International Federation of Netball Associations|accessdate=22 June 2011[/tpl]

===Gender===

As of 2006, the IFNA recognises only women's netball.[tpl]cite web |last=Turk |first=Peter |title=History of Men's Netball |url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-2729-0-0-0&sID=26574 |publisher=International Mens and Mixed Netball Challenge Cup |accessdate=24 August 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] Men's netball teams exist in some areas but attract less attention from sponsors and spectators.[tpl]harvnb|Tagg|2008|p=409[/tpl] Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams to compete in the Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union.[tpl]harvnb|Davis|Davis|2006|p=4[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SPORT/10/07/rugby.wcup.bground/|title=Humble start spawns global giant|newspaper=CNN|author= Craig Francis|date=9 October 2003[/tpl] Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.[tpl]harvnb|Tagg|2008|p=411[/tpl] Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.
An all-transgender netball team from Indonesia competed at the 1994 Gay Games in New York City.[tpl]harvnb|Altman|2001|p=100[/tpl] The team had been the Indonesian national champions. At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with the highest rates of transgender athletes participating.[tpl]harvnb|Symons|Hemphill|2006|p=122[/tpl] There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender. They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with transgender players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.

==Description and rules==

The objective of a game is to score more goals than the opposition. Goals are scored when a team member positioned in the attacking shooting circle shoots the ball through the goal ring. The goal rings are [tpl]convert|380|mm[/tpl] in diameter and sit atop [tpl]convert|3.05|m|adj=on[/tpl]-high goal posts that have no backboards. A [tpl]convert|4.9|m|adj=on[/tpl]-radius semi-circular "shooting circle" is an area at each end of the court. The goal posts are located within the shooting circle. Each team defends one shooting circle and attacks the other.[tpl]cite web |author=Netball Australia |title=Court & venue specifications |publisher =Netball Australia |url=http://www.netball.asn.au/extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] The netball court is [tpl]convert|30.5|m[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|15.25|m[/tpl] wide, and divided lengthwise into thirds. The ball is usually made of leather or rubber, measures [tpl]convert|680|to|710|mm[/tpl] in circumference, and weighs [tpl]convert|397|to|454|g[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Murrary|2008|p=186[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Davis|Davis|2006|p=6[/tpl] A normal game consists of four 15-minute quarters[tpl]harvnb|Davis|Davis|2006|p=5[/tpl] and can be played outdoors or in a covered stadium.
Each team is allowed seven players on the court.[tpl]cite web |author=International Netball |url=http://www.internationalnetball.com/netball_rules.html |title=netball rules |date=September 2006|work=|publisher=International Netball |accessdate=28 February 2011|ref=harv[/tpl] Each player is assigned a specific position, which limits their movement to a certain area of the court. A "bib" worn by each player contains a two letter abbreviation of indicating this position.[tpl]harvnb|Davis|Davis|2006|p=7[/tpl] Only two positions are permitted in the attacking shooting circle, and can therefore shoot for a goal. Similarly, only two positions are permitted in the defensive shooting circle; they try to prevent the opposition from shooting goals. Other players are restricted to two thirds of the court, with the exception of the Centre, who may move anywhere on the court except for a shooting circle.[tpl]harvnb|Hickey|Navin|2007|p=34[/tpl]
At the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These "centre passes" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.[tpl]harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|p=xiii[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Slade|2009|p=98[/tpl] The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least [tpl]convert|90|cm[/tpl] away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.[tpl]harvnb|Hickey|Navin|2007|p=31[/tpl] If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.[tpl]harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|pp=15–19[/tpl]

==Variants==

===Indoor netball===

Indoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.[tpl]harvnb|Alswang|2003|p=2[/tpl]
Different forms of indoor netball exist. In a seven-per-side version called "action netball", seven players per team play with rules similar to netball. However, a game is split into 15-minute halves with a three-minute break in between. This version is played in Australia,[tpl]cite web |title=Indoor Netball Australia Rule Book |author=Indoor Netball Australia |year=2003 |url=http://www.indoornetball.org.au/images/stories/rules/INARULEBOOK_V2010.PDF |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] New Zealand,[tpl]cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=7-a-side Indoor Netball Official Rule Book |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |date=January 2008|accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] South Africa[tpl]harvnb|Alswang|2003[/tpl] and England.[tpl]cite web |author=Action Indoor Sports (England) |title=Action Netball: 7 A-Side |url=http://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl]
A six-per-side version of the sport is also played in New Zealand. Two Centres per team can play in the whole court except the shooting circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to one half of the court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot from outside the shooting circle for a two-point goal.[tpl]cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=Indoor Netball Official Rule Book (6-a-side) |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/6_aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_Oct_2009.pdf |date=October 2009|accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165 |author=Planet Sport |title=Indoor Netball at Planet Sports |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110724194100/http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165| archivedate =24 July 2011[/tpl]
A five-per-side game is also common in indoor netball. Players can move throughout the court, with the exception of the shooting circles, which are restricted to certain attacking or defending players.

===Fast5===

Fast5 (originally called Fastnet) is a variation on the rules of netball designed to make games faster and more television-friendly. The World Netball Series promotes it to raise the sport's profile and attract more spectators and greater sponsorship.[tpl]Cite news |author=The Jamaica Star |title=Rhone excited about World Netball Series |publisher=The Jamaica Star (online) |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20090112/sports/sports4.html |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |last=Irvine |first=Mairi |title=New Style Netball to be Held in the UK |publisher=UK Sport |url=http://www.uksport.gov.uk/news/netball_as_never_seen_before/ |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2009|ref=harv[/tpl] The game is much shorter, with each quarter lasting only six minutes and only a two-minute break between quarters.[tpl]cite web |author=World Netball Series |title=Rules |url=http://www.worldnetballseries.com/rules |year=2010 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] The coaches can give instructions from the sideline during play, and unlimited substitutions are allowed. Like six-per-side indoor netball, attacking players may shoot two-point goals from outside the shooting circle.[tpl]cite web |author=International Federation of Netball Associations |year=2009e |title=Fastnet: Official Rules Of The International Federation |url=http://www.netball.org/documents/FAST%20NET_RULES_SUMMARY_270709.doc |date=27 July 2009 |accessdate=14 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] Each team can separately nominate one "power play" quarter, in which each goal scored by that team is worth double points and the centre pass is taken by the team that conceded the goal.

===For children===

Netball has been adapted in several ways to meet children's needs. The rules for children are similar to those for adults, but various aspects of the game (such as the length of each quarter, goal height, and ball size) are modified.
Fun Net is a version of netball developed by Netball Australia for five- to seven-year-olds. It aims to improve basic netball skills using games and activities.[tpl]harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=50[/tpl] The Fun Net program runs for 8–16 weeks. There are no winners or losers. The goal posts are [tpl]convert|2.4|m[/tpl] high, and a smaller ball is used.[tpl]cite web |author=NSW Department of Sport & Recreation |title=Netball |year=1997 |url=http://www.cybersydney.com.au/kids/sar/netball.html |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl]
Netball Australia also runs a modified game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds.[tpl]harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=51[/tpl] The goal height and ball size are the same as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position.[tpl]cite web |last=Plaisted |first=Val |title=A comparison of the effectiveness of the modified with the traditional approach to junior netball |url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15665/1/Plaisted_1989compressed.pdf |year=1989 |publisher=Victoria University |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game. Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.
A version called High Five Netball is promoted by the All England Netball Association. It is aimed at 9- to 11-year-old girls and includes only five positions.[tpl]Cite news |author=BBC Sport Academy |title=Get playing high five netball! |publisher=BBC Sport Academy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/netball/give_it_a_go/newsid_2933000/2933617.stm |accessdate=27 February 2011 |ref=harv |date=11 April 2003[/tpl] The players swap positions during the game.[tpl]cite web |author=East Grinstead High Fives Netball |url=http://www.egjnl.org.uk/High_Five.html |title=Hi-5 Information |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] When a player is not on the court, she is expected to help the game in some other way, such as being the timekeeper or scorekeeper. High Five Netball has four six-minute quarters.

==Governance==

The recognised international governing body of netball is the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA), based in Manchester, England. Founded in 1960, the organisation was initially called the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball. The IFNA is responsible for compiling world rankings for national teams, maintaining the rules for netball and organising several major international competitions.
As of July 2012, the IFNA has 49 full and 24 associate national members in five regions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netball.org/AssociateMembers.aspx|title=Associate Members|publisher=International Federation of Netball Associations|accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] Each region has an IFNA Regional Federation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netball.org/IFNA.aspx?id=31|title=IFNA Regional Federations|publisher=International Federation of Netball Associations|accessdate=24 May 2011[/tpl]
The IFNA is affiliated with the General Association of International Sports Federations, the International World Games Association and the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations. It is also a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code.[tpl]cite web |author=International Federation of Netball Associations |title=IFNA: Anti-doping |url=http://www.netball.org/IFNA.aspx?id=110 |accessdate=23 March 2011|ref=harv[/tpl]

==Major championships==

There are three major international netball competitions.
Netball's important competition is the World Netball Championships, held every four years. It was first held in 1963 at the Chelsea College of Physical Education at Eastbourne, England, with 11 nations competing. Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to win a championship title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points at the end of the round robin, and there were no finals.[tpl]cite web |author=World Netball Championships 2011 Singapore |title=History |url=http://www.wnc2011.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160&Itemid=213 |year=2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
