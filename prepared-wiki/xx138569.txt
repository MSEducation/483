==Fictional character biography==

Mock is born in Waldenburg in Silesia in 1883, to humble shoemaker Willibald Mock. After graduating from a local gymnasium, Mock matriculates at the University of Breslau, but does not graduate. Instead he joins the police force and quickly advances through its ranks, partially due to protection from the local masonic lodge. Mock remains in service until the very end of the Siege of Breslau, after which he reappears in the German Democratic Republic in 1950 only to escape to the United States shortly afterwards. He dies in 1960 from lung cancer in New York.
