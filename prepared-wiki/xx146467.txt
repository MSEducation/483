The Közlekedési Múzeum or Transport Museum of Budapest is one of Europe’s oldest transportation collections.
It is a must for railway connoisseurs and amateurs. This museum has a unique collection of locomotives and wagons on a 1:5 scale. This means that a locomotive of, for example, 10 m length is reproduced with all details in a 2 m length model. The models represent a wide range of railway technology. The museum shows also a locomotive and wagon in real size with a railway station of the 1900s.
In other parts of the museum are shown :
The history of town traffic shows the public traffic in Buda and Pest before the appearance of trams and buses. The Omnibusz and the first trams in Budapest.
