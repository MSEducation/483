==Career==

In 1962, after his father purchased the license for Miami's WSVN Channel 7 for $3.4 million, then an NBC affiliate, Ansin became an executive vice president at Sunbeam Television Corp, the holding company for the television station. After his father's death in 1971, he became Sunbeam's president In 1988, WSVN lost its affiliation with NBC and Ansin, after rebuking then CBS chairman Laurence Tisch's offer to purchase the station, found himself without network sponsorship. The station affiliated with the up-start Fox Network and pulled down supplemental news broadcasts from the newly launched CNN satellite network. Rather than follow the conventional approach used by successful independent stations (morning kids' shows, afternoon game shows, evening movies, and syndicated sitcoms), Ansin instead decided to focus on news. Instead of dry and stoic presentation, he and his news director, Joel Cheatwood, created the now ubiquitous Miami News Style with fast-paced reporting, crime-lead stories, live breaking coverage, and pretty presenters. “If it bleeds, it leads” became an industry catch phrase. The approach was wildly successful and WSVN news soon became the market leader. WSVN reported $96 million in revenues in 2011
In 1993, returning to his childhood home, he bought Boston's WHDH Channel 7 in 1993. He implemented a less tabloid style than in Miami but still shortened the time spent on individual news stories, relied heavily on video and audio effects, and emphasized "on-the-spot" reporting. “When you finished watching a half-hour of Channel 7 news, you were excited as hell, but you couldn't remember what the news stories were.” In 2006, Sunbeam television purchased Boston's WLVI, a CW Television Network affiliate, from Tribune Broadcasting.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/105796-Tribune_Sells_Boston_Station.php | title=Tribune Sells Boston Station | work=Broadcasting & Cable | date=September 14, 2006 | accessdate=March 22, 2013 | author=Romano, Allison[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WO&p_theme=wo&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1161B024D80BE628&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=WLVI's main man takes the high road | work=Worcester Telegram & Gazette | date=December 14, 2006 | accessdate=March 22, 2013[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required|via=NewsBank[/tpl]
