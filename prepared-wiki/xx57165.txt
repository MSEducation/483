James Beattie FRSE (25 October 1735 – 18 August 1803) was a Scottish poet, moralist and philosopher.
He was born the son of a shopkeeper and small farmer at Laurencekirk in the Mearns, and educated at Aberdeen University.  In 1760, he was appointed  Professor of moral philosophy there as a result of the interest of his intimate friend, Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo.  In the following year he published a volume of poems, The Judgment of Paris (1765), which attracted attention. The two works, however, which brought him most fame were An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, and his poem of The Minstrel. The Essay, intended as an answer to David Hume, had great immediate success, and led to an introduction to the King, a pension of £200, and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford. The first book of The Minstrel was published in 1771 and the second in 1774, and constitutes his true title to remembrance, winning him the praise of Samuel Johnson. It contains much beautiful descriptive writing.
Beattie was prominent in arguing against the institution of slavery, notably in his Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth (1770) and Elements of Moral Science.[tpl]cite web|title= A North East Story: Abolishing the Slave Trade| url =http://www.abdn.ac.uk/slavery/7p1.htm | accessdate = 2009-02-03 [/tpl]
Beattie was an amateur cellist and member of the Aberdeen Musical Society. He considered questions of music philosophy in his essay On Poetry and Music (written 1762, published 1776), which was republished several times and translated into French in 1798. His poem "The Hermit" was set to music by Tommaso Giordani (1778).[tpl]GroveOnline|James Beattie|David Johnson|January 14|2014[/tpl]
Beattie underwent much domestic sorrow in the death of his wife and two promising sons, which broke down his own health and spirits.
A biographical sketch, An Account of the Life of James Beattie, LL.D., was published in 1804 by Alexander Bower.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Bower, Alexander|last=Sutton|first=Charles William|authorlink=Charles William Sutton|volume=[/tpl]
The poet Robert Burns informed Mrs Frances Dunlop in a letter that the idea of using Coila as the name of his poetic muse first came to him from Beattie's use of a muse named 'Scota' in his Scots language poem of 1768 titled To Mr Alexander at Lochlee.
