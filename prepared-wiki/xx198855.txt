Genesee Park is a park in Jefferson County, Colorado. It is the largest park in the Denver Mountain Parks system, with a total of [tpl]convert|2413|acre[/tpl]. Interstate 70 traverses the park between exits 252 and 254 along the Lariat Loop Scenic & Historic Byway.  On I-70 just west of exit 254, there are scenic overlooks for both directions for viewing the historic Bison herd, which live on maintained pastures on the north and south sides of I-70.  The land for Genesee Park was initially purchased in 1912 and the park area was largely complete by 1926.
The park contains two mountains, Genesee Mountain at [tpl]convert|8284|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level and Bald Mountain at [tpl]convert|7988|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level. The park also contains forests of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. The park's bison herd is owned by the City and County of Denver, Colorado. Some of the original bison were acquired from Yellowstone National Park in 1914.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/parks/MountainParks/GeneseePark/tabid/434906/Default.aspx|title=Denver Mountain Parks: Genesee Park|date=2011-11-05|publisher=City & County of Denver[/tpl] 
Chief Hosa Lodge, designed by Jacques Benedict, was built in 1918 near what is now Exit 253. A historical point of interest, it is currently used as an event facility. The nearby Chief Hosa Campground serves recreational travelers each year between May and September. A large stone picnic shelter near Genesee Mountain was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939; it is also available for group use by reservation.
