==History==

The manor of Bramall dates from the Saxon period, when it was held as two separate estates by two Saxon freemen, Brun and Hacun [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]. In 1070, William the Conqueror subdued the north-west of England, and divided the land among his followers. The manor of "Bramale" was given to Hamon de Massey[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl], who eventually became the first Baron of Dunham Massey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stockport.gov.uk/services/environment/planningbuilding/conservationheritage/conservationareas/conservationareaappraisalsmanagementplans/bramhallpark  |title=Bramhall Park (2005) |publisher=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council |accessdate=11 March 2014[/tpl] The earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the Domesday Book as "Bramale", a name derived from the Old English words brom meaning broom, both indigenous to the area, and halh meaning nook or secret place, probably by water. De Masci received the manor as wasteland, since it had been devastated by William the Conqueror's subdual. By the time of the Domesday survey, the land was recovering and cultivated again.Dean, p14
In 1875 Bramhall was one of eight civil parishes of Cheshire to be included in the Stockport Rural rural sanitary district. The sanitary district became the Stockport Rural District in 1894. The parish was abolished in 1900 and its former area became part of the Hazel Grove and Bramhall civil parish and urban district. In 1974 the district was abolished, under the Local Government Act 1972, and its former area was transferred to Greater Manchester to be combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/maps/districtstext.html
