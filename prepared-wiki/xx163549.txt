==History==

Prior to the involvement of Saracens, the complex perhaps achieved its greatest fame when London Crusaders (now the London Broncos) made the athletics stadium their home for two seasons of second division professional rugby league between 1993 and 1994. 
The stadium is today home to two athletics clubs, Barnet & District AC and Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers. Before Saracens took over the stadium, it was also home to non-league football club Kentish Town.
In November 2010, Saracens, searching for a new home after their landlord Watford F.C. activated a break clause in their groundshare agreement, revealed they were in discussions with Barnet Borough Council about a move to the stadium. Under the plan, Saracens would redevelop the stadium into a modern facility with 3,000 permanent seats. Demountable stands would allow a capacity of 10,000 for rugby matches whilst retaining the stadium's ability to host athletics events. Finally, the plans called for the use of an artificial pitch, the first in English rugby union. Widnes Vikings introduced the first in English rugby as a whole in when they used it for the 2012 Super League season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/my_club/saracens/9175247.stm |title=Saracens set out Copthall Stadium plans |work=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl]
