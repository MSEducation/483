==History==

===Early years (1945–1969)===

thumb|right|Sam Walton's original Walton's Five and Dime store in Bentonville, Arkansas now serving as the Walmart Visitor CenterIn 1945 a businessman and former J. C. Penney employee, Sam Walton, purchased a branch of the Ben Franklin Stores from the Butler Brothers.[tpl]cite book|author=Walton, Sam; Huey, John|title=Sam Walton: Made in America: My Story|place=New York|publisher=Bantam|year=1993|isbn=978-0-553-56283-5[/tpl] Sam's focus was on selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower-profit margin. He portrayed it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks, because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than the ones used by other stores. He passed on the savings in the product pricing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/2375.html|title=Sam Walton: Great From the Start[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] HBS Working Knowledge|author=Richard S.

Within the fifth year, the store was making $250,000 in revenue. When the lease for the location expired, he couldn't reach an agreement for renewal, so he opened a new Ben Franklin franchise in Bentonville, Arkansas and called it "Walton's Five and Dime."[tpl]cite news|author=Frank, T.A.|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13796|title=A Brief History of Wal-Mart|work=Washington Monthly|date=April 1, 2006|accessdate=July 24, 2006[/tpl]
On July 2, 1962, Walton opened the first Walmart Discount City store located at 719 W. Walnut Street in Rogers, Arkansas. The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antique mall, while the company's "Store #1" — since converted to a Supercenter concept — is located several blocks west down Walnut Street as of 2013. Within its first five years, the company expanded to 24 stores across Arkansas and reached $12.6 million in sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/walmart/transform/cron.html |title=The Rise of Walmart|work=Frontline: Is Wal-Mart Good for America?|date=November 16, 2004|accessdate=September 19, 2007[/tpl] In 1968, it opened its first stores outside Arkansas, in Sikeston, Missouri and Claremore, Oklahoma."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.walmartfacts.com/content/default.aspx?id=3|title=The Wal-Mart Timeline|publisher=Wal-Mart (published on walmartfacts.com|accessdate=July 24, 2006[/tpl]

===Incorporation and growth as a regional power (1969–1990)===

The company was incorporated as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. on October 31, 1969. In 1970, it opened its home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38 stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2 million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 at a market price of $47. By this time, Walmart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As it moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125 stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3 million. Walmart opened its first Texas store in Mount Pleasant on November 11, 1975.[tpl]cite news|author=Halkias, Maria|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10D9531DE09EB928&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|title=Living with Walmart 30 years later, Texas both cheers and fears discount behemoth Lone Star State has been changed, as has giant retailer|work= The Dallas Morning News|date=October 30, 2005|accessdate=February 22, 2011[/tpl]
In the 1980s, Walmart continued to grow rapidly, and by its 25th anniversary in 1987 there were 1,198 stores with sales of $15.9 billion and 200,000 associates. This year also marked the completion of the company's satellite network, a $24 million investment linking all operating units of the company with its Bentonville office via two-way voice and data transmission and one-way video communication. At that time, it was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate to stores.[tpl]cite web|author=Ranade, Sudhanshu|url= http://www.blonnet.com/2005/07/17/stories/2005071700141600.htm|title=Satellite Adds Speed to Wal-Mart|work=The Hindu Business Line|date=July 17, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2006[/tpl] In 1988, Sam Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by David Glass.[tpl]cite news|author=Longo, Donald|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n4_v27/ai_6348147|title=Wal-Mart Hands CEO Crown to Glass[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] David Glass|work=Discount Store News|date=February 15, 1988|accessdate=April 1, 2008[/tpl] Walton remained as Chairman of the Board, and the company also rearranged other people in senior positions.

===Retail hegemony and rise to multinational status (1990-present)===

By 1988 Walmart was more profitable than its rivals Kmart and Sears and was the dominant retailer in the Bible Belt; by 1990 it outsold both in terms of revenue and became the largest US retailer in sales revenue.
Prior to the summer of 1990 Walmart had no foothold on the West Coast or Northeast (aside from a single Sam's Club in New Jersey opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year it opened its first stores in California and Pennsylvania respectively, making the corporation present from coast to coast. By the mid-1990s it was far and away the most powerful retailer in the US and spread to Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994.Jacques, Peter. (1970-01-01) Wal-Mart or World-Mart? A Teaching Case Study | Peter Jacques. Academia.edu. Retrieved on 2013-12-06. It spread to New England, Maryland, Delaware, Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific Northwest last, Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1996.

As Walmart grew rapidly into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about the effect of its stores on local communities, particularly small towns with many "mom and pop" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a Professor of Economics at Iowa State University, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening.Stone, Kenneth E.

However, in another study, he compared the changes to what small town shops had faced in the past[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] including the development of the railroads, the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog, as well as the arrival of shopping malls[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Walmart arrives.

===Initiatives (2005–present)===

In October 2005, Walmart announced it would implement several environmental measures to increase energy efficiency. The primary goals included spending $500 million a year to increase fuel efficiency in Walmart's truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in seven years, reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent, and cut solid waste from U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent in three years. CEO Lee Scott said that Walmart's goal was to be a "good steward for the environment" and ultimately use only renewable energy sources and produce zero waste.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9815727/|title=Is Wal-Mart Going Green?|publisher=MSNBC|date=October 25, 2005|accessdate=November 8, 2007[/tpl] The company also designed three new experimental stores in McKinney, Texas, Aurora, Colorado, and Las Vegas, Nevada with wind turbines, photovoltaic solar panels, biofuel-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and xeriscape gardens.[tpl]cite news|author=Berner, Robert|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf20050922_6448_db016.htm|title=Can Wal-Mart Wear a White Hat?|work=BusinessWeek|date=September 22, 2005|accessdate=July 24, 2006[/tpl] Despite much criticism of its environmental record, Walmart took a few steps in what some view as a positive direction, which included becoming the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world, as well as reducing packaging and energy costs.[tpl]cite news|author=Gunther, Mark|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/25/news/companies/wal-mart-short.fortune/|title=Wal-Mart sees green|publisher=CNN|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=November 8, 2007[/tpl] Walmart also spent nearly a year working with outside consultants to discover the company's total environmental impact and find where they could improve. They discovered, for example, that by eliminating excess packaging on their toy line Kid Connection, they could not only save $2.4 million a year in shipping costs but also 3,800 trees and a million barrels of oil. Walmart has also recently created its own electric company in Texas, Texas Retail Energy, and plans to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices. Through this new venture, the company expects to save $15 million annually and also lays the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future.[tpl]cite web|author=Souder, Elizabeth|url= http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/817594/will_walmart_sell_electricity_one_day/index.html|title=Will Wal-Mart Sell Electricity One Day?|publisher=RedOrbit|date=January 28, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2008[/tpl]
In March 2006, Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic.

On September 12, 2007, Walmart introduced new advertising with the slogan, "Save Money Live Better", replacing the "Always Low Prices, Always" slogan, which it had used for the previous 19 years. Global Insight, which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Walmart's price level reduction resulted in savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006, which equated to $957 per person or $2,500 per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of $2,329).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/us-walmart-advertising-idUSWEN091820070912|title=Wal-Mart rolling out new company slogan|publisher=Reuters|date= September 12, 2007|accessdate=December 7, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CkWuovb7|archivedate=December 7, 2012[/tpl]

==Operating divisions==

Walmart's operations are organized into three divisions: Walmart Stores U.S., Sam's Club, and Walmart International."[tpl]PDFlink|Walmart 2010 Annual Report|13.4 MB[/tpl]." Walmart. 2010. Retrieved October 22, 2010. The company does business in nine different retail formats: supercenters, food and drugs, general merchandise stores, bodegas (small markets), cash and carry stores, membership warehouse clubs, apparel stores, soft discount stores and restaurants.

===Walmart Stores U.S.===

Walmart Stores U.S. is the company's largest division, accounting for $258 billion, or 63.8 percent of total sales for financial year 2010. It consists of three retail formats that have become commonplace in the United States: Discount Stores, Supercenters, and Walmart Markets. The retail department stores sell a variety of mostly non-grocery products, though emphasis has now shifted towards supercenters, which include more grocery items. This division also includes Walmart's online retailer, walmart.com.
In September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell generic drugs at just $4 per prescription. The pilot program was launched at stores in the Tampa, Florida area, and expanded to all stores in Florida by January 2007. While the average price of generics is $29 per prescription, compared to $102 for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing as an act of charity – instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6119292|title=Walmart to Sell Generic Drugs for $4|last=Silberner|first=Joanne|date=September 21, 2006|publisher=All Things Considered (NPR)|accessdate=March 10, 2009[/tpl] Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India and made by drug makers in the country, including Ranbaxy and Cipla.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=326184|title=Pharma firms boost Walmart revenues|publisher=Business Standard|date=June 16, 2008[/tpl]

Many of these stores also have a garden center, a pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a bank branch, a cell phone store and a fast food outlet, usually Subway, or McDonald's. Some also have gasoline stations.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/Walmart-to-offer-customers-discount-gas-as-prices-rise.html|title=Walmart to Offer Customers Discount Gas as Prices Rise| publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2012|author= Welch, David|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CkXOibVh|archivedate=December 7, 2012[/tpl]
In 1990, Walmart opened its first Bud's Discount City location in Bentonville. Bud's operated as a closeout store, much like Big Lots. Many locations were opened to fulfill leases in shopping centers as Walmart stores left and moved into newly built Supercenters. All of the Bud's Discount City stores closed or converted into Walmart Discount Stores by 1997.[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n15_v36/ai_19662401|title=Walmart shuttering 7-year old Bud's chain|accessdate=December 7, 2012[/tpl]

====Walmart Supercenter====

Walmart Supercenters are hypermarkets with size varying from [tpl]convert|98000|to|261000|sqft|m2|1[/tpl], with an average of about [tpl]convert|197000|sqft|m2|1[/tpl]. These stock everything a Walmart discount store does, and also include a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also have a garden center, pet shop, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, local bank branches (newer locations have Woodforest National Bank branches), and fast food outlets, usually Subway but sometimes Dunkin Donuts, McDonald's, Wendy's, Checker's, or  Blimpie. Many often featured McDonald's stores, but in 2007, Walmart announced to stop opening McDonald's restaurants at most of their newer stores. Most locations that opened up after the announcement had Subway as their restaurant. Some McDonald's inside the Walmarts were even replaced with Subway.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/13/walmart-dumps-mcdonalds-f_n_64322.html| work=Huffington Post | first=Michelle | last=Kung | title=Walmart Dumps McDonald's For Subway As In-Store Restaurateur | date=September 13, 2007[/tpl] Some also sell gasoline distributed by Murphy Oil Corporation (whose Walmart stations are branded as "Murphy USA"), Sunoco, Inc. ("Optima"), or Tesoro Corporation ("Mirastar").
The first Supercenter opened in 1988, in Washington, Missouri. A similar concept, Hypermart USA, opened in Garland, Texas a year earlier. All of the Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters, such as the first ones located in Garland TX and Bannister TX, which were both reopened as Walmarts.
[tpl]As of|2014|01[/tpl], there were 3,273 Walmart Supercenters in the United States. The largest Supercenter in the United States, covering [tpl]convert|260000|sqft|m2|1[/tpl] and two floors, is located in Crossgates Commons in Albany, New York.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.albany.com/news/walmart.cfm|title=Largest Walmart Supercenter In US Finds Home In Albany NY|publisher=Albany.com|accessdate= December 23, 2008[/tpl]
The "Supercenter" portion of the name on these stores has been phased out, simply referring to these stores as "Walmart", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008. The Supercentre portion of the name is still used on supercentres in Canada.

====Walmart Market====

Walmart Market is a chain of grocery stores that average about [tpl]convert|42000|sqft|m2|1[/tpl]. They are used to fill the gap between discount store and supercenters, offering a variety of products, which include full lines of groceries, pharmaceuticals, health and beauty aids, photo developing services, and a limited selection of general merchandise.
Previously branded as "Walmart Neighborhood Market", the first store opened in 1998, in Bentonville, Arkansas.

====Walmart Express====

Walmart Express is a smaller discount store, with a range of services, from simple grocery shopping, to check cashing, and even gasoline service. The concept is focused on small towns that are not able to support a larger store, and in large cities where physical space is at a premium.
Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012.
"This is about access to breadth of assortment", says Walmart's Anthony Hucker, vice president of strategy and business development.

===Sam's Club===

Sam's Club is a chain of warehouse clubs which sell groceries and general merchandise, often in large quantities. Sam's Club stores are "membership" stores and most customers buy annual memberships. There are three kinds of memberships of Sam's Club,Sam's Plus, Sam's Business and Sam's Savings. Each of those memberships will enable customers various types of benefits and convenience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dotcomol.com/2013/05/www-samsclub-com-sams-club-membership.html |title=Dotcomol |publisher=www.dotcomol.com |accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] However, non-members can make purchases either by buying a one-day membership or paying a surcharge based on the price of the purchase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pressroom.samsclub.com/content/?id=3&atg=524|title=About Sam's Club|publisher=Sam's Club|accessdate=November 1, 2007[/tpl] Some locations also sell gasoline.

Sam's Club has found a niche market in recent years as a supplier to small businesses. All Sam's Club stores are open early hours exclusively for business members and their old slogan was "We're in Business for Small Business." Their current[tpl]When|date=March 2011[/tpl] slogan is "Savings Made Simple" as Sam's Club attempts to attract a more diverse member base. In March 2009, the company announced that it plans to enter the electronic medical records business by offering a software package to physicians in small practices for $25,000.

In the mid-1990s Walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in the German retail market.
In 1997 Walmart took over the supermarket chain Wertkauf with its 21 stores for DEM750 million (€375 million)"Metro übernimmt Walmart". (in German). ka-news. August 3, 2006 and in 1998 Walmart took over 74 Interspar stores for DEM1.3 billion (€750 million)."Schnitte". (in German). Die Zeit."In Deutschland ein Zwerg". (in German). Stern. February 18, 2005.
The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among the companies which also used a similar low price strategy as Walmart. Because of this, Walmart's low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage. Also Walmart's corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers in Germany, particularly Walmart's "statement of ethics", which restricted relationships between employees and led to a public discussion in the media, resulting in a bad reputation for Walmart among customers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/549609.html|title=Auch Walmart-Mitarbeiter dürfen lieben|work=Stern|date=November 15, 2005|language=German[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article177942/Walmart-Mitarbeiter_duerfen_flirten.html|title=Walmart-Mitarbeiter dürfen flirten|language= German|publisher=Die Welt|date=November 15, 2005[/tpl]

In 2004, Walmart bought the 118 stores in the Bompreço supermarket chain in northeastern Brazil. In late 2005, it took control of the Brazilian operations of Sonae Distribution Group through its new subsidiary, WMS Supermercados do Brasil, thus acquiring control of the Nacional and Mercadorama supermarket chains, the leaders in the Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná states, respectively. None of these was rebranded. [tpl]As of|2014|01[/tpl], Walmart operates 61 Super-Bompreço stores, 39 Hiper-Bompreço stores.

[tpl]As of|2014|01[/tpl], Asda had 573 stores, including 147 from the 2010 Netto acquisition. In addition to small suburban Asda stores, larger stores are branded Asda Walmart Supercentres, as well as Asda Superstores and Asda Living.[tpl]cite web|title=Walmart Corporate: United Kingdom|url=http://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-business/locations/#/united-kingdom|publisher=Walmart|accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl]ASDA Careers: All about ASDA Stores.

====Controversy====

An April 2012 investigative report in The New York Times reported that a former executive of Walmart de Mexico alleged that, in September 2005, Walmart de Mexico had paid bribes via local fixers called gestores to officials throughout Mexico in order to obtain construction permits, information, and other favors. Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were raised that Walmart executives in the United States "hushed up" the allegations. Reportedly, bribes were given to rapidly obtain construction permits, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over its business competitors.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/business/at-Walmart-in-mexico-a-bribe-inquiry-silenced.html |title=Vast Mexican Bribery Case Hushed Up by Walmart After High-Level Struggle |publisher=The New York Times|author=David Barstow |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012[/tpl] A follow-up investigation by The New York Times, published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery.

===Private label brands===

About 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are private label store brands, or products offered by Walmart and produced through contracts with manufacturers. Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991 with the launch of Sam's Choice, a brand of drinks produced by Cott Beverages exclusively for Walmart. Sam's Choice quickly became popular, and by 1993 was the third most popular beverage brand in the United States.[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n19_v32/ai_14495621|title=Sam's Choice Climbs Beverage Brand List[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Walmart's Sam's American Choice Beverage Brand|work=Discount Store News|date=October 4, 1993|accessdate=April 20, 2007[/tpl] Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the US and Canada, and Smart Price in Britain.

==Corporate affairs==

Walmart is headquartered in the Wal-Mart Home Office complex in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company's business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at "always low prices." They refer to their employees as "associates". All Wal-Mart stores in the US and Canada also have designated "greeters" at the store entrance, a practice pioneered by founder Sam Walton and later copied by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.[tpl]cite book|last=Kendall|first=Gerald I.|title=Securing the future: strategies for exponential growth using the theory of constraints.|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=1-57444-197-3|page=106|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KgjTUtVixroC&pg=PA106&dq=walmart+greeter#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] For many years, associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest, but this was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with more modern and professional khaki pants and polo shirts. The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul for the store in an effort to increase sales and rejuvenate its stock price.[tpl]cite news|title=Wal-Mart Replaces Blue Vests|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3288829|accessdate=June 28, 2011|publisher=ABC News|date=June 18, 2007[/tpl]

The layaway location in most stores is now used for Wal-Mart's Site-To-Store program, which was introduced in March 2007.

===Competition===

In North America, Wal-Mart's primary competition includes department stores like Kmart, Publix, Target, ShopKo and Meijer, Canada's The Real Canadian Superstore and Giant Tiger, and Mexico's Comercial Mexicana and Soriana. Competitors of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club division are Costco, and the smaller BJ's Wholesale Club chain operating mainly in the eastern US. Wal-Mart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s also set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada. Some retail analysts see regional grocery store chain WinCo Foods as serious competition for Walmart.[tpl]cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2013/08/07/meet-the-low-key-low-cost-grocery-chain-being-called-wal-marts-worst-nightmare/|title=Meet the Low-Key, Low-Cost Grocery Chain Being Called ‘Walmart’s Worst Nightmare’|author=Tuttle, Brad|work=TIME|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013[/tpl] Several smaller retailers, primarily dollar stores, such as Family Dollar and Dollar General, have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Wal-Mart for home consumer sales.[tpl]cite news|author=Stilgoe, John|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/23/wal_mart_giant_can_be_tamed|title = Wal-Mart Giant Can Be Tamed|work=The Boston Globe|date=November 23, 2003|accessdate=January 11, 2006[/tpl] In 2004, Wal-Mart responded by testing its own dollar store concept, a subsection of some stores called "Pennies-n-Cents."[tpl]cite web|author=Berner, Robert|url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_19/b3882086.htm|title=Out-Discounting the Discounter|work=BusinessWeek|date=May 10, 2004[/tpl]
Wal-Mart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets. For example, in Germany it had captured just 2 percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained "a secondary player" behind Aldi with a 19 percent share.[tpl]cite web|author=Ewing, Jack|url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_15/b3928086_mz054.htm|title=Wal-Mart: Struggling in Germany|work=BusinessWeek|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=July 27, 2006[/tpl] When in July 2006, Wal-Mart announced its withdrawal from Germany, its stores were sold to German company Metro.

In May 2006, after entering the South Korean market in 1998, Wal-Mart withdrew and sold all 16 of its South Korean outlets to Shinsegae, a local retailer, for $882 million.

Wal-Mart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Wal-Mart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/walmart-low-prices-big-numbers/|title= Walmart: Low Prices, Big Numbers|publisher=IndustryLeaders|accessdate=December 16, 2012|author=Ann, Carrie|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CwmGVwgZ|archivedate= December 16, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl]

===Economic impact===

Kenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at Iowa State University, in a paper published in Farm Foundation in 1997, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Wal-Mart store opening. He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls. He concludes that small towns are more affected by "discount mass merchandiser stores" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever changing retail market can "co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment."
One study found Wal-Mart's entry into a new market has a profound impact on its retail competition. When a Wal-Mart opens in a new market, median sales drop 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores, according to the June 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0704-soda-wars-20100703,0,5230113.story|title=Wal-Mart Impact: Pop Price War Warns of Wal-Mart Impact for Chicago|author=Julie Wernau|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 4, 2010[/tpl]
A Loyola University Chicago study suggested that the impact a Wal-Mart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store. The leader of that study admits that this factor is stronger in smaller towns and doesn't apply to more urban areas saying "It'd be so tough to nail down what's up with Wal-Mart".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/22/AR2008062201717.html|title=When Wal-Mart Moves In, Neighborhood Businesses Suffer.

Dr Raj Patel, author of "Stuffed and Starved: Markets, Power and the Hidden Battle for the World Food System", said in a lecture at the University of Melbourne on September 18, 2007, that a study in Nebraska looked at two different Wal-Marts, the first of which had just arrived and "was in the process of driving everyone else out of business but, to do that, they cut their prices to the bone, very, very low prices". In the other Wal-Mart, "they had successfully destroyed the local economy, there was a sort of economic crater with Wal-Mart in the middle; and, in that community, the prices were 17 percent higher".[tpl]cite news|author=Patel, R.|date=September 18, 2007|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2009/2534576.htm|title=Food Glorious Food|publisher=Radio National|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl]

It argued that while Wal-Mart's low prices caused some existing businesses to close, the chain also created new opportunities for other small business, and so "the process of creative destruction unleashed by Wal-Mart has no statistically significant impact on the overall size of the small business sector in the United States."Sobel, Russell S.; Andrea M.

===Big data analytics===

As the largest retailer in the US, Walmart collects and analyzes an enormous amount of data on consumer's shopping habits. The big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits.
In April 2011, Walmart acquired Kosmix to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams. In August 2012, Walmart announced its Polaris search engine.

Despite the turnover rate the company still is able to affect unemployment rates.
