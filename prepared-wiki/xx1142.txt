</ref> This anecdote is briefly discussed in [[G. Waldo Dunnington]]'s ''Gauss, Titan of Science'' where it is suggested that it is an [[apocryphal]] story.
He referred to mathematics as "the queen of sciences"Quoted in Waltershausen, Wolfgang Sartorius von (1856, repr. 1965). Gauss zum Gedächtniss. Sändig Reprint Verlag H. R. Wohlwend. ISBN 3-253-01702-8.

==Commemorations==

From 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a normal distribution curve and some prominent Göttingen buildings were featured on the German ten-mark banknote. The reverse featured the approach for Hanover. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss. One (no. 725) appeared in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two others, nos. 1246 and 1811, in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth.
Daniel Kehlmann's 2005 novel Die Vermessung der Welt, translated into English as Measuring the World (2006), explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting them with those of the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt. A film version directed by Detlev Buck was released in 2012.Measuring the World IMDb
In 2007 a bust of Gauss was placed in the Walhalla temple.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/downloads/aviso/2004_1_aviso_48-49.pdf |title=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst: Startseite |publisher=Stmwfk.bayern.de |accessdate=2009-07-19[/tpl]
Things named in honor of Gauss include:
In 1929 the Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski, who would solve the German Enigma cipher machine in December 1932, began studying actuarial statistics at Göttingen. At the request of his Poznań University professor, Zdzisław Krygowski, on arriving at Göttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.Władysław Kozaczuk, Enigma:  How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two, Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, p. 7, note 6.
