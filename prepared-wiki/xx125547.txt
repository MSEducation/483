==Career==

===Dundee United===

Born in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Conway started his career with Caledonian Boys Club in Prestwick and later signed with Ayr United, making 61 league appearances for the 'Honest Men' and scoring seven times. Conway's good form alerted then-Dundee United manager Craig Brewster and he agreed a pre-contract deal with Conway to bring him to Tannadice, with the transfer completed on 1 June 2006, with compensation decided ten months later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/6590441.stm|title=Ayr settle over Conway transfer|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=24 April 2007[/tpl] Largely used as a substitute under Brewster, Conway started the majority of matches under Craig Levein and assisted more goals than any other United player in 2006–07. In late February 2007, Conway suffered a broken foot which appeared to end his season prematurely,[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/6404949.stm|title=Dundee United hit by Conway blow|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=28 February 2007[/tpl] although it later transpired he would be fit for the final two matches of the season.
