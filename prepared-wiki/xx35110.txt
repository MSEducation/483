==Early life and family background==

Schreiber was born Isaac [tpl]Not a typo|Liev[/tpl] Schreiber in San Francisco, California, the son of Heather (née Milgram) and Tell Carroll Schreiber, a stage actor and director.http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Royal/Notes/schreiber.pdf Schreiber's father is from a wealthy Protestant society family from Bucks County, Pennsylvania; Tell's family had lived in the United States for many generations, and his ancestry includes German, Swiss-German, Danish, Dutch, English, French, Irish, Norwegian, Belgian (Flemish), Scottish, and Welsh.[tpl]IMDb name|630|section=bio[/tpl] Liev's father graduated from Hampshire College and was a wrestling and football star.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lamag.com/article.aspx?id=12264|title=Knotty Pinings |last=Dougherty|first=Margot |date=January 2009 |work=LA |publisher= |accessdate=November 19, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/01/entertainment/et-liev1|title=Liev Schreiber enjoys fatherhood and playing opposite Daniel Craig in 'Defiance.'|last=Roston|first=Tom|date=January 1, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher= |accessdate=May 24, 2011[/tpl] Schreiber's mother, who now lives on an ashram in Virginia, was born into a Brooklyn working-class household of Communists; her family was Jewish (descended from immigrants from Poland and Russia). With a firm knowledge of classical music and Russian literature, Liev's mother has been described by Schreiber as a "far-out Socialist Labor Party hippie bohemian freak who hung out with William Burroughs."[tpl]cite news | author=Bednářová, Veronika | title=Mining Cultural Identity and a Writer's Motives | url=http://www.iffkv.cz/download/daily/2004/070705mff.pdf |format=PDF| work=Festival Daily | date=2004-07-07 | accessdate=2008-05-19[/tpl] When Heather was twelve, her own mother, [tpl]Not a typo|Liev's[/tpl] grandmother, was lobotomized. His mother has said that she named him after her favorite Russian author, Leo Tolstoy, while his father has stated that Schreiber was named after the doctor who saved his mother's life. His family nickname, adopted when Schreiber was a baby, is "Huggy."[tpl]cite news | author=Lahr, chris | title=Fresh Prince: Why Liev Schreiber is Ready to Play Hamlet | url= | work=The New Yorker | pages=46–52 | date=1999-12-13 | accessdate=2008-05-19[/tpl]
When Schreiber was one year old, his family moved to Canada, winding up in the unincorporated rural area of Winlaw, in the Slocan Valley.https://twitter.com/AngelaMcd1/status/308171256778338305 Prior to this point, according to Liev's father, Tell, at the beginning of their marriage (in San Francisco), Heather had a bad experience on LSD. Over the next four years, she was repeatedly admitted to hospitals and underwent therapy. After Tell threatened to admit her to a mental institution, she left with her son. As Tell pursued his wife, [tpl]Not a typo|Liev[/tpl] and his mother were trailed by private detectives in various states; when he was three, his father kidnapped him from an upstate New York commune to which Heather had decamped. By the time [tpl]Not a typo|Liev[/tpl] was four, he was living with her on the fourth floor of a dilapidated walkup at First Avenue and First Street in New York City (his half brothers from her first marriage were with their father in a duplex on Central Park West), and he was the object of a fierce custody battle, which bankrupted his maternal grandfather, Alex Milgram. Milgram, who was the most significant male in Schreiber’s youth, played the cello and owned Renoir etchings, and made his living by delivering meat to restaurants.  When Schreiber was five, his parents divorced; his mother won custody, and the two moved to a cold-water flat on the Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York City, where he was raised.404 error[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] They frequently had no electricity, hot water, or even beds.
His mother was "a highly cultured eccentric" who supported them by splitting her time between driving a cab and creating papier-mâché puppets." On Schreiber's 16th birthday, his mother bought him a motorcycle, "to promote fearlessness." The critic John Lahr wrote in a 1999 New Yorker profile that, "To a large extent, Schreiber's professional shape-shifting and his uncanny instinct for isolating the frightened, frail, goofy parts of his characters are a result of being forced to adapt to his mother's eccentricities. It's both his grief and his gift." He endured her mood swings and bohemian proclivities which included making him take Hindu names, wear yoga shirts, and forcing Liev, briefly, to go to an Ashram school in Connecticut when he was 12.[tpl]cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5467746.ece.html |title=404 error |author= |work= The Times|publisher= |accessdate= [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010[/tpl]  Schreiber's mother also forbade Schreiber from seeing color movies. As a result, his favorite actors were Charlie Chaplin and Basil Rathbone.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s Schreiber, known then as Shiva Das, lived at the Satchidananda Ashram, Yogaville East, in Pomfret, Connecticut. He also abided by his mother's vegetarian diet. In retrospect, Schreiber said in a 2008 interview, he appreciates his mother's influences, saying, "Since I've had Sasha, I've completely identified with everything my mother went through raising me...And I think her choices were inspired."[tpl]cite news | author=Hong, Catherine | title=Liev Schreiber| url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/10/liev_schreiber?currentPage=all| work=W |date=October 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-19[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early films===

Schreiber had several supporting roles in various independent films until his big break, as the accused murderer Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy of horror films. Though the success of the Scream trilogy would lead Schreiber to roles in several big-budget studio pictures, Entertainment Weekly wrote in 2007 that "Schreiber is still best known for such indie gems as Walking and Talking, The Daytrippers, and Big Night."[tpl]cite news | author= Rice, Lynette | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20008982,00.html | date=2007-01-26 | title=Liev Among the Dead | work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=2007-01-29[/tpl]
After Scream, Schreiber was cast as the young Orson Welles in the HBO original movie RKO 281, for which he was nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. He then played supporting roles in several studio films, including the 2000 movie version of Hamlet with Ethan Hawke, also Ron Howard's 1996 remake of Ransom with Mel Gibson, The Hurricane with Denzel Washington, and he played Tom Clancy's fictional C.I.A. super spy and assassin John Clark in The Sum of All Fears with Ben Affleck. The 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate, with Washington and Meryl Streep, was another major film for the actor, stirring some controversy as it opened during a heated presidential election cycle. Schreiber also played Robert Thorn with Julia Stiles in the 2006 film The Omen, a remake of the 1976 horror classic The Omen. He played the time-traveling ex-boyfriend of Meg Ryan in Kate and Leopold, also starring Hugh Jackman.  Also in the movie "Mixed Nuts" 1994 with Steve Martin.

===Shakespeare===

Along with his screen work, Schreiber is a well-respected classical actor; in a 1998 review of the Shakespeare play Cymbeline, The New York Times called his performance "revelatory" and ended the article with the plea, "More Shakespeare, Mr. Schreiber."[tpl]cite news | author= Marks, Peter | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DB1F3AF934A2575BC0A96E958260 | date=1998-08-17 | title=Theater Review: Fairy-Tale Plottings of a British Royal Family | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2007-01-11[/tpl]
A year later, Schreiber played the title role in Hamlet in a December 1999 revival at The Public Theater, to similar raves. In 2000, he went on to play Laertes in the film Hamlet, a modern adaptation of the play.
His performance in the title role of Henry V in a 2003 Central Park production of that play caused Lahr to expound upon his aptitude at playing Shakespeare.  "He has a swiftness of mind," Lahr wrote, "which convinces the audience that language is being coined in the moment.  His speech, unlike that of the merely adequate supporting cast, feels lived rather than learned."[tpl]cite news | author=Lahr, John | title=Time Trials | pages=88–91 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/07/28/030728crth_theatre | work=The New Yorker | date=2003-07-28 | accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]

Schreiber told The New Yorker in 1999 that "I don't know that I want to be an actor for the rest of my life."  For a time in the late nineties, he hoped to produce and direct an adaptation of The Merchant of Venice starring Dustin Hoffman.  In that time, Schreiber started writing a screenplay about his relationship with his Ukrainian grandfather, a project he abandoned when, according to The New York Times, "he read Jonathan Safran Foer's hit novel, Everything Is Illuminated, and decided Mr. Foer had done it better."[tpl]cite news | author=Finn, Robin | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E1DD133EF93BA35752C0A9659C8B63 | date=2003-01-08 | title=A Role That's Hard to Shake Off: The 9/11 Antihero | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2008-03-22[/tpl] Schreiber's film adaptation of the short story from which the novel originated, which he both wrote and directed, was released in 2005.
