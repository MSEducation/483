Biglow Canyon Wind Farm is an electricity generating wind farm facility in Sherman County, Oregon, United States. It is owned by Portland, Oregon based Portland General Electric and began operations in 2007. With the completion of phase 3 of the project it has a generating capacity of 450 megawatts. It is located roughly five miles (8 km) northeast of Wasco, Oregon, and about ten miles (16 km) southeast of Rufus, Oregon. Biglow Canyon Wind Farm covers [tpl]convert|25000|acre[/tpl] in the Columbia River Gorge.

==History==

In 2005, Orion Energy announced plans to develop a 450-megawatt wind farm with 225 turbines at Biglow Canyon in the Columbia River Gorge, at the time the largest project of its kind in Oregon.Hill, Gail Kinsey. Wind farm in gorge may blow others away. The Oregonian. August 1, 2005. Portland General Electric (PGE) acquired Orion’s development right to the $200 million project in 2006.Hill, Gail Kinsey.

In November 2006, PGE purchased the first 76 turbines for the project from Vestas, with the project cost increasing to an estimated $256 million for the first phase.Hill, Gail Kinsey.

Phase 3 will add an  additional 76 wind turbines, with the cost of phases two and three totaling $700 to $800 million. Phase 3 will complete the project and allow for a maximum generating capacity of 450 megawatts, though the anticipated generation is estimated to average 150 megawatts. The final phase was completed in September 2010, with the project totaling 217 turbines at a cost $1 billion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2010/09/pge_completes_final_phase_of_b.html|title=PGE completes final phase of Biglow Canyon wind farm|last=Sickinger|first=Ted|date=September 8, 2010|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=9 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100911142436/http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2010/09/pge_completes_final_phase_of_b.html| archivedate= 11 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Operations==

The Biglow Canyon Wind Farm has an installed capacity of 275 megawatts. Additional phases, planned for construction in 2009 and 2010, are expected to bring its total generating capacity to between 400 and 450 megawatts. The site covers [tpl]convert|25000|acre[/tpl] in Sherman County. The wind farm uses a feeder transmission line from the canyon to high-voltage transmission lines via a power substation located near The Dalles.[ref] Confusingly, the power substation near The Dalles is named John Day substation.  See 
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [/ref] PGE does not own this line. Additionally, the line connects this and other wind farms to the Bonneville Power Administration run power grid built for use with the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River.

==Certification==

The facility is authorized to install up to 225 wind turbines totaling 450 MW and averaging 150 MW distributed over [tpl]convert|25000|acre[/tpl].  Each turbine's supporting tower must be [tpl]convert|265|–|280|ft[/tpl] tall; combined with wind turbine blades, each unit may be [tpl]convert|400|–|445|ft[/tpl] in height.  The turbines may be aligned in up to 30 corridors [tpl]convert|500|ft|m[/tpl] wide on private farmland leased from the appropriate landowners. The initial construction—termed phase I—provides a completed capacity of 125 MW or enough to power 34,000 homes.PGE's Biglow Canyon Wind Farm Helps Make Holiday Lights Greener, PGE press release, December 21, 2007.  Phase I cost some $250 million.  Energy Trust of Oregon, Inc. contributed $6 million.
Turbine output is around 600 VAC and is converted to 34.5 kV by a transformer at the base of each tower.  The output is gathered by a substation which combines the individual turbine contributions.  Most collector cabling and associated control and monitoring fiber optic cable (up to 99 miles) is buried [tpl]convert|3|ft|m[/tpl] underground.  Exceptions are made for aerial cables to span terrain such as canyons, wetlands, and cultivated areas to protect the environment.  Up to [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] of aerial cabling is permitted.  Bonneville Power Administration built a 12 mile 230 kV transmission line to collect the power.  It has capacity for an expected additional 450 MW from two other proposed wind farms in Sherman County.
The substation may be up to [tpl]convert|6|acre[/tpl] including transformers, switching equipment, maintenance shops, control room, and offices. As many as ten meteorological observation towers up to 279 ft (85 m) are allowed throughout the wind farm to collect wind resource data. Construction must be completed by June 30, 2011.
Visual impact restrictions are in force for the John Day Wildlife Refuge, John Day Wild and Scenic River, and the John Day State Scenic Waterway (from Parish Creek to Tumwater Falls).  Wildlife protection must be provided for nesting bald eagles, peregrine falcons, Swainson's hawk, golden eagle, Burrowing owl, Ferruginous hawk and minimization of harm to other wildlife. Noise levels during construction and operation of the facility must not contribute more than 50 dBA at 24 identified noise sensitive sites.
