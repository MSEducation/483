CATEGORIES: French pastries, Sweet breads

Viennoiseries (French etymological sense: 'things of Vienna') are baked goods made from a yeast-leavened dough in a manner similar to bread, or from puff pastry, but with added ingredients (particularly eggs, butter, milk, cream and sugar) giving them a richer, sweeter character, approaching that of  pastry.http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/advanced.exe?8;s=3108413280; The dough is  often laminated. Viennoiseries are typically eaten at breakfast or as snacks.
Examples include: croissants; Vienna bread and its French equivalent, pain viennois, often shaped into baguettes; brioche; pain au chocolat; pain au lait; pain aux raisins; chouquettes; Danish pastries; bugnes; and chausson aux pommes, the French name for an apple turnover.
The popularity of Viennese-style baked goods in France began with the Viennese Bakery opened by August Zang in 1839. The first usage of the expression "pâtisseries viennoises" appears in a book by French author Alphonse Daudet, Le Nabab in 1877.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/viennoise |title=Viennois, -oise (definition) |work=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]
