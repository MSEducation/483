Born in Springfield, Ohio, Alice Hohlmayer was the daughter of Carl Hohlmayer, a milkman and laundromat owner, and Marguerite (née Waggaman) Hohlmayer, a housewife. Alice played softball at age five with her brothers and later served as a batgirl and player for the Finke and Herne club, which toured across Ohio, being selected at first base for the All-Star team in the 1937 State's Tournament. Nicknamed ״Lefty״ from school days, she also played basketball, field hockey, tennis and volleyball.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports – David L. Porter. Publisher: Greenwood Press, 2000.

Hohlmayer graduated from Springfield High School in 1942. The next year she entered Ohio State University, where she had a chance to show her athletic talent. Then, she was discovered by an AAGPBL sport in 1945 while playing during a tournament in Cleveland, and later was contacted by the league's president Max Carey.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports
Following a tryout at Pascagoula, Mississippi, Hohlmayer entered the league in 1946 with the Kenosha Comets, playing for them three years before joining the Muskegon Lassies (1949), Kalamazoo Lassies (1950) and Peoria Redwings (1950–1951). She opened at first base, then gradually started to pitch until becoming a full-time pitcher, showing good batting skills and a hard throwing arm. The versatile Hohlmayer hurled 42 consecutive scoreless innings in 1950, and also made 21 putouts at first base in a regular game. Her most productive season came in 1951, when she posted a 15–11 record with a 2.02 earned run average and 209 innings of work in 29 pitching appearances. Besides this, she gained notoriety for having a hit against legendary pitcher Satchel Paige during an All-Star exhibition game.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record BookEncyclopedia of Women and Baseball – Leslie A.
