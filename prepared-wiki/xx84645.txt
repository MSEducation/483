Stroke was the second most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2011, accounting for 6.2 million deaths (~11% of the total).

Approximately 17 million people had a stroke in 2010 and 33 million people have previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes decrease by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. Overall two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Feigin|first1=Valery L|author2=Forouzanfar, Mohammad H; Krishnamurthi, Rita; Mensah, George A; Connor, Myles; Bennett, Derrick A; Moran, Andrew E; Sacco, Ralph L; Anderson, Laurie; Truelsen, Thomas; O'Donnell, Martin; Venketasubramanian, Narayanaswamy; Barker-Collo, Suzanne; Lawes, Carlene M M; Wang, Wenzhi; Shinohara, Yukito; Witt, Emma; Ezzati, Majid; Naghavi, Mohsen; Murray, Christopher|title=Global and regional burden of stroke during 1990–2010: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=The Lancet|date=1 October 2013|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61953-4[/tpl]
It is ranked after heart disease and before cancer.  In the United States stroke is a leading cause of disability, and recently declined from the third leading to the fourth leading cause of death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Towfighi A, Saver JL |title=Stroke declines from third to fourth leading cause of death in the United States: historical perspective and challenges ahead |journal=Stroke |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=2351–5 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21778445 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.621904 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/42/8/2351.long[/tpl] Geographic disparities in stroke incidence have been observed, including the existence of a "stroke belt" in the southeastern United States, but causes of these disparities have not been explained.
The incidence of stroke increases exponentially from 30 years of age, and etiology varies by age.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Ellekjær | first1=H |author2=Holmen J, Indredavik B, Terent A | title=Epidemiology of Stroke in Innherred, Norway, 1994 to 1996 : Incidence and 30-Day Case-Fatality Rate | journal=Stroke | volume=28 | pages=2180–2184 | date= November 1, 1997 | url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/strokeaha%3B28/11/2180 | accessdate=2008-01-22 | pmid=9368561 | issue=11 | doi=10.1161/01.STR.28.11.2180 [/tpl] Advanced age is one of the most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of strokes occur in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of strokes occur in those over the age of 65.

However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood.
Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke.
