In 2003, Dabayin again became center of attention in Burmese politics. The Dabayin Massacre took place on 30 May 2003, during a tour of the country by the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200705/25/eng20070525_378074.html|title=Myanmar extends Aung San Suu Kyi house arrest|publisher=People's Daily online, May 25, 2007|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] The last stanzas of a recent poem titled "Diparinga" ([tpl]my|ဒီပရင်္ဂ[/tpl]),  which refers to the ancient name of Dabayin and extols the past glories of the place, by Khin Maung Than, raised the ire of the authorities as they read like a thinly veiled reference to the massacre.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2008/10/01/poetic-injustice/|title=Poetic Injustice|author=Square Table|publisher=New Mandala August 1, 2008[/tpl]
