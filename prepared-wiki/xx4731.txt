The economy of Israel is a market economy. [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], Israel ranks 16th among 187 nations on the UN's Human Development Index, which places it in the category of "Very Highly Developed".
The major industrial sectors include high-technology products, metal products, electronic and biomedical equipment, agricultural products, processed foods, chemicals, and transport equipment; the Israeli diamond industry is one of the world's centers for diamond cutting and polishing. Relatively poor in natural resources, Israel depends on imports of petroleum, raw materials, wheat, motor vehicles, uncut diamonds and production inputs, though the country's nearly total reliance on energy imports may change with recent discoveries of large natural gas reserves off its coast.  Israel is active in software, telecommunication and semiconductors development.http://www.iaesi.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/HongKongbusinessdelegation.pdf The high concentration of high-tech industries in Israel, which are backed by a strong venture capital industry, gave it the nickname "Silicon Wadi", which is considered second in importance only to its Californian counterpart.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/C80F623B-65AD-41E3-AA8D-98A1B8A2D28A/0/intellectualcapital.pdf | title=The Intellectual Capital of the State of Israel | publisher=State of Israel Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Labor | date=November 2007 | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | pages=27[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Israel's technology cluster |url= http://www.economist.com/node/10881264 |newspaper= The Economist | date =19 March 2008 |accessdate=17 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Israeli innovators build new 'Silicon Valley' |first=Katia |last=Dolmadjian |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-gDRug6JWGMEkwHh7h9Li7gB8fA |newspaper= Agence France-Presse |date= 28 June 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2012[/tpl] Numerous Israeli companies have been acquired by global corporations for its reliable and quality corporate personnel.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jfunders.org/sites/default/files/docs/events/briefing_book_final.pdf | title=FUNDING THE FUTURE: Advancing STEM in Israeli Education | publisher=STEM Israel | date=December 4, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2013[/tpl] The country was the destination for Berkshire Hathaway's first investment outside the United States when it purchased ISCAR Metalworking, and the first research and development centers outside the United States for companies including Intel, Microsoft, and Apple.[tpl]cite news|last=Shelach|first=Shmulik|title=Apple to set up Israel development center| url = http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000706928 | accessdate = 10 February 2013|newspaper=Globes|date=14 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Shelach | first = Shmulik|title= Apple opens Ra'anana development center|url = http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000820961 |accessdate=10 February 2013|newspaper=Globes|date=10 February 2013[/tpl] American business magnates and investors Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Donald Trump have each praised Israel's economy and each entrepreneur has invested heavily in numerous Israeli industries that range include real estate, high technology, and manufacturing beyond their traditional business activities and investments back in the United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/05/17/donald-trump-plans-world-class-golf-course-in-israel/ | title=Donald Trump Plans World-Class Golf Course in Israel | publisher=Algemeiner | date=May 17, 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://israel21c.org/technology/microsofts-bill-gates-israel-is-a-vital-resource-for-us/  | title=Microsoft's Bill Gates: Israel is a vital resource for us | publisher=Israel 21 | date=Dec 2, 2002 | accessdate=9 August 2013 | author=Allison Kaplan Sommer[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-big-israel-endorses-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-1017172 | title=Donald Trump, Big In Israel, Endorses Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu | publisher=IB Times | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013 | author=Maya Shwayder[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4031794 | title=Bill Gates pledges new investment in Israel | publisher=Wis TV | date=October 26, 2005 | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wisemoneyisrael.com/2013/06/21/donald-trump-to-us-youre-fired/ | title=Donald Trump to U.S. – "You’re fired!" | publisher=Wise Money Israel | date=June 21, 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/167650 | title=Buffett: Israel a Top Place for Ideas, Investments | publisher=Israel National News | date=5/2/2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013 | author=David Lev[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.israelbusinessinvestment.com/business-climate/multinationals-investing-in-israel/ | title=Israeli Business Investments | publisher=Israeli Business Investment.com | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] Israel is also a major tourist destination, with 3.54 million foreign tourists visiting it in 2013.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/2013-record-year-for-tourism-government-says/ | title=2013 ‘record year’ for tourism, government says | publisher=Times of Israel | date=January 10, 2014 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Yifa Yaakov[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4475168,00.html | title=2013: Record year for incoming tourism | date=01.10.14 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Ziv Reinstein[/tpl]

===After independence===

After statehood, Israel faced a deep economic crisis. As well as having to recover from the devastating effects of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it also had to absorb hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe and the Arab world. Israel was financially overwhelmed and faced a deep economic crisis, which led to a policy of austerity from 1949 to 1959. Unemployment was high, and foreign currency reserves were scarce.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mezia.co.il/articles/?idmsg=1663 |title=הויכוח סביב הסכם השילומים |language=Hebrew |accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl]
In 1952, Israel and West Germany signed an agreement stipulating that West Germany was to pay Israel for the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust, and compensate for Jewish property stolen by the Nazis. Over the next 14 years, West Germany paid Israel 3 billion marks. The reparations became a decisive part of Israel's income, comprising as high as 87.5% of Israel's income in 1956.  In 1950, the Israeli government launched Israel Bonds for American and Canadian Jews to buy. In 1951, the final results of the bonds program exceeded $52 million. Additionally, many American Jews made private donations to Israel, which in 1956 were thought to amount to $100 million a year. In 1957, bond sales amounted to 35% of Israel's special development budget.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865644,00.html | work=Time | title=ORGANIZATIONS: Dollars for Israel | date=21 January 1957[/tpl] Later in the century Israel became significantly reliant on economic aid from the United States,[tpl]cite web|last=Mark|first=Clyde|title=Israel: US Foreign Assistance|url=http://www.fas.org/man/crs/IB85066.pdf annual report|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=12 July 2004[/tpl] a country which also became Israel's most important source of political support internationally.
The proceeds from these sources was invested in industrial and agricultural development projects, which allowed Israel to become economically self-sufficient. Among the projects made possible by the aid was the Hadera power plant, the Dead Sea Works, the National Water Carrier, port development in Haifa, Ashdod, and Eilat, desalination plants, and national infrastructure projects.
After statehood, priority was given to establishing industries in areas slated for development, among them Lachish, Ashkelon, the Negev and Galilee. The expansion of Israel's textile industry was a consequence of the development of cotton growing as a profitable agricultural branch. By the late 1960s, textiles were one of the largest industrial branches in Israel, second only to the foodstuff industry. Textiles constituted about 12% of industrial exports, becoming the second-largest export branch after polished diamonds. In the 1990s, cheap East Asian labor decreased the profitability of the sector. Much of the work was subcontracted to 400 Israeli Arab sewing shops. As these closed down, Israeli firms, among them Delta, Polgat, Argeman and Kitan, began doing their sewing work in Jordan and Egypt, usually under the QIZ arrangement. In the early 2000s, Israeli companies had 30 plants in Jordan. Israeli exports reached $370 million a year, supplying such retailers and designers as Marks & Spencer, The Gap, Victoria's Secret, Wal-Mart, Sears, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan.
In its first two decades of existence, Israel's strong commitment to development led to economic growth rates that exceeded 10% annually. Average living standards steadily rose, with the expenditure of an average wage-earner’s family rising in real terms by 97.% between 1950 and 1963.The Challenge Of Israel by Misha Louvish The years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War were a lost decade economically, as growth stalled, inflation soared and government expenditures rose significantly. Also worthy of mention is the 1983 Bank stock crisis. By 1984, the economic situation became almost catastrophic with inflation reaching an annual rate close to 450% and projected to reach over 1000% by the end of the following year.

Two developments have helped to transform Israel's economy since the beginning of the 1990s. The first is waves of Jewish immigration, predominantly from the countries of the former USSR, that has brought over one million new citizens to Israel. These new immigrants, many of them highly educated, now constitute some 16% of Israel's 7.5 million population. The second development benefiting the Israeli economy is the peace process begun at the Madrid conference of October 1991, which led to the signing of accords and later to a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan (1994).[tpl]Dubious|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Despite the Second Intifada, which cost Israel billions of dollars in economic terms,[tpl]cite web |url=http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/10558/EI%202007-39.pdf |title=Economic consequences of intifada: a sequel |last1=De Boer |first1=Paul |last2=Missaglia |first2=Marco |date=September 2007 |work=Econometric Institute Report |publisher=Erasmus University Rotterdam |accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl] Israel managed to open up new markets to Israeli exporters farther afield, such as in the rapidly growing countries of East Asia.
In the past few years there has been an unprecedented inflow of foreign investment in Israel, as companies that formerly shunned the Israeli market now see its potential contribution to their global strategies. In 2006, foreign investment in Israel totaled $13 billion, according to the Manufacturers Association of Israel."Israeli Growth", Dateline World Jewry, September 2007 The Financial Times said that 'bombs drop, yet Israel's economy grows'./ Middle East / Arab-Israel conflict – Israeli economy shrugs off political turmoil. Financial Times (7 May 2007). Retrieved on 8 September 2011. Moreover, while Israel's total gross external debt is US$95 billion, or approximately 41.6% of GDP, since 2001 it has become a net lender nation in terms of net external debt (the total value of assets vs. liabilities in debt instruments owed abroad), which [tpl]as of|2012|6|lc=y[/tpl] stood at a significant surplus of US$60 billion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bankisrael.gov.il/en/NewsAndPublications/PressReleases/Pages/19092012.aspx |title=Israel's International Investment Position (IIP), June 2012 |date=19 September 2012 |publisher=Bank of Israel |accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl] The country also maintains a current account surplus in an amount equivalent to about 3% of its gross domestic product in 2010.
The Israeli economy withstood the late-2000s recession, registering positive GDP growth in 2009 and ending the decade with an unemployment rate lower than that of many western countries.[tpl]cite news |title=GDP, jobs figures end 2009 on a high |first=Moti |last=Bassok |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/gdp-jobs-figures-end-2009-on-a-high-1.260636 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2012[/tpl] There are several reasons behind this economic resilience, for example, the fact, as stated above, that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative macro-economic policies. Two policies in particular can be cited, one is the refusal of the government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their risky behavior. The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the banks' depository and investment banking activities, contrary to the then-opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions which had the effect of encouraging more risk-taking in the financial systems of those countries.[tpl]cite news |title=כך ביזבזנו עוד משבר ענק |first=Guy |last=Rolnik |url=http://www.themarker.com/wallstreet/1.549518 |newspaper=TheMarker |date=31 December 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |language=Hebrew |trans_title=How another Giant Crisis was Wasted[/tpl]

===Challenges===

The Israeli economy faces many challenges, some are short term and some are long term challenges. On the short term its inability to duplicate its success in the telecommunication industry into other growing industries hampers its economic outlooks. Its inability to foster large multinational companies in the last decade also calls into question its ability to employ large numbers of people in advanced industries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://startup-nation.com/the-book/ |title=What's Next for the Startup Nation? |accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl] On the long term, Israel is facing challenges of high dependency of the growing number of Ultra-Orthodox Jews who have a low level of official labor force participation amongst men, and this situation could lead to a materially lower employment-to-population ratio and a higher dependency ratio in the future.OECD Economic Outlook: Israel The governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, stated that the growing poverty amongst the Ultra-Orthodox is hurting the Israeli economy.BoI chief: Haredi unemployment is hurting Israel's economy According to the data published by Ian Fursman, 60% of the poor households in Israel are of the Haredi Jews and the Israeli Arabs. Both groups together represent 25–28% of the Israeli population.

====Natural gas====

Until the early 2000s, natural gas use in Israel was minimal. In the late 1990s, the government of Israel decided to encourage the usage of natural gas because of environmental, cost, and resource diversification reasons. At the time however, there were no domestic sources of natural gas and the expectation was that gas would be supplied from overseas in the form of LNG and by a future pipeline from Egypt (which eventually became the Arish–Ashkelon pipeline). Plans were made for the Israel Electric Corporation to construct several gas-driven power plants, for erecting a national gas distribution grid, and for an LNG import terminal. Soon thereafter, gas began to be located within Israeli territory, first in modest amounts and a decade later in very large quantities located in deep water off the Israeli coastline. This has greatly intensified the utilization of natural gas within the Israeli economy, especially in the electrical generation and industrial sectors, with consumption growing from an annual average of 350 million cubic feet between 2000 and 2002 to 129 billion cubic feet in 2010.

=====Gas discoveries=====

In 2000, a modest discovery was made when a 33-billion-cubic-metre (BCM), or 1,200-billion-cubic-foot, natural-gas field was located offshore Ashkelon, with commercial production starting in 2004. [tpl]As of|2014[/tpl] however, this field is nearly depleted—earlier than expected due to increased pumping to partially compensate for the loss of imported Egyptian gas in the wake of unrest associated with the fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011. In 2009, a significant gas find named Tamar, with proven reserves of 223 BCM or [tpl]convert|223|e9m3|disp=out[/tpl] (307 BCM total proven + probable) was located in deep water approximately [tpl]convert|90|km|mi|-1|abbr=on[/tpl] west of Haifa, as well as a smaller 15 BCM ([tpl]convert|15|e9m3|disp=out[/tpl]) field situated nearer the coastline.[tpl]Cite press release |title=Delek Group Subsidiaries Announce Preliminary Results of 3D Seismic Survey & Updates on Tamar & Mari-B Fields |publisher=Delek Group |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://ir.delek-group.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=160695&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1433914 |accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Tamar offshore field promises even more gas than expected |first=Avi |last=Bar-Eli |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/tamar-offshore-field-promises-even-more-gas-than-expected-1.281861 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Noble increases Tamar gas reserve estimate 15 pct |first=Steven |last=Scheer |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/03/israel-naturalgas-idUSLDE65209Q20100603 |newspaper=Reuters |date=3 June 2010 |accessdate=17 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tamar Reserves Update|url=http://maya.tase.co.il/bursa/report.asp?report_cd=875826-00&CompCd=232&Type=Pdf|publisher=Isramco Negev 2, LP.|accessdate=2 February 2014|page=2|date=1 February 2014[/tpl] Furthermore, results of 3D seismic surveys and test drilling conducted since 2010 have confirmed that an estimated 535 BCM ([tpl]convert|535|e9m3|disp=out[/tpl]) natural-gas deposit exists in a large underwater geological formation nearby the large gas field already discovered in 2009.[tpl]Cite press release |title=Noble Energy Announces Successful Leviathan Appraisal Results and Increases Resource Size |publisher=Noble Energy |date=19 December 2011 |url=http://investors.nobleenergyinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=634137 |accessdate=28 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite press release |title=Significant Discovery Announced at Leviathan-1 |publisher=Delek Group |date=29 December 2010 |url=http://ir.delek-group.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=160695&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1511164 |accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Barkat|first=Amiram|title=Leviathan gas reserves raised again|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000840788|accessdate=1 May 2013|newspaper=Globes|date=1 May 2013|author2=Koren, Hillel[/tpl] As of early 2014, Israel has verified gas finds of 35 trillion cubic feet.http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21595039-obstacles-still-block-flow-oil-and-gas-eastern-mediterranean-too Israel’s and Palestine’s gas and oil: Too optimistic?

====Electricity====

The Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), a state-owned enterprise, produces nearly all of the electricity generated in Israel. The IEC has an aggregate installed generating capacity of 11,690 MW, virtually all of it produced from fossil fuels. The company sold 52,037 GWh of electricity in 2010. The IEC is in the midst of adding several thousand megawatts of generating capacity due to increased demand and a low operating reserve, though a debate is currently raging with respect to how much should be generated from new coal-fired versus gas-fired plants, a determination complicated by the fact that some of the company's capital investment decisions predate the recent discoveries of significant reserves of natural gas offshore. In addition, in order to encourage competition in the electricity market, the government of Israel is currently (mid-2010) considering proposals from four private companies to generate up to 3,640 MW of electricity in 11 new sites, most of which would be gas-fired combined cycle power stations.
While the country possesses sufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet all domestic electricity needs, a chronic problem faced by Israel's electricity market is a persistently low operating reserve, which is mostly the result of Israel being an "electricity island". Most countries have the capability of relying on power drawn from producers in adjacent countries in the event of a power shortage. Israel's grid however, is unconnected to those of neighboring countries. This is mostly due to political reasons but also to the considerably less-developed nature of the power systems of Jordan and Egypt, whose per-capita electric generation is one quarter to one fifth that of Israel's. Nevertheless, unlike in the countries surrounding it, rolling blackouts in Israel are rare, even at periods of extreme demand. However, to help alleviate the low reserve situation and to enable the potential of electricity exports when surplus electricity is available, Israel and Cyprus are considering implementing the proposed EuroAsia Interconnector project. This consists of laying a 2000MW HVDC undersea power cable between them and between Cyprus and Greece, thus connecting Israel to the greater European power grid.[tpl]cite news|title=Israel, Cyprus in underwater electricity cable deal|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iqfv2OhTRHvxJ_ehm4cpQJ5-7k5Q|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=4 March 2012|agency=AFP[/tpl]

==External trade==

For 2006, Israeli exports grew by 11%, to just over $29 billion; the hi-tech sector accounted for $14 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year.
The United States is Israel's largest trading partner, and Israel is the United States' 26th-largest trading partner;http://www.ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/middle-east/north-africa/israel two-way trade totaled some $24.5 billion in 2010, up from $12.7 billion in 1997. The principal U.S. exports to Israel include computers, integrated circuits, aircraft parts and other defense equipment, wheat, and automobiles. Israel's chief exports to the U.S. include cut diamonds, jewelry, integrated circuits, printing machinery, and telecommunications equipment. The two countries signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 1985 that progressively eliminated tariffs on most goods traded between the two countries over the following ten years. An agricultural trade accord was signed in November 1996, which addressed the remaining goods not covered in the FTA. Some non-tariff barriers and tariffs on goods remain, however. Israel also has trade and cooperation agreements in place with the European Union and Canada, and is seeking to conclude such agreements with a number of other countries, including Turkey, Jordan and several countries in Eastern Europe.
In regional terms, the European Union is the top destination for Israeli exports. In the four-month period between October 2011 and January 2012, Israel exported goods totalling $5 billion to the EU – amounting to 35% of Israel's overall exports. During the same period, Israeli exports to the Far East came to $3.1 billion.[tpl]cite news |title=Asia overtakes U.S. as target market for Israeli exports |url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/asia-overtakes-u-s-as-target-market-for-israeli-exports-1.416761 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=6 March 2012 |author=Coren, Ora |author2=Bassok, Moti[/tpl]
