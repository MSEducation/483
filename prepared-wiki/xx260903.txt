In 2007, Bostwick was named the AFCA Division II Assistant Coach of the Year in 2007.  He succeeded Tjeerdsma as head coach following the 2010 season, but died of a heart attack the following June.

==Early life and playing career==

==Coaching career==

Bostwick stayed on as a coaching assistant at Nebraska Wesleyan following graduation, and served as the programs defensive coordinator from 1986 to 1990. He next headed west to Bellingham, Washington in 1990, taking over as defensive coordinator for Western Washington University until 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2010/12/31/2552398/bostwick-takes-over-at-northwest.html |title=Bostwick takes over at Northwest Missouri State |publisher=KansasCity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl]

===Building a Bearcat dynasty===

In 1994, Bostwick's next career move brought his greatest success as he joined new head coach Mel Tjeerdsma as defensive coordinator at Northwest Missouri State University, a member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). The MIAA had already produced several NCAA Division II playoff teams, and one National Champion, Pittsburg State in 1991. After a disappointing 0–11 season in 1994, the Bearcats would over the ensuing 16 seasons win or share 12 MIAA conference titles, make the Division II playoffs 15 times, appear in seven national title games and win three NCAA Division II National Championships.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20110605/SPORTS/306059922|title=NW Missouri coach dies of apparent heart attack|publisher=Omaha World-Herald.com|date=2011-06-05|accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl] Bostwick's strong defenses were key to the Bearcats success, allowing only eight opposing players to rush for 100 yards or more over a period of 77 games between 2007 and 2010. For his efforts Bostwick was named the AFCA Division II Assistant Coach of the Year in 2007. Two of Bostwick's defensive players, Dave Tollefson and Steve Williams have gone on to professional football careers in the NFL.

===Appointment as head coach and death===

On December 31, 2010 Northwest officials announced that Bostwick would succeed the just-retired Tjeerdsma as the Bearcats 18th head coach. Bostwick said he did not even know that Tjeersdma was going to retire until being told the week before his Christmas week announcement.[tpl]cite web|author= Andrew DeWitt St. Joseph News-Press  |url=http://www.newspressnow.com/college-sports/26325819/detail.html |title=Bostwick to be next Northwest coach - College Sports News Story - St. Joseph |publisher=Newspressnow.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl] At a press event following his promotion to top Bearcat, Bostwick told the media, "I've been a coordinator for 26 years and if I was ever going to be a head coach, this is where I wanted to be." Bostwick, however, never had the chance to serve Northwest as head coach in an official game. On Sunday morning, June 5, 2011 Bostwick was at home mowing the yard when he collapsed and died of a heart attack.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/06/05/2929238/coachs-death-stuns-northwest-missouri.html|title=Football coach's death at 49 stuns Northwest Missouri State|publisher=The Kansas City Star|date=2011-06-05|accessdate=2011-06-06[/tpl]
Three week after Bostwick's death Adam Dorrel, who was the offensive coach under Tjeersdma and who had played with him in the first 1993 0-11 season succeeded Bostwick.  Bostwick had earlier named him assistant coach.  On July 7 Bostwick's brother Chad Bostwick who had been a walk on player at Northwest under Bostwick was named linebackers coach under Dorrel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.missourinet.com/2011/07/07/northwest-missouri-state-adds-another-bostwick-as-linebacker-coach/|title=Northwest Missouri State adds another Bostwick as linebacker coach|publisher=Missouri Net|date=2011-07-07|accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maryvilledailyforum.com/sports/x1285614220/Chad-Bostwick-hired-as-linebackers-coach|title=Chad Bostwick hired as linebackers coach|publisher=Maryville Daily Forum|date=2011-07-07|accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl]
