Peter Wilson Raffan (1863 – June 23, 1940) was a British Liberal politician. 
Raffan came from Newbridge, Monmouthshire, and in 1910  was chairman of the Monmouthshire County Council.Candidates and Constituencies, The Times, January 1, 1910, p.6 When a general election was called in January 1910, P W Raffan was selected as Liberal candidate for Leigh in south Lancashire. John Brunner, the sitting Liberal member of parliament, had chosen to stand in Northwich.
The constituency contained a large number of coalminers, and Raffan was opposed not only by the Conservatives, but by Thomas Greenall of the Labour Party, who was a leader of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. Leigh was one of the few seats where Labour and Liberals ran against each other.P F Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism, Cambridge, 1971 Raffan won the seat easily.
