The 2nd Indian Infantry Brigade was an Infantry formation of the Indian Army during World War II.
It was formed in Rawalpindi in September 1939. In October 1940, it was re named 16th (Independent) Indian Infantry Brigade in November 1941, and left India for Burma. The brigade was caught in the Battle of Sittang Bridge where it suffered heavy losses. Instead of being reformed in September 1942, it was re named yet again  this time to 116th Indian Infantry Brigade. Attached to the 39th Indian Infantry Division it now provided specialised jungle conversion training. An infantry battalion would spend from four to six months with the brigade, before being sent to the front to replace a tired battalion in one of the fighting divisions.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-10-19|publisher=Order of Battle|title=16 Brigade|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6157&Tab=Uhi[/tpl]
