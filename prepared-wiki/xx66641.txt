==Education and early political activities==

George Price completed his education at St. John's College High School  While there he was exposed to the teachings of Catholic social justice, in particular the encyclical Rerum Novarum. Upon graduation, young George felt the call for priesthood and he went to study abroad, first attending the Saint Augustine's Minor Seminary in Mississippi, USA and later the Mayor Seminario Conciliar in Guatemala City.  The raging war in Europe prevented him from completing his studies in Rome and instead, George Price returned to Belize.  He was hired by local businessman Robert Sidney Turton as his private secretary. He also rallied a few SJC graduates, some of them later members of the PUP, to contest elections in 1944 and 1947 for the local Town Board, being successful in 1947. Price also contributed to the Belize Billboard, then run by Phillip Goldson.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
