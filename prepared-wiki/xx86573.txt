==History==

David Kirke, Governor of Newfoundland from 1638 to 1651, was the original bearer of the arms, which later faded into obscurity.
In 1893, D.W. Prowse published A History of Newfoundland, in which he printed a copy of the Newfoundland arms. Prowse erroneously attributed the armorial bearings to John Guy. The Newfoundland Post Office perpetuated his error by issuing a 1910 two-cent stamp depicting the arms and indicating they were issued to the London and Bristol Company, which financed Guy's colonization attempt.
The Newfoundland arms were rediscovered by London archivists after World War I, and in 1928 became the official coat of arms of the Dominion of Newfoundland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/facts3.html|title=Heraldry and Flags: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl]
