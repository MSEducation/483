</ref> On the night of 26 February 1860, a small group of white men crossed [[Humboldt Bay]] and to avoid drawing attention from nearby Eureka residents, some of whom may not have condoned the killings, carried out the attack primarily with hatchets, clubs and knives. Contrary to a commonly held view, guns were also used to kill Indians, because some Eureka residents reported hearing shots that night, but knowledge of the attack was not widespread at the time.<ref name="norton">

===Deaths===

Based upon Wiyot Tribe estimates, 80 to 250 Wiyot men, women, and children were murdered.  Because most of the adult able-bodied men were away gathering supplies as part of continuing preparation for the World Renewal Ceremony, nearly all the Wiyot men murdered are believed to have been older men, which is one reason why the Wiyot were largely defenseless.   It is untrue to say the Wiyot were killed with ease because they were "exhausted from the annual celebration."  The celebration usually lasted seven to 10 days, and the men traditionally left at night for the supplies while the elders, women and children slept. That is why most victims were children, women and older men.
Arcata's local newspaper, the Northern Californian, described the scene as follows:
 "Blood stood in pools on all sides; the walls of the huts were stained and the grass colored red. Lying around were dead bodies of both sexes and all ages from the old man to the infant at the breast. Some had their heads split in twain by axes, others beaten into jelly with clubs, others pierced or cut to pieces with bowie knives. Some struck down as they mired; others had almost reached the water when overtaken and butchered." 

===Survivors===

There were few survivors.  One woman, Jane Sam, survived by hiding in a trash pile.  Two cousins, Matilda and Nancy Spear, hid with their three children on the west side of the island and later found seven other children still alive.  A young boy, Jerry James, was found alive in his dead mother's arms.  Polly Steve was badly wounded and left for dead, but recovered.  One of the few Wiyot men on the island during the attack, Mad River Billy, jumped into the bay and swam to safety in Eureka.  Another woman, Kaiquaish (also known as Josephine Beach) and her eleven month old son William survived by not being on the island in the first place.  Kaiquaish had set out in a canoe with her son to take part in the ceremonies, but became lost in the fog and was forced to return home before the attacks began.[ref]

===Coordinated attacks===

The Tuluwat/Indian Island massacre was part of a coordinated simultaneous attack that targeted other nearby Wiyot sites, including an encampment on the Eel River.  The same day the same party was reported to have killed 58 more people at South Beach, about [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] south of Eureka even though many of the women worked for the white families and many could speak "good English." On 28 February 1860, 40 more Wiyot were killed on the South Fork of the Eel River, and 35 more at Eagle Prairie a few days later. Though the attack was widely condemned in newspapers outside Humboldt County, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders.  One writer in nearby Union (now Arcata, California), the then-uncelebrated Bret Harte, wrote against the killers and would soon need to leave the area due to the threats against his life.  Several local citizens also wrote letters to the San Francisco papers condemning the attacks and naming suspected conspirators.[tpl]cite news |last=Rossiter |first=Charles |title=More of the Humboldt Bay Butchery |publisher=San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin |date=2 March 1860[/tpl]

==Investigation==

Motive for the attacks was never clearly established.  The local sheriff, Barrant Van Ness, stated in a newspaper editorial published in the San Francisco Bulletin a few days after the massacre that the motive was revenge for cattle rustling.   Ranchers in the inland valleys claimed as much as one-eighth of their cattle had been stolen or slaughtered by Indians over the previous year and one rancher, James C. Ellison, was killed while pursuing suspected rustlers in May 1859.  However, the area where the ranches were located was occupied by the Nongatl tribe, not the Wiyot, so the victims of the massacre would not have been responsible for any rustling.  Van Ness closed his written statement by saying he did not excuse the killers for their deeds.[ref]

Major Gabriel J. Rains, Commanding Officer of Fort Humboldt at the time, reported to his commanding officer that a local group of vigilantes had resolved to "kill every peaceable Indian - man, woman, and child."[ref]
