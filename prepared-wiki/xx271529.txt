[[Bordes scene]]

CATEGORIES: Dutch political institutions

In Dutch politics the bordes scene is the official presentation of a new Cabinet with the Monarch on the "bordes" (wide stairs) of the royal palace.[tpl]nl[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | url=http://nos.nl/artikel/191224-kabinetrutte-is-een-feit.html | title=Kabinet-Rutte is een feit | work=NOS Nieuws | date=October 14, 2010 | accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl]
During the bordes scene the prime minister and the senior vice prime minister (usually from the second largest party in the Cabinet) stand respectively on the right and the left of the Monarch with the remaining ministers and state secretaries standing around them. The women are generally not placed next to each other.
The bordes scene is intended to give the media an occasion to make photos and videos of the new Cabinet. The tradition was started when the Cabinet Biesheuvel I presented itself with Queen Juliana at Huis ten Bosch and later at her home, Palace Soestdijk (with the exception of the Cabinet Van Agt II, which presented itself in the hall of Huis ten Bosch).[tpl]nl[/tpl] See photo on Parlement.com
During the reign of her daughter Queen Beatrix the bordes scene always takes place at Huis ten Bosch (which is her home).
Rump cabinets such as the Cabinet Van Agt III and the Cabinet Balkenende III are not presented with a bordes scene.
