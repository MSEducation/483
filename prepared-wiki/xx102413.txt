Alive 1997 is a live album by Daft Punk released in 2001. It contains a 45-minute excerpt of a live performance recorded at Birmingham's Que Club on 8 November 1997.

==Background==

The album was initially released online as part of the Daft Club service. Early pressings of the Daft Punk album Discovery contained a card that would allow access to the Daft Club website containing remixes and the live recording. The Daft Club service ended in 2003. The Birmingham performance was selected by Daft Punk themselves for release, as they considered it to be their favorite from their Daftendirektour. 
Alive 1997 prominently features elements of "Daftendirekt", "Da Funk", "Rollin' & Scratchin'" and "Alive" from their Homework album. There are also prominent elements of Armand Van Helden's "Ten Minutes Of Funk" remix of "Da Funk".  The live performance also contains elements of what would later become the track "Short Circuit" featured in Discovery. Alive 1997 contains the 45-minute excerpt in one continuous track on CD. The CD and vinyl packaging included a set of Daft Punk stickers. The layout for the album was done by  Åbäke, and the photography by Serge Paulet.
