[[Demographics of Tunisia]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of Tunisia

The majority (98% CIA) of modern Tunisians are Arabized Berber or Arab-Berber,Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2012. Tunisia. Steven Danver (ed.), Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures, and Contemporary Issues, Vol. 3. Armonk, NY: M. E. Sharpe, pp. 688–689. and are speakers of Tunisian Arabic. However, there is also a small (1 percent at most) of pure native Berbers located mainly in the Jabal Dahar mountains in the South East and on the island of Jerba. The Berbers primarily speak Berber languages, often called Shilha or Tashlihit,Ethnologue entry for Tunisia or have shifted to Tunisian Arabic. 
Nearly all Tunisians (98 percent of the population) are Muslim.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html#People |title=CIA – The World Factbook — Tunisia |accessdate=2007-01-13 |work= [/tpl] There is a Jewish population on the southern island of Djerba and Tunis.

==Genetic==

While the vast majority of modern Tunisians identify themselves as Arabs, they are predominantly descended from Berber groups, with some Arab input. Tunisians are also descended, to a lesser extent, from other African, Middle Eastern and European peoples, specifically the Phoenicians/Punics, Romans, Vandals, French and Haratin.

The literacy rate among the Tunisian population increased greatly after its independence from France. According to the 1996 census data,[tpl]cite journal | author = As , Walters Keith | year = 2003 | title = Fergie's prescience: the changing nature of diglossia in Tunisia | url = | journal = International Journal of the Society of Language | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 85–87 [/tpl] the literacy rate of the last generation of Tunisian men educated under the French rule (those born 1945-49) was less than 65%. For the first generation educated after independence (born 1950-1954), literacy in Arabic among males had increased to nearly 80%. (Sixty-two percent were also literate in French and 15 percent literate in English). Among the youngest generation included in the census (those born 1980-1984), 96.6% were literate in Arabic.
Among Tunisian women, the increase in literacy was even greater. The literacy rate among the last generation of women educated under the French was less than 30%. In the first generation educated after independence, this increased to just over 40%. For the youngest generation of women cited (born 1980-1984), literacy in Arabic had increased to slightly over 90%; over 70% of women were also literate in French.The children born in the early 1980s had not yet begun English instruction by the time of the 1996 census, so no literacy rate in English is given. However, the children born between 1970-74 (who had completed their education) had a literacy in English of 20%. It's highly likely that the younger generation's literacy in English was even higher at the conclusion of their schooling. Walters 86.
