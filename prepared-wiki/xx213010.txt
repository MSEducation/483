[[Euler D.II]]

CATEGORIES: German fighter aircraft 1910–1919

The Euler D.II was a German single-seat fighter, the successor to the earlier Euler D.I. The D.II was essentially a re-engined Euler D.I, the air-frame being virtually unchanged and the power plant being a 100 hp Oberusel U I seven cylinder rotary.

==Operational history==

30 D.II fighters were ordered by the German air force in March 1917, however due to slow production these were not delivered until December 1917. As a result the D.II was relegated to the role of a trainer aircraft for the rest of the war.
