[[Topographic profile]]

CATEGORIES: Topography

A topographic profile is a cross sectional view along a line drawn through a portion of a topographic map.  In other words, if you could slice through a portion of the earth, pull away one half, and  look at it from the side, the surface would be a topographic profile.
Not only does constructing a topographic profile aid in understanding topographic maps, it is very useful for geologists when analyzing numerous problems.
