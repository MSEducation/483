The Red-throated Thrush is a migratory Asian species. Its range overlaps with the more westerly-breeding Black-throated Thrush. It is a large thrush with a plain grey back and reddish underwings. The adult male has a red throat. Females and young birds lack the bib, but have black-streaked underparts. This bird species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.
