Bush bounced back the next year, finishing the year with his first 20-game winning season. Bush had another career year, finishing second in the league in wins and ninth in the league with a 2.75 ERA. Bush followed up with another solid season in [tpl]By|1934[/tpl], his last with the Cubs. On November 22, [tpl]By|1934[/tpl], just a little over a month after the season, Bush was traded alongside with outfielder Babe Herman and Jim Weaver to the Pittsburgh Pirates for left-handed pitcher Larry French and future Hall of Famer Freddie Lindstrom, also then playing outfield after spending most of his career at third base. Bush left the Cubs after twelve years with the team and finished as one of the club's winningest pitchers with a record of 152–101.

==With the Pirates==

Bush did not show much improvement in [tpl]By|1935[/tpl] with the Pirates. He did, however, place his name into the record books. On May 25, the Pirates played the Braves in one of Babe Ruth's final games. Ruth put on a performance, collecting four hits including three home runs and knocking in six runners. The first home run shot came off pitcher Red Lucas, while the last two came off Bush. The last home run was Ruth's career home run #714, and was a mammoth of a shot. It was the first home run to clear the right field grandstands at Forbes Field and was reportedly measured as a [tpl]convert|600|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] bomb. Despite Ruth's goliath performance, Waite Hoyt, who came in relief for Bush, won the game after he held on to a 11–7 Pirates win. The Pirates sent the 34-year-old Bush to the bullpen for the [tpl]By|1936[/tpl] season. The transition did not go well with Bush as he gave up 49 hits in just 34.7 innings of work, and posted a 5.97 ERA.

==Journeyman==

Midway through the season, on July 20, [tpl]By|1936[/tpl], the Pirates released Bush. He was subsequently signed by the Boston Bees (the former Braves). The Bees used him primarily as a starter and his stats improved, as a result. Despite pitching with below a 3.60 ERA in both [tpl]By|1936[/tpl] and [tpl]By|1937[/tpl], the St. Louis Cardinals bought Bush from the Bees months prior to the start of the [tpl]By|1938[/tpl] season. On May 7, after coming in relief in six games, Bush was released by the Cardinals. Bush's career seemed to be over, however, he did come back to the majors seven years later, at age 43. Since many teams were affected by players leaving to fight in World War II, ex-players like Bush, Babe Herman and Hod Lisenbee were signed as replacements.
The Reds signed Bush prior to the [tpl]By|1945[/tpl] season, and used him as a closer. Despite picking up one save in four relief appearances, the Reds released Bush on June 2, [tpl]By|1945[/tpl]. Bush's career was finished, this time for good. The Mississippi Mudcat finished his career with a 176–136 pitching record and a 3.86 ERA over 2722 innings and 542 games—308 as a starter, 234 in relief.
Bush also managed the Battle Creek Belles of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in parts of two seasons spanning 1951-1952.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League official website – Guy Terrell Bush profile
