The peninsula of Qatar is to the southeast across the Gulf of Bahrain. The population in 2010 stood at 1,234,571, including 666,172 non-nationals.
Bahrain is believed to be the site of the ancient land of the Dilmun civilizationhttp://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-the.lost.land.htm and later came under the rule of successive Parthian and Sassanid Persian empires. The country was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid empire.

In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. Following the withdrawal of the British from the region in the late 1960s, Bahrain declared independence in 1971. Formerly a state, Bahrain was declared a "Kingdom" in 2002.

==Etymology==

In Arabic, Bahrayn is the dual form of bahr ("sea"), so al-Bahrayn means "the Two Seas" although which two seas were originally intended remains in dispute. The term appears five times in the Qur'an, but does not refer to the modern island{–}originally known to the Arabs as Awal{–}but rather to the oases of al-Katif and Hadjar (modern al-Hasa). It is unclear when the term began to refer exclusively to the Awal islands, but it was probably after the 15th century.
Today, al-Hasa belongs to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain's "two seas" are instead generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island, the seas north and south of the island,[tpl]Cite book|publisher=E.J. Brill|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936|isbn=978-90-04-09796-4|page=584|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&pg=PA584|year=1993[/tpl]  or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground.Faroughy, Abbas. The Bahrein Islands (750–1951): A Contribution to the Study of Power Politics in the Persian Gulf. Verry, Fisher & Co. (New York), 1951.

An alternate theory with regard to Bahrain's toponymy is offered by the al-Ahsa region, which suggests that the two seas were the Great Green Ocean and a peaceful lake on the Arabian mainland. Another supposition by al-Jawahari suggests that the more formal name Bahri (lit. "belonging to the sea") would have been misunderstood and so was opted against[tpl]clarify|date=September 2013|reason=Who voted? The meaning is not clear here whether this was a formal or informal decision on the name[/tpl].
Until the late Middle Ages, "Bahrain" referred to the larger historical region of Bahrain that included Al-Ahsa, Al-Qatif (both now within the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia) and the Awal Islands (now the Bahrain Islands). The region stretched from Basra in Iraq to the Strait of Hormuz in Oman. This was Iqlīm al-Bahrayn's "Bahrayn Province". The exact date at which the term "Bahrain" began to refer solely to the Awal archipelago is unknown.

==History==

===Pre-Islamic period===

Inhabited since ancient times, Bahrain occupies a strategic location in the Persian Gulf. It is the best natural port between the mouth of the Tigris, Euphrates Rivers and Oman, a source of copper in ancient times. Bahrain may have been associated with the Dilmun civilisation, an important Bronze Age trade centre linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1192 |title=Qal'at al-Bahrain – Ancient Harbour and Capital of Dilmun |publisher=UNESCO  |accessdate=5 October 2012[/tpl] It was later ruled by the Assyrians and Babylonians.[tpl]cite book |title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society |last=Larsen |first=Curtis E. |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-46906-5 |pages=52–55 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC&pg=PA52[/tpl] It came under the control of Persians,[tpl]sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh |‏ | 1999 | p=119[/tpl] and then Arabs, under whom the island first became Nestorian Christian and then Islamic.
From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain was added to the Persian Empire by the Achaemenian dynasty. By about 250 BC, the Parthians brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as Oman. During the classical era, the island's Hellenic name was Tylos, named when Nearchus discovered it while serving under Alexander the Great during Alexander's Asia campaign.[tpl]cite book |title=Life and land use on the Bahrain Islands |last=Larsen |first=Chris E.  |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-46906-5 |page=13 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PQyzAAAAIAAJ[/tpl] In order to control trade routes, the Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. In the 3rd century AD, Ardashir I, the first ruler of the Sassanid dynasty, marched on Oman and Bahrain, where he defeated Sanatruq the ruler of Bahrain.[tpl]cite book |title=Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam |last=Hoyland |first=Robert G. |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19535-5 |page=28 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mZb9g1tSeXYC&pg=PA28[/tpl] At this time, Bahrain comprised the southern Sassanid province along with the Persian Gulf's southern shore.
The Sassanid Empire divided their southern province into the three districts of Haggar (now al-Hafuf province in Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (now al-Qatif province in Saudi Arabia) and Mishmahig (which in Middle-Persian/Pahlavi means "ewe-fish") which is present-day Bahrain.Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a Early Islamic sources describe the country as inhabited by members of the Abdul Qais, Tamim, and Bakr tribes who worshipped the idol Awal,  from which the Arabs named the island of Bahrain Awal for many centuries. However, Bahrain was also a center of Nestorian Christianity, including two of its bishoprics.Curtis E. Larsen.

===Islam, Persian and Portuguese control===

Traditional Islamic accounts state that Al-ʿAlāʾ Al-Haḍrami was sent as an envoy to the Bahrain region by the prophet Muhammad in 628 AD and that Munzir ibn-Sawa al-Tamimi, the local ruler, responded to his mission and converted the entire area.A letter purported to be from Muhammad to al-Tamimi is preserved at the Beit al-Qur'an Museum in Hoora, Bahrain.[tpl]Cite web|title=The letters of the Prophet Muhammed beyond Arabia|url=http://www.alghurabaa.org/books/seerah/The%20letters%20of%20the%20Prophet%20Muhammad%20to%20the%20Kings%20beyond%20Arabia.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2012[/tpl]
In 899 AD, the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili Muslim sect seized Bahrain, seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in Baghdad, and in 930 AD sacked Mecca and Medina, bringing the sacred Black Stone back to their base in Ahsa, in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian Al-Juwayni, the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the Great Mosque of Kufa in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html | title=Qarmatiyyah|publisher=St. Martin's College|work=Overview of World Religions|accessdate=4 May 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428055134/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/qarma.html| archivedate= 28 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]Cyril Glasse, New Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 245.

Following a 976 AD defeat by the Abbasids, the Qarmations were overthrown by the Arab Uyunid dynasty of al-Hasa, who took over the entire Bahrain region in 1076.Smith, G.R. "Uyūnids".

In 1253, the Bedouin Usfurids brought down the Uyunid dynasty, thereby gaining control over eastern Arabia, including the islands of Bahrain.  In 1330, the archipelago became a tributary state of the rulers of Hormuz,Rentz, G. "al- Baḥrayn". Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2008.

In the mid-15th century, the archipelago came under the rule of the Jabrids, a Bedouin dynasty also based in Al-Ahsa that ruled most of eastern Arabia.
In 1521, the Portuguese allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Migrin ibn Zamil, who was killed during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on Sunni Persian governors. The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty of Persia,Cole, Juan R. I. "Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300–1800", p. 186, through JSTOR. http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438%28198705%2919%3A2%3C177%3AREOTAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X which gave impetus to Shia Islam.Cole, Juan R. I. "Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300–1800", p. 198. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadhis of Oman.Cole, Juan R. I. Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300–1800, p. 194 During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant Sunni Arab clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala (literally: those that have changed or moved).Cole, Juan R. I. "Rival Empires of Trade and Imami Shiism in Eastern Arabia, 1300–1800", p. 187  In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain on behalf of the Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule.

===Rise of the Bani Utbah===

In 1783, Nasr Al-Madhkur, ruler of Bahrain and Bushire, lost the islands of Bahrain following his defeat by the Bani Utbah tribe at the 1782 Battle of Zubarah. Bahrain was not new territory to the Bani Utbah; they had been a presence there since the 17th century. During that time, they started purchasing date palm gardens in Bahrain; a document shows that 81 years before arrival of the Al-Khalifa, one of the shaikhs of the Al Bin Ali tribe (an offshoot of the Bani Utbah) had bought a palm garden from Mariam bint Ahmed Al Sindi in Sitra island.Ownership deeds to a palm garden on the island of Sitra, Bahrain, which was sold by Mariam bint Ahmed Al Sindi to Shaikh Salama Bin Saif Al Utbi, dated 1699–1111 Hijri,
The Al Bin Ali were the dominant group controlling the town of Zubarah on the Qatar peninsula, originally the center of power of the Bani Utbah. After the Bani Utbah gained control of Bahrain, the Al Bin Ali had a practically independent status there as a self-governing tribe. They used a flag with four red and three white stripes, called the Al-Sulami flagGazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia, Geographical, Volume 1, 1905 in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the Eastern province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Later, different Arab family clans and tribes from Qatar moved to Bahrain to settle after the fall of Nasr Al-Madhkur of Bushehr. These families and tribes included the Al Khalifa, Al-Ma'awdah, Al-Fadhil, Al-Mannai, Al-Noaimi, Al-Sulaiti, Al-Sadah, Al-Thawadi, and other families and tribes.[tpl]Cite book|title=Background Notes: Mideast, March, 2011|year=2011|publisher=US State Department|isbn=1-59243-126-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bLRoWtwJnZQC[/tpl]

===Al Khalifa ascendancy===

The Al Khalifa family moved to Bahrain in 1797. Originally, they lived in Umm Qasr where they preyed on the caravans of Basra and pirated ships in the Shatt al-Arab waterway until Turks expelled them to Kuwait where they remained until 1766.Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia, John Gordon Lorimer, Volume 1 Historical, Part 1, p1000, 1905 In the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by both the Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a twelve-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort.Onley, James. The Politics of Protection in the Persian Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century, Exeter University, 2004 p44 In 1820, the Al Khalifa tribe were recognised by Great Britain as the rulers ("Al-Hakim" in Arabic) of Bahrain after signing a treaty relationship.[tpl]Cite book|last=Al-Baharna|first=Husain|title=Legal Status of the Arabian Gulf States: A Study of Their Treaty Relations and Their International Problems|year=1968|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-0332-6|page=31|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BH27AAAAIAAJ[/tpl] However, ten years later they were forced to pay yearly tributes to Egypt despite seeking Persian and British protection.
In 1860, the Al Khalifas used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and Ottomans, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually the Government of British India overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel Pelly signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.
Following the Qatari–Bahraini War in 1868, British representatives signed another agreement with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support the rule of the Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British.
Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain.[tpl]sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh |‏ | 1999 | p=130[/tpl] Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations.

===Early 20th century reforms===

In 1911, a group of Bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son. Some clerical opponents and families such as al Dossari left or were exiled to Saudi Arabia and Iran.[tpl]cite news |title=Bahrain's Re-Reform Movement |first=Jane |last=Kinninmont |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67553/jane-kinninmont/bahrains-re-reform-movement |newspaper=Foreign Affairs |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl] Three years later the British placed the country under the de facto rule of Charles Belgrave who operated as an adviser to the ruler until 1957.[tpl]cite news |title=All at sea over 'the Gulf' |first=Mahan |last=Abedin |url=http://atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FL09Ak03.html |work=Asia Times Online |date=9 December 2004 |accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8 |title=Near & Middle East Titles: Bahrain Government Annual Reports 1924–1970  |publisher=Cambridge Archives Editions |archivedate=2 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8hiC1qB |accessdate=2 October 2012[/tpl] Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919, the Persian Gulf's first girls school in 1928[tpl]Cite web|title=Bahrain Education|url=http://looklex.com/e.o/bahrain.education.htm|accessdate=17 June 2012|archivedate=3 October 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8l8HHzV|publisher=looklex.com[/tpl] and the abolition of slavery in 1937."Treasure troves of history and diversity".

===Abandonment of Iranian claim===

This action caused numerous problems for Iran in its international relations, especially with some United Nations bodies, Britain, Saudi Arabia, and a number of Arab countries. At this time, Britain set out to change the demographics of Bahrain. The British policy of "Deiranisation" of the country consisted of importing large numbers of different Arabs as well as other ethnic groups from the British colonies to work as labourers.
In 1965, Britain began dialogue with Iran to determine their borders in the Persian Gulf. Before long extensive differences over borders and territory came to light, including the dispute over the dominion of Bahrain.

Iran pressed hard for a referendum in Bahrain in the face of strong opposition from both the British and the Bahraini leaders. Their opposition was based on Al Khalifa's view that such a move would negate 150 years of their clan's rule in the country. In the end, as an alternative to the referendum, Iran and Britain agreed to request the United Nations conduct a survey in Bahrain that would determine the political future of the territory.
Report no. 9772 was submitted to the UN General Secretary and on 11 May 1970, the United Nations Security Council endorsed Winspeare's conclusion that an overwhelming majority of the people wished recognition of Bahrain's identity as a fully independent and sovereign state free to decide its own relations with other states.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cascon/cases/case_bah.html|title=Cascon Case BAH: Bahrain 1970|accessdate=22 March 2011|publisher=MIT.edu|year=1999|author=Bloomfield, Lincoln P. and Moulton, Allen|archivedate=3 October 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8ikHHqN[/tpl] Both Britain and Iran accepted the report and brought their dispute to a close.[tpl]Cite web|title=UN Report no. 9772|url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/69-71/69-71_10.pdf|publisher=UN|accessdate=17 June 2012[/tpl]

Bahrain's largest islands are Bahrain Island, Hawar,Muharraq Island, Umm an Nasan, and Sitrah. Bahrain has mild winters and very hot, humid summers. The country's natural resources include large quantities of oil and natural gas as well as fish in the offshore waters.

92% of Bahrain is desert with periodic droughts and dust storms the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.

The Zagros Mountains across the Persian Gulf in Iran cause low level winds to be directed toward Bahrain. Dust storms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia transported by northwesterly winds, locally called Shamal wind, cause reduced visibility in the months of June and July.[tpl]Cite web|last=Hasanean|first=H.M|title=Middle East Meteorology|url=http://www.iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/~yqwang/Middle-east-meteorology.doc|publisher=International Pacific Research Center|accessdate=2 October 2012[/tpl]

===Biodiversity===

More than 330 species of birds were recorded in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian Gulf region in the winter and autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Phalacrocorax nigrogularis specie of bird, up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.
Only 18 species of mammals are found in Bahrain, animals such as Gazelles, desert rabbits and hedgehogs are common in the wild but the Arabian Oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora.[tpl]Cite book|title=Towards a Bahrain National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity|year=2005|publisher=Fuller & Associates|pages=22, 23, 28|url=http://www.fuller-imc.com/images/Bahrain%20CBD%20Final%20Report.pdf[/tpl] The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.
The Hawar Islands Protected Area provides valuable feeding and breeding grounds for a variety of migratory seabirds, it is an internationally recognised site for bird migration. The breeding colony of Socotra Cormorant on Hawar Islands is the largest in the world, and the dugongs foraging around the archipelago form the second largest dugong aggregation after Australia.[tpl]Cite web|title=Country profile: Bahrain|url=http://www.cbd.int/countries/profile.shtml?country=bh#status|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|accessdate=24 June 2012[/tpl]

Bahrain under the Al-Khalifa regime claims to be a constitutional monarchy headed by the King, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa; however, given its dictatorial oppression and lack of parliamentary power and lack of an independent judiciary, most observers assert that Bahrain is an absolute monarchy. King Hamad enjoys wide executive authorities which include appointing the Prime Minister and his ministers, commanding the army, chairing the Higher Judicial Council, appointing the parliament's upper half and dissolving its elected lower half.[tpl]rp|page=15[/tpl] The head of government is the unelected Prime Minister, Shaikh Khalīfa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the uncle of the current king who has served in this position since 1971, making him the longest serving prime minister in the world."Bahrain News — The Protests".

===Media===

Bahraini journalists risk prosecution for offences which include "undermining" the government and religion. Self-censorship is widespread.  Journalists were targeted by officials during anti-government protests in 2011. Three editors from opposition daily Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper) were sacked and later fined for publishing "false" news. Several foreign correspondents were expelled.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14541053 | work=BBC News | title=Bahrain profile | date=29 January 2013[/tpl]
Most domestic broadcasters are state-run. An independent commission, set up to look into the unrest, found that state media coverage was at times inflammatory. It said opposition groups suffered from lack of access to mainstream media, and recommended that the government "consider relaxing censorship". Bahrain will host the Saudi-financed Alarab News Channel, expected to launch in December 2012. It will be based at a planned "Media City". An opposition satellite station, Lualua TV, operates from London but has found its signals blocked.
By December 2011, Bahrain had 694,000 internet users.InternetWorldStats.com. The platform "provides a welcome free space for journalists, although one that is increasingly monitored", according to Reporters Without Borders. Rigorous filtering targets political, human rights, religious material and content deemed obscene. Bloggers and other netizens were among those detained during protests in 2011.

The island is home to forts including Qalat Al Bahrain which has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The Bahrain National Museum has artefacts from the country's history dating back to the island's first human inhabitants some 9000 years ago and the Beit Al Quran (Arabic: بيت القرآن, meaning: the House of Qur'an) is a museum that holds Islamic artefacts of the Qur'an. Some of the popular historical tourist attractions in the kingdom are the Al Khamis Mosque, which is the one of the oldest mosques in the region, the Arad fort in Muharraq, Barbar temple, which is an ancient temple from the Dilmunite period of Bahrain, as well as the A'ali Burial Mounds and the Saar temple.[tpl]Cite web|title=Popular Attractions|url=http://www.bahrainguide.org/BG2/popularattractions.html|publisher=Bahrain Guide|accessdate=5 October 2012[/tpl]  The Tree of Life, a 400 year-old tree that grows in the Sakhir desert with no nearby water, is also a popular tourist attraction.[tpl]Cite web|title=Tree of Life, Bahrain|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/Bahrain/Southern/TreeOfLife.htm|publisher=Wondermondo|accessdate=25 June 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8zQzRGp|archivedate=3 October 2012[/tpl]

==Demographics==

In 2010, Bahrain's population grew to 1.2 million, of which 568,399 were Bahraini and 666,172 were non-nationals. It had risen from 1.05 million (517,368 non-nationals) in 2007, the year when Bahrain's population crossed the one million mark.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/bahrain/bahrain-s-population-crossed-1m-in-december-1.86848|title=Bahrain's population crossed 1m in December|publisher=Gulfnews.com|date=28 February 2008|accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl] Though a majority of the population is Middle Eastern, a sizeable number of people from South Asia live in the country.

The only sovereign states with larger population densities are city states. Much of this population is concentrated in the north of the country with the Southern Governorate being the least densely populated part. The north of the country is so urbanised that it is considered by some to be one large metropolitan area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-33&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&va=&pt=a |title= Bahrain: metropolitan areas |publisher=World Gazetteer|archiveurl=http://archive.is/GvO3F|archivedate=9 Feb 2013[/tpl]

===Ethnic groups===

Bahraini people are ethnically diverse. There are at least 8–9 different ethnic groups of Bahraini citizens. Shia Bahraini citizens are divided into two main ethnic groups: Bahrani and Ajam. Most Shia Bahrainis are ethnic Baharna. The Baharna are descendants of the original pre-Islamic inhabitants of Bahrain. The pre-Islamic population of Bahrain consisted of Christianized Arabs (mostly Abd al-Qays tribe), Aramean Christians, Persian-speaking Zoroastrians[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&pg=PA98&dq|title=E.J.

The Ajam are ethnic Persian Shias. Unlike the Baharna, Ajam are not ethnic Arabs. Shia Persians form large communities in Manama and Muharraq. Bahraini Persians maintain a distinct culture and language, but have long since assimilated into Bahraini culture; they tend to identify themselves as Persian Bahrainis than Iranians. 22% of Bahraini citizens are ethnic Persian Shias.[tpl]cite book|author=Sophia Pandya|title=Muslim Women and Islamic Resurgence: Religion, Education and Identity Politics in Bahrain|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=LlDtMCBYVF4C&pg=PA66&dq|year=2012|page=66[/tpl] A tiny minority of Shia Bahraini citizens are ethnic Hasawis from Al-Hasa.
Among Sunni Bahraini citizens, there are also many different ethnic groups. Sunni Bahrainis are mainly divided into two main ethnic groups: urban Arabs (al Arab) and Huwala. The urban Arabs are mostly descendants of Sunni Arabs from central Arabia who were traditionally pearl-divers, merchants, sailors, traders and fishermen in the pre-oil era. The urban Arabs are the most influential ethnic group in Bahrain, they hold most government positions and the Bahraini monarchy are ethnic urban Arabs. Urban Arabs have traditionally lived in areas such as Zallaq, Muharraq, Riffa and Hawar islands. The Huwala are descendants of Sunni Iranians; some of them are ethnic Persians,[tpl]cite web |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/730/1/Taqi10.pdf |title=Two ethnicities, three generations: Phonological variation and change in Kuwait |work=Newcastle University |year=2010 |page=11[/tpl]Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary.

The Huwala form a significant part of Bahrain's elite and merchant class.
In addition to these ethnic groups, there are also ethnic Afro-Arabs, Balochis, Indians and ethnic tribal people. Bahraini Balochis are descendants of ethnic Baloch from Iran and Pakistan. Most Bahrainis of African origin come from east Africa and have traditionally lived in Muharraq island and Riffa.http://www.hoteltravel.com/bahrain/manama/bahrains-rainbow-nation.htm A portion of Indian Bahrainis are descendants of wealthy Indian merchants from the pre-oil era, known as the Bania. A smaller group of Sunni Bahraini citizens are descendants of naturalized Palestinian refugees and other Levant Arab immigrants.

===Religion===

The state religion of Bahrain is Islam and most Bahraini citizens are Muslim. There are no official figures for the proportion of Shia and Sunni among the Muslims of Bahrain, but approximately 66–70% percent of Bahraini Muslims are Shias.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/why_bahrain_blew_up_NkYx4h4E1m80WGe2tXfsrI |title=Why Bahrain blew up |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BA6ukktF|archivedate=3 October 2012|work=New York Post |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |first=Amir |last=Taheri[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/bahrain-shiites-may-rally-after-funeral-for-second-person-killed-in-unrest.html |title=Bahrain Shiites May Rally After Funeral for Protester |publisher=Bloomberg |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |first1=Glen |last1=Carey |first2=Mohammed |last2=Hatem[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/bahrain-it-may-be-small-but-it-matters |title=Bahrain: it may be small, but it matters – Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title=UK FCO|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/bahrain/|publisher=UK FCO|accessdate=3 March 2012[/tpl]

Arabic is the official language of Bahrain, though English is widely used.[tpl]Cite web|title=Bahrain: Languages|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/49072/Bahrain/256652/Languages|publisher=Britannica Online|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl]  Bahrani Arabic is the most widely spoken dialect of the Arabic language, though this differs slightly from standard Arabic. Arabic plays an important role in political life, as, according to article 57 (c) of Bahrain's constitution, an MP must be fluent in Arabic to stand for parliament. Among the Bahraini and non-Bahraini population, many people speak Persian, the official language of Iran, or Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. Malayalam and Nepali are also widely spoken in the Nepalese workers and Gurkha Soldiers community. Hindi is spoken among significant indian communities.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an. After World War I, Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand for modern educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked the beginning of modern public school system in Bahrain when the Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School for boys opened in Muharraq. In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in Manama, and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq.[tpl]Cite web|title=History of Education in Bahrain|url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/en/history/Index.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl] As of 2011, there are a total of 126,981 students studying in public schools.[tpl]Cite web|title=Statistics for the academic year 2011/2012|url=http://www.moe.gov.bh/archive/statistics/2011/st_class_gov.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education, Bahrain|accessdate=28 June 2012[/tpl]

The BS is a United States Department of Defense school that provides a K-12 curriculum including International Baccalaureate offerings. There are also private schools that offer either the IB Diploma Programme or United Kingdom's A-Levels.
Bahrain also encourages institutions of higher learning, drawing on expatriate talent and the increasing pool of Bahrain nationals returning from abroad with advanced degrees. The University of Bahrain was established for standard undergraduate and graduate study, and the King Abdulaziz University College of Health Sciences, operating under the direction of the Ministry of Health, trains physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and paramedics. The 2001 National Action Charter paved the way for the formation of private universities such as the Ahlia University in Manama  and University College of Bahrain in Saar. The Royal University for Women (RUW), established in 2005, was the first private, purpose-built, international University in Bahrain dedicated solely to educating women. The University of London External has appointed MCG (Management Consultancy Group) as the regional representative office in Bahrain for distance learning programmes.[tpl]Cite web|title=Management Consultancy Group – Bahrain|url=http://www.infobahrain.com/Management_Consultancy_Group_2679_7.html|publisher=InfoBahrain|accessdate=17 June 2012[/tpl] MCG is one of the oldest private institutes in the country.
