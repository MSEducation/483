Macrotristria angularis, commonly known as the cherrynose, is an Australian cicada native to eastern Australia, where it is found in sclerophyll forests.

==Taxonomy==

German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar described the cherrynose in 1834 as Cicada angularis,[tpl]cite journal|last=Germar|first=Ernst Friedrich|title=Observations sur plusieurs espèces du genre Cicada Latr. |journal=Revue Entomologique |year=1834|volume=2|pages=49–82 68, pls. 19–26.|language=French|url=http://biostor.org/reference/105581[/tpl] reporting its type locality incorrectly as Sierra Leone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/afd/taxa/Macrotristria_angularis |title=Species Macrotristria angularis (Germar, 1834)|last=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|date=19 November 2013|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=28 November 2013[/tpl] Swedish entomologist Carl Stål named the genus Macrotristria  in 1870, though this was misspelt as Macrotristia and Macrotistria in some later publications.

==Description==

The cherrynose is a medium- to large cicada, the male and female similar in appearance. The head and thorax are black (or red-brown in North and Central Queensland) with orange markings. The postclypeus is red. The underparts are brown to blackish.[tpl]cite book|last=Moulds|first=Maxwell Sydney|title=Australian Cicadas|publisher=New South Wales University Press|location=Kensington, New South Wales |year=1990|pages=95–97|isbn=0-86840-139-0[/tpl] They have an array of cuticular nanostructures on the transparent panes of their wings - conical protuberances with a spacing and height of about 200 nm, tipped with a spherical cap with a radius of curviture of around 25-45 nm.[tpl]cite book|editor=Pramatarova, Lilyana|title=On biomimetics|year=2011|publisher=Intech|location=Rijeka, Croatia|isbn=9789533072715|pages=395-418|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/on-biomimetics|author=Watson, Jolanta A.; Hu, Hsuan-Ming; Cribb, Bronwen W.; and Watson, Gregory S.|archiveurl=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/18546/|archivedate=11 April 2012|chapter=Anti-wetting on insect cuticle – structuring to minimise adhesion and weight[/tpl]  These act as anti-wetting and anti-reflective surfaces.
The call has a trilling sound and is made in the day and at sunset.

==Distribution and habitat==

The adult cherrynose is found on the upper branches and trunks of tall eucalypts in sclerophyll forests, and is becoming rare in the Sydney region. They have also been recorded from sheoaks, apples (Angophora), native cypress (Callitris) and Tamarix aphylla.
