"Lofsöngur" ("Hymn"), also known as "Ó Guð vors lands" ("O, God of Our Land"), is the national anthem of  Iceland. The lyrics are by Matthías Jochumsson and the music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson. The anthem contains three stanzas, but only the first one is commonly sung. 
The melody might be considered difficult to sing, as it requires a vocal range of a minor fourteenth. That the anthem is essentially a hymn has been the subject of controversy in recent times.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
