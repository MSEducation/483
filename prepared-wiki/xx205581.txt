Auchmuty School is a state secondary school in the town of Glenrothes in  the Fife council area of Scotland. Opened in 1957, it was the first school for secondary education in the area. It quickly outgrew the original building and additions were added about 1970. The planning and construction of a completely new Auchmuty High School, beside the old, began in 2011, with doors opening to pupils before the summer of 2013. The old school has been demolished with plans to develop playing fields for recreational sports in its place.

==History==

The school was opened in 1957, the first school for Secondary education in Glenrothes, then a New Town. The first pupils arrived in April 1957, despite the fact the school was still not completed.
In 1966, it was planned to make all of the Glenrothes schools (including Glenrothes & Glenwood) comprehensive schools, phasing out the system of Junior/Senior schooling. In 1967, it became a Junior High School.
The original 1957 building was becoming unable to cater for the increasing numbers of pupils joining the school, and so plans were set down in 1970 to extend the school, to meet the needs of all the new intake. Work started on the extension, today's quadrangle building, in 1972.
When all work was completed, the school went through a redevelopment stage. In 1977 it was renamed Auchmuty High School, the name it still holds.
In May 2011, the local council approved plans for a full rebuild at a cost of 33 million pounds. While the council was concerned by the cost of the project, partial funding from the Scottish Futures Trust combined with the perceived poor physical condition of the school spurred approval of the plans.
With the old buildings remaining in use until the new ones were completed, the construction began on the playing fields beside the A92 and Queensway roundabout. After completion, the old buildings were gradually demolished and new playing fields are planned to be built in place. Since there will be no playing fields available on the school campus during the construction period, students will use nearby council fields at Dovecot and Lomond.[tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Craig|title=Glenrothes councillors approve plans for Auchmuty High School|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/fife/glenrothes-councillors-approve-plans-for-auchmuty-high-school-1.43974|publisher=The Courier; D.
