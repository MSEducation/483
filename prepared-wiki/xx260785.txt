Battlegore Burial Chamber is a Bronze Age burial chamber located in Williton, Somerset. It is composed of three round barrows and possibly a long, chambered barrow. The site was excavated in 1931 by George Gray.[tpl]cite web|title=Excavation (1931), Battlegore barrow cemetery, Williton|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=30238|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Morgan|first=Vicky|title=Battlegore|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=5277|work=Burial Chamber (Dolmen) in England in Somerset|publisher=Megalithic Portal|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] The name "Battlegore" comes from this site being attributed to the location of a Danish raid in 918 AD[tpl]Cite report|title=An Archaeological Assessment of Williton|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_WillitonText.pdf|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|year=2003|publisher=Somerset City Council|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] or 988 AD. At least as early as the 1300s, the site was referred to as "Bytelgore", a predecessor of the word "Battlegore".

==Description==

The most northernly of the barrows is around [tpl]convert|18|m|ft[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|1|m|ft[/tpl] high.[tpl]cite web|title=Barrow, Battle Gore, Williton|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=34185|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] It is partially surrounded by a shallow ditch with a radius of [tpl]convert|45|m|ft[/tpl]. [tpl]convert|20|m|ft[/tpl] east of this barrow is a small mound about [tpl]convert|6.5|m|ft[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|25|cm|in[/tpl] high. Gray found four other mounds in addition to this small one, but he was unable to find anything that would indicate the importance of these small mounds. A large urn, found [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|disp=flip[/tpl] to the east of the center of the barrow, contained the cremated remains of a human.
Just south of this is another one of the three major round barrows, and it was around [tpl]convert|8|ft|m|disp=flip[/tpl] high as of 1969.[tpl]cite web|title=Barrow, Battle Gore, Williton|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=34186|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] Between this and the southernmost of the three major barrows is a ring ditch, which might be another barrow.[tpl]cite web|title=Ring ditch, Battle Gore, Williton|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=35440|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] The final, southernmost barrow is around [tpl]convert|27|m|ft[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|1.8|m|ft[/tpl] in height. Unlike the previous barrow, this one has not been ploughed, and as such it is in better condition.[tpl]cite web|title=Barrow, Battle Gore, Williton|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=34187|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset Government|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl]
The chambered barrow is composed of three stones. The largest is [tpl]convert|3.1|m|ft[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|1.2|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|.7|m|ft[/tpl] deep; the second-largest is [tpl]convert|1.6|m|ft[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|.8|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|.5|m|ft[/tpl] deep; and the smallest is [tpl]convert|1|m|ft[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|.5|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|.3|m|ft[/tpl] deep. According to legend, the devil and a giant's quarrel caused these stones to be thrown there.[tpl]cite book|last=Grinsell|first=L.
