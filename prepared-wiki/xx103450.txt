The Maryland State Highway Administration is working on improvements to Maryland Route 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wtop.com/index.php?nid=30&sid=1190456|title=Wider Lanes May Improve Beach Traffic|date=July 17, 2007|publisher=WTOP-FM|accessdate=2009-03-27[/tpl] The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatersalisbury.org/userfiles/files/CarolineCounty2005partA.pdf|title=CAROLINE 2000 â€“ A Comprehensive Development Plan for Caroline County, Maryland|year=2005|publisher=Caroline County|accessdate=2009-03-27[/tpl] As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million is going to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs.[tpl]cite news|title=Stimulus Funds Allow MD-404 Widening to Proceed|date=March 18, 2009|publisher=Congressman Frank M.

===Hillsboro alternate route===

Maryland Route 404 Alternate is a [tpl]convert|2.69|mi|km|2|adj=on[/tpl] long alternate route of Maryland Route 404 in Talbot and Caroline counties. The route runs along the former alignment of Maryland Route 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro. The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 (Cordova Road) near Queen Anne, Talbot County, where it heads east on two-lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road. West of MD 309, Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404. MD 404 Alternate passes through woodland, crossing under the abandoned Chesapeake Railroad before coming to MD 303 (Lewistown Road). At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue, and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east. MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street,  while MD 404 Alternate continues east past homes, intersecting Maryland Route 518 (First Street).[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Cordova+Rd+%26+Old+Queen+Anne+Hwy,+4,+Chapel,+Talbot,+Maryland&daddr=hillsboro+road+and+shore+highway+hillsboro,+md&geocode=FQTaUQIdpOd4-ylNM-JK8W64iTFvLbT0PqbsYg%3BFbfYUQIdQKN5-yk9TR2CnW-4iTGjHr4-Y6LTIA&hl=en&mra=pe&mrcr=0&sll=38.921086,-75.946195&sspn=0.027846,0.0842&ie=UTF8&ll=38.917683,-75.938444&spn=0.027847,0.0842&t=h&z=14|title=overview of Maryland Route 404 Alternate|accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl]  As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek, there is an industrial building on the south side of the road. Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, MD 404 Alternate enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road. The route continues through residential areas of the town. Upon leaving Hillsboro, the road heads into agricultural areas with a few homes and a patch of woods. MD 404 Alternate ends at an intersection with MD 404 east of Hillsboro.

===Denton business loop===

Maryland Route 404 Business is a [tpl]convert|2.32|mi|km|2|adj=on[/tpl] long business route of Maryland Route 404 through the town of Denton in Caroline County. The route runs along the former alignment of Maryland Route 404 that was bypassed by the divided, four-lane Denton Bypass. MD 404 Business branches off from MD 404 west of Denton by heading southeast on a two-lane divided road called Meeting House Road that soon becomes undivided as it passes through farmland with some businesses. As it comes to MD 328 (New Bridge Road) in West Denton, the route passes near residences.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=shore+highway+and+station+road+west+denton,+md&daddr=shore+highway+and+gay+street+denton,+md&geocode=%3BFVM-UQIdTBV7-yn3lTzdEWS4iTG39ogLJd9YBQ&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=38.895909,-75.848966&sspn=0.006964,0.02105&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=14|title=overview of Maryland Route 404 Business|accessdate=2009-12-19[/tpl]  The road crosses the Choptank River into Denton, where it becomes Franklin Street. Shortly after the river, MD 404 Business splits into a one-way pair that follows Franklin Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound. The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, carries the route through the residential and commercial downtown of Denton, where it intersects Maryland Route 619 (Sixth Street). In the eastern part of Denton, the two directions of MD 404 Business turn south and join again, becoming a four-lane divided highway with the Franklin Street name that runs through woodland.  MD 404 Business ends at MD 313 and MD 404 a short distance later.
