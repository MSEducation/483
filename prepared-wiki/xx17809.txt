CATEGORIES: Panthera, Mammal genera

Panthera is a genus within the Felidae family that was named and first described by the German naturalist Oken in 1816.Oken, L. (1816). Lehrbuch der Zoologie, 2. Abtheilung. August Schmid & Comp., Jena. The British taxonomist Pocock revised the classification of this genus in 1916 as comprising the species tiger, lion, jaguar and leopard on the basis of cranial features.Pocock, R. I. (1916). The Classification and Generic Nomenclature of F. uncia and its Allies. The Annals and Magazine of Natural History: zoology, botany, and geology. Series 8, Volume XVIII: 314–316. Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the Panthera, a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Jackson, R., Mallon, D., McCarthy, T., Chundaway, R.

Only the tiger, lion, leopard and jaguar have the anatomical structure that enables them to roar. The primary reason for this was formerly assumed to be the incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone. However, new studies show the ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx. The snow leopard does not roar. Although it has an incomplete ossification of the hyoid bone, it lacks the special morphology of the larynx.[tpl]cite book | last = Nowak | first = R.

==Name==

The word panther derives from classical Latin panthēra, itself from the ancient Greek pánthēr (πάνθηρ).[tpl]cite web |author=Liddell, H. G. and R.

==Characteristics==

In Panthera species the dorsal profile of the skull is flattish or evenly convex. The frontal interorbital area is not noticeably elevated, and the area behind the elevation less steeply sloped. The basicranial axis is nearly horizontal. The inner chamber of the bullae is large, the outer small. The partition between them is close to the external auditory meatus. The convexly rounded chin is sloping.Pocock, R. I. (1939). The fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma. Mammalia. – Volume 1. Taylor and Francis, London.

==Evolution==

Panthera probably evolved in Asia, but the roots of the genus remain unclear. Genetic studies indicate that pantherine cats diverged from the subfamily Felinae between six and ten million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | author = Johnson, W. E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W. J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. & O'Brien, S. J. | year = 2006 | doi =  10.1126/science.1122277 | title = The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment. | journal = Science | volume = 311 | pages = 73–77 | pmid = 16400146 | issue = 5757[/tpl] Fossil records point to the emergence of Panthera just 2.0 to 3.8 million years ago.Turner, A. (1987). New fossil carnivore remains from the Sterkfontein hominid site (Mammalia: Carnivora). Annals of the Transvaal Museum 34(15): 319–347.
The snow leopard was initially seen at the base of Panthera, but newer molecular studies suggest that it is nestled within Panthera and is a sister species of the tiger.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=B.

Results of a mitogenomic study suggest the phylogeny can be represented as Neofelis nebulosa (Panthera tigris (Panthera onca (Panthera pardus, (Panthera leo, Panthera uncia)))).[tpl]cite journal | author=Wei L, Wu X, Zhu L, Jiang Z |title= Mitogenomic analysis of the genus Panthera | journal= Science China Life Sciences |year=2010 | volume=54| pages=917–930|pmid=22038004 | doi=10.1007/s11427-011-4219-1 | issue=10[/tpl]  About [tpl]ma|11.3[/tpl] Panthera separated from other felid species and then evolved into the several species of the genus.

The prehistoric cat Panthera onca gombaszogensis, often called European jaguar is probably closely related to the modern jaguar. The earliest evidence of the species was obtained at Olivola in Italy, and dates 1.6 million years.Hemmer, H., Kahlke, R. D., Vekua, A. K. (2001). The Jaguar – Panthera onca gombaszoegensis (Kretzoi, 1938) (Carnivora: Felidae) in the late lower pleistocene of Akhalkalaki (south Georgia; Transcaucasia) and its evolutionary and ecological significance.

==Classification==

During the 19th and 20th centuries, various explorers and staff of natural history museums suggested numerous subspecies, or at times called races, for all Panthera species. The taxonomist Pocock reviewed skins and skulls in the zoological collection of the Natural History Museum, London and grouped subspecies described, thus shortening the lists considerably.Pocock, R. I. (1930.) The panthers and ounces of Asia. Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society 34(1): 65–82.Pocock, R. I. (1932.) The leopards of Africa. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1932(2): 543–541.Pocock, R. I. (1939). The races of jaguar (Panthera onca). Novitates Zoologicae 41: 406–422.
Since the mid 1980s, several Panthera species became subject of genetic research, mostly using blood samples of captive individuals. Study results indicate that many of the lion and leopard subspecies are questionable because of insufficient genetic distinction between them.[tpl]cite journal |author=O’Brien, S. J., Martenson, J. S., Packer, C., Herbst, L., de Vos, V., Joslin, P., Ott-Joslin, J., Wildt, D.

J. (1996). Phylogeographic subspecies recognition in leopards (Panthera pardus): Molecular genetic variation. Conservation Biology 10: 1115–1132.
Subsequently, it was proposed to group all African leopard populations to P. p. pardus and retain eight subspecific names for Asian leopard populations.Uphyrkina, O., Johnson, W. E., Quigley, H. B., Miquelle, D. G., Marker, L., Bush, M. E., O'Brien, S. J. (2001). Phylogenetics, genome diversity and origin of modern leopard, Panthera pardus. Molecular Ecology 10: 2617–2633.
Based on genetic research, it was suggested, to group all living sub-Saharan lion populations into P. l. leo.Dubach, J., Patterson, B. D., Briggs, M. B., Venzke, K., Flamand, J., Stander, P., Scheepers, L. and Kays, R. W. (2005). Molecular genetic variation across the southern and eastern geographic ranges of the African lion, Panthera leo. Conservation Genetics 6(1): 15–24. More recent genetic research, however, indicates that the Western and Central African lions form a different clade of lions and are perhaps more related to Asian lions than to lions from southern or eastern Africa. These populations have been largely ignored in previous studies.Laura Bertola, Hans de Iongh, Klaas Vrieling (2011). Researchers confirm West and Central African lion is different from other lions.
