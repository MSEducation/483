[[Opaque travel inventory]]

CATEGORIES: Tourism

An opaque inventory is the market of selling unsold travel inventory at a discounted price. The inventory is called "opaque" because the specific supplier (i.e. hotel, airline, etc.) remain hidden until after the purchase has been completed. This is done to prevent sales of unsold inventory from cannibalizing full-price retail sales. According to TravelClick, the opaque channel accounted for 6% of all hotel reservations for major brands in 2012, up 2% from 2010.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.secrethotels.eu/secret-hotels-win-win-for-hotels-and-travellers/=all|title = Secret Hotels â€“ Win Win for Hotels and Travellers|date= June 29, 2013|website=Secret Hotels Europe[/tpl]
The primary consumers of opaque inventories are price-conscious people whose primary aim is the cheapest travel possible and are less concerned with the specifics of their travel plans. Hotel discounts of 30-60% are typical, and bargains are stronger at a higher star hotel. While one has control over the dates and times of a travel itinerary, the downside is these purchases are absolutely non-refundable and non-changeable and, as noted above, the specific hotel or airline is not revealed until after purchase.
The main sources of opaque inventories are Hotwire.com and Priceline.com, but Travelocity.com and Expedia.com. Priceline functions with a bidding model, while Hotwire has a fixed pricing model, meaning it sells at a fixed price and travelers do not bid for inventory. Typically hotel deals are greater than airline discounts on opaque travel sites, namely because airlines have limited seating and also take monetary cuts when publishing discounted fares, whereas a hotel sells to opaque sites to fill empty rooms.
A newer website, GetGoing.com, is offering a twist to the opaque booking model - it asks consumers to pick two destinations, set travel dates and times to each destination, and it randomly picks one of the two destinations, offering a sizable discount.  The service doesn't reveal the airline until after the consumer has found out which destination they are flying to.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/travel/taking-some-mystery-out-of-blind-booking.html?pagewanted=all|title = Taking Some Mystery Out of Blind Booking|date = March 28, 2013|website = New York Times[/tpl]
In response to these opaque travel sites, there are also 'decoder' sites that use feedback from recent purchasers to help construct a profile of the opaque travel property.
