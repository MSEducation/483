[[Heart & Symphony]]

CATEGORIES: Hitomi Shimatani albums, 2005 albums

Heart & Symphony is Japanese pop singer Hitomi Shimatani's fifth studio album. There is both a CD and CD+DVD format. The CD+DVD version is limited, and the first pressing of the CD only version comes with a bonus track.
The album has a number of techno/dance tracks, as well as a song with an element of rock in it, but it is also notable for, as the title alludes, mixing a bit of pop and balladry with classical and symphonic music - such as the tracks Sarasoujou and Salvia. It is also to be noted that the title, Heart&Symphony, incorporates Hitomi's initials.
The album's lyrical content seems to tell a story, starting from the beginnings of love to heartbreak and, finally, acceptance, strength, and a new love.
