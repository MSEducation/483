James George Janos[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/j/jesse-ventura/|title=OWOW profile|accessdate=December 29, 2012|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] (born July 15, 1951), better known by his stage name, Jesse Ventura, is an American politician, actor, author, veteran, and former professional wrestler who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003.
Born James George Janos, Ventura served as a U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team member during the Vietnam War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.militaryhub.com/military-people.cfm?id=42|title=More than Military[/tpl] After leaving the military, he embarked on a professional wrestling career from 1975 to 1986, taking the ring name Jesse "The Body" Ventura. He had a long tenure in the World Wrestling Federation as a performer and color commentator, and was inducted into the company's Hall of Fame in 2004.  Ventura also pursued a film career, appearing in films such as Predator (1987).
Ventura first entered politics as Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, from 1991 to 1995. Four years after his mayoral term ended, Ventura was the Reform Party candidate in the Minnesota gubernatorial election of 1998, running a low-budget campaign centered on grassroots events and unusual ads that urged citizens not to "vote for politics as usual". Ventura's campaign was successful, with him narrowly and unexpectedly defeating both the Democratic and Republican candidates. The highest elected official to ever win an election on a Reform Party ticket, Ventura left the Reform Party a year after taking office amid internal fights for control over the party.[tpl]cite web|title=Ventura Will Quit Reform Party Today, Minn.

As governor, Ventura oversaw reforms of Minnesota's property tax as well as the state's first sales tax rebate. Other initiatives taken under Ventura included construction of the METRO Blue Line light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, and cuts in income taxes.[tpl]cite web|last=McCallum|first=Laura|title=The political legacy of Jesse Ventura|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/17_mccalluml_venturalegacy/|publisher=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Khoo|first=Michael|title=The days of Jesse|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/16_khoom_ventura/|publisher=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013[/tpl]
Ventura left office in 2003, deciding not to run for reelection. After leaving office, Ventura became a visiting fellow at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 2004. He has since also hosted a number of television shows and has written several political books. Ventura remains politically active and currently hosts a show on Ora TV called Off the Grid.http://www.ora.tv/offthegrid He has publicly contemplated a run for President of the United States in 2016.

In January 2002, Ventura - though he had never outright claimed combat service in Vietnam, but heavily suggested it - disclosed he had not seen combat. He was stationed at Subic Bay in the Philippines, and for this he received the Vietnam Service Medal, given to all military personnel who supported the war effort even though stationed outside of South Vietnam.

===Post Navy===

Near the end of his service in the Navy, Ventura began to spend time with the "Dago" chapter of the Mongols motorcycle club, in San Diego. He would ride onto Naval Base Coronado on his Harley-Davidson wearing his Mongol colors. According to Ventura, he was a full-patch member of the club and even third in command of his chapter, though he never had any problems with the authorities.[tpl]cite book |title=Jesse Ventura |last=Cohen |first=Daniel|year=2001 |publisher=Lerner Publishing Group |location= |isbn=978-0-7613-1905-4|pages=30–32 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=e2UxwnHvNMAC&lpg=PT15&dq=jesse%20ventura%20mongols&pg=PT18#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-12-Sun-2002/news/18724079.html |title=Outlaw Gangs: Northern Nevada eyes biker enmity |publisher=Reviewjournal.com |date=May 12, 2002 |accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Labar |first=Justin |url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/181959-complete-interview-transcript-with-jesse-ventura |title=Complete Interview Transcript With Jesse Ventura |publisher=Wrestlezone.com |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl] In the fall of 1974, Ventura left the bike club to return to the Twin Cities. Shortly after that, the Mongols entered into open warfare with their biker rivals, the Hells Angels.
Ventura attended North Hennepin Community College in suburban Minneapolis in the mid-1970s. At the same time, he began weightlifting and wrestling. He was a bodyguard for The Rolling Stones for a time, before he entered professional wrestling and changed his name to Jesse Ventura.Jesse Ventura PBS

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===

He created the stage name Jesse "The Body" Ventura to go with the persona of a bully-ish beach bodybuilder, picking the name "Ventura" from a map as part of his "bleach blond from California" gimmick. As a wrestler, Ventura performed as a heel and often used the motto "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!" Much of his flamboyant persona was adapted from "Superstar" Billy Graham, a charismatic and popular performer during the 1970s and '80s.John Molinaro, The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, (Winding Stair Press: 2002), page 199 Years later, as a broadcaster, Ventura made a running joke out of it claiming that Graham stole all of his ring attire ideas from him.

===Singles and tag team success===

In 1975, Ventura made his debut in the Central States territory, before moving to the Pacific Northwest, where he wrestled for promoter Don Owen as Jesse "The Great" Ventura. During his stay in Portland, Oregon, he had notable feuds with Dutch Savage and Jimmy Snuka and won the Pacific Northwest Wrestling title twice (once from each wrestler), and the tag team title five times (twice each with Bull Ramos and "Playboy" Buddy Rose, and once with Jerry Oates). He later moved to his hometown promotion, the American Wrestling Association in Minnesota, and began teaming with Adrian Adonis as the "East-West Connection" in 1979. In his RF Video shoot in 2012 he revealed that shortly after he arrived in the AWA he was given the nickname "the Body" by Verne.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/jesseventura/|title=WWE profile[/tpl] The duo won the promotion's World Tag Team Championship on July 20, 1980, on a forfeit when Verne Gagne, one-half of the tag team champions along with Mad Dog Vachon, failed to show up for a title defense in Denver, Colorado. The duo held the belts for nearly a year, losing to "The High Flyers" (Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell).

===Retirement and commentary===

Shortly after losing the belts, the duo moved on to the World Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by "Classy" Freddie Blassie. Although the duo was unable to capture the World Tag Team Championship, both Adonis and Ventura became singles title contenders, each earning several title shots at World Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund.
Ventura continued to wrestle until September 1984, when blood clots in his lungs ended his in-ring career. Ventura claimed the blood clots were a result of his exposure to Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/ventura_jesse.html|title=Jesse Ventura's bio|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=January 21, 2006|author=Milner, John M.[/tpl] Ventura did return to the ring in 1985 forming a tag-team with "Macho Man" Randy Savage & Savage's manager (and real life wife) Miss Elizabeth. Often after their televised matches Ventura would taunt and challenge fellow commentator Bruno Sammartino, but nothing ever came of this. He also participated in a six-man tag team match in December 1985 as he, Roddy Piper, and "Cowboy" Bob Orton defeated Hillbilly Jim, Uncle Elmer, and Cousin Luke in a match which was broadcast on Saturday Night's Main Event. The tag match against the Hillbillies came about after Piper and Orton interrupted Elmer's wedding ceremony and Ventura, who was under instruction from Vince McMahon to "bury them", insulted Elmer and his wife during commentary of what was a real wedding ceremony at the Meadowlands Arena by proclaiming when they kissed "OMG they look like two Carp in the middle of the Mississippi River going after the same piece of corn" (according to Ventura the wedding was real as at the time the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board would not allow the WWF to stage a fake wedding in the state of New Jersey, so Stan Frazier (Uncle Elmer) and his fiance agreed to have a real in-ring wedding).
After a failed comeback bid, he began to do color commentary on television for All-Star Wrestling (replacing Angelo Mosca) and later Superstars of Wrestling (initially alongside WWF owner Vince McMahon and the semi-retired Sammartino, and then just with McMahon after Sammartino's departure from the WWF in 1988), hosted his own talk segment on the WWF's Superstars of Wrestling called "The Body Shop" (in much the same heel style as Piper's Pit, though the setting was a mock gym), and did color commentary on radio for a few National Football League teams (among them, the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers). Ventura most notably co-hosted Saturday Night's Main Event with Vince McMahon and the first six WrestleManias (1985–1990) and most of the WWF's pay-per-views at the time with Gorilla Monsoon (the lone exception for Ventura being the first SummerSlam, in which Ventura served as the guest referee during the main event). Following a dispute with Vince McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a Sega product, McMahon—who had a contract with rival company Nintendo at the time—released Ventura from the company in August 1990.Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 104–105
In February 1992 at SuperBrawl II, Ventura joined World Championship Wrestling as a commentator. His professional wrestling commentary style was an extension of his wrestling persona (i.e. a "heel"), as he was partial to the villains, which was something new and different at the time (Vince McMahon, who was always looking for ways of jazzing things up, came up with the idea of Ventura doing heel commentary at a time when most commentators, including McMahon himself, openly rooted for the face). However, he would still occasionally give credit where it was due, praising the athleticism of wrestlers such as Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat and Randy Savage (who was championed by Ventura for years, even when he was a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon). Occasionally he would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heel's Bobby "The Brain" Heenan and "The Mouth of the South" Jimmy Hart.
One notable exception to this rule was the WrestleMania VI Ultimate Challenge title for title match between WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and the WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary; even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship at the end of the match when he handed over the WWF Championship to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion (though during the match, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming "This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty"). The praise of Hogan's action was unusual for Ventura because he regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Gorilla Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he would "come out of retirement and take this dude out". Hogan and Ventura were, at one point, close friends.Jesse Ventura, "I Ain't Got Time To Bleed pg. 108 Ventura, however, abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against Vince McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told Vince about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984. Ventura was released by WCW President Eric Bischoff for allegedly falling asleep during a WCW Worldwide TV taping at Disney MGM Studios in July 1994, though it's been speculated the move may have had more to do with Hulk Hogan's arrival shortly before.
Ventura generally worked well with most of his fellow commentators, with the exception being Jim Ross during his time with WCW. In a radio interview, Ventura stated that working with Ross was hard as he would often say something controversial in favor of the heel wrestler or manager, only for Ross (who at that time had only worked with those who favored the fan favorites) to ignore the comment and continue with his play-by-play.

===Litigation===

In 1987, while negotiating his contract as a WWF commentator, Ventura waived his rights to royalties on videotape sales when he was falsely told that only feature performers received such royalties. In 1991, having discovered that other non-feature performers received royalties, Ventura brought an action for fraud, misappropriation of publicity rights, and quantum meruit in Minnesota state court against Titan Sports. Titan removed the case to federal court, and Ventura won an $801,333 jury verdict on the last claim. The judgment was affirmed on appeal, and the case,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jollylager.com/pub/caselaw/ventura.html |title=Ventura v. Titan Sports, Inc |publisher=Jollylager.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl]  65 F.3d 725 (8th Cir.1995), is an important result in the law of restitution.

===Return to the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment===

In mid-1999, Ventura reappeared on WWF television during his term as Governor of Minnesota, acting as the special guest referee for main event of SummerSlam held in Minneapolis. Ventura would continue his relationship with the WWF by performing commentary for Vince McMahon's short-lived XFL. On the March 20, 2003, episode of SmackDown!, Ventura appeared in a taped interview to talk about the match between McMahon and Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania XIX. Less than a year later, he would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 13, 2004, and the following night at WrestleMania XX, he approached the ring to interview Donald Trump, who had a front row seat at the event. Trump affirmed that Ventura would receive his moral and financial support were he to ever reenter the world of politics. Alluding to the 2008 election, Ventura boldly announced that "In 2008, maybe we oughta put a wrestler in the White House". On the June 11, 2007, episode of Raw, Ventura appeared to give comments about Vince McMahon.
Ventura was guest host on the November 23, 2009, episode of Raw during which he retained his heel persona by siding with the number one contender, Sheamus over WWE Champion John Cena. This happened while he confronted Cena about how it was unfair that Cena always got a title shot in the WWE while Ventura didn't during his WWE career. After that Sheamus attacked Cena and put him through a table. Ventura then made the match a Table match at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs. During the show, for the first time in nearly 20 years, Vince McMahon joined Ventura at ringside to provide match commentary together.

==Acting career==

Nearing the end of his wrestling career, Ventura began an acting career. He acted in the 1987 movie Predator, whose cast included future California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and future Kentucky Gubernatorial candidate Sonny Landham. Ventura became close friends with Schwarzenegger during the production of Predator. He appeared in two episodes of Zorro filmed in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. He had a starring role in the 1990 sci-fi movie Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe, and supporting roles in The Running Man, Thunderground, Demolition Man, Repossessed, Ricochet, The Master of Disguise (in which he steals the Liberty Bell), and Batman & Robin – the first two and last of these also starring Schwarzenegger. Ventura also made a cameo appearance in Major League II, as "White Lightning". He also appeared as a self help guru (voice only) in The Ringer trying to turn Johnny Knoxville into a more confident worker. Ventura also had a cameo in The X-Files episode "Jose Chung's From Outer Space" as a Man in Black alongside fellow 'MiB' Alex Trebek. In 2008, Ventura was in the independent comedy Woodshop, starring as a high school shop teacher named Mr. Madson. The film was released September 7, 2010.Woodshop (2010) – Release dates

In 1989 Ventura co-hosted the four episodes of the DiC Entertainment children's program Record Breakers along with Gary Apple.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dicentertainment.com/dic_shows.html#MShows |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040401135740/http://www.dicentertainment.com/dic_shows.html#MShows |archivedate=April 1, 2004 |title=DiC Shows |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 1, 2004 |accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl]The WrestleCrap Book of Lists!

Ventura also co-hosted the short-lived syndicated game show The Grudge Match alongside sportscaster Steve Albert.
Between 1995 and his run for governor in 1998, Ventura had radio call-in shows on (KFAN 1130) and (KSTP 1500) in Minneapolis – Saint Paul. Jesse had a brief role on the television soap opera The Young and the Restless in 1999.
Ventura has been criticized by the press for privately profiting from his heightened popularity. He was hired as a television analyst for the failed XFL football enterprise, served as a referee at a World Wrestling Federation match, and published several books during his tenure as governor. On his weekly radio show, he often criticized the media for focusing on these deals rather than on his policy proposals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/28_khoom_jessereview/ |title=MPR: Ventura – the year in review |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]
Since 2009, comedian James Adomian has done an impression of Jesse Ventura on the Comedy Bang Bang and Sklarbro Country podcasts, and at live shows. Adomian mocks Ventura's bombastic Minnesota accent, eccentric style and contrarian take on current events. James Adomian has also performed as Jesse "The Mind" Ventura at live comedy shows, often styled "Conspiracy Theory LIVE" in a direct parody of Ventura's TruTV show.
In 2013 Ventura announced a new show with Ora TV, "Jesse Ventura: Uncensored" which launched on January 27, 2014 and is now called "Jesse Ventura: Off the Grid"

==Political career==

===Mayor of Brooklyn Park===

Following his departure from the WWF, Ventura took advice from a former high school teacher and ran for mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota in 1990.Jake Tapper, "Body Slam: The Jesse Ventura Story," pg. 105–108 Ventura defeated the city's 25-year incumbent mayor and served from 1991 to 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=11&issue=5&section=feature&index=2 |title=Mayor of Brooklyn Park, Jesse Ventura: Reform endorsed candidate |publisher=Morris.umn.edu |author=Carly Skorczewski |date=October 29, 1998 – Volume 11, Issue 5 |accessdate=2008-10-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090107061557/http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=11&issue=5&section=feature&index=2|archivedate=January 7, 2009[/tpl]

===Governor of Minnesota===

Ventura ran for Governor of Minnesota in 1998 as the nominee for the Reform Party of Minnesota (he later joined the Independence Party of Minnesota when the Reform Party broke from its association with the Reform Party of the United States of America). His campaign consisted of a combination of aggressive grassroots events and original television spots, designed by quirky adman Bill Hillsman, using the phrase "Don't vote for politics as usual." He spent considerably less than his opponents (about $300,000) and was a pioneer in his using the Internet as a medium of reaching out to voters in a political campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090818140106/http://www.howeypolitics.com/2009/06/18/brian-howey-time-to-take-over-the-indiana-libertarian-party/|title=Time to Take Over the Indiana Libertarian Party|author=Howey, Brian|accessdate=2009-06-26|date=June 18, 2009[/tpl] Retrieved from Internet Archive January 17, 2014.
He won the election in November 1998, narrowly (and unexpectedly) defeating the major-party candidates, St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman (Republican) and Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. "Skip" Humphrey III (Democratic-Farmer-Labor). After his victory, bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing the slogan "My governor can beat up your governor" appeared in Minnesota. The nickname "Jesse 'The Mind[tpl]' "[/tpl] (from a last-minute Hillsman ad featuring Ventura posing as Rodin's Thinker) began to resurface sarcastically in reference to his frequently controversial remarks. Ventura's old stage name "Jesse 'The Body[tpl]' "[/tpl] (sometimes adapted to "Jesse 'The Governing Body[tpl]' "[/tpl]) also continued to appear with some regularity.
After a trade mission to China in 2002, Ventura announced that he would not run for a second term, stating that he no longer felt dedicated enough to his job to run again as well as what he viewed were constant attacks on his family by the media.[tpl]cite news|title=Jesse Ventura announces he will not seek second term in November|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020618&slug=webventura18|publisher=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=June 22, 2012|date=June 18, 2002[/tpl] Ventura accused the media of hounding him and his family for personal behavior and belief while neglecting coverage of important policy issues. He later told a reporter for The Boston Globe that he would have run for a second term if he had been single, citing the media's effect on his family life.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/25/the_body_politic/ |title=The Body politic – The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |author=Joseph P.

Governor Ventura sparked media criticism when, nearing the end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he wanted her to be the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors. Ventura quickly retreated from the comments, saying he was just floating an idea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2002/10/21/ventura_may_leave_office_early.html |title=Ventura May Leave Office Early – Political Wire |publisher=Politicalwire.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]

====Political positions====

In political debates, Ventura often admitted that he had not formed an opinion on certain policy questions. Ventura frequently described himself as "fiscally conservative and socially liberal."[tpl]Cite book|title=Ain't Got Time to Bleed|author=Ventura, Jesse|pages=13–14|isbn=0-451-20086-1|publisher=Signet|year=2000[/tpl] He selected teacher Mae Schunk as his running mate.
Lacking a party base in the Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Ventura's policy ambitions had little chance of being introduced as bills. Initially, the residents of Minnesota feared Ventura's vetoes would be overturned. He vetoed 45 bills in his first year, only three of which were overridden.

One of the most notable was the rebate on sales tax. In each year of his administration, Minnesotans received a tax-free check in the late summer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=d676ae3effb81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD |title=National Governors Association |publisher=http://www.nga.org |date=01-nov-08 |accessdate=2010-09-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629032126/http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.29fab9fb4add37305ddcbeeb501010a0/?vgnextoid=d676ae3effb81010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD&vgnextchannel=e449a0ca9e3f1010VgnVCM1000001a01010aRCRD|archivedate=June 29, 2011[/tpl] The state was running a budget surplus at the time, and Ventura believed that the money should be returned to the public.
Later, he came to support a unicameral (one-house) legislature, property tax reform, gay rights, and abortion rights. While funding public school education generously, he opposed the teachers' union, and did not have a high regard for the public funding of higher education institutions. Additionally, Ventura supported the use of medicinal marijuana,Jesse Ventura: Legalize Marijuana Fox Business News. Retrieved January 17, 2014. advocated a higher role for third parties in national politics, and favored the concept of instant-runoff voting. He also opposed the death penalty.
In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, he reaffirmed his support of gay rights, including gay marriage and gays in the military, humorously stating he would've gladly served alongside homosexuals when he was in the Navy as they would've provided less competition for women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1242705600#14047 |title=The body on the hulk – The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100131155709/http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1242705600|archivedate=January 31, 2010[/tpl] (Later, on the subject of a 2012 referendum on amending the Minnesota constitution to limit marriage to male-female couples, Ventura elaborated "I certainly hope that people don't amend our constitution to stop gay marriage because, number one, the constitution is there to protect people – not oppress them", and went on to relate a story from his pro wrestling days of a friend who was denied hospital visitation to his same-sex partner.[tpl]cite web |title=Political Notebook: Ventura offers to campaign against marriage amendment |url=http://www.postbulletin.com/news/stories/display.php?id=1500082 |last=Carlson |first=Heather J. |work=Post-Bulletin |publisher= |date=June 18, 2012[/tpl])
Ventura was elected on a Reform party ticket, but he never received support from Ross Perot's Texas faction. When the Reform party was taken over by Pat Buchanan supporters before the presidential elections of 2000, Ventura left the party in February 2000, referring to it as "hopelessly dysfunctional". However, he maintained close ties to the Independence Party of Minnesota, which also broke from the Reform party around the same time.
During the first part of his administration, Ventura strongly advocated for land-use reform and substantial mass transit improvements, such as light rail.[tpl]Cite book|title=Don't start the revolution without me!|author=Ventura, Jesse|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2008|isbn=1-60239-273-0|pages=143–160[/tpl] He made the light rail project a priority, obtaining additional funding from the Minnesota state legislature to keep the project moving. The METRO Blue Line was completed in 2004.
During another trade mission to Cuba in the summer of 2002, he denounced the American economic sanctions against Cuba, stating that the sanctions affected the Cuban public more than it did its government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200209/25_khoom_cuba1/ |title=MPR: Ventura begins final foreign journey as governor |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]
In his book Independent Nation, political analyst John Avlon describes Ventura as a radical centrist thinker and activist.Avlon, John (2004).  Independent Nation: How the Vital Center Is Changing American Politics.  Harmony Books / Random House, pp. 177–93 ("Radical Centrists").  ISBN 978-1-4000-5023-9.

====Views on political parties====

Ventura, who ran on a Reform Party ticket and advocated for a greater role for third parties in American politics, is highly critical of both Democrats and Republicans. Ventura described both parties as "monsters that are out of control" who are concerned only with "their own agendas and their pork."[tpl]cite web|title=Jesse Ventura on Principles & Values|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Jesse_Ventura_Principles_+_Values.htm|publisher=http://www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl]
Despite having been a supporter of third parties as governor and having voted for Ralph Nader in 2008 as a protest vote, although he did vote for John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, Ventura has since declared he no longer supports the third party movement and advocates that all political parties, including third parties, be abolished. Feeling that the two-party system has corrupted the government, Ventura has expressed concern that if a third party became as successful as the Republicans and Democrats, it "will likewise have to corrupt itself. If you already have a two-headed monster, why would you need three?"[tpl]cite web|title=Jesse Ventura: US should abolish inherently corrupt political parties|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/10/13/jesse-ventura-abolish-inherently-corrupt-political-parties/|publisher=rawstory.com|accessdate=2011-07-27[/tpl] Ventura still remains an independent and has indicated in the event he runs for political office in the future, he would not run with any political party.

====Wellstone memorial====

Ventura greatly disapproved of some of the actions that took place at the 2002 memorial for Senator Paul Wellstone, his family, and others who died in a plane crash on October 25, 2002. Ventura said, "I feel used. I feel violated and duped over the fact that the memorial ceremony turned into a political rally".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,67075,00.html |title= Ventura May Tap Independent to Wellstone's Seat; Mondale Officially in for Dems |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110205130655/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,67075,00.html|archivedate=February 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/830clrob.asp |title=Honor & Civility, RIP |publisher=Weeklystandard.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl] He left halfway through the controversial speech made by Wellstone's best friend, Rick Kahn.

Barkley was succeeded by Norm Coleman, who won the seat against Walter Mondale, who became the Democratic candidate replacement a few days before the election.

====Political criticisms====

After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6D71431F932A35756C0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing | Midwest: Minnesota: Governor Shuts Mansion – New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |date= May 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]
In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that "the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain." The petition was denied.In Re Proposed Petition to Recall Governor Jesse Ventura http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/ventura.html
During his tenure as Governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as "media jackals," a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=14279 |title=Provocative Press Pass Miffs Minnesota Media |publisher=Stateline.org |author=Lynda McConnell, Special to Stateline.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl] Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as "Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente," a self-aggrandizing former "Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor "makes Minnesota proud".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.current.org/people/peop908g.html |title=Current.org | Keillor v.

Ventura responded, "Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3DD173CF935A15751C0A96F958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/V/Ventura,%20Jesse |title=Gov.

====Consideration of bids for other political offices====

While Ventura has not held public office since the end of his term as governor in 2003, he has remained politically active and has occasionally hinted at intentions of possibly running again for political office. In an interview on CNN's The Situation Room on April 7, 2008, Ventura said that he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race.Jesse Ventura Running For The Senate?![tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl], YouTube A poll commissioned by Twin Cities station Fox 9 put him at 24 percent, behind Democratic candidate Al Franken at 32 percent and Norm Coleman at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on Larry King Live on July 14, 2008, that he would not run; Ventura's decision not to join the race was partly rooted from a fear of a potential lack of privacy for his family, a concern that contributed to his refusal to seek a second term as governor.[tpl]cite news |last=Falcone |first=Michael |title=Ventura Decides Against Senate Run |work=The Caucus|publisher=New York Times |date=July 14, 2008 |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/ventura-decides-against-senate-run/ |accessdate=2008-07-14 [/tpl] Al Franken ended up winning the election.
In his 1999 autobiography I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura suggested he did not plan on running for President of the United States but did not rule out such an idea.[tpl]cite web|title=Jesse Ventura on Principles & Values|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Jesse_Ventura_Principles_+_Values.htm|publisher=http://www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=February 23, 2012[/tpl] He spoke at Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul's "Rally for the Republic", organized by the Campaign for Liberty, on September 2, 2008. At the event, Ventura implied a possible future run at the U.S. Presidency. At the end of his speech, Ventura announced before a live audience that if he saw that the public was willing to see a change in the direction of the country, then "in 2012 we'll give them a race they'll never forget!" In 2011, Ventura expressed interest in running with Ron Paul for the 2012 presidential elections if the latter decided to run as an independent.[tpl]cite web|last=Barr|first=Andy|title=Jesse Ventura wants to be Ron Paul's 2012 running mate|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52516.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=October 2, 2011[/tpl] On November 4, 2011, Ventura said at a press conference about the dismissal of his court case against the Transportation Security Administration for what he claims are illegal searches of air travelers, that he is "thinking about" running for President.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.twincities.com/news/ci_19265340?source=rss| author=Emily Gurnon| title=Angry Jesse Ventura thinking about presidential run| publisher=TwinCities.com| date=November 4, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/former-minn-gov-ventura-miffed-by-court-setback-says-hell-seek-mexican-citizenship/2011/11/04/gIQATmvwmM_story.html| title=Former Minn.

But I think he's serious. If Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian, I think he definitely would be interested in running as a vice presidential candidate.

===Electoral history===

==Post-gubernatorial life==

Ventura was succeeded in his office on January 6, 2003, by Republican Tim Pawlenty. He began a cable television show in October 2003, on MSNBC called Jesse Ventura's America. The show was broadcast once a week, on Saturdays, unlike many MSNBC shows which are on five nights a week (this show was originally planned for five nights a week as well, but MSNBC executives changed their minds). At the time of its airing, Jesse Ventura's America was the only national television show filmed in Minnesota. Among his guests were Charles Barkley, Gray Davis, Arianna Huffington, Rob Kampia, and Kathy McKee. However, the show was short-lived and ended on December 26, 2003, only a couple of months after it began. Although MSNBC executives said the show was cancelled because the show was too expensive to make, Ventura argued that the show was shelved because of his opposition to the Iraq War, saying that MSNBC did not want him becoming a prominent opponent to the war.[tpl]cite news|last=Collins|first=Scott|title=Jesse Ventura searches for coverups|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/29/entertainment/la-ca-conversation29-2009nov29|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=November 29, 2009[/tpl]
In 2004, Harvard graduate student and fellow Navy veteran Christopher Mora promoted the idea that the academic establishment had failed to reach out to citizens experienced in public service, but who did not fit the traditional idea of a politician. He successfully lobbied for the selection of Ventura, who started teaching a study group at Harvard University for the Spring 2004 semester as a visiting fellow at the Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics (IOP). His 90-minute study group focused on third party politics, campaign finance, the war on drugs, and other relevant political issues. Ventura scheduled multiple famous friends to appear for his seminars including Dean Barkley and Richard Marcinko.
On October 22, 2004, with Ventura by his side, former Governor of Maine Angus King endorsed John Kerry for President at the Minnesota state capitol building. Ventura did not speak at the press conference. When prodded for a statement, King responded, "He plans to vote for John Kerry, but he doesn't want to make a statement and subject himself to the tender mercies of the Minnesota press".[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/10/28_mccalluml_venturakerry/ |title=MPR: Speechless no more, Ventura stumps for Kerry at colleges |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl] In the 2012 Senate elections, Ventura endorsed King in his campaign for the open Senate seat in Maine, in which King won.[tpl]cite web|last=Gavin|first=Patrick|title=Jesse Ventura goes gangsta in political tome|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77395.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=April 11, 2013[/tpl]

In late October 2005, he went on The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch and reiterated that he was leaving the U.S. and moving to Mexico due to, among other things, censorship.
In September 2006, Ventura endorsed and campaigned with independent Texas gubernatorial candidate Kinky Friedman, and Independence Party of Minnesota's gubernatorial candidate Peter Hutchinson and Team Minnesota.

===Bush/Cheney administration and torture===

In a May 11, 2009, interview with Larry King, Ventura twice stated that George W. Bush was the worst president of his lifetime, adding "President Obama inherited something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You know? Two wars, an economy that's borderline depression."Jesse Ventura: You Give Me a Water Board, Dick Cheney and One Hour, and I'll Have Him Confess to the Sharon Tate Murders, CrooksAndLiars.com On the issue of waterboarding, Ventura added:

Ventura then stated that he had no respect for Dick Cheney because he is "a guy who got five deferments from the Vietnam War. Clearly, he's a coward. He wouldn't go when it was his time to go. And now he is a chickenhawk. Now he is this big tough guy who wants this hardcore policy.

"We only seem to waterboard Muslims."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/18/ventura-and-hasselbeck-de_n_204774.html |title=Ventura And Hasselbeck Rumble Over Waterboarding on the View |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= May 18, 2009|accessdate=2010-06-13 |first=Sam |last=Stein[/tpl] Comparing the waterboarding of detainees to the North Vietnamese torture of American P.O.W.s, Ventura asserted, "We created our own Hanoi Hilton in Guantánamo.

On May 20, 2009, Ventura appeared on Fox & Friends. When Brian Kilmeade told Ventura that he would stop supporting waterboarding when "they're dead", Ventura responded, "Really? Have you enlisted?

===Questions regarding 9/11===

In a brief interview with Alex Jones in September 2006, Ventura began expressing doubts regarding the events behind the September 11 attacks. Ventura expressed concern over NORAD's response to the four commercial airliners that were hijacked and compared it to the response to the plane crash that killed professional golfer Payne Stewart in 1999, in which fighter jets were scrambled to intercept Stewart's jet. However, Ventura did not state that he believed the government orchestrated the attacks, but did argue that the government has contemplated false flag attacks in the past, citing Operation Northwoods as an example.[tpl]cite web|last=Watson|first=Paul Joseph|title=Former Governor Jesse Ventura Questions Official 9/11 Story|url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/september2006/260906venturaquestions.htm|publisher=http://www.prisonplanet.com|accessdate=September 8, 2012[/tpl]

On April 9, 2011, when Piers Morgan from CNN asked Ventura what his official view on the events of 9/11 was, Ventura said, "My theory of 9/11 is that we certainly – at the best we knew it was going to happen. They allowed it to happen to further their agenda in the Middle East and go to these wars."[tpl]cite news|title=PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT Interview With Jesse Ventura|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1104/09/pmt.01.html|publisher=http://www.cnn.com|accessdate=October 20, 2012[/tpl]

===Books written by Ventura===

During his time as governor, Ventura wrote a number of politically themed books. He continued to write several other books after leaving office. In April 2008, a book authored by Ventura, titled Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, was released. In it, Ventura describes a hypothetical campaign in which he is a candidate for President of the United States in 2008, running as an independent. In an interview with the Associated Press at the time of the book's release, however, Ventura denied any plans for a presidential bid, stating that the scenario is only imaginary and not indicative of a "secret plan to run".Freed, Joshua."Ventura:No Plans to Run Again, but...", Associated Press. Retrieved April 1, 2008. On MinnPost.com, Ventura's agent, Steve Schwartz, describes the book thus: "is revealing why he left politics and discussing the disastrous war in Iraq, why he sees our two-party system as corrupt, and what Fidel Castro told him about who was really behind the assassination of President Kennedy."Jesse's back!

American Conspiracies is a book Ventura wrote with Dick Russell, published by Skyhorse Publishing in 2010 which discusses conspiracy theories related to several notable events in United States history.
63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read was written by Ventura with Dick Russell and published in 2011. The book describes documents that Ventura claims the government does not want the public to be informed of, although he stated the documents were not stolen and were only on the public domain.
Ventura also wrote DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans: No More Gangs in Government, which was released in 2012. The book expresses Ventura's opposition to the two-party system and calls for political parties to be abolished.[tpl]cite web|last=Harper|first=Jennifer|title=Inside the Beltway: Bipartisan gangland|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/may/14/inside-the-beltway-bipartisan-gangland/|publisher=http://www.washingtontimes.com|accessdate=May 24, 2012[/tpl] He has finished his latest book They Killed Our President: 63 Reasons to Believe There Was a Conspiracy to Assassinate JFK which was printed and released in October, coinciding with the upcoming 50th anniversary on November 22, of President Kennedy's assassination.

===Lawsuit against the TSA===

In January 2011, Jesse Ventura filed a lawsuit against the Transportation Security Administration for being subject to controversial pat-downs. Ventura, who received a titanium hip replacement in 2008 that sets off metal detectors at airport security checkpoints, has asserted that these pat-downs violate citizens' Fourth Amendment rights. Ventura's attorney has claimed that while he is not seeking any monetary compensation, Ventura wants an acknowledgment from the court that his rights were violated and that the TSA halt future pat-downs on him.[tpl]cite news|last=Hunter|first=Marnie|title=Jesse Ventura slams TSA with lawsuit|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-01-25/travel/jesse.ventura.tsa.lawsuit_1_pat-downs-and-full-body-tsa-lawsuit?_s=PM:TRAVEL|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 17, 2011|date=September 27, 2000[/tpl] Ventura stated that as a former politician and a military veteran and posing no threat, it is inappropriate for him to be subject to pat-downs.
The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2011 under the ruling that Ventura should have filed the lawsuit in the Court of Appeals.[tpl]cite news|title='I've had enough of the Fascist States of America': Former Governor's fury at TSA as he says he's leaving for Mexico... but may still run for President|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057955/Jesse-Ventura-says-hes-fed-airport-security-hes-getting-Mexican-citizenship.html|publisher=http://www.dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=February 21, 2012|location=London|date=November 5, 2011[/tpl] In related comments to the media following the lawsuit's dismissal, Ventura stated he believed America had become "fascist" for the secret ruling and subsequent mainstream media blackout. The former Governor said he would seek dual citizenship in both the United States and Mexico, having lived in Baja California Sur for a number of years. He also said he no longer felt patriotic and would raise a fist during the playing of the national anthem at public events. Ventura has declared he would no longer fly commercially and has repeatedly stated, "I love my country, not my government" in post-press-release interviews. After his press conference on the issue, upon being  asked if he would next go to the Court of Appeals, Ventura responded:
 "What for? I want a trial by jury. They tell me I can't have a jury decide my fate. They want three government paid judges to decide it. Well it'll never see the light of day then. They claim it's because of security reasons: We can't even know what the rules are at the TSA. How do we know if we're being abused our rights if they won't even tell us what the rules are?"Video of Press Conference Response starts at 3:03 minutes 
The ultimate outcome of the TSA constitutional matter remains undetermined, and Ventura has not stated whether he would continue his lawsuit.[tpl]cite news|title=Former Minn. Gov.

==Controversies==

===Navy SEAL background controversies===

Bill Salisbury, an attorney in San Diego and a former Navy SEAL officer, accused Ventura of "pretending" to be a SEAL and wrote that Ventura would be blurring an important distinction by claiming to be a SEAL when he was actually a frogman with the UDT. Compared to SEAL Teams, UDTs saw less combat and took fewer casualties. Although Ventura underwent UDT training, he never attempted the additional 26 week SEAL Qualification Training. In 1983, eight years after Ventura left the Navy, the UDT's were disbanded and those operators were retrained and retasked as SEALs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199912/14_kastem_seals/ |title=MPR: Battling Seals |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=December 14, 1999 |accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1999/dec/02/jesse-great-pretender-ventura/ |title=Jesse "The Great Pretender" Ventura |publisher=San Diego Reader |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EYkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4203,170203 |title=Ventura brushes off criticism of SEAL training |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] Responding to the controversy, Governor Ventura's office confirmed that Ventura was a member of the UDTs. His spokesman stated that Ventura has never tried to convince people otherwise. Ventura stated: "Today we refer to all of us as SEALs; that's all it is," and dismissed the accusations of lying about being a SEAL as "much ado about nothing."

===Opie and Anthony incident===

The Opie and Anthony Show hosted Ventura on December 2, 2009. The theme was Ventura's show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. A debate arose with Ventura opposing the hosts on torture and suspension of due process after the September 11 attacks, as well as the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
The debate shifted from terrorist profiling to racial profiling of Mexicans, in which Ventura said when returning to the United States from his home in Mexico, two hours after crossing the border into Arizona, he witnessed Border Patrol agents demanding proof of citizenship on a highway in an effort to combat illegal immigration, actions that Ventura argued were violating the Constitution. When co-host Jim Norton, who defended these actions by the Border Patrol, said he also believed in the Constitution, Ventura said, "No, you don't, 'cause you're saying this is OK."
Both Ventura and Norton continued to argue over the government's handling of illegal immigration. During the debate, Ventura told Norton to not "put words in my mouth". Norton defended doing so by saying Ventura was doing the same, to which Ventura said "Bye, guys" and prepared to exit the studio. When Norton asked Ventura why he was leaving, Ventura said, "No, I'm not. There's a fucking guy here telling me I've got a schedule, asshole," Norton replied, "You're using dirty language, asshole." Further tension ensued, with Norton making various insults and accusations of physical intimidation.
Norton continued to vent after Ventura left the studio, calling Ventura a "fucking baby" and a "big fucking guy who doesn't like the little guy yelling." The incident was recorded on camera and gained over a million views since the video was posted in December 2009 on YouTube.[tpl]cite news|last=Huff|first=Richard|title=Jesse Ventura walks off 'Opie & Anthony' show after verbal mud fest with Jim Norton|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/12/03/2009-12-03_jesse_ventura_walks_off.html|work=December 3, 2009|work=Daily News|accessdate=September 16, 2011|location=New York[/tpl] Ventura, who was hosted on the Opie and Anthony show a few times prior to the incident, has not returned to the show since.

===Tailgating allegations===

In December 2011 TMZ reported that Jesse Ventura was pulled over for tailgating another vehicle in the San Fernando Valley while on his way to the airport and that the police officers who pulled him over let him go with a warning.[tpl]cite web|last=Gerweck|first=Steve|title=Jesse Ventura pulled over for tailgating|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2011/12/20/jesse-ventura-pulled-over-for-tailgating/|publisher=http://www.gerweck.net|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl] However, Ventura dismissed the rumors and one of his attorneys stated he had not been in California since July 15, 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Ventura Says Story About Being Pulled Over in California is Not True|url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/s2430476.shtml|publisher=http://kstp.com|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl] Ventura himself said that he had not left Minnesota for over a month at the time the story was published and that he has refused to fly commercially since filing an unsuccessful lawsuit against the TSA earlier that year.[tpl]cite web|last=Giri|first=Raj|title=Correction on Jesse Ventura Tailgating Story|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2011/1221/547844/jesse-ventura/|publisher=http://www.wrestlinginc.com|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl] Ventura warned that he was considering a lawsuit against TMZ over the article, which has since been taken off their website and he also denounced the rumors as part of a smear campaign against him.[tpl]cite web|last=Webb|first=Chad|title=Jesse Ventura Has Lawyers Threatening Lawsuit Against TMZ Over Recent News Article|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/215908|publisher=http://www.411mania.com|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl]

===Chris Kyle controversy===

On January 4, 2012, Chris Kyle, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who had served in Iraq who had 160 confirmed kills and was thus the deadliest marksman in American military history,[tpl]cite news|last=Buiso|first=Gary|title=Meet the big shot SEAL is America's deadliest sniper|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/meet_the_big_shot_BxlVpxzQijkC9mwZcmwkrN?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost|publisher=http://www.nypost.com|accessdate=January 13, 2012|date=January 3, 2012[/tpl] promoted his recently released book American Sniper on the Opie and Anthony Show, the same radio show where Ventura got into a verbal altercation with a host two years prior. When Kyle was on the air, a listener called in and asked about how Kyle allegedly punched Ventura in a bar fight. After receiving the call, show host Gregg 'Opie' Hughes asked Kyle about the rumor. Kyle claimed that he punched Ventura in the face at a bar popular with Navy SEAL personnel in Coronado, California, for loudly expressing criticism of the Iraq War back in 2006 during a wake for Michael A. Monsoor, a Medal of Honor recipient and Navy SEAL who had been killed in action in Iraq the same year. According to Kyle, Ventura, who was present in San Diego to give a speech to a graduating BUD/S class, was "letting it known he did not agree" with the war in Iraq and was "bad-mouthing the war, bad-mouthing (former President) Bush, bad-mouthing America." Although Kyle, who wrote about the alleged incident in his book but did not mention Ventura by name, said he approached Ventura and asked him to tone down his voice because the families of SEAL personnel were present, Ventura allegedly said to Kyle that the SEALs "deserved to lose a few guys." Kyle said he responded by punching Ventura.[tpl]cite news|last=Zennie|first=Michael|title=America's deadliest sniper killed 255 Iraqi 'savages' to protect his friends... but he punched out Jesse Ventura because he 'bad-mouthed the troops'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2083235/Americas-deadliest-sniper-killed-255-Iraqi-savages-protect-friends--punched-Jesse-Ventura-bad-mouthed-troops.html|publisher=http://www.dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=January 13, 2012|location=London|date=January 6, 2012[/tpl]Associated Press, "Ex-SEAL’s attorney: Ventura’s claims deficient", Military Times, August 29, 2012 Kyle repeated his claims in a later interview with Bill O'Reilly on his show.
Following this interview, radio host Alex Jones interviewed Ventura on January 8 regarding what happened. During the interview, Ventura denied the rumors, saying he never met Kyle nor has he heard of him before. Ventura argued that had the confrontation occurred, Kyle would be admitting to assault and that the incident would have become known across the Navy SEAL community, as Ventura had been a member of the UDT/SEALs community. Ventura also stated that the bar, known as McP's, was owned by a former Navy SEAL who was his cadre instructor when in the military and that he would not misbehave at the bar. Because the rumors emerged as Ventura was travelling down to his second home in Mexico, Ventura felt that the story was released at that point so he would be unable to properly fight the allegations.[tpl]cite web|last=Watson|first=Paul Joseph|title=Ventura: Navy SEAL ‘Punch’ Hoax May be Retribution For Supporting Ron Paul|url=http://www.infowars.com/ventura-navy-seal-punch-hoax-may-be-retribution-for-supporting-ron-paul/|publisher=www.infowars.com|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl]
After the Opie and Anthony hosts learned of Jones' interview with Ventura, they interviewed Kyle, who clarified his view of what happened and urged witnesses who were present at the bar to come forward to back his claims. Alex Jones, who is a friend of Ventura and was highly skeptical of Kyle's claims before his interview with Ventura, was also invited by the Opie and Anthony hosts to discuss the controversy. After Jones called in, an argument erupted over whether the incident happened, with the Opie and Anthony hosts siding with Kyle's version of events, and Jones siding with Ventura's. During the argument, Kyle denied claims by Jones that he was part of a bigger plot of discrediting Ventura and also suggested frustration over the attention on Kyle being focused on the alleged incident rather than on his book in general. Kyle also offered to meet with Ventura privately to end the dispute.[tpl]cite web|last=Mike|first=Opelka|title=RADIO HOST CONFRONTS SEAL SNIPER OVER VENTURA BAR BRAWL STORY...AND REVEALS ‘PSY-OPS’ THEORY|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/radio-host-confronts-seal-sniper-over-ventura-bar-brawl-story-and-reveals-psy-ops-theory/|publisher=http://www.theblaze.com|accessdate=January 13, 2012[/tpl] While Jones and the Opie and Anthony hosts were receptive to Kyle's proposal, no meeting between him and Ventura occurred.
Ventura, reiterating that the incident did not happen, posted a comment on his official Facebook page saying the following:
[tpl]quote | The event this man spoke of never happened. I have been to McP's many times since leaving the Navy. I was never there alone. I was always accompanied by other people. If this happened 6 years ago, someone would have known of it before now. Certainly in the UDT/SEAL community it would have been known. This has to be news to all of us. I have always opposed the war in Iraq but I have never spoken or wished any ill will towards the soldiers. My heart aches that soldiers have died or been wounded because this war should never have taken place. I am perplexed over the agenda this man has and why a fellow Navy Seal sic would tell a lie about an event that never happened. Clearly between this story and the previous week's story about supposedly getting pulled over for tailgaiting sic in CA that was also a lie, someone is out to destroy my credibility. I find it very interesting that both these stories are being spread by Fox news sic and it's sic affiliates. As a Navy veteran you realize you can’t believe every sea story you hear. Let me finish by stating both of the recent two national stories about me are completely untrue lies, neither event ever happened.

====Lawsuit against Kyle====

Ventura filed a defamation suit against Kyle in January 2012. Ventura initially considered dropping the lawsuit, but several retired Navy SEALs including the owner of McP's demanded that Ventura continue his lawsuit, which Ventura did after Kyle failed to agree on a settlement in which he would state the incident never happened.[tpl]cite web|last=Watson|first=Paul Joseph|title=Jesse Ventura Gets Backing of Former SEALs in Lawsuit Over "Punch" Hoax|url=http://www.infowars.com/jesse-ventura-gets-backing-of-former-seals-in-lawsuit-over-punch-hoax/|publisher=http://www.infowars.com|accessdate=September 6, 2012[/tpl] In a motion filed by Kyle's attorney in August 2012 to dismiss two of the suit's three counts, declarations by five former SEALs and the mothers of two others supported Kyle's account.Browing, Dan, Star Tribune, "Ex-SEAL: Jesse Ventura got popped after popping off", Stars and Stripes, August 29, 2012 However, in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle, and said that Kyle's claims were false.

===Steroid use===

During his wrestling days, Ventura used anabolic steroids. He admitted this after retiring from competition, and went on to make public service announcements and appear in printed ads and on posters warning young people about the potential dangers and potential health risks of abusing steroids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ThisWeek/ucm117728.htm |title=This Week in FDA History |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06[/tpl]

Although a staunch critic of religion, Ventura is a supporter of religious freedom. He endorsed equal rights for religious minorities, as well as people who do not believe in God, by declaring July 4, 2002, "Indivisible Day". Ventura proclaimed October 13–19, 2002 as "Christian Heritage Week" in Minnesota.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?ewsID=1402 |title=Religion News |publisher=Pewforum.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7DF1F3BF931A3575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=National Briefing | Midwest: Minnesota: Christians One Up On Ventura – New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Jo Napolitano (Nyt) |date=August 2, 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl]
In a Playboy interview, Ventura said, "Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business. I live by the golden rule: Treat others as you'd want them to treat you. The religious right wants to tell people how to live." In his 1999 best-selling memoir I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion:
[tpl]quote | I'd like to clarify comments published in Playboy about religious people being weak-minded. I didn't mean all religious people. I don't have any problem with the vast majority of religious folks. I count myself among them, more or less. But I believe because it makes sense to me, not because I think it can be proven. There are lots of people out there who think they know the truth about God and religion, but does anybody really know for sure? That's why the Founding Fathers built freedom of religious belief into the structure of this nation, so that everybody could make up their minds for themselves. But I do have a problem with the people who think they have some right to try to impose their beliefs on others. I hate what the fundamentalist fanatics are doing to our country. It seems as though, if everybody doesn't accept their version of reality, that somehow invalidates it for them. Everybody must believe the same things they do.
