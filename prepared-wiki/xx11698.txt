Roosevelt, he recommended that a foundation be established by Congress to serve as a focal point for the Federal Government's support and encouragement of research and education in science and technology as well as the development of a national science policy. The legislation creating the National Science Foundation was signed by President Harry S. Truman on May 10, 1950
