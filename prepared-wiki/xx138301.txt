Uberdata (also known as Ãœberdata or Uber data) is a ROM editing software designed specifically for On Board Diagnostics (OBD) Honda Engine control units. It was created by Blake Warner (also known as Uberteg or Vertigo). In an article Warner states that "Uberdata is, in short, a piece of software that enables you to modify your Honda ECU's code using a Windows-based program".[tpl]citation|publisher=Honda Tuning Magazine|date=June 2005|page=47[/tpl]
The current stable release is 1.70 (which was officially released on 24 Oct 04). The future of Uberdata is uncertain because Warner stopped developing the program, but he has released the source code to the open source community.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.pgmfi.org/twiki/bin/view/Library/UberDataFAQ|title=Uberdata FAQ|format=[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl]
