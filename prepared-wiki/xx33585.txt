CATEGORIES: Lace, Net fabrics, History of the textile industry

Lace is an openwork fabric, patterned with open holes in the work, made by machine or by hand.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lace |title=Show election|publisher=Lace|accessdate=2012-05-23[/tpl] The holes can be formed via removal of threads or cloth from a previously woven fabric, but more often open spaces are created as part of the lace fabric. Lace-making is an ancient craft. True lace was not made until the late 15th and early 16th centuries. A true lace is created when a thread is looped, twisted or braided to other threads independently from a backing fabric.
Originally linen, silk, gold, or silver threads were used. Now lace is often made with cotton thread, although linen and silk threads are still available. Manufactured lace may be made of synthetic fiber. A few modern artists make lace with a fine copper or silver wire instead of thread.

==Types==

There are many types of lace, classified by how they are made. These include:

==Etymology==

The word lace is from Middle English, from Old French las, noose, string, from Vulgar Latin *laceum, from Latin laqueus, noose; probably akin to lacere, to entice or ensnare.

==History==

In the late 16th century there was a rapid development in the field of lace. There was an openwork fabric where combinations of open spaces and dense textures formed designs. These forms of lace were dominant in both fashion and home décor during the late 1500s. For enhancing the beauty of collars and cuffs, needle lace was embroidered with loops and picots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://decoratingwithlaceoutlet.com/page.asp?id=90 |title=History of Lace | Lace Trends | Lace Spreads |publisher=Decoratingwithlaceoutlet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11[/tpl]
Objects resembling lace bobbins have been found in Roman remains, but there are no records of Roman lace making. Lace was used by clergy of the early Catholic Church as part of vestments in religious ceremonies but did not come into widespread use until the 16th century in the northwestern part of the European continent.Lacemakerslace.oddquine.co.uk The popularity of lace increased rapidly and the cottage industry of lace making spread throughout Europe. Countries like Italy, France, Belgium, Germany (then Holy Roman Empire), Czech Republic (town of Vamberk), Slovenia (town of Idrija), Finland (town of Rauma) England (town of Honiton), Hungary, Ireland, Malta, Russia, Spain, Turkey and others all have an established heritage expressed through lace.
In North America in the 19th century, missionaries spread the knowledge of lace making to the Native American tribes.Lace.lacefairy.com
St. John Francis Regis helped many country girls stay away from the cities by establishing them in the lace making and embroidery trade, which is why he became the Patron Saint of lace making.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
In 1837, Samuel Ferguson first used jacquard looms with Heathcoat’s bobbin net machine, resulting in endless possibilities for lace designs.
Traditionally, lace was used to make tablecloths and doilies and in both men's and women's clothing. The English diarist Samuel Pepys often wrote about the lace used for his, his wife's, and his acquaintances' clothing, and on May 7, 1669, noted that he intended to remove the gold lace from the sleeves of his coat "as it is fit he should", possibly in order to avoid charges of ostentatious living.Diary of Samuel Pepys, May 7, 1669.

===Industrial revolution===

With the passage of time, the way the world produced goods changed. An increase in demand for lace led to the development of machine lace. In 1768, John Heathcoat invented the bobbin net machine, which made it possible to produce complex lace designs more quickly. The Industrial Revolution was the downfall of the handmade lace industry. The teaching of handmade lace making disappeared in schools as emphasis shifted from trades to academics, paving the way for lace making to become a hobby instead of the business it once was.

==Military uniforms==

The term 'lace' is used by the British to refer to the gold bands sewn onto the sleeves of naval officers' uniforms to indicate rank, and to name the similar decoration elsewhere on other uniforms (such as Italian caps and Polish collars) because of the procedure used to make it. In America, the term is not used for this purpose because the bands are compactly sewn metal thread, and 'lace' seems to imply cloth sewn into patterns with holes in them.
