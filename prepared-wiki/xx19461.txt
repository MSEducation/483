Avalanche chess is a chess variant designed by Ralph Betza in 1977. After moving one of your own pieces, you must move one of your opponent's pawns forward one space.

==Rules==

Rules are as normal chess except for the following. After you move one of your own pieces, you must move one of your opponent's pawns one space forward toward you.  You cannot use your opponent's pawn to capture and you cannot move your opponent's pawn two spaces forward. If none of opponent's pawns can be moved, then that part of the turn is skipped. If you must move your opponent's pawn to promotion, then your opponent chooses to what piece it promotes. If moving an opponent's pawn gives check to you, then your opponent wins the game immediately.
