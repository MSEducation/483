Euston railway station or London Euston [tpl]IPAc-en|'|l|ʌ|n|d|ə|n|.|'|j|uː|s|t|ən|[/tpl] is a central London railway terminus and one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/managed-stations/ |title=Commercial information |date=April 2014 |work=Our Stations |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page= |accessdate=12 April 2014 [/tpl] It is the southern terminus of the West Coast Main Line, the main gateway to the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and part of Scotland. Its most important long-distance destinations are Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow.
It is connected to Euston tube station and near Euston Square tube station on the London Underground. It is a short walk from King's Cross Station, the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, and St Pancras International Station for the Midland Main Line and Eurostar to France and Belgium. These stations are all in Travelcard Zone 1.
It is the gateway to Ireland via Holyhead and ferry to Dún Laoghaire, for Dublin.  Until the 1960s the station was a terminus of the most-frequented London to Belfast route via Carlisle and the Beeching Axe-closed Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway to Stranraer.

==History==

It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on 20 July 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway. The original building was demolished in the 1960s and replaced with the present one, built in the international modern style.
The site was selected in the early 1830s by George and Robert Stephenson, engineers of the London and Birmingham Railway. The area was then mostly farmland at the edge of the expanding city of London. The station was named after Euston Hall in Suffolk, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Grafton, who were the main landowners in the area. Objections to the station by local farmers meant that, when the Act authorising construction of the line was passed in 1833, the terminus was at Chalk Farm. These objections were overcome, and in 1835 an Act authorising construction of the station was passed, and construction went ahead.
The station and railway have been owned by the London and Birmingham Railway (1837–1845), the London and North Western Railway (1846–1922), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (1923–1947), British Railways (1948–1994), Railtrack (1994–2001) and Network Rail (2001–present)

===Old building===

The original station was built by William Cubitt.Holland & Hannen and Cubitts — The Inception and Development of a Great Building Firm, 1920, p. 41. It was designed by the classically trained architect Philip Hardwickwww.shaw-hardwick.co.uk – Website in memory of the Hardwick architects with a 200 ft (61 m)-long trainshed by structural engineer Charles Fox. Initially it had only two platforms, one for departures and one for arrivals. Also designed by Hardwick was a 72 ft (22 m)-high Doric propylaeum, the largest ever built,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.topfoto.co.uk/imageflows/preview/t=topfoto&f=0506308 |title=Arch outside the main entrance to Euston Station, Camden, London, 1952 |publisher=Museum of London Picture Library |accessdate=19 August 2007[/tpl] erected at the entrance as a portico, which became known as the Euston Arch.
Until 1844 trains were pulled up the incline to Camden Town by cables because the London and Birmingham Railway's Act of Parliament prohibited the use of locomotives in the Euston area; this prohibition is said to have been in response to concerns of local prominent residents as to the noise and smoke emitted by locomotives toiling up the incline.[tpl]cite web |title= London and Birmingham Railway |url= http://www.crht1837.org/history/lbr |publisher=Camden Railway Heritage Trust |accessdate=22 February 2013[/tpl]
The station grew rapidly over the following years as traffic increased. It was greatly expanded in the 1840s, with the opening in 1849 of the spectacular Great Hall, designed by Hardwick's son Philip Charles Hardwick in classical style. It was [tpl]convert|126|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|61|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|64|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high, with a coffered ceiling and a sweeping double flight of stairs leading to offices at its northern end. Architectural sculptor John Thomas contributed eight allegorical statues representing the cities served by the line.  The station was on Drummond Street, further from Euston Road than the front of the modern complex, which now terminates at the side of the station but then ran across the front.www.motco.com – 1862 map, showing position of 1849 station. A short road called Euston Grove ran from Euston Square towards the arch. Two hotels, the Euston Hotel and the Victoria Hotel, flanked the northern half of this approach.
As traffic grew, the station required further expansion. Two platforms were added in the 1870s with new service roads and entrances, and four in the 1890s, bringing the total to 15, one of them for parcels traffic.[tpl]cite web |title= Euston Station, London |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/virtualarchive/euston-station/ |publisher=Network Rail |accessdate=22 February 2013[/tpl]
Apart from the lodges on Euston Road and statues now on the forecourt, few relics of the old station survive. The National Railway Museum's collection at York includes a commemorative plaque and E.H. Bailey's statue of George Stephenson, both from the Great Hall; the entrance gates; and an 1846 turntable discovered during demolition.

====1930s rebuilding proposals====

By the 1930s the station had become congested, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) looked into the possibility of rebuilding it. They appointed the Welsh architect Percy Thomas to produce some designs. He proposed a new American-inspired station that would involve removing or re-siting the arch. However, World War II intervened and the proposals were shelved.[tpl]cite web |last=Bull |first=John |title=The Euston Arch Part 2: Death |url= http://www.londonreconnections.com/2009/the-euston-arch-part-2-death/ |publisher= London Reconnections |accessdate=22 February 2013[/tpl]

===New building===

In the early 1960s it was decided that a larger station was required. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels at the northern end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and the Arch. Amid much public outcry, the station building and the Arch were demolished in 1961–2 and replaced by a new building. Its opening in 1968 followed the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, and the new structure was intended to symbolise the coming of the "electric age". The station was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction LtdThe New Euston Station 1968 1968 British Rail information booklet to a design by BR's architects in consultation with Richard Seifert & Partners, responsible for the second phase of the complex in the late 1970s.
The station is a long, low structure with a frontage of some [tpl]convert|197|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The second phase consists of a bus terminal and three low-rise office towers looking out on to Melton Street and Eversholt Street. The offices were occupied by British Rail, then Railtrack, and finally Network Rail, which has now vacated all but a small portion of one of the towers. These buildings are in a functional style and the main facing material is polished dark stone, complemented by white tiles, exposed concrete and plain glazing. The station has a single large concourse, separate from the train shed. A few remnants of the older station remain: two Portland stone entrance lodges and a war memorial. A statue of Robert Stephenson by Carlo Marochetti, previously in the old ticket hall, stands in the forecourt.
There is a large statue by Eduardo Paolozzi named Piscator dedicated to German theatre director Erwin Piscator at the front of the courtyard. Other pieces of public art, including low stone benches by Paul de Monchaux around the courtyard, were commissioned by Network Rail in the 1990s.
The station has catering units and shops, a large ticket hall and an enclosed car park with over 200 spaces.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/eus/details.html#Transport_Links |title= Station Facilities for London Euston |publisher=ATOC |date=No date |accessdate=26 March 2013[/tpl]
The screening-off and positioning of platforms away from a spacious main concourse results in a waiting area that is protected from the elements, while areas in front of the inter-city platforms allow passengers to queue without obstructing passenger flow in the main body of the station. Passenger flow is further aided by the positioning of the main departure indicator board to encourage passengers to gather away from platform entrances, and by a walkway under the main concourse that provides a direct link from commuter platforms 8 to 11 to the Underground station.
The lack of daylight on the platforms compares unfavourably with the glazed trainshed roofs of traditional Victorian railway stations, but the use of the space above as a parcels depothttp://www.eustonarch.org/britishrail1968.pdf released the maximum possible space at ground level for platforms and passenger facilities.
The station has 18 platforms: platforms 8 to 11 are used primarily for London Overground and London Midland commuter services, and have automatic ticket gates. Two platforms are extra long to accommodate the 16-car Caledonian Sleeper.

===Architectural controversy===

Euston's 1960s style of architecture has been described as "hideous",[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Williams  |title=The real Eurostar: How a poet returned St Pancras to the nation |date=14 September 2007 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-481696/The-real-Eurostar-How-poet-returned-St-Pancras-nation.html |work =Daily Mail |accessdate=22 September 2007 |location= London[/tpl] "a dingy, grey, horizontal nothingness"[tpl]cite news |first=Andrew |last=Martin |title=So, what would you burn? |date=13 December 2004 |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/node/149574 |work= New Statesman |location=London |accessdate=22 September 2007[/tpl] and a reflection of "the tawdry glamour of its time", entirely lacking in "the sense of occasion, of adventure, that the great Victorian termini gave to the traveller".[tpl]cite news |first=Gavin |last=Stamp |authorlink=Gavin Stamp |title=Steam ahead: the proposed rebuilding of London's Euston station is an opportunity to atone for a great architectural crime |date=October 2007 |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Steam+ahead%3A+the+proposed+rebuilding+of+London's+Euston+station+is+an...-a0169961673 |work= Apollo: the international magazine of art and antiques |accessdate=9 November 2007[/tpl] Writing in The Times, Richard Morrison stated that "even by the bleak standards of Sixties architecture, Euston is one of the nastiest concrete boxes in London: devoid of any decorative merit; seemingly concocted to induce maximum angst among passengers; and a blight on surrounding streets. The design should never have left the drawing-board — if, indeed, it was ever on a drawing-board. It gives the impression of having been scribbled on the back of a soiled paper bag by a thuggish android with a grudge against humanity and a vampiric loathing of sunlight".[tpl]cite news |first=Richard |last=Morrison |title=Euston: we have an architectural problem |date=10 April 2007 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/richard_morrison/article1631849.ece |work =The Times |location=London |accessdate=22 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl] Michael Palin, explorer and travel writer, in his contribution to Great Railway Journeys titled "Confessions of a Trainspotter", likened it to "a great bath, full of smooth, slippery surfaces where people can be sloshed about efficiently".
Access to parts of the station is difficult for the disabled. The ramps from the concourse down to platform level are too steep for unassisted wheelchairs, but the introduction of lifts in May 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station easily accessible from the concourse.
The demolition of the original buildings in 1962 has been described as "one of the greatest acts of Post-War architectural vandalism in Britain" and is believed to have been approved by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan (Con), who was the first of a line of Prime Ministers who championed motorway building. The replacement trainshed has a low, flat roof, making no attempt to match the airy style of London's major 19th century trainsheds. The attempts made to preserve the earlier building, championed by the later Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, led to the formation of The Victorian Society and heralded the modern conservation movement.Royal Institution of British Architects, "How We Built Britain" exhibition. Retrieved 9 September 2007. This movement saved the nearby high Gothic St Pancras Station when it was threatened with demolition by British Rail in 1966, ultimately leading to its renovation in 2007 as the terminus of HS1 to the Continent.
The demolition of the original building is often compared to the 1963 demolition of New York Penn Station, which similarly alerted preservationists in New York City to the importance of saving historic buildings.

===1973 IRA attack===

Extensive but superficial damage was caused by an IRA bomb that exploded close to a snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police were able to evacuate much of the area just prior to the explosion, thereby reducing casualties. In 1974, the mentally-ill Judith Ward was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect. She was acquitted in 1992, and the actual culprit has not been apprehended.BBC On This Day 1973: "Bomb blasts rock Central London". Retrieved 27 February 2007.

===Privatisation===

Ownership of the station transferred from British Rail to Railtrack plc in 1994, passing to Network Rail in 2002 following the failure of Railtrack.
In 2005 Network Rail was reported to have long-term aspirations to redevelop the station, removing the 1960s buildings and providing a great deal more commercial space by using the "air rights" above the platforms.
In December 2005 Network Rail announced as part of the redevelopment plans to create a subway link to Euston Square tube station, currently separated by a five-minute walk along Euston Road.http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/125 – Euston to Euston Square subway link

===2007 rebuilding announcement===

On 5 April 2007, British Land announced that it had won the tender to demolish and rebuild the station, spending some £250m of its overall redevelopment budget of £1bn for the area. The number of platforms will increase from 18 to 21.[tpl]cite news  |url= http://www.building.co.uk/news/british-land-wins-%C2%A31bn-euston-contract/3084568.article |work=Building |date=5 April 2007 |last=Stewart |first= Dan  |title=British Land wins £1bn Euston contract[/tpl] Media reports in early 2008 hinted that the Arch could be rebuilt.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article3385860.ece |newspaper=The Times |location=London |first= Marcus |last= Binney |title=Landmark of the railway age may be resurrected |date= 18 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]

===Usage===

It is the sixth-busiest terminus in London by entries and exits.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/stn_usage_report_0708.pdf |title=Station Usage 2007/08 |publisher=Network Rail |accessdate=15 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.networkrail.co.uk/managed-stations/ | title=Stations Run by Network Rail | year= | author= | publisher =Network Rail | accessdate=23 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/EUS/details.html |title=Station facilities for London Euston |work=National Rail Enquiries |accessdate=29 May 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 [/tpl]

===High Speed 2===

On 11 March 2010 the Secretary of State for Transport announced that Euston was the preferred southern terminus of the proposed High Speed 2 line to Birmingham and the north.[tpl]cite book |url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/commandpaper/pdf/cmdpaper.pdf |title=High Speed Rail — Command Paper |author=Department for Transport |publisher= The Stationery Office |isbn=978-0-10-178272-2 |year=2010a |accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] This would require expansion to the south and west to create new sufficiently long platforms. These plans would preclude the 2007 reconstruction and would entail complete reconstruction, involving the demolition of 220 Camden Council flats, with half the station providing conventional train services and the new half high-speed trains. The Command Paper suggests rebuilding the Arch and an artist's impression includes it.[tpl]cite web |url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/rail/pi/highspeedrail/commandpaper/pdf/cmdpaper.pdf |page=104 |publisher=Department for Transport |title=High Speed Rail (Command Paper) |date=March 2010[/tpl]
The station would have 24 platforms serving both high-speed and classic lines. These would be at a low level while the flats demolished by the extension would be replaced by significant building work above. The underground station would also be rebuilt and connected to Euston Square tube station. When High Speed 2 is extended beyond Birmingham, the Mayor's office believes it will be necessary to build the proposed Crossrail 2 line via Euston to relieve 10,000 extra passengers forecast to arrive during an average day.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.standard.co.uk/news/highspeed-trains-will-increase-passenger-numbers-by-10000-at-euston-station-6571867.html |title= High-speed trains 'will increase passenger numbers by 10,000' at Euston station |work=London Evening Standard |date=28 February 2011 |author=Cecil, Nicholas[/tpl]Transport Select Committee, 28 June 2011, House of CommonsSubject: Proposal for Examining the Potential Effect of High Speed 2 on London's Transport Network, Greater London Authority, 17 May 2011.High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain's Future Consultation, Department for Transport, February 2011.
In order to relieve pressure on Euston during and after the rebuilding for High Speed 2, HS2 Ltd has proposed the withdrawal of London Overground trains between Euston and [tpl]stnlink|Queen's Park[/tpl], and the diversion to Crossrail of eight London Midland trains per hour from Milton Keynes.High Speed Rail London to the West Midlands and Beyond: A Report to Government by High Speed Two Limited: part 3 of 11[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

==Services==

Four train operating companies use Euston, with the following services in trains per hour:
Virgin Trains operates Intercity West Coast services from platforms 1–7 and 12–18:
London Midland operates regional, commuter and outer suburban services from platforms 8-15 and 17.
London Overground operates local commuter services, usually from platform 9.
First ScotRail operates two nightly Caledonian Sleepers to Scotland.

==London Underground==

Euston station is directly above and connected to Euston tube station, on the Victoria line and the Northern line (both Bank and Charing Cross branches) of the London Underground. Euston Square tube station on the Circle line, Hammersmith & City line and Metropolitan line is a five-minute walk away along Euston Road.
If High Speed 2 goes ahead, Transport for London (TfL) plans to change the safeguarded route for the proposed Chelsea–Hackney line to include Euston between Tottenham Court Road and King's Cross St Pancras.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?ID=25199 |title= HS2 fuels Crossrail 2 business case |work=TransportXtra |date=21 December 2010[/tpl] As part of the rebuilding work for High Speed 2, it is proposed to integrate Euston and Euston Square into a single tube station.
