==History==

The Butterfield Overland Mail route was a stagecoach route chosen to be snow-free unlike the more northern but shorter routes in place at the time. It ran from St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California beginning in 1858. Fayetteville was located between the major stops at Tipton, Missouri and Fort Smith, Arkansas and the city grew significantly during the trail's operation. This segment overlapped a formerly well-traveled Native American removal route from Springfield, Missouri to Fayetteville from the 1830s.[tpl] cite web |url=http://anpa.ualr.edu/trail_of_tears/indian_removal_project/site_reports/pea_ridge/pea_ridge_1.htm |title=The Pea Ridge National Military Park Site: Interpretive Contexts |publisher=American Native Press Archives |accessdate=2011-09-26 [/tpl] John Butterfield built a hotel and several barns in Fayetteville for his travelers to utilize before continuing north to Fitzgerald Station in Shiloh, Mudtown, Cross Hollows, Callahanâ€™s tavern and Missouri. 

==Preservation==

Today, the route has been partially preserved as Arkansas Highway 265 in Northwest Arkansas and (partially) as Old Wire Road in Fayetteville. The route is designated with historic markers through Fayetteville, including an original stone along present-day College Avenue in front of the Former Washington County Courthouse. This NRPH segment is not designated AR 265 and runs through Lake Fayetteville Park as a dirt path.
In south Washington County, Arkansas another NRHP-listed segment exists along Bugscuffle Road.[tpl] cite web |url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic-properties/_search_nomination_popup.asp?id=904 |title=Butterfield Overland Mail Route Fayetteville Segments Historic District |publisher=Arkansas Historic Preservation Program |accessdate=2011-09-26 [/tpl]
A study to include the Butterfield Trail as a National Historic Trail was commissioned in the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 upon the request of Representative John Bozeman as a nationally significant piece of history of trade and commerce in America.
