A Warthin–Finkeldey cell is a type of giant multinucleate cell found in hyperplastic lymph nodes early in the course of measles and also in HIV-infected individuals,[tpl]cite journal | author = Burke AP, Anderson D, Mannan P, Ribas JL, Liang YH, Smialek J, Virmani R. | title=Systemic lymphadenopathic histology in human immunodeficiency virus-1-seropositive drug addicts without apparent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome | journal=Hum Pathol. | year=1994 | volume=25 | issue=3 | pages = 248–56 | pmid=8150456[/tpl] as well as in Kimura disease,[ref][tpl]cite journal | author = Abuel-Haija M, Hurford MT | year = 2007 | title = Kimura Disease | journal = Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine | volume = 131 | issue=4 | pages=650–651 | pmid=17425383 | doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2007)131650:KD2.0.CO;2[/tpl]
