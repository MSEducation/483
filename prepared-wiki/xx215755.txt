Magdiel ([tpl]lang-he|מגדיאל[/tpl]), founded in 1924 in the Yishuv of Mandate Palestine, is one of the four original communities of Jewish agriculturalists that combined in 1964 to form Hod Hasharon, Israel.
Magdiel was established as a moshava, starting on 4,000 dunams of land purchased near the Arab village of Biyar 'Adas. The initial population included Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and Lithuania, later joined by a group from the Netherlands.Encyclopedia Judaica, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972, Vol. 8, p. 802, "Hod Ha-Sharon" In 1964, four villages - Magdiel, Ramatayim, Hadar, and Ramat Hadar - merged to become Hod Hasharon.Encyclopedia Judaica, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, 1972, Vol. 8, p. 802, "Hod Ha-Sharon"
