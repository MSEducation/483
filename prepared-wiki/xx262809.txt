Roy Herman "Squib" Torbet (August 21, 1889 – February 1974) was an American football player.  He played at the end and fullback positions for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1910 to 1913. He developed a reputation as an excellent forward passer and was one of the earliest Michigan players to have success as a passer.

==Early years==

A native of Detroit, Michigan, Torbet attended the Detroit public schools.  He attended Detroit Central High School and was a star of the school's football teams in 1908 and 1909.  After the 1908 season, the school's yearbook noted that Torbet's "sensational playing was a bright feature of every game."  He was unanimously selected as the captain of the school's 1909 football team.[tpl]cite book|title=The D.C.H.S.

==University of Michigan==

Torbet graduated from high school in 1910 and enrolled at the University of Michigan.  He was a reserve on Michigan's football team in 1910,[tpl]cite web|title=1910 Michigan Football Roster|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/FMPro?-DB=allrost.fp5&-Format=fbresult.htm&-SortField=name&-SortOrder=Ascend&year=1910&-max=170&-Find[/tpl] and a three-year starter at the end, fullback and halfback positions from 1911 to 1913.[tpl]cite web|title=1911 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1911fbt.htm|accessdate=January 4, 2011[/tpl](started three games at left halfback in 1911)[tpl]cite web|title=1912 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1912fbt.htm|accessdate=January 4, 2011[/tpl](started five games at end in 1912)[tpl]cite web|title=1913 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1913fbt.htm|accessdate=January 4, 2011[/tpl](started four games at end, and two at fullback in 1913)  The Wolverines compiled a record of 16-4-2 in Torbet's three years as a starter.
Torbet was one of the earliest Michigan Wolverines football players to have success as a forward passer.  The forward pass was not legalized until 1906,[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=New Football Rules: Radical Changes Are Tentatively Adopted |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/251732852.html?dids=251732852:251732852&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=JAN+28%2C+1906&author=Special+to+The+Washington+Post.&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=NEW+FOOTBALL+RULES |format= |work=Washington Post |publisher= |pages= |page=S1 |date=1906-01-28 |accessdate=2008-02-19 [/tpl] and it was not until 1913 (after the success that year of Gus Dorais and Knute Rockne at Notre Dame) that the forward pass was widely popularized.[tpl]cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1418742&type=Page2Story&imagesPrint=off |title= Football history passes away |accessdate= 2008-06-11 |last= Caple |first= Jim |date= 2002-08-16 |work= |publisher= ESPN.com [/tpl]Cross, Harry, "Inventing the Forward Pass", November 1, 1913, reprinted in "This Day in Sports", The New York Times, November 1, 2004  
Two years before Dorais and Rockne popularized the passing game, Torbet developed a reputation as one of the game's best forward passers.  The Detroit Free Press wrote that, in 1911, "his long forward passes were largely instrumental in bringing Michigan her victory."  In the final game of the 1912 season, on fourth down with seven yards to go in the fourth quarter, Torbet threw a touchdown pass to Miller Pontius to give Michigan the lead against Cornell; Michigan won the game 20-7.[tpl]cite news|title=Cornell 7; Michigan 20|publisher=The Michigan Alumnus|date=December 1912|page=137|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nAriAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]  The New York Times praised Torbet's work in the "whirlwind finish" against Cornell: "While Cornell did not have as strong a team as was expected, the Wolverines' expert use of the forward pass placed them on a higher plane than they have reached before this fall. ... It was the forward pass that did the work, and to 'Squib' Torbet belongs the glory. His heaves were excellent."[tpl]cite news|title=Cornell Loses At End: Michigan Makes Whirlwind Finish and Wins, 20 to 7|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 1912|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60D12FF355E13738DDDAE0994D9415B828DF1D3|accessdate=January 4, 2011[/tpl] 
At the end of the 1912 season, Torbet was selected by Fielding H. Yost as a first-team player on his All-Western team.[tpl]cite news|title=SIX MICHIGAN PLAYERS IN YOST'S ALL-WESTERN TEAM: Torbet, Quinn, Pontius, Paterson, Craig and Thomson Earn Places on Mythical Eleven--"Hurry-Up" Thinks Michigan Superior of Conference Outfits|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=November 28, 1912|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749709912.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+28,+1912&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=11&desc=SIX+MICHIGAN+PLAYERS+IN+YOST'S+ALL-WESTERN+TEAM[/tpl]
In early 1913, Torbet announced plans to leave the university, stating that he was not satisfied with the results of his last semester's examinations.  However, in late February 1913, he announced that he had reconsidered his decision and would return to the football team in the fall of 1913.[tpl]cite news|title="SQUIB" TORBET WILL RETURN TO ANN ARBOR: Star End of Maize and Blue Eleven Reconsiders Plan to Leave School|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=February  21, 1913|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1758809292.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Feb+21,+1913&author=Special+to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=12&desc=%22SQUIB%22+TORBET+WILL+RETURN+TO+ANN+ARBOR[/tpl]  The Detroit Free Press reported: "It seems that the forward-passing end was a bit hasty in making up his mind to leave and that when the matter was gone into carefully it was found that he was not in bad shape at all scholastically."  
As a senior in 1913, he was moved to the fullback position where he continued to develop a reputation as an effective forward passer.[tpl]cite news|title=TORBET OUT; CRAIG WILL BE IN GAME: TORN MUSCLES FORCE ROY TO STAY IDLE|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 1, 1913|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1764768562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+1,+1913&author=to+The+Free+Press&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=10&desc=TORBET+OUT;+CRAIG+WILL+BE+IN+GAME[/tpl]  At the end of October 1913, the Detroit Free Press wrote: "The showing of 'Squib' Torbet at fullback this afternoon was the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal scrimmage.  ...  On his off tackle plunges the new Yost fullback was always good for a gain.  He hit low and hard when he came to his opposition and he seldom failed to string out a bunch of tacklers before he was finally stopped, and once he spun a forward pass down the field that was a beauty. ...  The aim of Torbet was perfect.  The ball went like a streak and was high and true."[tpl]cite news|title=ROY TORBET PLAYS FULL WITH STYLE: Detroit Boy's Performance is Only Bright Spot in Thursday's Practice for Syracuse Game -- Bound to Stick|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 31, 1913|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1764784762.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+31,+1913&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=12&desc=ROY+TORBET+PLAYS+FULL+WITH+STYLE[/tpl]
