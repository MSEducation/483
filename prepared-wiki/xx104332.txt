The forest is mainly savannah covered with tall elephant grasses. The main attraction of the park is the Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The park holds the largest rhino population in India after Kaziranga National Park in Assam. Other animals in the park include Royal Bengal Tigers, elephants, sambar, barking deer, spotted deer, hog deer, wild pigs, and bison.
Jaldapara is a paradise for bird watchers. It is one of the very few places in India, where the Bengal florican is sighted. The other birds to be found here are the crested eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, shikra, Finn's weaver, jungle fowl, peafowl (peacock), partridge, and lesser Pied Hornbill. Pythons, monitor lizards, kraits, cobras, geckos, and about 8 species of fresh water turtles can also be found here.
