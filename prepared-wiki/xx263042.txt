CATEGORIES: Industry in China

Rare earth industry in China is a huge and important industry domestically and elsewhere around the world which uses these metals to manufacture everything from electric or hybrid vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics and other clean energy technologies.[tpl]cite news|title=China may not issue new 2011 rare earths export quota: report|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BU04S20101231| work=Reuters|date=31 December 2010[/tpl] Rare earth minerals are a group of 17 elementshttp://www.steelguru.com/metals_news/Top_Chinese_rare_earth_producer_to_build_stockpile/183875.html which are found dispersed in low concentrations and costly to extract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/rare-earth.htm|title=Rare-Earth Elements (REE)|publisher=www.globalsecurity.org[/tpl]

==History==

China began dominating the rare earth trade two decades ago as it became more economical to produce locally and its lax environmental regulations.[tpl]cite news|author=William J. Broad|title=Mining the Seafloor for Rare-Earth Minerals|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/science/09seafloor.html|date=November 8, 2010|publisher=New York Times[/tpl] China's rare earth production may be the largest in the world but this is made up by large number of producers who have small production output.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/rare-earth-industry.htm|title=Rare-Earth Elements (REE) Industry|publisher=www.globalsecurity.org[/tpl]
China's start to the rare earth industry began in 1986 with the program known as Program 863 which calls for the advancing of the country through technological breakthrough and increase research to propel the country forward economically and strategically.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iags.org/rareearth0310hurst.pdf|title=Chinaâ€™s Rare Earth Elements Industry: What Can the West Learn?|author=Cindy Hurst|date=March 2010|publisher=Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS)[/tpl] The other important program Program 973 created as a basic research program to utilise science to advance the rare earth industry.
In 2002, China's central government push forward restructuring of the domestic rare earth industry by creating two state-owned groups China Northern Rare Earth Group Company and China Southern Rare Earth Group Company. This largely failed due to opposition from powerful local authorities and local producers. Fierce competition in the local sector produced low profitability and inefficiency. This drove producers to consolidate and merge into larger companies for survival.
In China, Xu Guangxian is regarded as the founding father of China's rare earth industry. He helped spearheaded China's strategic scientific development into rare earth in the early nineties which lead China to become a rare earth powerhouse.  Xu was the chair of Natural Science Foundation of China and former chief of the Chinese Academy of Science. He is also former president of the Chinese Chemical Society.
As rare earth prices goes up because of the restriction of export, many illegal mines were developed by organized criminals to benefit from the trade.[tpl]cite news|title=In China, Illegal Rare Earth Mines Face Crackdown|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/business/global/30smuggle.html|author=Keith Bradsher|date=December 29, 2010|publisher=New York Times[/tpl] The smuggling by organized criminal groups is harmful to China's rare earth industry as it depletes resources rapidly, deflate prices and cause supply problems for local producers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2010/October/29101001.asp|title=Smuggling key factor in China's rare earth actions|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=29 October 2010[/tpl] It is estimated a third of exports or 20 000 tonnes in 2008 were illegally exported from China.

Due to Chinese restrictions and heavy dependence by foreign companies in other countries, there is work going on to restart rare earth mines in other countries and pressure high manufacturing economies like Japan to look elsewhere to source their rare earth demands.[tpl]cite web|title=Western Australia sees bonanza in Chinese move |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/western-australia-sees-bonanza-in-chinese-move/story-e6frg6nf-1225978995918|author=Nicolas Perpitch|date=December 31, 2010|publisher=The Australian[/tpl] Non Chinese companies which will benefit from increased demand is Lynas Corporation and Alkane Resources of Australia.

==Research==

China has two state research facilities which provide specialist research into rare earth elements. They are the Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications state key laboratory, which is associated with Peking University. The other laboratory is the Rare Earth Resource Utilization state key laboratory located in Changchun, Jilin province.
Chinese rare earth industry also have two journals which published research in rare earth minerals.[tpl]cite web|title=China's Ace in the Hole: Rare Earth Elements|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/chinas-ace-in-the-hole.html|author=Cindy A. Hurst|publisher=National Defense University Press[/tpl] They are the Journal of Rare Earth and China Rare Earth Information (CREI) Journal.
These journals are published by the Chinese Society of Rare Earths established in 1980 by Chinese rare earth researchers.

==Major players==

Chinese rare earth industry is dominated by local state owned firms, private firms and centrally owned state firms.[tpl]cite web|title=China to cut 90 rare earth firms into 20 |url=http://business.globaltimes.cn/industries/2010-09/571679.html|date=September 9, 2010|publisher=globaltimes.cn[/tpl]
In northern China, rare earth industry is dominated by  the Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Company. In southern China, China Minmetals Corporation is the dominant player in the region. Other major players include the Aluminum Corporation of China Limited and China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining.
