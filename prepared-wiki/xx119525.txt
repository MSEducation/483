The distinction between Empire and Kingdom here is arbitrary. Many of the kingdoms which began as such expanded to become empires or some empires broke down into smaller kingdoms. As an example, Maratha Empire grew from a small kingdom established by Shivaji into a powerful empire in eighteenth century while the later Mughal Emperors became powerless entities.
