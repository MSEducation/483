</ref> According to these sources, 400 ships from the [[Mali Empire]] discovered a land across the ocean to the West after being swept off course by ocean currents. Only one ship returned, and the captain reported the discovery of a western current to Prince [[Abu Bakr II|Abubakari II]]; the off-course Mali fleet of 400 ships is said to have conducted both trade and warfare with the peoples of the western lands. It is claimed that Abubakari II abdicated his throne and set off to explore these western lands. In 1324, the Mali king [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]] is said to have told the Arabic historian, [[Al-Omari|Al-Umari]] that "his predecessors had launched two expeditions from West Africa to discover the limits of the Atlantic Ocean."
According to the abstract of Columbus' log made by Bartolomé de las Casas, the purpose of Columbus’ third voyage was to test both the claims of King John II of Portugal that “canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea Africa and sailed to the west with merchandise” as well as the claims of the native inhabitants of Hispaniola that “from the south and the southeast had come black people whose spears were made of a metal called guanín...from which it was found that of 32 parts: 18 were gold, 6 were silver, and 8 copper.”[tpl]cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|title=Journals & Other Documents on the Life & Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1963|publisher=The Heritage Press|location=New York|pages=262, 263[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolomé De Las Casas, the first Historians of America|year=1903|publisher=G.

===Chinese===

Other researchers have argued that the Olmec civilization came into existence with the help of Chinese refugees, particularly at the end of the Shang dynasty.This theory is mentioned in the history book The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community (1963) by William H. McNeill In 1975, Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institution argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BC.Meggers. In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that celts from La Venta bear Chinese characters.Xu, Origin of the Olmec civilization.Dr. Mike Xu's Transpacific website, comparing Olmec and Chinese Shang period artifacts.  These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Other claims have been made for early Chinese contact with North America.
In 1882 artefacts identified at the time as Chinese coins were discovered in British Columbia. A contemporary account states that:[tpl]cite journal|last=Dean|first=James|journal=The American Naturalist|year=1884|pages=98–99|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2450831|accessdate=March 16, 2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press for The American Society of Naturalists|volume=18|issue=1|month=January[/tpl] In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by the Emperor Huungti, 2637 B. C., and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.  In 1885, a vase containing similar discs was also discovered, wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300 years old.[tpl]cite book|last=Chow|first=Lily|title=Chasing their dreams : Chinese settlement in the Northwest region of British Columbia = Zhui qun meng xiang|year=2000|publisher=Caitlin Press|location=Prince George, B.C.|isbn=0-920576-83-4|chapter=The Gold Fever|chapterurl=http://caitlin-press.com/our-books/chasing-their-dreams/[/tpl]  Grant Keddie, Curator of Archeology at the Royal BC Museum, examined a photograph of a coin from Cassiar taken in the 1940s (whereabouts now unknown) and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground show it to be a 19th-century copy of a Ming Dynasty temple token.[tpl]cite book|title=Western Washington Indian socio-economics: papers in honor of Angelo Anastasio|year=1984|publisher=Western Washington University|page=172|author=Megan Merry McCormick|editor=Herbert C Taylor and Garland F Grabert|chapter=Chinese Coins and Pre-Columbian Asian Contacts with the Pacific Northwest[/tpl]
A group of Chinese Buddhist missionaries led by Hui Shen before 500 AD claimed to have visited a location called Fusang. Although Chinese mapmakers placed this territory on the Asian coast, others have suggested as early as the 1800sAnonymous (1892). "The Land of Fu-Sang,' Science 20:148; reprinted in William R.

In his book 1421: The Year China Discovered the World, the British author Gavin Menzies made the controversial claim that the fleet of Zheng He arrived in America in 1421.Menzies, Gavin. 1421: The Year China Discovered the World (Transworld Publishers, 2003).

In 1973 and 1975 dough-nut shaped stones were discovered off the coast of California that resembled Chinese stone anchors used by fishermen. These (sometimes called the Palos Verdes stones) were initially thought to be up to 1500 years old and proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as Monterey shale, and they are thought to have been used by Chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth century.Kenneth L.

===Japanese===

Smithsonian archaeologist Betty Meggers noted that pottery associated with the Valdivia culture of coastal Ecuador dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the Jōmon period in Japan, arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible.Valdivia, Jomon Fishermen, and the Nature of the North Pacific: Some Nautical Problems with Meggers, Evans, and Estrada's (1965) Transoceanic Contact Thesis Gordon F. McEwan, D. Bruce Dickson American Antiquity, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul. 1978), pp. 362–371.Prehistory of the Americas By Stuart J. Fiedel pp 188–189. The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.
Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the Zuni people of New Mexico exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese.Davis, Nancy Yaw (200). The Zuni Enigma. W. W. Norton & Company. ISBN 0-393-32230-0, ISBN 978-0-393-32230-9 The Zuni language is a linguistic isolate, and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, endemic disease, and religion. Davis speculates that Buddhist priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the American Southwest, and influenced Zuni society.
James WickershamWickersham, James (1892). "Origin of the Indians--The Polynesian Route." American Antiquarian, 16:323-335, partly reprinted in William R. Corliss, ed. (1978) Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts, Glen Arm, Maryland: Sourcebook Project, ISBN 0915554-03-8 pp. 705-709 argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 1600s to the mid-1800s several dozen Japanese ships were carried from Asia to North America along the powerful Kuroshio Currents. Such Japanese ships landed from the Aleutian Islands in the north to Mexico in the south, carrying a total of 293 persons in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels, but in 1833 one Japanese crew crashed near Cape Flattery and was enslaved by Makahs for a period before being rescued by members of the Hudson's Bay Company. Another Japanese ship crashed in about 1850 near the mouth of the Columbia River, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America.

===Mormon archaeology===

The Book of Mormon states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples, all of whom sailed from the Old World.
Mormon apologetics groups such as the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies attempt to vindicate these ideas.
Though discovered and documented first in the 1930s, Izapa Stela 5 is particularly noteworthy because of the controversy created by the proposition by Professor M. Wells Jakeman in 1953 that the stone was a record of the Book of Mormon tree of life vision,*[tpl]aut|Brewer, Stewart W.[/tpl], (1999); "The History of an Idea: The Scene on Stela 5 from Izapa, Mexico, as a Representation of Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life", (p. 12) which he considered of Old World origin.

==Claims of trans-oceanic travel from the New World==

In addition to trans-oceanic travel to the Americas from elsewhere, there is also evidence for possible travels originating from the New World.

===Arctic and Native American peoples===

There is substantial evidence for Inuit and other American Arctic peoples arriving in Europe prior to Columbus' voyage. Contact between indigenous Americans and the Norse of Greenland as early as the 11th century is well attested. In 1009, Norse explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni captured two boys from Markland (Labrador) and took them to Greenland, where they were taught to speak Norse and baptized. The Norse sagas report that Thorfinn sailed to Norway and then Iceland shortly after; though it is not explicitly stated, it is likely that he took his two captives with him. If so, they may have been the earliest Americans to come to Europe. It is possible that the Norse took other indigenous peoples to Europe as slaves over the following centuries, because they are known to have taken Scottish and Irish slaves.[tpl]cite book |title= The American Discovery of Europe|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 0-252-03152-0 |page= 163|pages= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=cd8yZn7MfSQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=American+Discovery+of+Europe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V-TwTs-nKIKEtgeEhpnQBg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Nidaros&f=false|accessdate= December 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1993|publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 0-252-06321-X |pages= 18–21| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&pg=PA20&dq=Trondheim+cathedral+Inuit&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BuDwTsilH4X7ggfekdWbAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Trondheim%20cathedral%20Inuit&f=false |accessdate= December 20, 2011[/tpl]
In 2010 DeCODE genetics and Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir, revealed the results of a genetic study of the Icelandic population, showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA found only in 'Native American' and East Asian populations, and all had a line of descent from a single woman, whose foreign DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and almost certainly around 1000. This DNA is distinct from Inuit DNA, and combining the historical and genetic information available, the only realistic hypothesis is that this ancestral woman was a 'Native American' presumably abducted from the Vínland area of North America around 1000 by visiting Norsemen.
In 1420, Danish geographer Claudius Clavus Swart wrote that he personally had seen "pygmies" from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim along with another, longer boat also taken from "pygmies". Clavus Swart's description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the kayak and the umiak. Similarly, the Swedish clergyman Olaus Magnus wrote in 1505 that he saw in Oslo Cathedral two leather boats taken decades prior. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the Haakons, which would place the event in the 14th century.
Additionally, there is substantial evidence of Inuit coming to Europe under their own power or as captives after 1492, opening up the possibility that this had happened previously as well. A substantial body of Greenland Inuit folklore first collected in the 19th century told of journeys by boat to Akilineq, here depicted as a rich country across the ocean.[tpl]cite book |title= In Order to Live Untroubled: Inuit of the Central Arctic, 1550-1940 |last= Fossett|first= Renée |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2001 |publisher= University of Manitoba Press|location= |isbn= 0-88755-647-7 |page= |pages= 75–77 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=yK7cac_mXGgC&pg=PA80&dq=Inuit+in+Europe+Trondheim&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V9rwTsmWJYzhggevrOirAg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=[/tpl]
Pre-Columbian contact between Alaska and Kamchatka via the subarctic Aleutian Islands would have been conceivable, but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the American side and its western continuation, the Commander Islands, remained uninhabited until after Russian explorers discovered the Aleut people in 1741. There is no genetic or linguistic evidence for earlier contact along this route.[tpl]cite news |title=The Peopling of the Aleutians |date=January 13, 2012 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.335.6065.158 |volume=335 |number=6065 |pages=158–161 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/158[/tpl]

===Other claims trans-Atlantic contacts===

According to Bartolomé de las Casas, two dead bodies that looked like those of Indians were found on the Portuguese Flores Island in the Azores. He said he found that fact in Columbus' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.De Las Casas, Bartolomé; Pagden, Anthony (September 8, 1999). A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indias. New York: Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-044562-5. In Ferdinand Columbus' biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in Galway, Ireland two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been Inuit who had drifted off course.Seaver (1995), p. 208

===Inca===

Túpac Inca Yupanqui, the tenth Inca emperor, is said to have led an expedition lasting from nine months to a year into the Pacific Ocean around 1480, which discovered two islands.[tpl]Cite book | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20218/20218-8.txt | title = History of the Incas | author = Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa | editor = Sir Clements Markham | chapter = TUPAC INCA YUPANQUI SETS OUT, A SECOND TIME, BY ORDER OF HIS FATHER, TO CONQUER WHAT REMAINED UNSUBDUED IN CHINCHAY-SUYU | others = Sir Clements Markham[/tpl] – see note 104 It has been suggested that the islands he visited are the Galápagos, or possibly Polynesian islands (Easter Island).[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] The story says that he brought back gold, brass, and the skin and jaw of a horse,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] none of which would have been found on islands in the south Pacific. This story inspired the Kon Tiki expedition, which set out to prove that such a voyage was possible.

===Hagoth===

In addition to the Mormon stories about people sailing to the New World, there is also the story of Hagoth, who allegedly sailed from the Americas to Polynesia. But while the stories of Lehi and Jared are generally accepted by Mormons, that of Hagoth is more ambiguous and it is not universally supported by Mormons, and not at all by non-members of that church. Differentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one Mormon writer makes the following observations:
  The Book of Mormon does not equate the "west sea" with the Pacific Ocean. The Book of Mormon does not tell us that Hagoth was on board any of the ships that were lost. Scripture does not say that he captained a vessel or that he was an explorer or an adventurer, or that he led people. For all we can tell, the skilled Hagoth’s main objective was to profit from the shipping industry. It is possible for peoples in various places to be related to Hagoth’s people (the Nephites) without Hagoth personally making an ocean voyage. Coastal and Island hopping colonies, once associated with Nephite shipping, could have built more vessels and traveled very far. It is also important to realize that the peoples of the Pacific islands may have come from more than one direction.Coon, W. Vincent, Q & A, “Hagoth’s Lost Ships!”; additionally, Coon notes that the scriptural use of the term “curious” may mean “accomplished with skill and ingenuity” and that it does not necessarily imply an inclination for adventure. 
Non-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsR. Lanier Britsch stated in the New Era, "Since the days of George Q. Cannon in Hawaii (1851–54), the Church leaders had more and more frequently alluded to the idea that the Polynesians were descendants of Lehi, the early Book Of Mormon prophet. Although the relationship between the Polynesian peoples and the alleged “adventurer” Hagoth (see Alma 63:5–8) is not clear—he being a Nephite and the Polynesians appearing to be Lamanites—Church leaders have time and time again referred to the Polynesians as children of Lehi." R. Lanier Britsch, "Maori Traditions and the Mormon Church", New Era, June 1981.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Book of Mormon Seminary Student Study Guide and scholars have stated that the peoples of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Polynesia, and New Zealand, are descendants of the Nephite Hagoth and his supposed followers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp |title=Book of Mormon Student Manual |publisher=Ldsces.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl] According to the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were descendants of Israel. Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor.For one Mormon artists portrayal of Polynesian people as the "Children of Hagoth", see "A Worldwide Look at the Book of Mormon", Liahona, December 2000. For a mention of Hagoth being considered a "popular hero" by Polynesian Mormon youth, see Kathleen C. Perrin, "Tahitian Pearls", Liahona June 1994.
