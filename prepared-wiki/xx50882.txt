In recent years, the safety of ephedra-containing dietary supplements has been questioned by the medical community as a result of reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths.[tpl]cite journal |author=Haller C, Benowitz N |title=Adverse cardiovascular and central nervous system events associated with dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=343 |issue=25 |pages=1833–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11117974 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200012213432502[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Bent S, Tiedt T, Odden M, Shlipak M |title=The relative safety of ephedra compared with other herbal products |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=138 |issue=6 |pages=468–71 |year=2003 |pmid=12639079 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-138-6-200303180-00010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Consumer Advisory on ephedra | date = 2004-10-01 | url = http://nccam.nih.gov/health/alerts/ephedra/consumeradvisory.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Food and Drug Administration summary of actions regarding sale of ephedra supplements | url = http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/ephedra/february2004/ | accessdate = 2007-02-13[/tpl] In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of ephedra-containing supplements in 2004.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2004/NEW01050.html | title = FDA Final Rule Banning Dietary Supplements With Ephedrine Alkaloids Becomes Effective | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=7 February 2007[/tpl] The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108715.htm | title = FDA Statement on Tenth Circuit's Ruling to Uphold FDA Decision Banning Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration[/tpl] The sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements is currently illegal in the United States because of the high risk of ephedra-related adverse events.

==Biochemistry and effects==

A wide variety alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of ephedra.  Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Abourashed|first=Ehab A.|coauthors=Abir T. El-Alfy, Ikhlas A. Khan and Larry Walker|title=Ephedra in perspective – a current review|journal=Phytotherapy Research|year=2003|volume=17|pages=703–712|url=http://ipac.kacst.edu.sa/eDoc/2006/158199_1.pdf|doi=10.1002/ptr.1337[/tpl] The stimulant and thermogenic effects of Ephedra sinica and other ephedra species are due to the presence of the alkaloids ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.
Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug,[tpl]cite journal |author=Bents R, Marsh E |title=Patterns of ephedra and other stimulant use in collegiate hockey athletes |journal=Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=636–43 |year=2006 |pmid=17342884[/tpl] despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bohn A, Khodaee M, Schwenk T |title=Ephedrine and other stimulants as ergogenic aids |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=220–5 |year=2003 |pmid=12834578 |doi=10.1007/s11932-003-0009-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429[/tpl] Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barker W, Antia U |title=A study of the use of Ephedra in the manufacture of methamphetamine |journal=Forensic Sci Int |volume=166 |issue=2–3 |pages=102–9 |year=2007 |pmid=16707238 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2006.04.005[/tpl]
Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was unclear whether such weight loss is maintained.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boozer C, Daly P, Homel P, Solomon J, Blanchard D, Nasser J, Strauss R, Meredith T |title=Herbal ephedra/caffeine for weight loss: a 6-month randomized safety and efficacy trial |journal=Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |year=2002 |pmid=12032741 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0802023[/tpl] However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.[tpl]cite journal |author=Woolf A, Watson W, Smolinske S, Litovitz T |title=The severity of toxic reactions to ephedra: comparisons to other botanical products and national trends from 1993-2002 |journal=Clin Toxicol (Phila) |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=347–55 |year=2005 |pmid=16235509 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200066075[/tpl]
Adverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia.

==Purity and dosage==

There are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch."Swallowing Ephedra", by Sharon Brownlee. Published online at Salon.com on June 7, 2000. Accessed 8 February 2007.Dietary Supplements: Background Information. From the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Accessed 7 February 2007.Herbal Rx: the promise and pitfalls. Consumer Reports, 1999, pp 44–48. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.[tpl]cite journal |author=Haller C, Duan M, Benowitz N, Jacob P |title=Concentrations of ephedra alkaloids and caffeine in commercial dietary supplements |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=145–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15107143 |doi=10.1093/jat/28.3.145[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Gurley B, Gardner S, Hubbard M |title=Content versus label claims in ephedra-containing dietary supplements |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=963–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10832496[/tpl]

==Safety and regulatory actions in the United States==

Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of ephedra-containing supplements in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.

===Initial concerns and supplement industry response===

In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death."Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Proposed Rule", from the Federal Register, June 4, 1997. Accessed 7 February 2007.
In response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe."Dangerous supplements: Still at large", from Consumer Reports magazine. Published May 2004, accessed 7 February 2007. The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.
Metabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA.Criminal investigation sought for diet supplement seller, published in USA Today on August 15, 2002. Accessed April 10, 2007. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA.Metabolife Founder Sentenced For Lying To FDA Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers."Senator, His Son Get Boosts From Makers of Ephedra", published in the Los Angeles Times on March 5, 2003. Purchase required to view full text. Accessed 7 February 2007.
In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wolfe S |title=Medicine. Ephedra--scientific evidence versus money/politics |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5618 |pages=437 |year=2003 |pmid=12702860 |doi=10.1126/science.1081910[/tpl] Business Week reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been "beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.""Diet Pills and Pols: A Dangerous Mix", by Arlene Weintraub and John Carey. Published in Business Week on September 2, 2002. Accessed March 31, 2007.
Ultimately, in 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions."Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Withdrawal in Part", from the Federal Register, April 3, 2000. Accessed 7 February 2007.

===Additional evidence and deaths===

A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA."The Secret of Ephedra's Questionable Success". A report on "All Things Considered", National Public Radio, November 22, 2002. Accessed 7 February 2007. Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer from heatstroke in 2001.Vikings: Stringer's use of ephedra contributed to death, published online by Sports Illustrated on February 25, 2003. Accessed March 15, 2007.
Steve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a "significant role" in Bechler's sudden death."Medical examiner: Ephedra a factor in Bechler death", from USA Today, published March 13, 2003. Accessed 7 February 2007. Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, "All of a sudden Bechler's death Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act."
Senator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that "...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist," and called FDA action to regulate ephedra "long overdue."

===Ephedra banned===

In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedra in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shekelle P, Hardy M, Morton S, Maglione M, Mojica W, Suttorp M, Rhodes S, Jungvig L, Gagné J |title=Efficacy and safety of ephedra and ephedrine for weight loss and athletic performance: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=12 |pages=1537–45 |year=2003 |pmid=12672771 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.12.1537 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=196247[/tpl] Almost simultaneously, a study in Annals of Internal Medicine found that ephedra was 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or Ginkgo biloba.
On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using ephedra, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedra-containing supplements."FDA Announces Plans to Prohibit Sales of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra": Press release from the FDA website, issued December 30, 2003, accessed 7 February 2007. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, stated that "...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately."
Because of its potential use in clandestine methamphetamine production and its widespread availability compared to pseudoephedrine pills, it is hypothesized that the crackdown on this illicit activity also played a role in the US ban on ephedra. http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/ephedra.html

===Legal challenges===

Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States."Judge's Decision Lifts Ban On Sale of Ephedra in Utah", from the New York Times, published April 15, 2005. Accessed 7 February 2007.
The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States.

==Use in sports==

Ephedrine is listed as a banned substance by both the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency.[tpl]PDFlink|World Anti-Doping Agency Prohibited List, 2006.|1.50 MiB[/tpl] Accessed March 15, 2007. The National Football League banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Korey Stringer; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death.Sauerbrun fails test: Broncos punter faces suspension for use of ephedra, by Bill Williamson. Published in the Denver Post on July 6, 2006. Accessed March 15, 2007. The substance is also banned by the National Basketball Association. Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra believing it enhanced their athletic performance.

===Prominent cases of ephedrine use===

In the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Argentine footballer Diego Armando Maradona tested positive for ephedrine."Maradona's fall from grace", by John May. From the BBC, published April 19, 2004. Accessed March 15, 2007. The Japanese motorcycle racer Noriyuki Haga tested positive for ephedrine in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result."Haga Saga", by Dirck Edge. From motorcycledaily.com, May 24, 2000. Accessed March 15, 2007. NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.
