[[Postcardware]]

CATEGORIES: Postcards, Software licenses

Postcardware, also called just cardware, is a style of software distribution similar to shareware, distributed by the author on the condition that users send the author a postcard.
This is similar to beerware. A variation, Emailware, uses the same approach but requires the user to send the author an email.
Postcardware, like other "novelty" software distribution terms, is often not strictly enforced.
