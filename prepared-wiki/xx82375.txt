[[Ergoline]]

CATEGORIES: Alkaloids, Ergolines, Alkaloids found in fungi

Ergoline is a chemical compound whose structural skeleton is contained in a diverse range of alkaloids. Ergoline derivatives are used clinically for the purpose of vasoconstriction (5-HT1 receptor agonists—ergotamine) and in the treatment of migraines (used with caffeine) and Parkinson's disease. Some ergoline alkaloids found in ergot fungi are implicated in the condition ergotism, which causes convulsive and gangrenous symptoms. Others include psychedelic drugs (e.g., LSD and some alkaloids in Ipomoea tricolor and related species [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]).

==Uses==

In addition to the naturally occurring ergonovine (used as an oxytocic) and ergotamine (a vasoconstrictor used to control migraine), synthetic derivatives of importance are the oxytocic methergine, the anti-migraine drugs dihydroergotamine and methysergide, hydergine (a mixture of dihydroergotoxine mesylates, INN: ergoline mesylates), and bromocriptine, used for numerous purposes including treatment of Parkinson's disease. Newer synthetic ergolines used for Parkinson's disease include pergolide and lisuride.
Perhaps the most famous ergoline derivative is the psychedelic drug LSD. Ergometrine and ergotamine are included as schedule I precursors in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf.

==Natural occurrence==

Ergoline alkaloids are found in lower fungi and two species of flowering plants: the Mexican species Rivea corymbosa and Ipomoea violacea of the Convolvulaceae (morning glory) family, the seeds of which were identified as the psychedelic plant drugs known as "ololiuhqui" and "tlitliltzin"[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2007[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]. The principal alkaloids in the seeds are ergine and its optical isomer isoergine, with several other lysergic acid derivatives and clavines present in lesser amounts. The Hawaiian species Argyreia nervosa includes similar alkaloids. It is possible, though not proven, that ergine or isoergine are responsible for the psychedelic effects. There may be a fungal origin of the ergoline alkaloids also in the Convolvulaceae. Like the ergot alkaloids in some monocot plants, the ergoline alkaloids found in the plant Ipomoea asarifolia (Convolvulaceae) are produced by a seed-transmitted epiphytic clavicipitaceous fungus.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = U | last2 = Ahimsa-Müller | first2 = MA | last3 = Markert | first3 = A | last4 = Kucht | first4 = S | last5 = Gross | first5 = J | last6 = Kauf | first6 = N | last7 = Kuzma | first7 = M | last8 = Zych | first8 = M | last9 = Lamshöft | first9 = M | title = Molecular characterization of a seed transmitted clavicipitaceous fungus occurring on dicotyledoneous plants (Convolvulaceae) | journal = Planta | volume = 224 | issue = 3 | pages = 533–44 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16525783 | doi = 10.1007/s00425-006-0241-0 [/tpl]

==History==

Ergoline alkaloids were first isolated from ergot, a fungus that infects grain and causes the disease ergotism. Ergot also has a long history of medicinal use, which led to attempts to characterize its activity chemically. This began in 1907 with the isolation by G. Barger and F. H. Carrin of ergotoxine, so-named since it appeared to exhibit more of the toxicity of ergot than its therapeutic qualities. With the isolation of ergotamine in 1918 by Arthur Stoll came the first therapeutic use of isolated ergoline alkaloids.
With the determination of the basic chemical structure of the ergot alkaloids in the early 1930s, an era of intensive exploration of synthetic derivatives began.

==Ergoline derivatives==

There are 3 main classes of ergoline derivatives, the water-soluble amides of lysergic acid, the water-insoluble ergopeptines (i.e., ergopeptides), and the clavine group.[tpl]cite journal|author=Schardl CL, Panaccione DG, Tudzynski P|year=2006|title=Ergot alkaloids – biology and molecular biology|journal=The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology|volume=63|pages=45–86|pmid=17133714|doi=10.1016/S1099-4831(06)63002-2|series=The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology|isbn=978-0-12-469563-4[/tpl]

===Lysergic acid amides===

The relationship between these compounds is summarized in the following structural formula and table of substitutions.
 

===Peptide alkaloids===

Peptide ergot alkaloids or ergopeptines (also known as ergopeptides) are ergoline derivatives that contain a tripeptide structure attached to the basic ergoline ring in the same location as the amide group of the lysergic acid derivatives. This structure comprises proline and two other α-amino acids, linked in an unusual cyclol formation >N-C(OH) 

===Clavines===

A variety of modifications to the basic ergoline are seen in nature, for example  agroclavine, elymoclavine, lysergol. Those deriving from dimethylergoline are referred to as clavines. Examples of clavines, include festuclavine, fumigaclavine A, fumigaclavine C.

===Others===

Some synthetic ergoline derivatives do not fall easily into any of the above groups.  Some examples are:
