[[Angular displacement]]

CATEGORIES: Angle

Angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians (degrees, revolutions) through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis.
When an object rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, since in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time (t).  When dealing with the rotation of an object, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid.  A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off.  In a realistic sense, all things can be deformable, however this impact is minimal and negligible.  Thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as rotational motion.   
In the example illustrated to the right, a particle on object P at a fixed distance r from the origin, O, rotating counterclockwise. It becomes important to then represent the position of particle P in terms of its polar coordinates (r, θ).  In this particular example, the value of θ is changing, while the value of the radius remains the same.  (In rectangular coordinates (x, y) both x and y vary with time). As the particle moves along the circle, it travels an arc length s, which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:

==Measurements of angular displacement==

Angular displacement may be measured in radians or degrees. If using radians, it provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle and the distance r from the centre. 
For example if an object rotates 360 degrees around a circle of radius r, the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2πr

==Three dimensions==

In three dimensions, angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude.  The direction specifies the axis of rotation, which always exists by virtue of the Euler's rotation theorem; the magnitude specifies the rotation in radians about that axis (using the right-hand rule to determine direction).
Despite having direction and magnitude, angular displacement is not a vector because it does not obey the commutative law for addition.[tpl]cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2=Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1973|pages=288–89[/tpl]
