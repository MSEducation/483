Greek passports are issued exclusively to Greek citizens for the purpose of international travel. Greek citizens can use their ID card instead for travel within the European Union and a number of other European countries. Biometric passports have been issued since 26 August 2006, with old-style passports being declared invalid as of 1 January 2007. Since June 2009, the passport's RFID chip includes two index fingerprints as well as a high resolution JPEG image of the passport holder.

==Passport appearance==

The Greek passport follows the standard European Union passport design, with a burgundy red cover and the national emblem emblazoned on the centre of the front cover. The word ΔΙΑΒΑΤΗΡΙΟ ([tpl]IPA-el|ðʝavaˈtirio|IPA[/tpl], Greek for "passport") is inscribed below the coat of arms, while ΕΥΡΩΠΑΪΚΗ ΕΝΩΣΗ ([tpl]IPA-el|evropaiˈci ˈenosi|IPA[/tpl], "European Union") and ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ ([tpl]IPA-el|eliniˈci ðimokraˈtia|IPA[/tpl], "Hellenic Republic") appear above.A Greek diplomatic passport has the same size and design as the standard one, but it features a black cover and the text ΔΙΠΛΩΜΑΤΙΚΟ ΔΙΑΒΑΤΗΡΙΟ ([tpl]IPA-el|ðiplomatiˈko ðʝavaˈtirio|IPA[/tpl], "diplomatic passport") inscribed below the coat of arms. Greek passports contain 32 pages and are valid for 5 years.

==Issuing process==

Greek passports are issued by the National Passport Centre ("Διεύθυνση Διαβατηρίων/Αρχηγείο Ελληνικής Αστυνομίας"). Applicants have to apply in person - in case of a child under 14, accompanied by a parent - at the local police department or at a Greek Consulate Authority. Upon submitting all the requirements (special portrait photo, issuing request and fee), the police department begins the issuing procedure. All passports are manufactured centrally at the N.P.C main building in Athens. Depending on the circumstances, passports are issued in 3 to 9 business days and must be picked up at the police department in which the issuing request was made. For this, an applicant must carry with her/him a special receipt they received after applying. Standard passports are valid for a period of 5 years for adults and teenagers above 14 years and 3 years for children under 14 (after the official edition of the 135th Presidential decree in 2007). 
Greek passports cannot be extended. A holder has to make a request for a new one, if his/her passport expires within the next six months of the request and he/she plans to use it after the expiry date.
The issuing of a standard adult passport costs €84.40, while that of a child costs €73.60. Reissuance of an existing and still valid passport with no blank pages is possible, with a validity date equal to the previous passport and a cost of €53.
