==History==

The Japan Times was launched by Motosada Zumoto on March 22, 1897 with the goal of giving Japanese an opportunity to read and discuss news and current events in English in order to help Japan to participate more fully in the international community.Kamiya, Setsuko, "Japan Times not just wartime mouthpiece", The Japan Times, 13 August 2011, p. 3. It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918-1940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940-1943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943-1956) before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956.
At first, the paper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the Japanese government was mounting pressure on the paper's editors to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs managed to appoint Hitoshi Ashida, former Ministry official, as chief editor.Peter O'Connor, The Japan Times at War Time: Mouth piece or Moderator? During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government propaganda and editorial opinion.  The paper's circulation at that time was about 825,000.Kamiya, Setsuko, "Japan Times not just wartime mouthpiece", The Japan Times, 13 August 2011, p. 3.
