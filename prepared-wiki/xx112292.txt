==History==

The early history of Lincoln High School is unusually complicated because it was founded in 1878 as Avenue 21 Grammar School. By 1913, the Avenue 21 school had become an intermediate school and its student population had grown to the point that a new campus was needed.  That year the intermediate school moved to the present Lincoln High School site, and the curriculum expanded to include the senior high school grades.  This marks the true beginning of Lincoln High. Pending the construction of a new school (the current site) on the former mansion property of Charles Woolwine, the Avenue 21 intermediate school moved its location to the hillside site (now the current physical education and track field), where students studied under the trees.http://www.stampstudio.com/earlyL.htmlhttp://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/cards/007/0614084-073.jpg  Through the early 1970s, students from all six upper grades attended the school together.http://lhsaatigers.org/School_News.html
In 1878, the plant was extended across Lincoln Park (Los Angeles) Avenue, which is now the current site. In 1881, the school added a gymnasium and a science building in 1924. The present school was built extensively in the 1940s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt under his Works Progress Administration reform. Much of the construction and renovations occurred after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, which damaged the gymnasium, the auditorium, the music building, the library, and the English building.http://www.laschools.org/employee/design/fs-studies-and-reports/download/LAUSD_Presentation_March_2002.pdf?version_id=1895945  Jim Tunney Stadium, home to Lincoln's football and track teams, was built during the reconstruction of Lincoln High School.
