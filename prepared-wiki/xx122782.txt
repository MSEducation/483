[[Kelvin equation]]

CATEGORIES: Surface chemistry, Physical chemistry

The Kelvin equation may be written in the form
Equilibrium vapor pressure depends on droplet size.
The further a vapour is supercooled, the smaller the critical radius becomes. Ultimately it gets as small as a few molecules and the liquid undergoes homogeneous nucleation and growth.
The change in vapor pressure can be attributed to changes in the Laplace pressure. When the Laplace pressure rises in a droplet, the droplet tends to evaporate more easily. 
When applying the Kelvin equation, two cases must be distinguished: A drop of liquid in its own vapor will result in a positively curved liquid surface or a bubble of vapor in a liquid, will result in a negatively curved liquid surface. 
The form of the Kelvin equation here is not the form in which it appeared in Lord Kelvin's article of 1871.  The derivation of the form that appears in this article from Kelvin's original equation was presented by Robert von Helmholtz (son of German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz) in his dissertation of 1885.Robert von Helmholtz (1886) "Untersuchungen über Dämpfe und Nebel, besonders über solche von Lösungen" (Investigations of vapors and mists, especially of such things from solutions), Annalen der Physik, 263 (4) :  508-543.  On pages 523-525, Robert von Helmholtz converts Kelvin's equation to the form that appears here (which is actually the Ostwald-Freundlich equation).
