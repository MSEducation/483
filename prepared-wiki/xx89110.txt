[[M-239 (Michigan highway)]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Michigan, Transportation in Berrien County, Michigan

M-239 is a north–south state trunkline highway in Berrien County in the extreme southwestern corner of the US state of Michigan connecting State Road 39 (SR 39) in Indiana to Interstate 94 (I-94). The highway was designated in 1963, and it provided the only connection from the southern end of I-94 into Indiana until 1972.

==Route description==

As SR 39 crosses into Michigan it becomes M-239.  As soon as it crosses the border, the road curves around to the northwest where it continues through a generally rural area. The trunkline intersects Wilson Road and passes next to a commercial development. After a little over a mile (1.8 km), the road comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-94 at exit 1. While M-239 officially ends at the interchange, the roadway, known as LaPorte Road, continues on to the northwest where it heads into New Buffalo.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1 in:15 mi / 1 cm:9 km |section= N7 [/tpl][tpl]google maps |url= https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=M-239+N%2FLa+Porte+Rd&daddr=M-239+N%2FLa+Porte+Rd&hl=en&ll=41.767343,-86.726589&spn=0.030856,0.02914&sll=41.776881,-86.733027&sspn=0.061704,0.058279&geocode=FWA0fQIdBLnU-g%3BFQFvfQIdApfU-g&t=h&mra=ls&z=15 |title= Overview Map of M-239 |accessdate= July 2, 2012[/tpl] Like other state highways in Michigan, M-239 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).

==History==

M-239 always ended at I-94, even though La Porte Road continues into New Buffalo. Before completion of the Indiana portion of I-94, the freeway ended at the present exit 1. A [tpl]convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] stretch of La Porte Road was designated as M-239 in 1963 to carry traffic to Indiana State Road 39, which connects to the Indiana Toll Road.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Map |year= 1963 |section= N7 [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department |title= Official Highway Map |year= 1964 |section= N7 [/tpl] Until 1972, when Indiana constructed their section of I-94, M-239 and SR 39 were the only connection from the southern end of I-94 in Michigan across the state line.[tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of State Highways |title= Official Highway Map |year= 1972 |scale= 1 in:14.5 mi |section= N7 [/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of State Highways |title= Official Highway Map |year= 1973 |scale= 1 in:14.5 mi |section= N7 [/tpl]
