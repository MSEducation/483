[[Stimulant]]

CATEGORIES: Stimulants, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Psychopharmacology

Stimulants (also referred to as psychostimulants) are psychoactive drugs that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. Examples of these kinds of effects may include enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion, among others. Due to their rendering a characteristic "up" feeling, stimulants are also occasionally referred to as "uppers". Depressants or "downers", which decrease mental and/or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be their functional opposites. Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and without prescription both as legal substances and illicit substances of recreational use or abuse.

==Effects==

Stimulants produce a variety of different kinds of effects by enhancing the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Common effects, which vary depending on the substance and dosage in question, may include enhanced alertness, awareness, wakefulness, endurance, productivity, and motivation, increased arousal, locomotion, heart rate, and blood pressure, and the perception of a diminished requirement for food and sleep. Many stimulants are also capable of improving mood and relieving anxiety, and some can even induce feelings of euphoria. However different effects are often dose related, such as amphetamine causing anxiety, dysthymia, hyperactivity and potentially heart failure at high doses, but relieving anxiety, producing euthymia or euphoria, reducing hyperactivity and being generally free of serious side effects at moderate doses used in clinical medicine. Stimulants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include facilitation of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and/or dopamine activity (e.g., via monoamine transporter inhibition or reversal),[tpl]cite journal|author=Riddle EL, Fleckenstein AE, Hanson GR |title=Role of monoamine transporters in mediating psychostimulant effects |journal=The AAPS journal |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=E847–51 |year=2005 |pmid=16594636 |doi=10.1208/aapsj070481 |pmc=2750953[/tpl] adenosine receptor antagonism, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism.

==Medical uses==

Stimulants are used both individually and clinically for therapeutic purposes in the treatment of a number of indications, including the following:

===ADHD drugs===

Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed medications for ADHD. The most common stimulant medications are substituted phenethylamines: amphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall),[tpl]Cite journal|author=Sulzer D, Sonders MS, Poulsen NW, Galli A |title=Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: a review |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=406–33 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15955613 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.04.003[/tpl] dextromethamphetamine (Desoxyn)[tpl]Cite journal|title=NTP-CERHR monograph on the potential human reproductive and developmental effects of amphetamines |journal=Ntp Cerhr Mon |volume= |issue=16 |pages=vii–III1 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16130031 |last1=National Toxicology |first1=Program[/tpl] and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse).[tpl]Cite journal|author=Howland RH |title=Lisdexamfetamine: a prodrug stimulant for ADHD |journal=Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=19–22 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18777964 |doi=10.3928/02793695-20080801-05[/tpl] Controlled-release pharmaceuticals may allow once or twice daily administration of medication in the morning. This is especially helpful for children preferring not to take their medication in the middle of the school day. Several controlled-release methods are used.

===Ampakines===

Ampakines are a class of compounds observed to enhance attention span and alertness, and facilitate learning and memory in clinical trials. They take their name from the glutamatergic AMPA receptor with which they strongly interact.
These stimulants tend to increase alertness without the peripheral (body) effects or addiction/tolerance/abuse potential of "traditional" stimulants (such as amphetamine),[tpl]medical citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] as they lack direct dopaminergic action. Their effect on sleep structure is not fully established and may reduce quality of sleep. The ampakine CX717, when administered at doses necessary to reduce the effects of sleep deprivation, reduced subsequent stage 4 and slow-wave recovery sleep.[tpl]cite journal|title=Acute sleep deprivation: the effects of the AMPAKINE compound CX717 on human cognitive performance, alertness and recovery sleep |last=Boyle |first=J. |last2=Stanley |first2=N. |last3=James |first3=L.M. |last4=Wright |first4=N. |last5=Johnsen |first5=S. |last6=Arbon |first6=E.L. |last7=Dijk |first7=D.J. |date=August 2012 |pmid=21940760|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1047–57|doi=10.1177/0269881111405353|journal=Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)[/tpl] Ampakines such as ampalex and CX717 have been developed but are awaiting further research before being commercially released. They have been investigated by DARPA for potential use in increasing military effectiveness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2195466/ |title=Night of the Living Meds – The U.S. military's sleep-reduction program |author=Saletan, W. |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]

===Eugeroics===

A wakefulness-promoting agent (eugeroic) is a type of psychoactive drug that improves wakefulness and alertness, and reduces tiredness, drowsiness, and the need for sleep. They are used mainly in the treatment of sleeping disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness, and narcolepsy, though they are also used merely to counteract fatigue and lethargy and to enhance motivation and productivity. Wakefulness-promoting agents appear to function primarily by increasing catecholaminergic (adrenergic, dopaminergic) and histaminergic activity in the brain. Unlike many other stimulants, eugeroics are relatively non-addictive and non-dependence-forming.[tpl]medical citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The prototype drug in this class is modafinil, and other drugs include adrafinil and armodafinil. The primary difference between these drugs and amphetamine-like stimulants is that wakefulness-promoting agents trigger activation of neurons in the hypothalamus-based wakefulness circuits, as opposed to producing diffuse neuronal activation.[tpl]cite journal|title=A systematic review of modafinil: potential clinical uses and mechanisms of action |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=554–66 |last=Ballon |first=D.D. |last2=Feifel |first2=D. |doi=10.4088/JCP.v67n0406 |pmid=16669720[/tpl]
The functional opposites of wakefulness-promoting agents would be hypnotics/sedatives like antihistamines, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

==Chemistry==

Classifying stimulants is difficult, because of the large number of classes the drugs occupy, and the fact that they may belong to multiple classes; for example, ecstasy is a substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine as well as a substituted amphetamine (and consequently, a substituted phenethylamine as well).
When referring to stimulants, the parent drug (e.g., amphetamine) will always be expressed in the singular; while the word "substituted" before the parent drug (substituted amphetamines).
Major stimulant classes include phenethylamines and their daughter class substituted amphetamines.

===Amphetamines (class)===

Substituted amphetamines are a group of phenylethylamine stimulants such as amphetamine and methamphetamine. With the exception of cathinones, many drugs in this class work primarily by activating trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1); in turn, this causes reuptake inhibition and effluxion, or release, of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. An additional mechanism of some substituted amphetamines is the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol, or intracellular fluid of the presynaptic neuron.[tpl]cite journal | author = Eiden LE, Weihe E | title = VMAT2: a dynamic regulator of brain monoaminergic neuronal function interacting with drugs of abuse | journal = Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 1216 | issue = | pages = 86–98 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21272013 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05906.x [/tpl]
Amphetamines-type stimulants are often used for their therapeutic effects; physicians occasionally prescribe amphetamine to treat major depression, where subjects do not respond well to traditional SSRI medications. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of drugs such as Adderall (a mixture of salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) in controlling symptoms associated with ADD/ADHD. Due to their availability and fast-acting effects, substituted amphetamines are prime candidates for abuse.Efforts of the National Institute on Drug Abuse to Prevent and Treat Prescription Drug Abuse, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources Committee on Government Reform, United States House of Representatives, 26 July 2006

===Dopamine precursors===

Dopamine is one of the principal neurotransmitters involved with stimulant activity in the brain, (others being norepinephrine and serotonin). Increase in its precursors may result in increased dopamine biosynthesis, especially in malnourished individuals. However levels of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase ultimately limit the biosynthesis regardless of increased tyrosine.
L-Tyrosine is the precursor that is 'closest' to being dopamine among those supplements legally available without prescription in most jurisdictions. It is converted by tyrosine hydroxylase into L-Dopa. Some of this L-Dopa is converted into dopamine and norepinephrine. Because tyrosine competes with other amino acids for entry into the brain supplement makers recommend tyrosine be taken on an empty stomach. However tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate limiting factor and even large dosages recommended by most supplement companies may not produce any noticeable effect. L-Phenylalanine is 'one step back' from L-Tyrosine—it must be converted into tyrosine before the tyrosine can be converted into L-Dopa, which in turn becomes dopamine. Dopamine is also the direct precursor of norepinephrine.

The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was Benzedrine, a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions. Because the dextro isomer has greater stimulant properties, Benzedrine was gradually discontinued in favor of formulations containing all or mostly dextroamphetamine. Presently, it is typically prescribed as Adderall, dextroamphetamine (e.g., Dexedrine), or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine (e.g., Vyvanse).[tpl]cite web|title=Adderall IR Prescribing Information |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/011522s040lbl.pdf |work=United States Food and Drug Administration |date=March 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2013 |page=5[/tpl] Amphetamine, through activation of a trace amine receptor, increases biogenic amine and excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine.[tpl]cite journal|author=Miller GM |title=The emerging role of trace amine-associated receptor 1 in the functional regulation of monoamine transporters and dopaminergic activity |journal=J.

Amphetamine is the parent compound of its own structural class, the (substituted) amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. It is chemically related to methamphetamine; however, unlike methamphetamine, its salts lack sufficient volatility to be smoked.[tpl]cite web|title=Amphetamine |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine |work=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl] During long-term treatment in humans, amphetamine has been shown to normalize, or improve, brain function, in particular in the right caudate nucleus; in contrast, methamphetamine induces permanent reductions in brain structure and function.

Synthetic and metabolic pathways for endogenous and exogenously administered trace amines and sympathomimetic amines...  Trace amines are metabolized in the mammalian body via monoamine oxidase (MAO; EC 1.4.3.4) (Berry, 2004) (Fig. 2)...It deaminates primary and secondary amines that are free in the neuronal cytoplasm but not those bound in storage vesicles of the sympathetic neurone... Thus, MAO inhibitors potentiate the peripheral effects of indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines. It is not often realized, however, that this potentiation occurs irrespective of whether the amine is a substrate for MAO. An α-methyl group on the side chain, as in amphetamine and ephedrine, renders the amine immune to deamination so that they are not metabolized in the gut. Similarly, β-PEA would not be deaminated in the gut as it is a selective substrate for MAO-B which is not found in the gut...  Brain levels of endogenous trace amines are several hundred-fold below those for the classical neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin but their rates of synthesis are equivalent to those of noradrenaline and dopamine and they have a very rapid turnover rate (Berry, 2004). Endogenous extracellular tissue levels of trace amines measured in the brain are in the low nanomolar range. These low concentrations arise because of their very short half-life,...[/tpl]

===Caffeine===

Caffeine is a stimulant compound belonging to the xanthine class of chemicals naturally found in coffee, tea, and (to a lesser degree) cocoa or chocolate. It is included in many soft drinks, as well as a larger amount in energy drinks. Caffeine is the world's most widely used psychoactive drug and by far the most common stimulant. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.[tpl]cite journal|author=Lovett R |title=Coffee: The demon drink? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2518 |date=24 September 2005 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 |accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl] A few jurisdictions restrict its sale and use. Caffeine is also included in some medications, usually for the purpose of enhancing the effect of the primary ingredient, or reducing one of its side-effects (especially drowsiness). Tablets containing standardized doses of caffeine are also widely available.

===Ephedrine===

Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs phenylpropanolamine and methamphetamine, as well as to the important neurotransmitter epinephrine (adrenaline). Ephedrine is commonly used as a stimulant, appetite suppressant, concentration aid, and decongestant, and to treat hypotension associated with anaesthesia.
In chemical terms, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic receptors.Merck Manuals EPHEDrine Last full review/revision January 2010 It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.
The herb má huáng (Ephedra sinica), used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as its principal active constituents. The same may be true of other herbal products containing extracts from other Ephedra species.

===MDMA===

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), known by its common street name "Ecstasy", typically comes in either tablet, capsule, or powder/crystal form. It had a medical application as a treatment for depression and a psychotherapy aid until 1985, when the DEA listed MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting most medical studies and applications. MDMA is also unique and very popular for its entactogenic properties. The stimulant effects of MDMA include hypertension, anorexia (appetite loss), euphoria, social disinhibition, insomnia (enhanced wakefulness/inability to sleep), improved energy, increased arousal, and increased perspiration, among others.
MDMA differs from most stimulants in that its primary pharmacological effect is on the neurotransmitter serotonin rather than dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Because of this, it is considered to be primarily an entactogen or an empathogen.

===MDPV===

Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a psychoactive drug with stimulant properties that acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).[tpl]cite journal|last1=Simmler |first1=L.

It comes in the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort, or inject, producing similar effects to MDMA, amphetamines, and cocaine.
Mephedrone was first synthesized in 1929, but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003. By 2007, mephedrone was reported to be available for sale on the Internet; by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound; and, by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries, and, in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the USA temporarily classified mephedrone as illegal, in effect from October 2011.

Methamphetamine (contracted from [tpl]nowrap|N-methyl-alpha-methylphenethylamine[/tpl]) is a neurotoxin and potent psychostimulant of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes that is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obesity.[tpl]cite book|author=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |editor=Sydor A, Brown RY |title=Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience |year=2009 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |isbn=9780071481274 |page=370 |edition=2nd |chapter=15 |quote=Unlike cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine is directly toxic to midbrain dopamine neurons.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Desoxyn Prescribing Information |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/005378s028lbl.pdf |date=December 2013 |work=United States Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Krasnova IN, Cadet JL |title=Methamphetamine toxicity and messengers of death |journal=Brain Res.

These abnormalities include persistent decreases in the levels of dopamine transporters (DAT) in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the caudate-putamen (McCann et al., 1998, 2008; Sekine et al., 2003; Volkow et al., 2001a, 2001c). The density of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) is also decreased in the midbrain, caudate, putamen, hypothalamus, thalamus, the orbitofrontal, temporal, and cingulate cortices of METH-dependent individuals (Sekine et al., 2006) ... Neuropsychological studies have detected deficits in attention, working memory, and decision-making in chronic METH addicts ...  There is compelling evidence that the negative neuropsychiatric consequences of METH abuse are due, at least in part, to drug-induced neuropathological changes in the brains of these METH-exposed individuals ...  Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in METH addicts have revealed substantial morphological changes in their brains. These include loss of gray matter in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices, significant shrinkage of hippocampi, and hypertrophy of white matter (Thompson et al., 2004). In addition, the brains of METH abusers show evidence of hyperintensities in white matter (Bae et al., 2006; Ernst et al., 2000), decreases in the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (Ernst et al., 2000; Sung et al., 2007), reductions in a marker of metabolic integrity, creatine (Sekine et al., 2002) and increases in a marker of glial activation, myoinositol (Chang et al., 2002; Ernst et al., 2000; Sung et al., 2007; Yen et al., 1994). Elevated choline levels, which are indicative of increased cellular membrane synthesis and turnover are also evident in the frontal gray matter of METH abusers (Ernst et al., 2000; Salo et al., 2007; Taylor et al., 2007).[/tpl] Methamphetamine exists as two enantiomers, dextrorotary and levorotary.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kuczenski R, Segal DS, Cho AK, Melega W |title=Hippocampus norepinephrine, caudate dopamine and serotonin, and behavioral responses to the stereoisomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine |journal=J.

Although rarely prescribed due to the potential risks, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under the trade name Desoxyn. Recreationally, methamphetamine is used to increase sexual desire, lift the mood, and increase energy, allowing some users to engage in sexual activity continuously for several days straight.
Methamphetamine may be sold illicitly, either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in an equal parts mixture of the right- and left-handed molecules (i.e., 50% levomethamphetamine and 50% dextromethamphetamine).[tpl]cite AV media |date=August 2013 |title=San Francisco Meth Zombies |medium=TV documentary |url= |accessdate=4 January 2014 |publisher=National Geographic Channel |asin=B00EHAOBAO [/tpl] Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are schedule II controlled substances in the United States.

In low doses, methamphetamine can cause an elevated mood and increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals. At higher doses, it can induce psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cerebral hemorrhage. Methamphetamine is known to have a high potential for abuse and addiction. Recreational use of methamphetamine may result in psychosis or lead to post-withdrawal syndrome, a withdrawal syndrome that can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period.[tpl]cite journal|author=Cruickshank CC, Dyer KR |title=A review of the clinical pharmacology of methamphetamine |journal=Addiction |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=1085–1099 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19426289 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02564.x[/tpl] Unlike amphetamine and cocaine, methamphetamine is neurotoxic to humans, damaging both dopamine and serotonin neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Entirely opposite to the long-term use of amphetamine, there is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hart H, Radua J, Nakao T, Mataix-Cols D, Rubia K |title=Meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of inhibition and attention in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: exploring task-specific, stimulant medication, and age effects |journal=JAMA Psychiatry |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=185–198 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23247506 |doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.277 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Spencer TJ, Brown A, Seidman LJ, Valera EM, Makris N, Lomedico A, Faraone SV, Biederman J |title=Effect of psychostimulants on brain structure and function in ADHD: a qualitative literature review of magnetic resonance imaging-based neuroimaging studies |journal=J.

===Nicotine===

Nicotine is the active chemical constituent in tobacco, which is available in many forms, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and electronic cigarettes. Nicotine is used widely throughout the world for its stimulating and relaxing effects.

===Phenylpropanolamine===

Phenylpropanolamine (PPA; Accutrim; β-hydroxyamphetamine), also known as the stereoisomers norephedrine and norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes that is used as a stimulant, decongestant, and anorectic agent.[tpl]cite journal|author=Flavahan NA |title=Phenylpropanolamine constricts mouse and human blood vessels by preferentially activating alpha2-adrenoceptors |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimentical Therapeutics |volume=313 |issue=1 |pages=432–9 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15608085 |doi=10.1124/jpet.104.076653 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15608085[/tpl] It is commonly used in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations. In veterinary medicine, it is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs under trade names Propalin and Proin.
In the United States, PPA is no longer sold without a prescription due to a proposed increased risk of stroke in younger women. In a few countries in Europe, however, it is still available either by prescription or sometimes over-the-counter. In Canada, it was withdrawn from the market on 31 May 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/2001-eng.php |title=Advisories, Warnings and Recalls – 2001 |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |publisher=Health Canada[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] In India, human use of PPA and its formulations were banned on 10 February 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdsco.nic.in/html/Drugsbanned.html |title=Drugs Banned in India |publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization |work=Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India |accessdate=7 January 2014[/tpl]

===Propylhexadrine===

Propylhexadrine (Hexahydromethamphetamine, Obesin) is a stimulant medication, sold over-the-counter in the United States as the cold medication Benzedrex.[tpl]cite web|title=Benzedrex Inhaler Nasal Decongestant Inhaler |url=http://brainchamber.com/yourls/dlJcTH |publisher=B.F. Ascher & Co., Inc. |accessdate=19 December 2013[/tpl] The drug has also been used as an appetite suppressant in Europe. Propylhexadrine is not an amphetamine, though it is structurally similar; it is instead a cycloalkylamine, and thus has stimulant effects that are less potent than similarly structured amphetamines, such as methamphetamine.
The abuse potential of propylhexadrine is fairly limited, due its limited routes of administration: in the United States, Benzedrex is only available as an inhalant, mixed with lavender oil and menthol. These ingredients cause unpleasant tastes, and abusers of the drug have reported unpleasant "menthol burps." Injection of the drug has been found to cause transient diplopia and brain stem dysfunction.[tpl]cite journal|title=Proposed Rules |journal=Federal Register |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=2226–2227[/tpl][tpl]cite court|litigants=Prince v.

===Pseudoephedrine===

Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It may be used as a nasal/sinus decongestant, as a stimulant,[tpl]cite journal|title=Pseudoephedrine is without ergogenic effects during prolonged exercise |author=Hunter Gillies, Wayne E. Derman, Timothy D. Noakes, Peter Smith, Alicia Evans, and Gary Gabriels |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |date=1 December 1996 |volume=81 |pages=2611–2617 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/81/6/2611.full |issue=6 |pmid=9018513[/tpl] or as a wakefulness-promoting agent.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hodges |first=K |coauthors=Hancock S, Currel K, Hamilton B, Jeukendrup AE |title=Pseudoephedrine enhances performance in 1500-m runners |journal=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health |date=Feb 2006 |pmid=16531903 |doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000183201.79330.9c |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=329–33[/tpl]
The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or another NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen).

==Stimulants found in nature==

===Catha edulis (Khat)===

Khat is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickens |first=Charles |chapter=The Orsons of East Africa |title=Household Words: A Weekly Journal, Volume 14 |publisher=Bradbury & Evans |year=1856 |origyear=Digitized 19 February 2010 |page=176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdUnAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA176 |accessdate=7 January 2014[/tpl] [tpl]open access[/tpl] [tpl]link note|note=Free eBook[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/10/08-011008/en/ |title=Khat chewing in Yemen: turning over a new leaf – Khat chewing is on the rise in Yemen, raising concerns about the health and social consequences |last=Al-Mugahed |first=Leen |accessdate=8 January 2014 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=October 2008[/tpl]
Khat contains a monoamine alkaloid called cathinone, a "keto-amphetamine", that is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol),[tpl]cite journal|author=Nutt D, King LA, Blakemore C |title=Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9566 |pages=1047–53 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17382831 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4[/tpl] although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. It is a controlled substance in some countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Germany, while its production, sale, and consumption are legal in other nations, including Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yemen.Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, Journal of psychoactive drugs, Volume 41, (Haight-Ashbury Publications: 2009), p.3.

===Cocaine===

Cocaine is an SNDRI. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca shrub, which grows in the mountain regions of South American countries such as Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. In Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia, the most common form of cocaine is a white crystalline powder. Cocaine is a stimulant but is not normally prescribed therapeutically for its stimulant properties, although it sees clinical use as a local anesthetic, in particular in ophthalmology. Most cocaine use is recreational and its abuse potential is high, and so its sale and possession are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions. Other tropane derivative drugs related to cocaine are also known such as troparil and lometopane but have not been widely sold or used recreationally.[tpl]cite journal|author=AJ Giannini, WC Price |title=Contemporary drugs of abuse |journal=American Family Physician |volume=33 |pages=207–213 |year=1986[/tpl]

==Abuse==

Abuse of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants is common. Addiction to some CNS stimulants can quickly lead to medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial deterioration. Drug tolerance, dependence, and sensitization as well as a withdrawal syndrome can occur.[tpl]cite journal|author=Dackis CA, Gold MS |title=Addictiveness of central stimulants |journal=Advances in Alcohol & Substance Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1–2 |pages=9–26 |year=1990 |pmid=1974121 |doi=10.1300/J251v09n01_02[/tpl]
Stimulants enhance the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Common effects may include increased alertness, awareness, wakefulness, endurance, productivity, and motivation, arousal, locomotion, heart rate, and blood pressure, and a diminished desire for food and sleep.
Use of stimulants may cause the body to reduce significantly its production of natural body chemicals that fulfill similar functions. Until the body reestablishes its normal state, once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and miserable. This is referred to as a "crash", and may provoke reuse of the stimulant.

==Testing==

The presence of stimulants in the body may be tested by a variety of procedures. Serum and urine are the common sources of testing material although saliva is sometimes used. Commonly used tests include chromatography, immunologic assay, and mass spectrometry.AJ Giannini. Drug Abuse. Los Angeles, Health Information Press, 1999, pp.203–208 Patients taking ADHD-prescribed, Adderall-type amphetamine compounds are commonly surprised upon being tested as "positive" for "meth", or methamphetamine (Desoxyn—its licit, FDA-licensed, medicinal form) in forensically unsophisticated urinalysis, as methamphetamine is the active ingredient of the drug Desoxyn, and is chemically similar to the active ingredients of other ADHD medications.
