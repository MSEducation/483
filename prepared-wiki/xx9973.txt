Reed College is a private and independent liberal arts college located in southeast Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus located in Portland's Eastmoreland neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the Tudor-Gothic style,[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.reed.edu/facilities_and_grounds/buildings/eliot.html |title=Eliot Hall |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |work=Facilities & Grounds |publisher=Reed College[/tpl] and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center. Reed is known for its mandatory freshman humanities program, for its required senior-year thesis, as the only private undergraduate college with a primarily student-run nuclear reactor supporting its science programs,[tpl]cite web | title = Reed Research Reactor | publisher = Reed College | url = http://reactor.reed.edu/ | accessdate = March 27, 2007[/tpl] and for the unusually high proportion of graduates who go on to earn PhDs and other postgraduate degrees.[tpl]cite web | title = Facts about Reed: Awards and Fellowships | work = Institutional Research | publisher = Reed College | url = http://web.reed.edu/ir/awards.html | accessdate = March 27, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher=Reed College Institutional Research | title=Reed College PhD Productivity | url=http://web.reed.edu/ir/phd.html[/tpl]For a list with actual percentages, see "Doctorates Awarded" at http://www.swarthmore.edu/x15575.xml.

==History==

The Reed Institute (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908, and Reed College held its first classes in 1911. Reed is named for Oregon pioneers Simeon Gannett Reed and Amanda Reed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.reed.edu/about_reed/history |title=Mission and History |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |work=About Reed |publisher=Reed College[/tpl] Simeon was an entrepreneur in trade on the Columbia River; in his will he suggested that his wife could "devote some portion of my estate to benevolent objects, or to the cultivation, illustration, or development of the fine arts in the city of Portland, or to some other suitable purpose, which shall be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city and to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants".[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/alumni/oral_hist_timeline.html |title=Retrieved on 19 December 2007 |publisher=Web.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] The first president of Reed (1910–1919) was William Trufant Foster, a former professor at Bates College and Bowdoin College in Maine.
Contrary to popular belief, the college did not grow out of student revolts and experimentation, but out of a desire to provide a "more flexible, individualized approach to a rigorous liberal arts education".[tpl]cite book |title=The Hidden Ivies |last=Greene |first=Howard |author2=Matthew Greene |year=2000 |publisher=HaperCollins Publishers Inc. |location=New York |isbn= 0-06-095362-4 |page=205[/tpl] Founded explicitly in reaction to the "prevailing model of East Coast, Ivy League education," the college's lack of varsity athletics, fraternities, and exclusive social clubs – as well as its coeducational, nonsectarian, and egalitarian status – gave way to an intensely academic and intellectual college whose purpose was to devote itself to "the life of the mind," that life being understood primarily as the academic life.[tpl]cite book |title=The Hidden Ivies |last=Greene |first=Howard |author2=Matthew Greene |year=2000 |publisher=HaperCollins Publishers Inc. |location=New York |isbn= 0-06-095362-4 |pages=206–207[/tpl]
The college has a reputation for progressivism.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |author=Princeton Review |title=Top 10 Most Politically Liberal Colleges | work=MSN Encarta | url=http://encarta.msn.com/college_article_LiberalColleges/Top_10_Politically_Liberal_Colleges.html | publisher=Microsoft |accessdate= December 18, 2007 |authorlink= Princeton Review[/tpl]

==Distinguishing features==

According to sociologist Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States,[tpl]cite book | first = Burton | last = Clark | title= The Distinctive College: Antioch, Reed, Swarthmore | year =1964 | isbn=1-56000-592-0 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | location = New Brunswick, N.J. [/tpl] featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110 – an intensive introduction to the Classics, covering ancient Greece and Rome as well as the Bible and ancient Jewish history. Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual – Reed's TRIGA research reactor makes it the only school in the United States to have a nuclear reactor operated entirely by undergraduates. Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation, and passing a junior qualifying exam at the end of the junior year is a prerequisite to beginning the thesis. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral exam that may encompass questions not only about the thesis, but also about any course previously taken.
Reed maintains a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio,[tpl]cite web | title = Reed College Student/Faculty Ratio | publisher = Reed College | url = http://www.reed.edu/ir/stufacratio.html | accessdate = September 21, 2010[/tpl] and its small classes emphasize a "conference" style, in which the teacher often acts as a mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer. While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.
Although letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed. According to the school, "students are encouraged to focus on learning, not on grades. Students are evaluated rigorously, and semester grades are filed with the registrar, but by tradition, students do not receive standard grade reports. Papers and exams are generally returned to
students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed. There is no dean’s list or honor roll per se, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an entire academic year receive academic commendations, which are noted on their transcripts, at the end of the spring semester.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/eval_student.html |title=Reed College | Guidebook to Reed | Evaluation of students |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Many Reedies graduate without knowing either their cumulative GPA or their grades in individual classes. Reed also claims to have experienced very little grade inflation over the years, noting, for example, that only ten students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2012.[tpl]cite web | title = Grades at Reed | publisher = Reed College | url = http://www.reed.edu/registrar/pdfs/grades.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 | format = PDF [/tpl] (Transcripts are accompanied by a card explaining Reed's relatively tough grading system, so as to not penalize students applying to graduate schools.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://ruk.ca/article/4794 |title=Retrieved on 13 September 2008 |publisher=Ruk.ca |date=May 28, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] And though Reed does not award Latin honors to graduates, Reed does confer several awards for academic achievement at the time of commencement, including naming students to Phi Beta Kappa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/acad_pol/awards.html |title=Reed College | Guidebook to Reed | Awards, fellowships and graduate awards |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]
Reed has no fraternities or sororities, and few NCAA sports teams,One NCAA sports team at Reed has been the Reed College Ski Team, which as early as 1937, and as late as 1988, competed with the University of Oregon and other regional schools. See "Oregon Ski Team to meet Huskies," Eugene Register-Guard, December 14, 1937 although physical education classes (which range from kayaking to juggling) are required for graduation. Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic clubs, most notably the Rugby,Reed rugby teams Ultimate Frisbee,Men's ultimate frisbeeWomen's ultimate frisbee and SoccerSoccer teams.
[tpl]Quote box|align=right|width=50%|quote=What this means is that a community governed by an honor principle is a community not of rules and procedures but of virtue. As such, it is a community of unfreedom. There is no protected realm; one can never take refuge in, seek protection from, or hide behind a doctrine of rights. Anything that anyone does is, in principle, subject to evaluation. Was it a virtuous thing to do? Was it consistent with notions of honorableness? Does it contribute to the well-being of the community? Is it the kind of behavior that we value and wish to encourage? In the absence of rights, behavior that we do not wish to value and do not wish to encourage has absolutely no protection.|source=Peter J. Steinberger, Former Dean of the Faculty[tpl]cite web | first = Peter J. | last = Steinberger |title = What is an Honor Principle? | date = March 17, 1998 | url = http://web.reed.edu/dean_of_faculty/speeches-articles/honor_principle-3-98.html | accessdate = March 21, 2007 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070710185242/http://web.reed.edu/dean_of_faculty/speeches-articles/honor_principle-3-98.html  |archivedate = July 10, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][/tpl]
Reed's ethical code is known as "The Honor Principle".[tpl]cite web | title = Living with the honor principle | publisher = Reed College | url = http://web.reed.edu/academic/gbook/coll_org/honor_prin.html [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  First introduced as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior, with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of the burden of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life. While inspired by traditional honor systems, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves, not just their enforcement. Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior. Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.
Discrete cases of grievance, known as "Honor Cases", are adjudicated by a Judicial Board, which consists of twelve full-time students. There is also an "Honor Council," which consists of students, faculty, and staff, designed to educate the community regarding the Honor Principle and mediate conflict between individuals.The Honor Council -- Reed webpage.

==Academic program==

Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program. Overall, Reed offers five Humanities courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students.

===Divisions===

===Humanities program===

Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole "an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and, ... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind".Scholz, Richard F., "Remarks to the Association of American Colleges", 1922.  The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in "world" literature, the other in "world" history) is one manifestation of this effort. One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995. The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus. These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/Hum110/syllabus/syllabus-preview-2010-13.html |title=Humanities 110, Syllabus for 2010–2013 |publisher=Academic.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Reed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course Introduction to Western Humanities covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take Early Modern Europe covering Renaissance thought and literature; Modern Humanities covering the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and Modernism, and/or Foundations of Chinese Civilization. There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.

===Interdisciplinary and dual-degree programs===

Reed also offers interdisciplinary programs in American studies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/amstudies.html |title=American Studies |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Environmental Studies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://academic.reed.edu/es/ |title=Environmental Studies Interdisciplinary Major |publisher=Academic.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/biochem.html |title=Biochem & Molec Bio interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Chemistry-Physics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/chemphys.html |title=Chem-Physics interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Classics-Religion,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/clasrel.html |title=Classics-Religion Interdisciplinary Major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Dance/Theatre,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/dancethea.html |title=Dance-Theatre Interdisciplinary Major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] History-Literature,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/histlit.html |title=History-Lit interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] International and Comparative Policy Studies (ICPS),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/icps.html |title=Internat-Compar Policy Studies |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Literature-Theatre,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/litthea.html |title=Lit-Theater interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Mathematics-Economics,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/mathecon.html |title=Math-Econ interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] and Mathematics-Physics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/catalog/programs/interdis_majors/mathphys.html |title=Math-Physics interdisc major |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

==Admissions and student demographics==

Until the late 1990s, Reed accepted a larger percentage of total applicants than peer institutions – 76% in 1996. This led to high levels of attrition (drop-outs) during that period.Romel Hernandez, "Many Apply. Few Are Chosen," Reed Magazine (Spring 2008): 26–33. Since then, the number of applicants for freshman admission has increased sharply.[tpl]cite web | title = Reed College receives record 3,051 applications | publisher = Reed College News Center | date = February 24, 2006 | url = http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2005-2006/022406_Record_2006_applications.html [/tpl] Since 2002, Reed's attrition rate has moved toward that of peer institutions, and the five-year graduation rate (76% for the 2004/05 entering class[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/ir/cds/index10.html |title=2010–11 CDS |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]) now exceeds the national average.
The applicant pool for the class of 2013 was the third largest in Reed's history: 3,159 students applied and 1,225 were admitted, for an admission rate of 38.8%. The admitted class of 2013's average combined Math and Verbal SAT scores were 1407; the mean composite ACT score was 31; and the mean high school GPA was 4.034.[tpl]cite press release | title = Reed admits a strong pool of applicants for Class of 2013| publisher = Reed College | date = April 7, 2009 |url =http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2008-2009/040709_Class_of_2013.html | accessdate = April 15, 2009 [/tpl]
Reed's student body is 45% male and 55% female, and includes 22% minority students: 3% self-report as Black (including African-American, African, and Afro-Caribbean); 6% as Hispanic; 9% as Asian, 2% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other.[tpl]cite web | title = Facts about Reed | publisher = Reed College Institutional Research | url = http://web.reed.edu/ir/enrollment_more.html | accessdate = March 21, 2007[/tpl]  Minority numbers include some of the 7% international citizens (13% of freshmen did not self-report their ethnicity). In the class of 2010, 38% of students are from the United States's West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington), with the most coming from California.

===Tuition and finances===

The total base cost for the 2012–13 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, is $55,920.[tpl]cite web | title = 2012–13 Tuition & Fees | publisher = Reed College | url = http://www.reed.edu/apply/tuition.html | accessdate = 2012-06-015[/tpl] "For the 2011–12 academic year, the average financial aid package – including grants, loans, and work opportunities – is approximately $35,990".Mean finaid 2011-12 In 2011–12 about half of students received financial aid from the college.Financial aid 2011–12. This cost does not include travel to and from college and home, books and supplies, and miscellaneous expenses.

Reed's endowment as of June 30, 2012, was $439.7 million."2013 NACUBO Endowment Study," National Association of College and University Business Officers, January 2013. Note, however, that in the economic downturn that began in late 2007, Reed's total endowment declined from $455 million in June 2007 to $311 million in June 2009.Matthew Kish, "Reed College endowment begins to recover," Portland Business Journal, May 27, 2011. By the end of 2013, the endowment surpassed the $500 million mark.Matthew Kish, "Reed College endowment bounces back, climbs above $500 million," Portland Business Journal, November 20, 2013.

===Rankings===

In 1995 Reed College refused to participate in the U.S. News and World Report "best colleges" rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings. According to Reed's Office of Admissions:
[tpl]quote|Reed College has actively questioned the methodology and usefulness of college rankings ever since the magazine's best-colleges list first appeared in 1983, despite the fact that the issue ranked Reed among the top ten national liberal arts colleges. Reed's concern intensified with disclosures in 1994 by the Wall Street Journal about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides. This led Reed's then-president Steven Koblik to inform the editors of U.S. News that he didn't find their project credible, and that the college would not be returning any of their surveys.[tpl]cite web | title = College Rankings | publisher = Reed College Admission Office | url = http://web.reed.edu/apply/news_and_articles/college_rankings.html [/tpl][/tpl]
Rolling Stone, in its October 16, 1997, issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by U.S. News after they stopped sending data to U.S. News and World Report.[tpl]cite web | first = Harriet  | last =Watson| title = U.S. News and World Report hat trick | publisher = Reed College |date=November 1997 | url= http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/nov1997/news/3.html[/tpl]  Nicholas Thompson reiterated this judgment in an article in The Washington Monthly in 2000.Nicholas Thompson, "Playing With Numbers How U.S. News Mismeasures Higher Education and What We Can Do About It", Washington Monthly (September 2000).  Reed has also made the same claim. In discussing Reed's decision, former President Colin Diver wrote in an article for the November 2005 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, "by far the most important consequence of sitting out the rankings game, however, is the freedom to pursue our own educational philosophy, not that of some news magazine."[tpl]cite web | first = Colin | last = Diver | title = Is There Life After Rankings? | publisher = The Atlantic Monthly |date=November 2005 | url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/shunning-college-rankings [/tpl] U.S News maintains that their rankings are "a very legitimate tool for getting at a certain level of knowledge about colleges."[tpl]citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1601839,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=March 21, 2001|last=Rawe|first=Julie|title=The College Rankings Revolt[/tpl]
However, in 2005 Reed did submit statistics to The Princeton Review, and received first in Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience. In 2009, The Princeton Review ranked Reed number two in "Best Classroom Experience", number three in "Students Study the Most", and number five in "Birkenstock-Wearing, Tree-Hugging, Clove-Smoking Vegetarians."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeRankings.aspx?iid=1023568 |title=Princeton Review|type=subscription required[/tpl] In 2006, Newsweek magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five "New Ivies",[tpl]cite journal |author=Kantrowitz, Barbara; Springen, Karen | title = America's 25 New Elite 'Ivies' | journal = Newsweek | url = http://www.newsweek.com/2006/08/20/25-new-ivies.html [/tpl] listing it among "the nation's elite colleges." In 2012, Newsweek ranked Reed the 15th "most rigorous" college in the nation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/galleries/2012/08/05/college-rankings-2012-most-rigorous-schools-photos.html#slide12|title=College Rankings 2012: Most Rigorous Schools|work=Daily Beast|accessdate=July 29, 2013[/tpl]  The guide to college admissions for About.com, moreover, places Reed as one of the top 10 liberal arts colleges in the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://collegeapps.about.com/od/choosingacollege/tp/top_colleges.htm |title=Top Colleges – U.S. Liberal Arts Colleges – List of Ten Top Colleges |publisher=Collegeapps.about.com |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

===Academic honors===

Reed has produced the second-highest number of Rhodes scholars for any liberal arts college—31—as well as over fifty Fulbright Scholars, over sixty Watson Fellows, and two MacArthur ("Genius") Award winners.[tpl]cite journal |title=A Thinking Reed |journal=Time | date =December 28, 1962 |volume=80 |issue=26 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827962,00.html |accessdate= December 18, 2007[/tpl]  A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn PhDs, particularly in the sciences, history, political science, and philosophy. Reed is third in percentage of its graduates who go on to earn PhDs in all disciplines, after only Caltech and Harvey Mudd.  In 1961, Scientific American declared that second only to Caltech, "This small college in Oregon has been far and away more productive of future scientists than any other institution in the U.S."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2002-2003/489.html |title=NSF Fellowships Go to Reed Senior and Recent Graduates |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |year=2002–2003 |work=Press Release |publisher=Reed College[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Smith |first=Chris |date=October 2001 |title=News you can abuse |journal=The University of Chicago Magazine |volume=94 |issue=1 |url= http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0110/features/abuse.html[/tpl]  Reed is first in this percentage in biology, second in chemistry and humanities, third in history, foreign languages, and political science, fourth in science and mathematics (fifth in physics and social sciences), sixth in anthropology, seventh in area and ethnic studies and linguistics, and eighth in English literature and medicine.
Reed's debating team, which had existed for only two years at the time, was awarded the first place sweepstakes trophy for Division II schools at the final tournament of the Northwest Forensics Conference in February 2004.
Loren Pope, former education editor for The New York Times, writes about Reed in Colleges That Change Lives, saying, "If you're a genuine intellectual, live the life of the mind, and want to learn for the sake of learning, the place most likely to empower you is not Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, or Stanford. It is the most intellectual college in the country—Reed in Portland, Oregon."[tpl]cite book | last = Pope | first = Loren | title = Colleges That Change Lives | publisher = Penguin Books |date=July 2006 | page = 354  | isbn = 0-14-303736-6[/tpl]

===Political===

Reed has a reputation for being politically left-wing.  Whether in fact Reed's student body is more leftist than those of similar colleges is difficult to determine, but Reed's academic tradition of open and passionate debate often spills into the off-campus political arena and, combined with a tolerant social environment, often leads to the appearance of radical leftism.
During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, then-President Duncan Ballantine fired Marxist philosopher Stanley Moore, a tenured professor, for his failure to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigation.[tpl]cite web | author= Schrecker, Ellen | title= Political Tests for Professors: Academic Freedom during the McCarthy Years | work=The University Loyalty Oath | date= October 7, 1999 | url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/schrecker.html | accessdate=April 9, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = History of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest | publisher = Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest, University of Washington | url = http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Pacific%20Northwest%20History/Lessons/Lesson%2023/23.html [/tpl] According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, "because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities. Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and untenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest. At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure."[tpl]cite news | last=Harmon | first=Rick | title=In the eye of the storm | work=Reed Magazine | date=August 1997 | url= http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/aug1997/index.html | accessdate=February 7, 2007 [/tpl]  A statement of "regret" by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees. In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the College, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.[tpl]cite news | author=Munk, Michael | title=Oregon Tests Academic Freedom in (Cold) Wartime: The Reed College Trustees versus Stanley Moore | work=The Oregon Historical Quarterly | year=1996 [/tpl]

==Campus==

The Reed College campus was established on a southeast Portland tract of land known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims. The college's grounds include [tpl]convert|116|acre|km2[/tpl] of contiguous land, including a wooded wetland known as Reed Canyon.
Portland architect A. E. Doyle developed a plan, never implemented in full, modeled on the University of Oxford's St. John's College. The original campus buildings (including the Library, the Old Dorm Block, and what is now the primary administration building, Eliot Hall) are brick Tudor Gothic buildings in a style similar to Ivy League campuses. In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the Modernist style. The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by Modernist architect Pietro Belluschi at the same time as his celebrated Equitable Building in downtown Portland.
The campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth, and there are now 21 academic and administrative buildings and 18 residence halls. Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy. At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use. Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a [tpl]convert|1.5|acre|ha|sing=on|lk=out[/tpl] tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive. Reed’s "immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007–08 academic year. Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing".[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2007-2008/press_release.html |title=Reed College press release |publisher=Web.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

===Residence halls===

Reed houses about 1,000 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus. Residence halls on campus range from the traditional (i.e., Gothic Old Dorm Block, referred to as "ODB") to the eclectic (e.g., Anna Mann, a Tudor-style cottage built in the 1920s by Reed's founding architect A. E. Doyle, originally used as a women's hallRomel Hernandez, "This New House," Reed (Spring 2007), p. 15.) language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), "temporary" housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon – Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan). There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to Arabic culture to a dorm for students interested in outdoors activities (hiking, climbing, bicycling, kayaking, skiing, etc.).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/res_life/on_campus/theme_dorms.html |title=Reed Theme Residences |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the College's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as "Asylum Block" because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an insane asylum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.reed.edu/apply/tour/index.html?welcome_to_campus/foster_scholz_mac.html~mainFrame |title=Foster-Scholz and Macnaughton Residence Halls |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |work= Reed Virtual Tour |publisher=Reed College[/tpl] Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect Pietro Belluschi.
Under the 10-year Campus Master Plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced, and MacNaughton to be remodeled.[tpl]cite web | title = Campus Facilities Master Plan | publisher = Reed College | url = http://web.reed.edu/campusmasterplan/pdfs/reed_master_plan_approved.pdf | format  =PDF [/tpl]  According to the master plan, "The College's goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the full-time student population. At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students".
In Spring 2007, the College broke ground on the construction of a new quadrangle called the Grove with four new residence halls (Aspen, Sequoia, Sitka, Bidwell) on the northwest side of the campus, which opened in Fall 2008. A new Spanish House residence was completed. Together, the five new residences added 142 new beds.

===Reed Canyon===

The Reed College Canyon, a natural area and national wildlife preserve, bisects the campus, separating the academic buildings from many of the residence halls (the so-called cross-canyon halls). The canyon is filled by Crystal Creek Springs, a natural spring that drains into Johnson Creek.[tpl]cite web | first = Ben | last = Jacklet | title = One vine at a time | publisher = Willamette Week | date = June 28, 2005 | url = http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=30595 | accessdate = March 26, 2007 [/tpl]
Canyon Day, a tradition dating back to 1915, is held twice a year. On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.[tpl]cite web |url= http://web.reed.edu/canyon/cday/history.html |title= Canyon Day History |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |work= Reed College Canyon |publisher= Reed College[/tpl]
A landmark of the campus, the Blue Bridge, spans the canyon. It appears on almost every viewbook that the college circulates. This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which "featured stressed plywood girders – the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge [tpl]convert|132|ft|m[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|15|ft|m[/tpl] high. It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime".[tpl]cite web | title = Exploring Reed's Vanished Buildings | publisher = Reed Magazine |date=August 2005 | url = http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/aug2005/features/vanished_buildings/2.html [/tpl] The Blue Bridge was originally  known as the "Cross Canyon Bridge" until student Rain Lynham bought and installed black lights in 1998 as decoration for Renn Fayre, the traditional end of year, campus-wide party, of which she was the organizer that year. The new look proved so popular with students and faculty alike that the original white bulbs were never replaced.
A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008. This bridge, dubbed the "Bouncy Bridge" by students, is [tpl]convert|370|ft|m[/tpl] long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and "connects the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus".

===Douglas F. Cooley Gallery===

Reed's Cooley Gallery is an internationally recognized contemporary art space located at the entrance to Reed's Hauser Library. It was established in 1988 as the result of a gift from Susan and Edward Cooley in honor of their late son.[tpl]cite journal |date=February 2001 |title=Trustee Ed Cooley Dies |journal=Reed Magazine |url=http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/Feb2001/columns/NoC/NoC_Cooley.html |accessdate= December 18, 2007[/tpl]  The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as Mona Hatoum, Al Held, David Reed and Gregory Crewdson as well as the contemporary art collection of Michael Ovitz.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2006/02/new_trajectorie_1.html |title=New Trajectories I: Relocations, at Reed College |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |last=Jahn |first=Jeff |date=February 17, 2006 |work=Portland art and reviews  |format=blog[/tpl] In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits. The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2006-2007/041607Getty.html |title=Reed College Gallery Curator Stephanie Snyder Receives Getty Research Fellowship |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |date=April 26, 2007 |work=News Center |publisher=Reed College[/tpl] who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.

===Food services===

The cafeteria, known simply as "Commons", has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services. The commons dining hall is operated by Bon Appétit, and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis. Suiting the student body, vegan and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu. It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception of Caffe Paradiso, a small cafe on the other side of campus which also operated by board points.
The Reed College Co-op is a theme residence located in Garden House, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall. It is the only campus dorm that is independent of the school's board plan. This residence houses ten students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings. It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants.
The Paradox ("Est. in the 80s") is a student-run cafe located on campus. In 2003 the Paradox opened a second cafe, dubbing it the "Paradox Lost" (an allusion to John Milton's Paradise Lost), at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the "Bio Fishbowl". The new north-campus dorms, which opened in Fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, dubbed "Cafe Paradiso", thereby providing three coffee shops within a [tpl]convert|116|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] campus. This third shop is not student-run, but is operated by Bon Appétit. Bon Appétit has a monopoly on the food services at Reed as they are the only ones who accept board points; written into their contract is the prohibition of food carts on campus.

===Off-campus housing===

Reed also has off-campus housing. Many houses in the Woodstock and Eastmoreland Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.

==Icons and student life==

===Griffin===

The official mascot of Reed is the griffin. In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of Dante's Commedia the griffin is associated with the Tree of Knowledge. The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed and is now on the official seal of Reed College.

===School color===

The official school color of Reed is Richmond Rose.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/apply/tour/index.html?welcome_to_campus/richmond_rose.html~mainFrame |title=Reed Virtual Tour |publisher=Web.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon. The most common examples of "Richmond Rose" are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.

===School song===

The school song, "Fair Reed," is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song "Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms." It may be imitative of the Harvard anthem "Fair Harvard", which is also sung to the tune of "Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms". It was composed by former president William Trufant Foster shortly after Reed's founding, and is rarely heard today.[tpl]cite web | first = Robert | last = Reynolds | title = Reed College Alma Mater | publisher = Reed College | url= http://people.reed.edu/~reyn/almamater.html [/tpl]
An unofficial Reed Alma Mater, "Epistemology Forever," sung to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", has been sung by Reed students since the 1950s.Spencer Wyant, "Epistemology Forever," Reed Magazine, August 1998; Jim Kahan, "The Evolution of Epistemology Forever, Reed Magazine, Spring 2009.

===Student nickname===

Reed students and alumni referred to themselves as "Reedites" in the early years of the college. This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous "Reedie" after World War II.[tpl]cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Nancy |date=May 1998 |title=A Campus Life |journal=Reed Magazine |url=http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/may1998/campus/index.html |accessdate= December 18, 2007[/tpl] Around campus, prospective students are called "prospies".

===Unofficial mottos and folklore===

An unofficial motto of Reed is "Communism, Atheism, Free Love", and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, t-shirts, etc. It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a "tongue-in-cheek slogan" in reference to Reed's nonconformism. Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into World War I, as well as the college's support for feminism, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the Socialist Party of America to speak on campus about the Russian Revolution’s potential impact on militarism, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its nonsectarian status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.[tpl]cite journal |last=Sheehy |first=John P. |date=Summer 2007 |title=What's so funny about communism, atheism, and free love? |journal=Reed Magazine |url=http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/summer2007/features/C_A_FL/7.html |accessdate= December 18, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |date=Summer 2007 |title=Ripped from the Archives: All you need is communism, atheism, and free love |journal=Reed Magazine |url=http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/summer2007/features/C_A_FL/8.html |accessdate= December 18, 2007[/tpl]
The faux Reed Seal has changed over the years.  In its original form the griffin was holding a hammer and sickle in its paws.  Later versions had the griffin wearing boxing gloves.
One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly [tpl]convert|280|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since 1913. The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl's oral history. The original Doyle Owl was almost certainly destroyed many years ago, but a number of replicas (of varying degrees of quality) remain in circulation, contributing to the frequency of its appearance.Admission/The Doyle Owl. from Reed College website, 3 September 2012This article has a photo of Steve Jobs with the Doyle Owl17 September 2013

===Paideia===

Each January, before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds an interim period called Paideia (roughly drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education').[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/apply/student_life/favorite_traditions.html |title=Reed College | Admission | Reed College Admission Office |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Originally conceived and approved by the faculty in 1968 for unstructured independent study or "UIS," Paideia ran for the full month of January from 1969–1981, supervised by a committee of faculty, staff and students.[tpl]Citation  | last = Massey  | first = Sammie  | title = Ghosts of Paideia's Past | pages = 1, 5  | newspaper = The Quest | location = Reed College, Portland OR | date = January 27, 2012  | url =http://www.reedquest.org/2012/01/ghosts-of-paideias-past/  | accessdate = January 29, 2012[/tpl] This festival of learning takes the form of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community. The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed. Many such classes are explicitly trivial (one long-running tradition is to hold an underwater basket weaving class), while others are trivially academic (such as "Giant Concrete Gnome Construction", a class that, incidental to building monolithic gnomes, includes some content relating to the construction of pre-Christian monoliths). More structured classes (such as martial arts seminars and mini-classes on obscure academic topics), tournaments, and film festivals round out the schedule, which is different every year. The objective of Paideia is not only to learn new (possibly non-useful) things, but to turn the tables on students and encourage them to teach.
In his 2005 Stanford commencement lecture, Apple Inc. founder and Reed dropout Steve Jobs credited a Reed calligraphy class for his focus on choosing quality typefaces for the Macintosh.[tpl]cite web |author= Jobs, Steve | title= Commencement Address | work=Stanford Report | date=June 14, 2005 | url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html | accessdate=April 9, 2006[/tpl] While the full calligraphy course[tpl]cite web | url = http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/aug2003/features/dance_of_pen/ | title = The Dance of the Pen | accessdate = October 6, 2011 | last = Schwartz | first = Todd | date = August 2003 | work = Reed Magazine | publisher = Reed College[/tpl] is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject.

===Renn Fayre===

Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration with a different theme each year. Born in the 1960s as an actual renaissance fair, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the Renaissance, although its name has persisted.

===Reed Arts Week===

Reed Arts Week is a week-long celebration of the arts at Reed. It features music, dance, film, creative writing, and the visual arts.

===Student organizations===

According to Reed's website, each semester, a $130 student body fee "is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate. The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin".[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/catalog/admission/costs.html |title=College Catalog – Reed College |publisher=Web.reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]
Student body funds (totaling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester's funding poll. The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either 'top six', 'approve', 'no opinion', 'disapprove' or 'deep six.' These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters.For more information, see Signators' Handbook[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus. The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.
The school's student-run newspaper, "The Quest", has been published since 1913, and its radio station, KRRC, has been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, since 1955.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/student_activities/student_media.html |title=Reed College: Student media |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]
Although some that partner with outside groups such as Oxfam or Planned Parenthood are more structured, most organizations are highly informal. There is no formal process for forming a student organization at Reed; a group of students (or a single student) announcing themselves as or just considering themselves a student organization is enough. Groups that want funding from the school's Student Activities office or Student Body Fees, however, must register with Student Activities or through the Student Senate. The Reed archive of comic books and graphic novels, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various beer gardens throughout the year and during Renn Fayre, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective – dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture – have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.[tpl]citation|author=Reed Student Senate|publisher=Reed College Quest|title=Spring 2006 Funding Poll|date=April 20, 2006[/tpl]
Reed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on Mount Hood, recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.reed.edu/sports_center/ |title=Sports Center |accessdate=December 18, 2007 |publisher= Reed College[/tpl]
==Notable alumni== 
Examples of alumni include Emilio Pucci, Larry Sanger, Gary Snyder, Howard Vollum, and Barry Hansen ("Dr. Demento").  Among those who attended but did not graduate from Reed are James Beard, Chris Langan, Ry Cooder, Steve Jobs, and Afshin Feiz.
