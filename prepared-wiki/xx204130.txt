An impact assessment (IA) is "a process aimed at structuring and supporting the development of policies. It identifies and assesses the problem at stake and the objectives pursued. It identifies the main options for achieving the objective and analyses their likely impacts in the economic, environmental and social fields. It outlines advantages and disadvantages of each option and examines possible synergies and trade-offs".http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/index_en.htm, Source: European commission
Key types of impact assessment in this field include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), Strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and Environmental impact assessment (project level).
