David Jewett was authorized as commander of the Trumbull to capture any vessel sailing under the flag of France.  On April 24, 1800, it came upon the French schooner Peggy and captured it.  The Peggy was returned to Connecticut where the local courts ruled her a prize of war in September 1800.  The owners of the Peggy appealed to the Supreme Court for her return.

==The decision==

The court ruled that the treaty was applicable as law and should apply retroactively to all seized vessels whose sentence was not yet final.  Since the seizure of the vessel was on appeal to the Supreme Court at the time the treaty was ratified, the seizure was not final.  The vessel was ordered to be returned to France.
The case continues to be one in a long line of sometimes inconsistent precedents in civil retroactivity analysis.[ref]
