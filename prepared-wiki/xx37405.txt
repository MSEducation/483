[[List of recorder players]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of musicians by instrument, Recorder players

A recorder player is a musician who plays the recorder, a flute-like  woodwind musical instrument. The recorder is often used in teaching the rudiments of music, as it is cheap to buy and relatively easy to play at a certain level of accomplishment (although its mastery is as demanding as that of any other instrument). Because of this widespread use of the recorder, the list of people who can play it is enormous.
This article lists three categories of people: first, those who are notable recorder players and are widely recognised as performers on the instrument; second, those who are not famous as recorder players but who have used the instrument as a notable feature of their work; and, third, people who are famous for some other reason but are known to be recreational players of the recorder.
