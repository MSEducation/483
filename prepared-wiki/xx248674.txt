There are 4000 arena roller rinks in the country to less than 200 ice rinks, 20 roller-skaters for every ice-skater. Once the sport of roughnecks, roller-skating has been taken up by the best people of all ages."[tpl]cite news|author=Harry Grayson|title=Gloria Nord, Star On Wheels, Puts Roller-Skating In Movies|newspaper=Blytheville Courier News|date=1943-06-16[/tpl]   In 1944, Nord appeared in a roller-skating scene with Betty Grable in the motion picture, "Pin Up Girl."[tpl]cite news|title=Gloria Nord of Roller Fame Is in Movies Now|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=1943-07-27|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iu8ZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FSMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6647,4732182&dq=gloria-nord&hl=en[/tpl]   Nord herself became a popular pin-up girl with American soldiers during World War II.

Not only is she acknowledged as the outstanding dance-skater in America, but she is also one of the country's most beautiful girls.  Her face and figure have adorned such national publications as The Saturday Evening Post, Look, Pic, the New York Sunday News, and others.  She has won acclaim for her solo skating in the aptly titled movie, "Pin-Up Girl."  And her photographs have been requested by American servicemen all over the world."[tpl]cite web|title=Gloria Nord profile|publisher=Nordskog Publishing|url=http://www.nordskogpublishing.com/gloria_nord.shtml[/tpl]
