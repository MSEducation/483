CATEGORIES: Aviation pioneers, Lists of pilots, 1911 in aviation, France transport-related lists

The Aéro-Club de France issued Aviators Certificates from 1909.The details provided in this and related lists covering the years 1909 to 1914 have been collected and collated largely from the following sources (as listed in the bibliography): "Flying Pioneers - Les Vieilles Tiges; Alphabetical lists of aviators licensed in France prior to 2 August 1914" (Fr.: "Liste Alphabétique des pilotes aviateurs brevetés en France avant le 2 août 1914") by Jacques Moulin; Grace's Guide; Flight global PDF archive. These were internationally recognised under the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
French aviators' licences were issued from 1 January 1910, but by this time many aviation pioneers, e.g. Louis Blériot and the Wright brothers, had amply demonstrated their abilities and they were therefore not required to pass an examination in order to receive a licence. The first fourteen licences were awarded in alphabetical order, with Blériot being awarded Licence No. 1 and Wilbur Wright receiving No. 15 (No. 13 was not awarded); two further such 'honorary' licences were awarded subsequently and inserted into the sequence as '5bis' and '10bis'.Lassalles, Émile
