Irina Khakamada was an elected Duma representative from 1993 to 2003. She is commonly regarded as a democratic politician who is in a moderate opposition to the Russian government. She is known for criticizing the governmental actions during Moscow theater hostage crisis where she was involved as one of the negotiators. Khakamada stated that the hostage takers were not going to use their bombs to kill the people and destroy the building http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/02n/n02n-s13.shtml. This opinion was supported by other negotiators including Anna Politkovskaya and by the subsequent events when the Chechens did not use their bombs.
Khakamada was one of the leaders of the Union of Rightist Forces, when she decided to run in the Russian presidential election, 2004. She was not supported by her own party, because they regarded her as the only opponent of president Putin (all other candidates were not opposed to the President's policies). She received 3.9% of votes http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3511164.stm. Publicist Yulia Latynina in her article in Novaya Gazeta http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/03n/n03n-s03.shtml claimed that she only staged a role of a democratic opponent to provide more legitimacy to the election of Vladimir Putin, a role that Grigory Alexeyevich Yavlinsky refused to play. However, Khakamada denied such allegations.http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2003-49-59
After the election, Khakamada founded a political party, Our Choice, which eventually merged with the People's Democratic Union led by Mikhail Kasyanov and her. She published book "Gender in big-time politics"http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/18n/n18n-s32.shtml describing her personal experience of work in Kremlin.http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/43n/n43n-s25.shtml

==Claims of receiving and passing threats==

On June 11, 2006 Boris Berezovsky, fugitive from Russian justice system, said Boris Nemtsov received a word from Khakamada that Putin threatened her and like-minded colleagues in person. According to Berezovsky Putin had issued threats that Khakamada and her colleagues "will take in the head immediately, literally, not figuratively" if they "open the mouth" about the Russian apartment bombings.Live interview with Berezovsky by Evgenia Albats, Radio Echo of Moscow, 11 June 2006.

Former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko said he had learned from Anna Politkovskaya that Putin asked Khakamada to pass a threat to Politkovskaya.Litvinenko's statement at the Frontline Club, 19 October 2006.
