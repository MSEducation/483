[[Flag of Réunion]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of France, Réunion

Réunion uses the flag of France. Although the federal period installed a number of flags of metropolitan France, Réunion does not have a separate official flag. However, the regional council of Réunion has a flag.
The Vexillological Association of Réunion selected a flag in 2003. It depicts the volcano of Fournaise, bedecked by gold sunbeams.
Since June 14, 2008, separatists and nationalists of Reunion also have their flag (green, yellow, red). Green symbolizes the marronage, yellow symbolizes the working class and red symbolizes the period of slavery and indentured labour, struck by a yellow star with five points.
