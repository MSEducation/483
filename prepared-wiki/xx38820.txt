FP is most often found externally around the armpits, genitals, neck, eyes and tail of turtles, but do also occur in and around the mouth, and rarely in internal organs or on the shell. This in turn impedes vision, feeding and movement. Around 25-30% of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours, primarily in heart, lungs and kidneys.
FP incidence is highest among immature and juvenile green turtles, while it is rare in adults. There are two suggestions for this pattern; firstly, the tumours can regress and be cured, which has been documented in some individuals, even when tumours were severe.[ref]

</ref> However, the responses that cause these tumour regressions is unknown. Secondly, the juvenile individuals with FP might die before reaching adulthood.<ref name="Stranded"></ref>

===Prognosis===

The tumours appear to be benign and can be present for many years, but the large tumours do mechanically hamper sight, swallowing and swimming, which may ultimately be fatal. While external tumours hamper movement and sight, internal tumours interfere with system functioning, another potentially fatal factor. And as the tumours progress, individuals with large numbers of tumours may become anaemic, have a lack of proteins and iron, and in more advanced stages even suffer from acidosis caused by imbalanced calcium/phosphorus ratios and severe emaciation.

===Other species===

Fibropapillomas are present in other animal groups but are caused by different viruses, for example the bovine cutaneous fibropapillomatosis.

==History==

The first documented case of the disease was in 1938 in Key West, Florida. Long-term studies found no signs of the disease on Florida’s Atlantic coast in the 1970s but during the 1980s FP was recorded in incidences varying from 28%-67%. Today incidences as high as 92% have been reported in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Generally FP is most prominent in warmer climates.

==Etiology==

The FP is an infectious disease with horizontal transmission. An alphaherpesvirus called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus (FPTHV) is believed to be the causative agent of the disease, even though there is no real proof of its causality. The reason for this belief is because nearly all tissue samples tested from turtles with lesions carry genetic material of this herpesvirus, varying between 95% - 100% depending on different studies and locations. The DNA loads of the herpesvirus in tumour tissue are 2.5-4.5 logarithms higher than in uninfected tissue.[ref]

</ref>
The FPTHV herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from FP and this suggest that the FP progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase. The global prevalence of the disease also suggests a multifactorial etiology, rather than single factors or agents.[ref]

</ref> Possible factors include some parasites, bacteria, environmental pollutants, UV-light, changing water temperatures and biotoxins. Even physiological factors such as stress and immunologic status appear to be associated with FP.<ref name="Sentinels"></ref>
The Ozobranchus genus of leeches is thought to be the mechanical vector of the herpesvirus, transmitting the virus from one turtle to another. These leeches are common turtle ectoparasites that exclusively feed on turtle blood and some leeches have been found carrying more than 10 million copies of the herpesvirus DNA. 
The green sea turtle is an herbivore and feeds primarily on seagrass and macroalgae. Two toxins which are suspected to be associated with FP are found epiphytically on these plants. First, the toxic compound lyngbyatoxin from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscule, and second the toxin okadaic acid – a documented tumour-promoting toxin - from the dinoflagellate order Prorocentrum. Again, causality has not been concluded, but there seems to be an association between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of FP, and as they are found on weeds they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles.
Turtles with FP are found to have a compromised immune system. They have higher phagocytic leucocyte counts (especially heterophils) compared to healthy individuals, which seems to be an effect of FP, as it is mostly evident in individuals with severe tumours.[ref]

</ref> This further supports the hypothesis of the herpesvirus as a causative agent.<ref name="Associations"></ref> Immunosupression is strongly correlated with FP, but does seem to be a consequence of the development and growth of FP rather than a prerequisite, which is similar to other virus-induced tumour diseases in other species, such as the Marek’s disease in poultry.<ref name="Sentinels"></ref><ref name="ImmuneStatus"></ref>

==Epidemiology==

FP is a global disease affecting green sea turtle population all over the world, making it a panzootic. It is especially found in warmer climates, such as the Caribbean, Hawaii, Japan and Australia, where up to 50%-70% of individuals in a population have FP.  
There are epidemiological links between FP rates, nitrogen-footprints and invasive macroalgae.[ref]
