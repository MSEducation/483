==Plot summary==

Coraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats. The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two elderly women retired from the stage, and Mr. Bobinski, who claims to be training a mouse circus. The flat beside Coraline's remains decayed.
During a rainy day she discovers a locked door in a downstairs room. She gets the key from her mother and opens the door to discover that it has been bricked up. As she goes to visit her neighbours, Mr. Bobo relates to her a message from his mice: Don't go through the door. At tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, Miss Spink spies danger in Coraline’s future after reading her tea leaves, and gives her a lucky stone. The ladies explain that the stone will make the unseen seen.
Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself. This time, she finds the brick wall behind the door gone. In its place is a long hallway that leads to a flat identical to her own, inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father. They look like her parents, except that in place of eyes, they have shiny black buttons. The Other Mother, however, is notably different from her real mother, in that she is taller and thinner. Her black hair seems to move by itself, her skin is paper-white, and her nails are long and red. In this “Other World”, Coraline finds everything to be better than her reality: her Other Parents pay attention to her, her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly, and the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible forever perform a cabaret show in their flat. She even finds that the feral Black Cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk; however, she learns he is not of the Other World; he can travel from one world to the other, and has done so to warn Coraline of imminent danger, but Coraline pays him no heed. The Other Mother and other inhabitants of the Other World do not like the black cat.
The Button Mother offers Coraline the opportunity to stay in the Button World forever, and to do so, Coraline must allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. Coraline is horrified and returns through the door to her home. Upon her return to her apartment, Coraline finds her real parents are missing. They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents. They signal to her by writing "Help Us" on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them. Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents. In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the Cat to challenge the Other Mother, as “her kind of thing loves games and challenges”. The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked within a mirror as punishment.
Behind the mirror is darkness and a small space like a closet. There, she meets three ghost children, each from a different era. They had let the beldame (the Other Mother) sew buttons in their eyes. They tell Coraline how she eventually grew bored with them, and eventually they died and she cast their spirits aside. But they are trapped there because she has kept their souls. If their souls can be rescued from the Other Mother, then the ghosts can pass on. The ghost children implore Coraline to avoid their fate. 
After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game: if she can find the ghost children's souls and her parents, then she, her parents and the ghost children may go free. If she loses, then Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes and become a loving daughter to her.
Coraline searches through the Other World, overcomes all of the Other Mother's obstacles, uses her wits and Miss Spink's stone to locate the ghost children's souls and her parents, who are imprisoned in a snow globe on the mantle. The ghost children warn her that even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go. So Coraline tricks the Other Mother: she announces that she knows her parents are hidden in the passageway between the worlds. The Other Mother cannot resist gloating by opening the door to show Coraline that her parents are not there. But as the Other Mother opens the door, Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key, and the Cat quickly follows. In escaping, she forces the door shut on the Other Mother's hand, severing it. Back in her home, Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the events.
That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children before they move on to the afterlife. They warn her that her task is still not done: the other mother's severed hand is in Coraline's world, and will not stop until it locates and uses the key to open the door that connects the two worlds. Coraline goes to an old well in the woods by her house, luring the Other Mother’s hand there with the key, and tricks the Other Mother's hand into falling down the bottomless well.
