The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17, Apr. 2, 1987, 101 Stat. 132) is a United States Act of Congress, also called the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1987. It nominally gave power to apportion money to the Secretary of Transportation.  Most noticeably it allowed states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour (105Â km/h) on rural Interstate highways.
It was followed by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.The local agencies (Counties and Cities) in California were assured that an equal or not less amount of monies will still be annually apportioned to the Counties and Cities as they received in 1990-91 under the Federal Highway Act of 1987 under the old Federal Aid Urban (FAU) and Federal Aid Secondary Program
