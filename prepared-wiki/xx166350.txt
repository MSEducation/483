David Lynn Harbour (born October 23, 1965 in Plainfield, Illinois) is a former American football center in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins.  He played college football at the University of Illinois.
In an interesting irony, Harbour was signed by the Washington Redskins after former Illinois teammate Mike Scully long snapped two balls over the head of the punter while on Monday Night Football and was cut the next day.
