WKKP Classic Country 1410 broadcasts on 1410 kHz at a power of 2,500 watts daytime and 58 watts at night from a tower located on Racetrack Road in McDonough, Georgia, a southern suburb of Atlanta. The station is owned by Henry County Radio Co Inc. and originates from studios located on Brownlee Road in Jackson, Georgia. The station was originally WZAL and was assigned to 1540 kHz and was owned by Dallas Tarkenton (older brother of Fran Tarkenton), broadcasting until it was purchased by DeVan-Moore Communication, Inc. in 1980. The station saw successful growth in the hands of Jim DeVan (former manager of WMCD, Statesboro, Georgia) and moved to 1410 kHz in the late 1980s.  Jim DeVan managed WZAL until his sudden death from a work-related accident in 1991. The station was sold to a former Tarkenton associate (Earnhart) who changed the call letters and moved the studios to Jackson several years later. WKKP (Kopy Kat Programming) was local programming in the morning then simulcast programming from sister station WJGA-FM in Jackson, Georgia. The station has gone through many format changes and now it broadcasts Classic Country programming from satellite. WKKP also broadcasts AP network news at the top of the hour. The Henry County Schools high school football game of the week is also aired every Saturday at 1:00PM during the football season. The play by play is provided by Jason Shadden and Tony Tumlin provides the color commentation. They also broadcast high school baseball and basketball games in season, with Rob Gulley providing play by play.
