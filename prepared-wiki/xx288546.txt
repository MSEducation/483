Mynydd y Gaer is a 295-metre-high hill in Bridgend County Borough in South Wales. The summit is crowned by a trig point.

==Geology==

The hill is formed from sandstones of the Pennant Sandstone Formation assigned to the Warwickshire Group laid down late in the Carboniferous Period. The strata here dip moderately steeply northwards into the South Wales Coalfield syncline. A number of coal seams are recorded as outcropping on the hillside including the No 1 Rhondda, No 2 Rhondda, Brithdir and Brithdir Rider.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 248 Pontypridd & accompanying memoirBGS ‘Geology of Britain’ viewer
