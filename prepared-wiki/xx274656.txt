CATEGORIES: Tea production

The Ethical Tea Partnership is a not-for-profit membership organisation that has been working with tea producers and tea companies to improve the sustainability of the tea industry since 1997.Jane Pettigrew and Bruce Richardson ‘Tea Classified: A Tea Lover’s Companion’ The National Trust Books, 2008[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethicalteapartnership.org/about/ |title=About « Ethical Tea Partnership |publisher=Ethicalteapartnership.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] This industry-wide initiative, which was originally called the Tea Sourcing Partnership, was established by a number of large UK tea packing companies who took the decision to work together to improve the social conditions in their supply chains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abf.co.uk/focus-ethical-tea-partnership-twinings.aspx |title=Associated British Foods plc - In focus - Ethical Tea Partnership - Twinings |publisher=Abf.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tradestandards.org/en/Standard.74.aspx |title=Ethical Tea Partnership | TSPN (Trade Standards Practitioners Network) |publisher=Tradestandards.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] Later on, ETP membership opened up to non UK based-tea packers, and extended the scheme to include environmental issues as well. 
The ETP works in all the main tea producing regions and has a London-based Secretariat, and 5 Regional Managers based in Kenya, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and China. It runs three coordinated programmes to achieve its vision of a "thriving tea industry that is socially just and environmentally sustainable''.

==Monitoring and Certification==

The ETP monitoring programme has been running since 1997 and is free of charge to producers. The programme is based on continuous improvement and its environmental and social provisions are outlined in the ETP Global Standard. These provisions are closely aligned to the main certification programmes operating in tea (Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ Certified) and help producers to meet internationally recognised standards.
The social and labour provisions[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethicalteapartnership.org/our-work/monitoring-cert/ |title=Monitoring & Certification « Ethical Tea Partnership |publisher=Ethicalteapartnership.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl] are based on the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) Base Code which covers the International Labour Organization's (ILO) core conventions. 

===Social Provisions===

===Environmental provisions===

In order to increase impact and to reduce duplication the ETP has formal relationships in place with Fairtrade,http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/march_2010/joint_commitment_with_flo_and_etp_announced.aspxhttp://www.foodbev.com/news/the-ethical-tea-partnership-links-with-fairtrade Rainforest Alliancehttp://www.rainforest-alliance.org/agriculture/initiatives and UTZ Certified.http://www.utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/95-press-release-utz-certified-announces-code-for-responsible-tea-and-partnership-with-etp?template=gk_corporateinner As such, the ETP works to facilitate certification where ETP member companies request this and producers are interested. The ETP also works with certification programmes and a wide range of NGOs and development organisations through its producer support programmes.

==Producer Support==

In order to help producers to meet international social and environmental standards the ETP co-ordinates a series of training and improvement programmes. These are aimed at both management and workers and cover a number of issues including:
These capacity building projects are facilitated by the ETP Regional Managers who build relationships with tea producers and support them to participate effectively in the ETP programme.International Trade Centre ‘Ethical Tea Partnership - At a Glance’  May 2011
ETP has been working with ETI  on a training programme focused on reducing  discrimination and harassment of workers in Africa. This type of training supplements the auditing process by offering practical support to producers and it tackles long-term problematic issues that cannot be addressed by auditing and certification alone. http://www.ethicaltrade.org/news-and-events/news/south-african-farm-workers-to-reap-training-rewards
ETP has also played a valued partnership role in CARE International’s long-term project to improve living and working conditions in tea communities in Sri Lanka.'The Story of Change in an Estate Community: The People Who Make Tea’ by CARE International Sri Lanka, July 2011http://www.careinternational.org.uk/what-we-do/working-with-business/who-we-work-with/care-and-the-ethical-tea-partnership

==Strategic Sustainability==

As well as addressing issues that pose an immediate threat to workers and the environment, the ETP also works on those issues that threaten the long-term future sustainability of tea. For example in Kenya, the ETP is working in partnership with GIZ (the German Development Agency) to help in excess of 10,000 smallholder farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change in order to help them secure their future livelihoods from tea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethicalteapartnership.org/our-work/strategic-sustainability/climate-change/ |title=Climate Change « Ethical Tea Partnership |publisher=Ethicalteapartnership.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
Together, ETP and GIZ are developing toolkits for good climate change adaptation practices that span from technical solutions (good practice farming) to socio-economic approaches and institutional and political options. ‘Recent Developments to Respond to Climate Change in Tea & Coffee in GIZ Public Private Partnerships: The Case of Tea in Kenya ’ September 2011
As well as working with NGO and development organisations, the Ethical Tea Partnership works closely with tea producers to share and develop ideas on how to improve the sustainability of tea.
