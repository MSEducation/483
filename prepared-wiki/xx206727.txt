Maurizio Moro (15??—16??) was an Italian poet of the 16th century, best known for his madrigals.

==Life==

Very little is known about his early life. Probably born in Ferrara, he became presbyter ("canonico") at the Congregazione di S Giorgio d'Alga in Venice, and author of sacred poems as well as secular texts for librettos. One of his madrigals, Sí ch'io vorrei morire, was set to music by Claudio Monteverdi in his Fourth Book of Madrigals. Filippo Bonaffino also set some of his work to music in book of madrigals.
In the Dizionario Storico degli Uomini Ferraresi ed. Rinaldi, Ferrara, 1804; volume II, pag. 80 by author Luigi Ughi, the entry for Maurizio Moro reads: "He was also a man of erudition and a good Italian poet who lived in the second half of the 16th century. Some of his works can be found in collections of that time and in selections of poems by Ferrara poets.""Fu anch'egli uomo d'erudizione e buon poeta italiano vissuto oltre la metà del sec. XVI. Si hanno alcune delle sue opere stampate nelle raccolte di quel tempo, e nelle rime scelte de' poeti ferraresi."
