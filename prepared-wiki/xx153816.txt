WiLife, Inc. was founded in 2002 by Evan Tree and Andrew Hartsfield. The company developed a simple but powerful PC-based digital video surveillance system for residential and light commercial use. Their first product, LukWerks, was a mix of PC software, cameras, HomePlug technology and online services. The idea was to make it easy for any home or small business owner to set up their own professional video surveillance system.
WiLife is based out of Draper, Utah and is a privately held company.
