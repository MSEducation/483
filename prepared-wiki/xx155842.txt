[[Neck guard]]

CATEGORIES: Ice hockey equipment, Protective gear

A neck guard is a piece of protective equipment worn by ice hockey players around the neck area. The guard is to prevent injury to the neck by pucks, hockey sticks, and skate blades.
This piece is critical to goaltenders, who are more likely at risk to be injured in this area. Goalie Clint Malarchuk suffered a severe injury during a game in 1989 when two players collided in front of his goal and one player's skate caught on his neck, slicing open his internal jugular vein. He most likely would have died were immediate medical help not available. Ever since then, NHL regulations have required goalies to wear neck guards.
On February 10, 2008, Florida Panthers forward Richard Zedník was behind the play and skating into the right corner of the Buffalo Sabres' zone, when teammate Olli Jokinen lost his balance after being checked by Clarke MacArthur. Jokinen fell head-first to the ice, and his right leg flew up and struck Zedník directly on the side of the neck, hitting Zedník's external carotid artery. Clutching his neck, Zedník raced to the Florida bench, leaving a long trail of blood. When he arrived, he nearly fell into the arms of a team trainer. He recovered fully from the injury.
The neck guard contains fabric that is BNQ certified. Most neck guards have a moisture system which let's the player keep cool while working so their neck guard won't get hot.
