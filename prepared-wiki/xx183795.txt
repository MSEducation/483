==History==

828 was first mentioned as Muncinesheim, the place was ruled from 1109 to 1282 by a local aristocracy. In 1326 it became part of Baden, as a fief to the Hofwart family of Kirchheim. The suzerainty probably comes from the Counts of Eberstein and thus of the Kraichgau knights. The fiefdom converted to protestantism in 1530. After reversion of the feud in 1675 Margrave Frederick of Baden gave Münzesheim to his two illegitimate sons, which styled themselves Barons of Münzesheim. Friedrich August of Münzesheim sold the community in 1761 back to the feudal lord, but Baden had to recognize the tax sovereignty of the Kraichgauer knighthood until 1805. From 1805 to 1807 Münzesheim belonged to the District Office Bretten, then to the Town Office Gochsheim. Finally in 1813 temporarily to the city office and the first land office Bruchsal and from December 1813 to the district office Bretten again. 1936 Münzesheim came to the district office Bruchsal.
On 1 September 1971 Gochsheim (Baden) was united with Unteröwisheim and the communities Bahnbrücken, Landshausen, Menzingen (Baden), Münzesheim, Neuenbürg (Baden), Oberacker und Oberöwisheim to the new city of Kraichtal.
