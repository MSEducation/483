==Early life==

Schwimmer was born in Flushing, Queens, New York City, to attorneys Arthur and Arlene Colman-Schwimmer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/davidschwimmer/|title=Hello Magazine Profile — David Schwimmer |work=Hello!|publisher=Hello Ltd|accessdate=January 16, 2009[/tpl] Arlene was Elizabeth Taylor's attorney in her divorce from Larry Fortensky[tpl]cite news | first= Nadine | last= Brozan | url =http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/08/style/chronicle-510629.html | title = Chronicle | date= April 8, 1997 | work = The New York Times[/tpl] and Roseanne Barr's attorney in her divorce from Bill Pentland.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/25/style/chronicle-646190.html | title= Chronicle | first= Susan Heller | last=  Anderson | date =August 25, 1990 | work = The New York Times[/tpl] He has an older sister named Ellie (born 1965).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=172712&apid=0|title=David Schwimmer|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=May 26, 2009[/tpl] His family subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where Schwimmer had his first experiences of acting at the age of 10 when he was cast as the fairy godmother in a Jewish version of Cinderella. In 1979, Schwimmer went to a Shakespeare workshop given by English actor Ian McKellen in Los Angeles. He recalls that he was riveted by the experience. Schwimmer then entered a contest in the Southern California Shakespeare Festival three years in a row, winning two first prizes.
Following his mother's successful career as a divorce lawyer, the family moved to Beverly Hills, where Schwimmer attended Beverly Hills High School. Schwimmer admitted to being an outsider during his time at the school. Also a troublemaker and a bully, he did not fit in with the other kids. "When I was there I always felt: 'this is not me, I'm surrounded by people with a different value system. And I just wanted to get out of California.'"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/nov/25/features.magazine|title=Friends in high places|last=Cooper|first=Tim|date=November 25, 2001|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=January 16, 2009[/tpl] He was best at the subjects of science and math and thought he would become a doctor. Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class, where he appeared in stage productions. Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting, he flew off to Chicago for an acting workshop. He noted that the experience was both "enlightening and exhilarating." In 1984, Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High, and wanted to go straight into acting, but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on, in case his acting career did not work out. Schwimmer moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he had attended a summer drama course when he was 16 years old. At the university, he enrolled as a theater major, joining Delta Tau Delta Fraternity and Arts Alliance. After graduating in 1988, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and speech, Schwimmer co-founded the Lookingglass Theatre Company. Subsequently, he returned to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

===Early work===

After his supporting role debut in the ABC television movie A Deadly Silence (1989),[tpl]cite journal|first=Daniel|last=Ruth|title=Nagging problems leave gaps in 'A Deadly Silence'|date=April 14, 1989|work=Chicago Sun-Times|page=65[/tpl] Schwimmer followed this with roles on the legal drama L.A. Law in 1992, and the comedy-drama series The Wonder Years. He made his feature film debut in Flight of the Intruder (1991), had a recurring role as a lawyer-turned-vigilante in NYPD Blue and appeared briefly in ER in 1993, before auditioning, unsuccessfully, for a series pilot called Couples. He landed his first regular series role as the liberal son of a conservative talk show host (Henry Winkler) in the sitcom Monty.

===Acting roles===

In 1994, Schwimmer was cast as Ross Geller in NBC's situation comedy Friends, a series that revolved around a group of friends who live together in Manhattan, New York City. He played a hopeless-romantic paleontologist who works at a museum and later becomes a professor at a university. Schwimmer notes when first approached about the role of Ross, he turned it down, but accepted the role afterwards.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4908086/|title=Can David Schwimmer leave Ross Geller behind?|last=Couric|first=Katie|date=May 5, 2004|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=January 17, 2009[/tpl] Executive producer Kevin S.

When asked why he decided to accept the role, Schwimmer admitted the decision was to "make an effort to find roles that are as far away from the character of Ross as possible". He was offered a role to star alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the 1997 science-fiction comedy Men in Black, but turned it down in favor of starring in The Pallbearer, explaining, "This is an opportunity to grow rather than go for the quick cash."[tpl]cite journal|first=Judy|last=Hevrdejs|coauthors=Mike Conklin|title=Schwimmer Makes Deal To Act, Direct On Silver Screen|date=November 2, 1995|work=Chicago Tribune|page=2[/tpl]
His next film roles in 1998 were Kissing a Fool, Six Days Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil.

Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man."

"I was scared of the part," Schwimmer said, "but I wanted to be part of the movie." At the time, he noted it was a "little frustrating" that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends.[tpl]cite journal|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|title=Young director follows up 'Usual Suspects'|work=The Tampa Tribune|date=May 4, 1997[/tpl] (Reprinted from the Los Angeles Times.)

In 2001, Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers.

The only thing believable about Schwimmer's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle. His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1544232.stm|title=Band of Brothers impresses|last=Hill|first=Aubrey|date=September 14, 2001|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=January 20, 2009[/tpl] Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama Uprising, based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/11/02/DD157481.DTL|title='Uprising' has Emmy potential|last=Carman|first=John|date=November 2, 2001|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=January 30, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117916244.html?categoryid=32&cs=1&query=%27Uprising%27|title=Uprising Review|last=Oxman|first=Steven|date=October 31, 2001|work=Variety |accessdate=January 30, 2009[/tpl]

The Independent wrote that Schwimmer "is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as one might have expected in Some Girl(s). ...

He takes to the stage with ... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy.

The film stars Simon Pegg as a man who signs up for a marathon (he is out of shape) to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: "As a director, I was struck by the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters.
