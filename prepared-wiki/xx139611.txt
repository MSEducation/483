Guzamn is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Part of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Guzamn is bordered on the southeast by Baso Liben, on the south by the Abay River which separates it from the Oromia Region, on the west by Debre Elias, on the northwest by Machakel, on the north by Sinan, and on the east by Aneded; the Chamwaga River defines part of the border between Guzamn and Baso Liben. The town and woreda of Debre Marqos is an enclave inside Guzamn. Towns in Guzamn include Chemoga and Yebokile. Sinan woreda was separate from Guzamn.
Landmarks include the fortified mountaintops of Jebelli and Mutera, which was used as a stronghold of the rulers of Gojjam until Birru Goshu was defeated and captured by Kassa Hailu (later known as Tewodros II) in the Battle of Amba Jebelli.
