Give And Take is the fourth album from The Dynamic Superiors, and their last on Motown Records.  Released in 1977, it includes covers of Martha and the Vandellas' "Nowhere to Run" and Stevie Wonder's "All In Love Is Fair".  It is also noted that singer Mariah Carey sampled the song "Here Comes That Feeling Again" for a song she recorded called "I Feel It" (co-produced by Mahogany) which was intended to be released on her album The Emancipation of Mimi, but was denied clearance for the use of the song by the songwriters (It was leaked out to the internet later, but still remains officially unreleased).
On (May 22, 2012), The Dynamic Superiors' Give And Take album was released on CD, not by Motown, but by Universal Records' "Soulmusic Records" imprint.http://www.amazon.com/Give-Take-Dynamic-Superiors/dp/B007NKLULS/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1378322977&sr=1-2&keywords=the+dynamic+superiorshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pve8rhZzjs0
