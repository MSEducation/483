The Punjabi community, which originated from Indian state of  Punjab and Pakistani province of  Punjab, were the first ethnic group from the South Asian diaspora to settle in America. Religiously, Sikhs of Punjab numbered as the first, with Punjabi Muslims, Punjabi Hindus, etc. being the religious organizations to come to America after the 1950s era.

==First Sikh immigrants==

Sikhs have been a part of the American populace for more than 130 years. At the turn of the 19th century, the state of Punjab of British India was hit hard by British practices of mercantilism. Many Sikhs emigrated to the United States, and began arriving to work on farms in California. They traveled via Hong Kong to Angel Island, California, the western counterpart to Ellis Island in New York.The Pioneers, America, "A historical perspective of Americans of Asian Indian origin 1790-1997" 31 October 2006
"Some Sikhs worked in lumber mills of Oregon or in railroad construction and for some Sikhs it was on a railway line, which allowed other Sikhs who were working as migrant laborers to come into the town on festival days".
Due to discrimination from Anglo Americans many early Punjabi immigrants in California married Mexican Americans, forming a sizable Punjabi Mexican American community. Punjabi farmers were also able to circumvent laws prohibiting their ownership of property by operating through American bankers.Bhatia, Sunil.

==Role in America==

Most Sikhs started life in America as farm laborers, with many eventually becoming landowners and successful farmers. In 1956, Dalip Singh Saund became the first East Indian-born person to be elected to the United States House of Representatives. At present Amarjit Singh Buttar is perhaps the only turbaned Sikh who holds elected public office. He was elected in December 2001 to the Vernon, Connecticut Board of Education for a four-year term. He has also been recently selected as the Chairman of the Board. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana is also of Punjabi descent.[tpl]cite new|accessdate=2008-10-14|author=Nossiter, Adam |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/22/america/22louisiana.php|title=In a Southern U.S. state, immigrants' son takes over |work=International Herald Tribune|date=October 22, 2007[/tpl]
Many Punjabi Americans have become successful in technology-related fields.
