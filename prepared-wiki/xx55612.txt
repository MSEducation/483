Years before his death, Appel established the Karel Appel Foundation, whose purpose is "to preserve Appel's artworks, to promote public awareness and knowledge of Karel Appel's oeuvre and to supervise publication of the Oeuvre Catalogue of the paintings, the works on paper and the sculptures.".Karel Appel Foundation website
In 2002 a number of Appel's works went missing on the way to his foundation, an event that was not to be resolved before his death. However in 2012 the works were found in a disused UK warehouse and returned to the foundation.
