</ref> A third category was added in 1912 when [[Vesto Slipher]] showed that the spectrum of the nebula that surrounded the star [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]] matched the spectra of the [[Pleiades]] [[open cluster]]. Thus the nebula radiates by reflected star light.<ref>

In about 1922, following the Great Debate, it had become clear that many "nebulae" were in fact galaxies far from our own.
Slipher and Edwin Hubble continued to collect the spectra from many diffuse nebulae, finding 29 that showed emission spectra and 33 had the continuous spectra of star light. In 1922, Hubble announced that nearly all nebulae are associated with stars, and their illumination comes from star light. He also discovered that the emission spectrum nebulae are nearly always associated with stars having spectral classifications of B1 or hotter (including all O-type main sequence stars), while nebulae with continuous spectra appear with cooler stars. Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell concluded that the nebulae surrounding the hotter stars are transformed in some manner.

==Formation==

Many nebulae or stars form from the gravitational collapse of gas in the interstellar medium or ISM. As the material collapses under its own weight, massive stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths. Examples of these types of nebulae are the Rosette Nebula and the Pelican Nebula.  The size of these nebulae, known as HII regions, varies depending on the size of the original cloud of gas. New stars are formed in the nebulae. The formed stars are sometimes known as a young, loose cluster. 
Some nebulae are formed as the result of supernova explosions, the death throes of massive, short-lived stars.  The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that it can produce.  One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula, in Taurus.  The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled SN 1054.  The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and is a neutron star.
Other nebulae may form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage of a low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to 8–10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres.  When a star has lost enough material, its temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation it emits can ionize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off.  The nebula is almost 97% hydrogen and 3% helium, plus trace amounts of other elements.

===Classical types===

Objects named nebulae belong to four major groups.  Before their nature was understood, galaxies ("spiral nebulae") and star clusters too distant to be resolved as stars were also classified as nebulae, but no longer are.
Not all  cloud-like structures are named nebulae; Herbig–Haro objects are an example.

===Diffuse nebulae===

Most nebulae can be described as diffuse nebulae, which means that they are extended and contain no well-defined boundaries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/diffuse.html|publisher=University of Illinois SEDS|title=The Messier Catalog: Diffuse Nebulae|accessdate=2007-06-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961225125109/http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/diffuse.html|archivedate=1996-12-25[/tpl]  In visible light these nebulae may be divided into emission and reflection nebulae. Emission nebulae emit spectral line radiation from ionized gas (mostly ionized hydrogen);[ref]
