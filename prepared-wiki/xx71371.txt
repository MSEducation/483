[[Eight-thousander]]

The eight-thousanders are the 14 independentIn making any "highest mountains" list, one needs to use a criterion to exclude subpeaks and only list independent mountains. There is no universally agreed-upon such criterion. However the (generally accepted) list of 14 eight-thousanders is obtained if one uses a topographic prominence cutoff of between 200 and 500 metres (610 and 1524 feet). Some eight-thousand metre subpeaks have been climbed as goals in themselves, for example Lhotse Middle, but this is quite rare. mountains on Earth that are more than [tpl]convert|8000|m|ft|0[/tpl] high above sea level. All eight-thousanders are located in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges in Asia.
The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie tried to climb Kashmir's Nanga Parbat (present-day Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan) in 1895. Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir and Goman Singh, were killed by an avalanche, and the attempt failed.
The first recorded successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, who reached the summit of Annapurna on June 3, 1950.
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was Reinhold Messner, who completed this task on October 16, 1986. A year later, in 1987, Jerzy Kukuczka became the second climber to accomplish this feat. Messner had summitted each of the 14 peaks without the aid of supplemental oxygen. This feat was not repeated until nine years later by Erhard Loretan in 1995. [tpl]As of|2011[/tpl], a total of 26 people have summitted all 14 peaks undisputed. This is an extremely hazardous feat; at least four people have died while in pursuit of this goal. Phurba Tashi of Nepal has completed the most climbs of the eight-thousanders, with 30 ascents between 1998 and 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=20198|title=Preliminary stats: Himalaya and Everest 2011 spring review|publisher=ExplorersWeb|date=June 8, 2013|subscription=yes|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Juanito Oiarzabal has completed the second most, with a total of 25 times between 1985 and 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/en/news-mainmenu-176/1-latest/283-lhotse-summits.html|title=Lhotse Summits|publisher=8000ers.com|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]
The countries with the highest number of climbers that have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders are Italy and South Korea, with five climbers each, followed by Spain, with four climbers.  Kazakhstan, Poland have three climbers each that completed the "Crown of the Himalaya". The first woman who claimed to have summited all 14 eight-thousanders was Oh Eun-Sun of South Korea, stating she completed the set by summiting Annapurna on April 27, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=19294|title=Oh Eun-Sun summits Annapurna - becomes the first woman 14x8000er summiteer!|publisher=ExplorersWeb|date=April 27, 2010|subscription=yes|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Doubts about this claim have been raised by several parties and an inquiry by the Korean Alpine Federation (KAF) declared her summit claim for Kangchenjunga 2009 "unlikely". Their doubts add to those previously brought forward by rival Edurne Pasaban, which moved Himalayan chronicler Elizabeth Hawley in the spring of 2010 to tag the summit as "disputed".[tpl]cite web|url=http://explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=19623|title=Korean Alpine Federation questions Miss Oh's Kangchenjunga 2009 summit|publisher=ExplorersWeb|date=August 30, 2010|subscription=yes|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl] Later in 2010, Edurne Pasaban was declared the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?id=19771|title=Oh Eun-Sun report, final: Edurne Pasaban takes the throne|publisher=ExplorersWeb|date=December 10, 2010|subscription=yes|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]
