==Pebbitone and TLC (group)==

On February 28, 1991, Watkins and Lisa Lopes signed production, management, and publishing deals with PebbitoneTionne WATKINS (T’Boz), Lisa Lopes (Left Eye), Rozonda Thomas (Chilli), Debtors. v. LaFace Records, Pebbitone, Inc., Peri Reid d/b/a Pebbitone Music, Movants (In re Watkins), 390 210 BR 394 (Bankr. Court, ND Georgia, 1997) (Cotten, S.)Retrieved 11-02-2013. with Perri Reid becoming their general manager. The group found its missing third member in Rozonda Thomas.  The girls were signed to LaFace in May 1991 through a production deal with Pebbitone and immediately went into the studio with producers Reid and Edmonds, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Marl to produce their first album. 
The first TLC album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip, was released on February 25, 1992, by LaFace.  The album was a critical and commercial success, being certified quadruple-platinum within a year and launching a number of US Hot 100 top-ten singles with "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", "What About Your Friends", and "Baby-Baby-Baby" which reached No. 2on the Hot 100.

However, in the midst of their apparent success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995 . 
Eventually, tensions arose between Pebbles and TLC, and the group filed for bankruptcy amid claims that Pebbles was mismanaging their money[tpl]cite web|last=Tannenbaum|first=Rob|title=L.A. Comes to New York|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/4318/index2.html|work=New York|accessdate=2011-07-07[/tpl]. Pebbles denied these claims. TLC declared debts totaling $3.5 million, much of it because of Lopes' insurance payments arising from the Andre Rison arson incident and Watkins' sickle cell anemia medical bills.  The primary reason being that each member of the group was taking home less than $35,000 a year after paying managers, producers, expenses, and taxes. They sought to renegotiate their 1991 contract with LaFace, under which they only received a maximum of eight percent of the revenues from their album sales http://www.meiea.org/Journal/html_ver/Vol01_No01/Vol_1_No_1_A6.html A recent case underscores the substantial impact a bankruptcy petition can have on the artist and record company. In Re Watkins, Lopes and Thomas, 210 B.R. 394 (1997). The musical recording group, TLC, consists of three female artists who signed with an Atlanta-based record company, LaFace Records. The group achieved multi-platinum sales after some half-dozen radio singles, but found themselves in financial distress and filed bankruptcy asking the court to terminate their record contract. TLC’s contract provided for a relatively low royalty rate of seven percent escalating to nine percent by the eighth album, considerably less than most major recording contracts. LaFace Records argued that because other labels dominate the record distribution channels, independent labels like LaFace are forced to offer lower royalty rates. Most record companies had developed a pattern of re-negotiating recording contracts when the artist achieved significant record sales, but LaFace Records refused to meet the demands of TLC, thus prompting the filing of the bankruptcy petition. LaFace Records argued against terminating the record contract because it claimed there were sufficient royalties in the pipeline to pay the debts of TLC, but that the members of TLC refused to accept advances against those pipeline royalties. The Bankruptcy Court refused to dismiss the case and found the filing to be proper rejecting the argument put forth by LaFace that the bankruptcy filing constituted “bad faith” because TLC wanted to void their record contract. Before, however, the Judge ruled on the request to terminate the record contract, TLC and LaFace reached an agreement which in essence provided for all of the group’s debts to be paid, a significant payment made to the artist and an increase in the royalty terms of their record contract., and to dissolve their association with Pebbitone. Both Pebbitone and LaFace countered that TLC simply wanted more money and were in no real financial danger, resulting in two years of legal debates before the cases were finally settled in late 1996. TLC's contract was renegotiated, their production deal with Pebbitone/Perri Reid (who had separated from her husband by this time[tpl]cite magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fjkDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&q=37%20-page&f=false|title=Singer Pebbles Talks About Breakups With Husband L.A. Reid And Group TLC|work=Jet|page=37|date= 23 Oct 1995|volume=88|number=24|ISSN=0021-5996[/tpl]) was rescinded.
L.A. Reid later said: "TLC wanted Pebbitone out of their lives, and the only way they could get out was to file bankruptcy". Reid claimed that the dispute was "one of the breaking points in my marriage".  The dispute with TLC and the disintegration of her marriage led Pebbles to leave the secular music industry altogether.
