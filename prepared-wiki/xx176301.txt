Explorers of the Human Body (Hangul: 인체탐험대; Hanja: 人體探險隊) was one of the three shows of the newly revamped Good Sunday, a lineup of variety shows that airs every Sunday evening at 5:30 pm KST on SBS. The show's aim was to answer curious questions about the human body, where the Super Junior members perform the answers by doing experiments with their own bodies.[tpl]ko icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=106&oid=001&aid=0001804250|title=SBS '일요일이 좋다', 11일 야심 찬 변신|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Naver News|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] The show succeeded in attracting a wide audience due to its comedic and educational content.

==Background==

After previous popular shows X-Man and Reverse Drama ended, SBS's Good Sunday decided to air a new educational program, introducing the audience to the human body. Shin Dong-yup was chosen to be the lead MC, with the Super Junior members being regulars and co-MCs of the program. Ratings for the show became the highest of all three shows that aired in SBS's new Good Sunday lineup as the show is educational and entertaining to watch. It was also the first and currently the only variety show that included every member of Super Junior as regulars.   
Each episode has a main topic to explore regarding the human body. In the first episode, which involved the tongue and blindness, the Super Junior members taste very hot peppers and extremely bitter-tasting drinks to test the mysteries of the tongue. The Super Junior members also test the blindness of their eyes by doing eye-fooling tests. Many episodes do not simply involve the physical features of the body. Episode six revolves around balance and episode eight deals with crying and tears.
