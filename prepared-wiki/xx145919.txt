The April Lyrids (LYR, IAU shower number 6 [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astro.amu.edu.pl/~jopek/MDC2007/index.php |title=IAU Meteor Data Center|page=1|accessdate=2013-08-06[/tpl]) are a meteor shower lasting from April 16 to April 26[tpl]cite web|url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/lyrids.html |title=Lyrids|publisher=Meteor Showers Online|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl] each year. The radiant of the meteor shower is located in the constellation Lyra, near this constellation's brightest star, Alpha Lyrae (proper name Vega).  Their peak is typically around April 22 each year.
The source of the meteor shower is particles of dust shed by the long-period Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher.[tpl]cite journal | last=Jenniskens | first = P. | title=Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2006 | pages=790[/tpl] The April Lyrids are the strongest annual shower of meteors from debris of a long-period comet, mainly because as far as other intermediate long-period comets go (200 - 10,000 years), this one has a relatively short orbital period of about 415 years. The Lyrids have been observed for the past 2600 years.
The shower usually peaks on around April 22 and the morning of April 23. Counts typically range from 5 to 20 meteors per hour, averaging around ten. As a result of light pollution, observers in rural areas will see more than observers in a city. Nights without a moon in the sky will reveal the most meteors. April Lyrid meteors are usually around magnitude +2. However, some meteors can be brighter, known as "Lyrid fireballs", cast shadows for a split second and leave behind smokey debris trails that last minutes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/lyrids/lyrids.html|title=the Lyrid meteor shower|year=2008|publisher=spaceweather.com|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05[/tpl]
Occasionally, the shower intensifies when the planets steer the one-revolution dust trail of the comet into Earth's path, an event that happens about once every 60 years.  This results in an April Lyrid meteor outburst. The one-revolution dust trail is dust that has completed one orbit: the stream of dust released in the return of the comet prior to the current 1862 return.This mechanism replaces earlier ideas that the outbursts were due to a cloud of dust moving in a 60-year orbit.[ref]
