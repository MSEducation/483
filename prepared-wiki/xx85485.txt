===The Jogeshwari Caves===

The Jogeshwari caves are located in the eastern part of Jogeshwari. Dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, the caves are estimated to be 1,500 years old and are some of the oldest cave temples in Mumbai. They are thought to be the work of Buddhist monks and Hindu priests, and they contain ornate sculptures. The size of the cave complex rivals several UNESCO World Heritage sites nearby, such as the cave temples of Ajanta, Elephanta, and Ellora. The Jogeshwari caves are currently in a very poor condition as they are used for drying clothes and as toilets by the surrounding slum population.[tpl]cite web|last=Patel|first=Samir|title=The Slum and the Sacred Cave|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/eesj/gradpubs/GeneralMags/Patel_Archaeology_SlumandSacredCave_0607.pdf|work=Archaeology May/June 2007|accessdate=26 June 2013[/tpl]
