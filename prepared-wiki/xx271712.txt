Maxim Pavlovich Kovtun ([tpl]lang-ru|Максим Павлович Ковтун[/tpl]; born 18 June 1995) is a Russian figure skater. He is a silver medalist at two Grand Prix events (2013 Cup of China, Rostelecom Cup), the 2012 JGP Final champion, and the 2014 Russian national champion. 

==Career==

Taken to the ice rink by his father, Kovtun began skating at age four in Yekaterinburg and was coached mainly by Maria Voitsekhovskaia in his early years. He also trained in ice hockey but chose skating at age ten. 

===Junior===

In the spring of 2011, Kovtun began training with Nikolai Morozov. He debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix circuit in the 2011–12 season, winning gold at his first event in Romania and silver in Estonia. He qualified for the 2011–12 Junior Grand Prix Final where he finished 4th. At the 2012 Russian Championships, Kovtun finished 12th on the senior level and won the bronze medal on the junior level. He was assigned to the 2012 World Team Trophy—his first senior international event—following Sergei Voronov's withdrawal due to injury. He finished 12th at the event.
In the summer of 2012, Kovtun switched coaches to Elena Buianova (Vodorezova). He began the 2012–13 season by winning a pair of gold medals at JGP events in Croatia and Germany. In Croatia, he scored a personal best 80.00 points in free skating TES. Kovtun qualified for the JGP Final in Sochi, Russia, where he won gold by 11 points over silver medalist Joshua Farris. At the event, he scored 149.78 points for his free skate which included a 4T-3T, 3A-3T and 3A.

===Senior===

Kovtun said he would try two quads in his free program at the 2013 Russian Championships. Although he finished 5th on the senior level, he was named in the Russian team to the 2013 European Championships because Russian regulations guaranteed berths only to the top two finishers while a committee had the right to choose the third entry. In his European debut, Kovtun placed 7th in the short program, 4th in the free skate, and 5th overall with a total score of 226.57 points. In the free skate, his fourth combination (3S-2T) was deemed invalid. Kovtun finished 17th in his first World Championships, held in London, Ontario, Canada. He was 8th in the men's event at the 2013 World Team Trophy and Team Russia finished 4th.
In the 2013–14 season, Kovtun made his senior Grand Prix debut at the 2013 Cup of China. He placed second in the short—landing a 4S-3T, 4T and 3A—and first in the free skate, in which he landed a 4S, 4S-2T, 3A-2T and 3A. Kovtun won the silver medal overall behind China's Han Yan. He won another silver medal at the 2013 Rostelecom Cup. The results qualified him to his first senior Grand Prix Final. He finished fifth at the event in Fukuoka, Japan. 
At the 2014 Russian Championships, Kovtun placed second in the short program and first in the free skate. He was awarded the gold medal ahead of three-time Olympic medalist Evgeni Plushenko. After Kovtun again placed fifth at the European Championships, Russia's sole spot in the men's event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was assigned to Plushenko. Kovtun was sent to the 2014 World Championships in Saitama, Japan. He placed seventh in the short program, fifth in the free skate, and finished fourth overall behind Spain's Javier Fernández.
