CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases, Eczema

Dermatitis (from Greek δέρμα derma "skin" and -ῖτις -itis "inflammation") or eczema ([tpl]lang-el|ἔκζεμα[/tpl] ekzema "eruption") is inflammation of the skin. It is characterized by itchy, erythematous, vesicular, weeping, and crusting patches. The term eczema is also commonly used to describe atopic dermatitis[tpl]cite web|title=Eczema|url=http://www.acpmedicine.com/acpmedicine/institutional/bestRxDx.action;jsessionid=D1F3669B916671AA91F32934D21DC08A?bookId=ACP&chapId=part02_ch04&readerFlag=|publisher=ACP medicine|accessdate=9 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Bershad|first=SV|title=In the clinic.

In some languages, dermatitis and eczema are synonyms, while in other languages dermatitis implies an acute condition and eczema a chronic one.[tpl]cite book| first1= Johannes |last1= Ring| first2= Bernhard |last2= Przybilla| first3= Thomas | last3= Ruzicka| title=Handbook of atopic eczema| url= http://books.google.com/?id=jTktMX60bPwC&pg=PA4| year= 2006| publisher=Birkhäuser| isbn=978-3-540-23133-2| page= 4 | accessdate=4 May 2010 [/tpl]
The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions. These include dryness and recurring skin rashes that are characterized by one or more of these symptoms: redness, skin swelling, itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding. Areas of temporary skin discoloration may appear and are sometimes due to healed injuries. Scratching open a healing lesion may result in scarring and may enlarge the rash.
Treatment is typically with moisturizers and steroid creams. If these are not effective, creams based on calcineurin inhibitors may be used.

==Classification==

The term "eczema" refers to a set of clinical characteristics. Classification of the underlying diseases has been haphazard and unsystematic, with many synonyms used to describe the same condition. A type of eczema may be described by location (e.g., hand eczema), by specific appearance (eczema craquele or discoid), or by possible cause (varicose eczema). Further adding to the confusion, many sources use the term eczema for the most common type of eczema (atopic dermatitis) interchangeably.
The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) published a position paper in 2001, which simplifies the nomenclature of allergy-related diseases including atopic and allergic contact eczemas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johansson SG, Hourihane JO, Bousquet J, et al. |title=A revised nomenclature for allergy. An EAACI position statement from the EAACI nomenclature task force |journal=Allergy |volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=813–24 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11551246 |doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2001.t01-1-00001.x [/tpl] Non-allergic eczemas are not affected by this proposal.

===Terminology===

There are several different types of dermatitis. The different kinds usually have in common an allergic reaction to specific allergens. The term may describe eczema, which is also called dermatitis eczema and eczematous dermatitis.  An eczema diagnosis often implies atopic dermatitis (which is very common in children and teenagers) but, without proper context, may refer to any kind of dermatitis.ICD 10: Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00-L99) – Dermatitis and eczema (L20-L30)
In some languages, dermatitis and eczema are synonyms, while in other languages dermatitis implies an acute condition and eczema a chronic one.[tpl]cite book| first1= Johannes |last1= Ring| first2= Bernhard |last2= Przybilla| first3= Thomas | last3= Ruzicka| title=Handbook of atopic eczema| url=http://books.google.com/?id=jTktMX60bPwC&pg=PA4| year= 2006| publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-540-23133-2| page= 4 | accessdate=4 May 2010 [/tpl] The two conditions are often classified together.

==Signs and symptoms==

Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. They range from skin rashes to bumpy rashes or including blisters. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin, swelling, itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis, whether on the neck, wrist, forearm, thigh or ankle. Although the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the genital area, such as the vulva or scrotum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neurodermatitis/ds00712/dsection=symptoms|title=Neurodermatitis|accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] Symptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.
Although the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin. Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands.
Dermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching, stinging and a burning sensation. Papules and vesicles are commonly present. The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in size, red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back, buttocks, elbows, knees, neck, shoulders, and scalp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dermatitispictures.net/|title=Contact Dermatitis Pictures|accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] Less frequently, the rash may appear inside the mouth or near the hairline.
The symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis on the other hand, tend to appear gradually, from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp (dandruff) to hair loss. In severe cases, pimples may appear along the hairline, behind the ears, on the eyebrows, on the bridge of the nose, around the nose, on the chest, and on the upper back.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/skin_disorders/itching_and_noninfectious_rashes/dermatitis.html|title=Dermatitis|accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] In newborns, the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash, often accompanied by a diaper rash.
Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dermatitis-eczema/DS00339/DSECTION=symptoms|title=Symptoms|accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl]

==Cause==

The cause of eczema is unknown but is presumed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[tpl]cite web|title=Atopic dermatitis|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Atopic_Dermatitis/default.asp|work=National Institute of Health|accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl]

===Environmental===

The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the cause of asthma, eczema, and other allergic diseases is an unusually clean environment. It is supported by epidemiologic studies for asthma.[tpl]cite journal | last=Bufford | first=JD | coauthors=Gern JE | title=The hygiene hypothesis revisited | journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=247–262 |date=May 2005 | pmid=15878454 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 [/tpl] The hypothesis states that exposure to bacteria and other immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases risk for asthma and allergy.
While it has been suggested that eczema may sometimes be an allergic reaction to the excrement from house dust mites,[tpl]cite journal |author=Carswell F, Thompson S |title=Does natural sensitisation in eczema occur through the skin? |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8497 |pages=13–5 |year=1986 |pmid=2873316 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)92560-2[/tpl] with up to 5% of people showing antibodies to the mites,[tpl]cite journal |author=Henszel Ł, Kuźna-Grygiel W |title=dust mites in the etiology of allergic diseases |language=Polish |journal=Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17633128[/tpl] the overall role this plays awaits further corroboration.[tpl]eMedicine|Derm|38|Atopic Dermatitis[/tpl]

===Genetic===

A number of genes have been associated with eczema, one of which is filaggrin. Genome-wide studies found three new genetic variants associated with eczema: OVOL1, ACTL9 and IL4-KIF3A.[tpl]cite journal |author=Paternoster et al. |year=2011 |title=Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies three new risk loci for atopic dermatitis|journal=Nature Genetics |doi=10.1038/ng.1017 |first2=Marie |first3=Chih-Mei |first4=Adaikalavan |first5=Klaus |first6=Liesbeth |first7=Manuel A |first8=Alexessander Couto |first9=Jacob P |first10=Eva |first11=Hansjörg |first12=Bjarke |first13=Patrick M A |first14=Pirro |first15=Nicole M |first16=Ivan |first17=Ronny |first18=John A |first19=Maria M |first20=Marjan |first21=Annika |first22=Andre |first23=David |first24=Regina |first25=Emmanouil |first26=Stephen B |first27=Holger |first28=Katharina |first29=Anna-Liisa |first30=Anneli |displayauthors=30 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=187–92 |pmid=22197932 |pmc=3272375[/tpl]
Eczema occurs about three times more frequently in celiac disease and about two times more frequently in relatives of those with celiac disease, potentially indicating a genetic link between the two conditions.[tpl]cite journal|title=Celiac Disease and Dermatologic Manifestations: Many Skin Clue to Unfold Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy|first1=M|last1=Caproni|first2=V|last2=Bonciolini|first3=A|last3=d'Errico|first4=E|last4=Antiga|first5=P|last5=Fabbri|journal=Gastroenterol.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of eczema is based mostly on the history and physical examination. However, in uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be useful.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies.[tpl]cite journal|author=Atkins D |title=Food allergy: diagnosis and management |journal=Primary Care|volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=119–40, vii |date=March 2008 |pmid=18206721|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2007.09.003[/tpl]

Fisher |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-21[/tpl]

==Prevention==

There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy, the formula used, or breastfeeding changes the risk. There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kalliomäki|first=M|coauthors=Antoine, JM; Herz, U; Rijkers, GT; Wells, JM; Mercenier, A|title=Guidance for substantiating the evidence for beneficial effects of probiotics: prevention and management of allergic diseases by probiotics|journal=The Journal of nutrition|date=Mar 2010|volume=140|issue=3|pages=713S–21S|pmid=20130079|doi=10.3945/jn.109.113761[/tpl]

==Management==

There is no known cure for eczema; with treatment aiming to control symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching.

===Lifestyle===

Bathing once or more a day is recommended. It is a misconception that bathing dries the skin in people with eczema.[tpl]cite web|title=Daily Skin Care Essential to Control Atopic Dermatitis article at American Academy of Dermatology's EczemaNet website|url=http://www.skincarephysicians.com/eczemanet/daily_care.html|accessdate=2009-03-24[/tpl] It is not clear whether dust mite reduction help with eczema.
There has not been adequate evaluation of changing the diet to reduce eczema.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bath-Hextall|first=F|coauthors=Delamere, FM; Williams, HC|title=Dietary exclusions for established atopic eczema|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Jan 23, 2008|issue=1|pages=CD005203|pmid=18254073|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013319/|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005203.pub2|editor1-last=Bath-Hextall|editor1-first=Fiona J[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care|title=Eczema: Can eliminating particular foods help?|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0005096/|work=Informed Health Online|publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care|accessdate=24 June 2013[/tpl] There is some evidence that infants with an established egg allergy may have a reduction in symptoms if eggs are eliminated from their diets. Benefits have not been shown for other elimination diets. Establishing that there is a food allergy before dietary change could avoid unnecessary lifestyle changes.
People can also wear clothing designed to manage the itching, scratching and peeling.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ricci G, Patrizi A, Bellini F, Medri M |title=Use of textiles in atopic dermatitis: care of atopic dermatitis |journal=Current Problems in Dermatology |volume=33|issue= |pages=127–43 |year=2006 |pmid=16766885 |doi=10.1159/000093940 |series=Current Problems in Dermatology |isbn=3-8055-8121-1[/tpl] Soaps and detergents should not be used on affected skin because they can strip natural skin oils and lead to excessive dryness.

===Moisturizers===

Moisturizing (also known as emollients) are recommended at least once or twice a day. Oilier formulations appear to be better and water based formulations are not recommended. It is unclear if moisturizers that contain ceramides are more or less effective than others.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jungersted|first=JM|coauthors=Agner, T|title=Eczema and ceramides: an update|journal=Contact dermatitis|date=Aug 2013|volume=69|issue=2|pages=65–71|pmid=23869725|doi=10.1111/cod.12073[/tpl] Products that contain dyes, perfumes, or peanuts should not be used. Occlusive dressings at night may be useful.

===Medications===

There is little evidence for antihistamine and they are thus not generally recommended. Sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, may be tried in those who are unable to sleep due to eczema.

====Corticosteroids====

If symptoms are well controlled with moisturizers, steroids may only be required when flares occur. Corticosteroids are effective in controlling and suppressing symptoms in most cases.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hoare C, Li Wan Po A, Williams H |title=Systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema |journal=Health Technology Assessment |volume=4 |issue=37 |pages=1–191 |year=2000 |pmid=11134919 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/execsumm/summ437.htm[/tpl] Once daily use is generally enough. For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.
Long term use of topical steroids may result in skin atrophy, stria or telangiectasia. Their use on delicate skin (face or groin) is therefore typically with caution. They are, however, generally well tolerated.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bewley A |title=Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids |journal=The British Journal of Dermatology |volume=158 |issue=5 |pages=917–20 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18294314 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08479.x |last2=Dermatology Working |first2=Group[/tpl]

====Immunosuppressants====

Topical immunosuppressants like pimecrolimus and tacrolimus may be better in the short term and appear equal to steroids after a year of use.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shams|first=K|coauthors=Grindlay, DJ; Williams, HC|title=What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2009–2010|journal=Clinical and experimental dermatology|date=Aug 2011|volume=36|issue=6|pages=573–7; quiz 577–8|pmid=21718344|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2011.04078.x[/tpl] Their use is reasonable in those who do not respond to or are not tolerant of steroids. Treatments are typically recommended for short or fixed periods of time rather than indefinitely. Pimecrolimus appears to be better than tacrolimus.[tpl]cite journal|last=Torley|first=D|coauthors=Futamura, M; Williams, HC; Thomas, KS|title=What's new in atopic eczema?

When eczema is severe and does not respond to other forms of treatment, systemic immunosuppressants are sometimes used. Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are ciclosporin, azathioprine and methotrexate.

===Light therapy===

Light therapy using ultraviolet light has tentative support but the quality of the evidence is not very good.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gambichler|first=T|title=Management of atopic dermatitis using photo(chemo)therapy|journal=Archives of dermatological research|date=Mar 2009|volume=301|issue=3|pages=197–203|pmid=19142651|doi=10.1007/s00403-008-0923-5[/tpl] A number of different types of light may be used including UVA and UVB.[tpl]cite journal|last=Meduri|first=NB|coauthors=Vandergriff, T; Rasmussen, H; Jacobe, H|title=Phototherapy in the management of atopic dermatitis: a systematic review|journal=Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine|date=Aug 2007|volume=23|issue=4|pages=106–12|pmid=17598862|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0781.2007.00291.x[/tpl] Overexposure to ultraviolet light carries its own risks, particularly that of skin cancer.[tpl]cite news |author=Stöppler MC |title=Psoriasis PUVA Treatment Can Increase Melanoma Risk |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=548 |date=31 May 2007 |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=2007-10-17[/tpl]

==Prognosis==

Most cases are well managed with topical treatments and ultraviolet light. About 2% of cases however are not. In more than 60% the condition goes away by adolescence.

Globally eczema affected approximately 230 million people as of 2010 (3.5% of the population).[tpl]cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2|first2=Abraham D|first3=Mohsen|first4=Rafael|first5=Catherine|first6=Majid|first7=Kenji|first8=Joshua A|first9=Safa|first10=Victor|first11=Jerry|first12=Ilana|first13=Rakesh|first14=Stephanie Y|first15=Mohammed K|first16=Mohammad A|first17=Miriam|first18=H Ross|first19=Laurie M|first20=Kathryn G|first21=Charles|first22=Larry M|first23=Adil N|first24=Suzanne|first25=Lope H|first26=David H|first27=Maria-Gloria|first28=Amanda|first29=Michelle L|first30=Emelia J|displayauthors=30[/tpl] The lifetime clinician-recorded prevalence of eczema has been seen to peak in infancy, with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the reproductive period of 15–49 years.[tpl]cite journal |author=Osman M, Hansell AL, Simpson CR, Hollowell J, Helms PJ |title=Gender-specific presentations for asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema in primary care |journal=Primary Care Respiratory Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=28–35 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17297524 |doi=10.3132/pcrj.2007.00006[/tpl] In the UK about 20% of children have the condition, while in the United States about 10% are affected.[tpl]cite journal|last=McAleer|first=MA|coauthors=Flohr, C; Irvine, AD|title=Management of difficult and severe eczema in childhood|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jul 23, 2012|volume=345|pages=e4770|pmid=22826585|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4770[/tpl]
Although little data on the rates of eczema over time exists prior to the Second World War (1939–45), the rate of eczema has been found to have increased substantially in the latter half of the 20th Century, with eczema in school-aged children being found to increase between the late 1940s and 2000.[tpl]cite journal |author=Taylor B, Wadsworth J, Wadsworth M, Peckham C |title=Changes in the reported prevalence of childhood eczema since the 1939–45 war |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8414 |pages=1255–7 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6150286 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)92805-8[/tpl] In the developed world there has been rise in the rate of eczema over time.
Dermatitis affected about 10% of U.S. workers in 2010, representing over 15 million workers with dermatitis. Prevalence rates were higher among females than among males, and among those with some college education or a college degree compared to those with a high school diploma or less. Workers employed in healthcare and social assistance industries and life, physical, and social science occupations had the highest rates of reported dermatitis. About 6% of dermatitis cases among U.S. workers were attributed to work by a healthcare professional, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related dermatitis among workers was at least 0.6%.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Luckhaupt|first1= SE|last2=Dahlhamer|first2= JM|last3= Ward|first3= BW|last4= Sussell| first4=AL|last5= Sweeney|first5=MH |last6=Sestito|first6=JP| last7=Calvert|first7= GM|title= Prevalence of dermatitis in the working population, United States, 2010 National Health Interview Survey|journal= Am J Ind Med|volume=56|issue=6|pages=625–634|date=June 2013 |pmid=22674651|doi=10.1002/ajim.22080[/tpl]

==History==

The term "atopic dermatitis" was coined in 1933 by Wise and Sulzberger.[tpl]cite book|title=Textbook of Atopic Dermatitis|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780203091449|page=1|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=xxDHpPGHFvAC&printsec=frontcover|date=2008-05-01[/tpl] Sulfur as a topical treatment for eczema was fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

==Society and culture==

The terms "hypoallergenic" and "doctor tested" are not regulated,[tpl]cite journal |author=Murphy LA, White IR, Rastogi SC |title=Is hypoallergenic a credible term? |journal=Clinical and Experimental Dermatology |volume=29|issue=3 |pages=325–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15115531 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2004.01521.x[/tpl] and no research has been done showing that products labeled "hypoallergenic" are in fact less problematic than any others.
