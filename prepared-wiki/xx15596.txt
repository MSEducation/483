CATEGORIES: Decorative knots, Heraldic charges

The Savoy knot, a type of decorative knot, is a heraldic knot used primarily in Italian heraldry. It is most notable for its appearance on the heraldic badge of the House of Savoy, where it is accompanied by the motto Stringe ma non costringe, "It tightens, but does not constrain".[tpl]cite book |title= Knots, Ties and Splices: A Handbook for Seafarers, Travellers and All Who Use Cordage, with Historical, Heraldic and Practical Notes|last= Burgess|first= Joseph Tom|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1884|publisher= G.

When used outside of heraldry (as a real knot), it is known as a figure-eight knot.
The Savoy knot can also be seen on the Alfa Romeo automobile badge (founded and manufactured in Milan, Italy) up to 1943.See the historical brands in Storia del logo (it)
