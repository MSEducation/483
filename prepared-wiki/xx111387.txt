==Career==

Parker is one of the few Americans to win both the French Championships (1948, 1949) and the U.S. Championships (1944, 1945).[tpl]efn|name=double|Other American players who have won singles titles at both the French and US Championshipba are Don Budge (1937), Don McNeill (1939-1940), Tony Trabert (1953-1954) and Andre Agassi (1994, 1999).[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Frank Parker Wins National Tennis Title|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ae8ZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4000%2C1414706|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=Sep 5, 1944[/tpl]
Parker became the singles champion at Cincinnati, then called the Tri–State Tennis Tournament in 1941 and was a four-time singles finalist (1932, 1933, 1938, 1939). He won the Canadian title in 1938. He was ranked World No. 1 in 1948 by John Olliff of The Daily Telegraph.
Writing about Parker in his 1949 autobiography, Bobby Riggs, who had played Parker many times, says "Parker is a tough man to get past. Equipped with a wonderful all-court game, he plays intently and with classic form.  His footwork is marvelous.  You never see Frankie hitting the ball from an awkward position." Tennis Is My Racket, by Bobby Riggs, New York, 1949, page 58.  Jack Kramer, however, writing in his own autobiography, says "...even as a boy Parker had this wonderful slightly overspin forehand drive. Clean and hard. Then for some reason, Frankie's coach, Mercer Beasley, decided to change this stroke into a chop.  It was obscene."  It also impaired his game, particularly in preventing him from getting to the net, and Parker dropped in the rankings. A few years later, however, he worked hard to regain his original forehand and, according to Kramer, did indeed greatly improve his stroke. But it was never again as good as it had once been.The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis (1979), Jack Kramer with Frank Deford, page 48
