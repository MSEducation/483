Menlough ([tpl]Irish place name|Mionlach[/tpl]) is a village in northeast County Galway in Ireland. Located 35 km from Galway, 27 km from Tuam, 30 km from Ballinasloe, and 20 km from Athenry, it forms part of the civil parish of Killascobe.  

==Irish language==

There are 4,651 people living in the Menlough ED and 10% (465) are Irish speakers.

==Historical background==

Historically, Menlough was in the Barony of Hymany which was a stronghold of the O'Mannion clan. The ruins of an O'Mannion castle are located in the fields behind the grotto in the centre of the village. Another O'Mannion castle in the parish is better known as there are more extensive ruins. This second ruin is known as Garbally castle. It is visible to travellers from Galway to Menlough as they pass through Skehana (half parish of Menlough). Other notable historical monuments include the old IRA monument, erected in the 90s in the centre of the village. It can be seen opposite Jordan's shop (formally McLoughlins) on Menlough Road. The photo shows the ruins of Menlough Castle located on the river Corrib.  It was owned by the Blakes of Menlough until the early 20th century.[tpl]cite web|last=Landed Estates Database|title=Family: Blake (Menlo)|url=http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/property-show.jsp?id=683|work=NUI Galway|accessdate=3 November 2013[/tpl] 
During the Irish War of Independence, a local landlord and large landholder Joyce was shot dead in the parish of Menlough as he walked to Mass. No one was ever apprehended for the crime and the incident forms part of parish folklore. The irony was that the landlord Joyce considered himself more Irish than anyone and was a supporter of the cause and the whole Joyce clan had a history of helping the locals stretching back to before the famine. The ruins of Joyce's house are still visible in the townland of Corgary as are the fine walls built to protect his lands.

==Recent developments==

A parish with little visible change for many decades has been transformed in the last decade. A large number of new houses built all over the parish are a testament to the growing popularity of this rural location. 
There is an expanding commuter population living here as is evidenced by a constant stream of commuters passing through this parish in the mornings and evenings.  There are four pubs in the parish; two are located in Menlough village, one in the townland of Guilka and one in Skehana. There are also several shops and small supermarkets. 

==Educational resources==

The parish has two National schools. The National schools are in Menlough village and at Garbally (next to the Castle). There were formerly four national schools, but Ballinruane closed in controversial circumstances in the early 2000s. This was one of the few times the parish made national headlines. Corgary also closed during Summer 2013. Students in Corgary have moved to other schools, including Menlough and Garbally.

==Sport==

This is the only incident to compete with the Joyce incident for notoriety in parish folklore. Those events led to the foundation of the successful but now nostalgically defunct Doonwood Hammers soccer team. The parish eventually drifted back to its Gaelic football roots after serving out its ban.
Hurling is popular in the half parish of Skehana. The Skehana hurling team continue to go from strength to strength and the fearsome phrase Up Skehana well known around Galway has its origins here.
