According to Lavasoft, Ad-Aware detects spyware, computer viruses, dialers, Trojans, bots, rootkits, data miners,[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] aggressive advertising, parasites, browser hijackers, and tracking components.http://www.lavasoft.com/support/supportcenter/manuals/ad_aware/ad_aware_manual.pdf

==History==

Ad-Aware was originally developed in 1999 to highlight web beacons inside of Internet Explorer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] On many websites, users would see a tiny pixelated square next to each web beacon, warning the user that the computer's IP address and other non-essential information was being tracked by this website. Over time, Ad-Aware added the ability to block those beacons, or ads. Ad-Aware no longer makes the user aware of the ads on the screen, instead the program fights spyware, adware, viruses and other malware.[tpl]cite web|title=Ad-Aware 10 Early Preview|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/company/blog/adaware-10-early-preview|publisher=LavaSoft|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]
In the 2008 Edition, Lavasoft bundled Ad-Aware Pro and Plus for the first time with an antivirus scanner,[tpl]cite web|last=Hopkins |first=John A |url=http://download.cnet.com/Ad-Aware-2008/3000-8022_4-10844457.html |title=Ad-Aware 2008 7.1.0.8 - Free software downloads and software reviews - CNET Download.com |publisher=Download.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09[/tpl] which uses the Avira engine[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/computing/smb-security/reviews/26025.aspx?p=3 |title=Page 3 - Ad-Aware Pro Anniversary Edition Review: Computer Security Articles at |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-09[/tpl]

==Overview==

[tpl]as of | 2013[/tpl], Lavasoft makes Ad-Aware version 10 available in three core versions:
Two other versions are also available:http://lavasoft.com/free_download/trial/
Latest Ad-Aware products have been completely revamped to the point where it has almost nothing in common with its predecessors except the core functionalities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://technojourney.com/freebies/free-ad-aware-pro-security-10-download-with-serial-key-giveaway/ |title=Ad-Aware Seucrity Pro 10 Review |publisher=Technojourney |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13[/tpl]
Lavasoft also offers volume licenses of Ad-Aware for businesses,[tpl]cite web|url=http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_business_edition.php |title=Lavasoft Business Friendly |publisher=Lavasoft |date= |accessdate=1 April 2012| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101101150131/http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_business_edition.php| archivedate= 1 November 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] which is designed for use over networks. It has a central server console interface with licences for installing Ad-Aware Pro Security on the networked machines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/support/faqs/what-is-adaware-business-edition |title=What is Ad-Aware Business Edition? |publisher=Lavasoft |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09[/tpl]
Each version includes anti-spyware, antivirus, and anti-rootkit protection, as well as integrated protection against real-time threats. According to Lavasoft, Ad-Aware allows computer users to combat malicious spyware, viruses, and malware; it protects users from malware that takes control of a computer and can result in aggressive advertising pop-ups, in sluggish computer activity and in the stealing of private information.  The vendor says that Ad-Aware detects hazardous content on a user's computer, identifies the threat level, and then gives the user the ability to block or remove unwanted content. Ad-Aware Total Security offers extra features that the three core version do not, primarily: firewall, system tuning, online backup, data recovery, anti-spam and parental controls.http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_total_security.php
According to PC World magazine, an older version of Ad-Aware, the Anniversary Edition, could locate only 83.6% of malware in a comparative test carried out by the security firm AV-TEST.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,71309-order,2-c,antispywaretools/description.html|title=Editorial Review of Ad-Aware Pro|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=2009-10-31|publisher=PC World (magazine)| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091124095030/http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,71309-order,2-c,antispywaretools/description.html| archivedate= 24 November 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
[/ref] However, as the article states, no such tests have been run on the newest version. Neil J. Rubenking at PCMag performed a lab test on version 8.3, where Ad-Aware scored 9.2 points, beating the previous top score of 9.1.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2366085,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Neil J. | last=Rubenking | title=Ad-Aware Pro Internet Security 8.3[/tpl]
Ad-Aware installs Google Chrome, which will be done automatically unless the user de-selects the tick-box in the Ad-Aware installation program.

==Market share==

Ad-Aware Free is listed as having been downloaded over 381 million times on download.com (and a total of 450 million times on the Lavasoft site, including downloads that do not originate at download.com) [tpl]as of|2013|7|lc=on[/tpl];[tpl]cite web |url = http://download.cnet.com/Ad-Aware-Free-Antivirus/3000-8022_4-10045910.html|title = Ad-Aware Free |date = undated |author = CNet |accessdate = 12 July 2013 [/tpl] however, since its primary competition is not downloadable from the same location, a comparison of relative market-share is not possible with these figures.
The paid versions of the product are under threat from more functional and lower cost, even free, competition such as Microsoft Security Essentials.
