The Virginia Scholastic Rowing Association (VASRA) operates competitive rowing regattas for high schools in Virginia.
It is associated with USRowing, the national governing body for the sport of rowing in the United States.
Most events are on the Occoquan Reservoir in Sandy Run Regional Park or on the Potomac River at Alexandria, Virginia. Some events are run with the Washington Metropolitan Interscholastic Rowing Association (WMIRA) on the Potomac River in Georgetown, DC and on the Anacostia River in Washington, DC.
