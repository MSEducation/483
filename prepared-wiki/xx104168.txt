"I Would Die 4 U" is a song by Prince and The Revolution, and the fourth single in the U.S. from their 1984 album, Purple Rain. The up-tempo dance song was a top 10 hit (the last from the album) in the U.S., reaching number 8 on the Hot 100.

==Alternate versions==

The extended version of "I Would Die 4 U" is actually a studio jam on the song with The Revolution and musicians from Sheila E.'s band, Eddie M (on sax) and Miko Weaver (guitar), along with Sheila E. herself; most of this version was often performed live, preceding "Baby I'm a Star". The jam features some overdubbing and fades at the end; a longer version, nearly 31 minutes long, was never released officially, but has been bootlegged. The extended mix was also used as the B-side of the 1989 "Erotic City" single (the artwork of which features the same image of Prince that was used for this single's cover).
The B-side, "Another Lonely Christmas", is a sad account of a man mourning his dear friend Kat's death on Christmas Day from pneumonia.  The UK 12" single release also included the 1999 track "Free".
