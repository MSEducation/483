[[Benzal chloride]]

CATEGORIES: Organochlorides, IARC Group 2A carcinogens

Benzal chloride is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CHCl2.  This colourless liquid is a lachrymator and is used as a building block in organic synthesis.

==Preparation and usage==

Benzal chloride is produced by the free radical chlorination of toluene, being preceded in the process by benzyl chloride (C6H5CH2Cl) and followed by benzotrichloride (C6H5CCl3):
Benzylic halides are typically strong alkylating agents, and for this reason benzal chloride is treated as a hazardous compound.  
Treatment of benzal chloride with sodium gives stilbene.
Most benzal chloride main industrial use is as a precursor to benzaldehyde.  This conversion involves  hydrolysis in the presence of base:Karl-August Lipper and Eckhard Löser “Benzyl Chloride and Other Side-Chain Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.
