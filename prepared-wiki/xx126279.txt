Malta Story is a 1953 British war film, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, which is based on the heroic air defence of Malta during the Siege of Malta in the Second World War. The film uses real and unique footage of the locations at which the battles were fought and includes a love story between a RAF pilot  and a Maltese girl, as well as the anticipated execution of her brother, caught as an Italian spy. The character of "Peter Ross" is apparently loosely based on that of Adrian Warburton.

==Plot==

In 1942, Britain is trying hard to keep Malta while invasion seems imminent and Italians and Germans are regularly bombing the airfields and towns regardless. The RAF fight to survive against the odds using the few fighter aircraft available. Flight Lt. Peter Ross (Alec Guinness), an archaeologist, is on his way to a posting in Egypt but is stranded in Malta due to the air attacks. He is then asked to join the RAF squadron there as an air reconnaissance pilot. He meets Maria (Muriel Pavlow), a lovely Maltese girl working in the RAF operations room. The two fall in love and spend a few romantic hours in the Neolithic temples of Mnajdra and Ħaġar Qim on the island.
In the meantime, the situation becomes desperate. Many civilians are buried daily under the rubble, and famine is threatening their survival, as relief convoys are easy prey to the numerous attacks by air. Peter proposes marriage to Maria although they realise that wartime is not favourable to love affairs, as her mother suggests. Nevertheless, the young couple remain hopeful of the future. In the meantime, Maria’s brother (Nigel Stock) is arrested while trying to infiltrate the island from Italy, obviously on a spying mission, for which he is expected to be executed. [tpl]#tag:ref|The plotline involving the character, Giuseppe Gonzar, has some parallels to the real story of Carmelo Borg Pisani.|group=N[/tpl] Maria’s mother lives a double drama.
The island relies on the last few ships of a convoy for supplies. The scene of the tanker SS Ohio (real footage) arriving half sunk in Valletta harbour is the apex of glory for the defenders and the island of Malta collectively receives the George Cross from Britain's King George VI.
The RAF holds on, and, along with Royal Navy submarines, is eventually able to take the offensive, targeting enemy shipping on its way to Rommel in Libya. Many air raids take place either to defend the island with Spitfires or a number of attack aircraft, including Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers, Bristol Beaufort and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which succeed in sinking Italian tankers and warships. There comes the moment when the most important enemy convoy is on its way to Libya under cover of poor visibility. Peter's commanding officer (Jack Hawkins) needs desperately to locate this target and orders him to find it at any cost. Peter, flying in his Spitfire, finally finds it, but has to stay close to keep contact. He is attacked by six Messerschmitt Bf 109Fs. Peter stays calm, but cannot escape his fate; he is shot down and killed, while Maria in the operations room listens helplessly to his radio transmissions. Later the next day, Maria sits by the beach, thinking of her beloved Peter. In the end it is implied (by newspaper) that the attack was a success, as the Afrika Corps has lost the Second Battle of El Alemain (in part due to supply shortages) and thus their foothold in Africa.

The Ulster born director Brian Desmond Hurst was persuaded by his lifelong friend, John Ford, to direct the Malta Story.

The unique footage used in the Malta Story is actual historic archive material. In the aerial sequences, combat footage of aircraft that attacked Malta, such as the Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 torpedo/horizontal bomber and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109F fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers can be seen, along with many other wartime RAF aircraft.Parish 1990, p. 268. Additionally, many scenes were shot in Malta with the real types of aircraft still in operational service at that time, some of which did not exist any longer elsewhere. The production only had the use of three later Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVIs, which had been located in storage.Farmer 1984, p. 53. Although a modicum of model work and studio rear projection footage was needed, careful editing of archival newsreel and location photography created an authentic looking, near-documentary style.[tpl]#tag:ref|The Spitfires shown in action are, however, mainly of the later types that flew from Malta after 1943-44.

The Fast Minelaying Cruiser [tpl]HMS|Manxman|M70|6[/tpl] is mentioned by name in the film as bringing Vice-Admiral Payne to Malta to relieve Vice-Admiral Willie Banks.  In the film Manxman is briefly depicted by a Dido-class cruiser - clearly identifiable from her 5.25 inch gun turrets which were unique to this cruiser class. (HMS Manxman herself was coincidentally used in another 1953 film which was also shot in Malta. This was Sailor of the King, in which she depicted the fictional German raider Essen.  This film also used the Dido-class Cruiser HMS Cleopatra, which was then operating as part of the Mediterranean Fleet).

==Reception==

===Box Office===

Malta Story was the fourth most popular movie at the British box office in 1953."From London." Sunday_Mail_(Adelaide, SA: 1912–1954), 9 January 1954, p. 50. via National Library of Australia.'' Retrieved: 10 July 2012. "The combination of an A-list cast, the portrayal of the iron resilience of the Maltese people, the gallantry of the RAF pilots and a tragic love story were the four components of its success." Smith 2010, p. 15.

===Critical Reception===

A contemporary review in The New York Times considered Malta Story as "restrained, routine fare." The reviewer continued,  "However, the commendable British reserve they display in the face of peril does not add luster to the standard yarn in which they are involved. This 'Malta Story,' unlike the actual one, does not stir the senses or send the spirit soaring." A. W. "Malta Story (1953): Three Films Arrive; 'Malta Story,' a British Import, at the Guild ..." The New York Times, 17 July 1954.Variety, however, called it, "(an) epic story of courage and endurance ..." "Malta Story (review)." Variety, 31 December 1952. Retrieved: 8 April 2012.
In a later review of Malta Story, Leonard Maltin commented that "on-location filming of this WW2 British-air-force-in-action yarn is sparked by underplayed acting."Maltin, Leonard. "Review: Malta Story." Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: 8 April 2012. Aviation film historians, Jack Hardwick and Ed Schnepf gave it a 3/5 rating, noting the use of period aircraft made it "good buff material." Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 59.
