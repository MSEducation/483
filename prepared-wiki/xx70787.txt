[[Dingbat]]

CATEGORIES: Typography, Unicode blocks

A dingbat is an ornament, character or spacer used in typesetting, sometimes more formally known as a printer's ornament or printer's character.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]  The term continues to be used in the computer industry to describe fonts that have symbols and shapes in the positions designated for alphabetical or numeric characters.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Examples of characters included in Unicode (ITC Zapf Dingbats series 100 and others):
The advent of Unicode and the universal character set it provides allowed commonly used dingbats to be given their own character codes, from 2700 to 27BF (hexadecimal). Although fonts claiming Unicode coverage will contain glyphs for dingbats in addition to alphabetic characters, fonts that have dingbats in place of alphabetic characters continue to be popular, primarily for ease of input.  Such fonts are also sometimes known as pi fonts.https://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/PiFontInfo.pdf
Some of the dingbat symbols have been used as signature marks, used in bookbinding to order sections.
