The S60 Platform (formerly Series 60 User Interface) is a software platform for smartphones that runs on the Symbian operating system. It was created by Nokia in 2001, and was first released in 2002 with the Nokia 7650 smartphone. The OS platform has since seen 5 updated editions. In 2010, S60 was replaced by the new Symbian^3.
S60 consists of a suite of libraries and standard applications, such as telephony, personal information manager (PIM) tools, and Helix-based multimedia players. It is intended to power fully featured modern phones with large colour screens, which are commonly known as smartphones.
The S60 software is a multivendor standard for smartphones that supports application development in Java MIDP, C++, Python[tpl]citation | url = http://www.forum.nokia.com/Resources_and_Information/Tools/Runtimes/Python_for_S60/ | publisher = Nokia | title = Python for S60[/tpl] and Adobe Flash. Originally, the most distinguishing feature of S60 phones was that they allowed users to install new applications after purchase. Unlike a standard desktop platform, however, the built-in apps are rarely upgraded by the vendor beyond bug fixes. New features are only added to phones while they are being developed rather than after public release. Certain buttons are standardized, such as a menu key, a four way joystick or d-pad, left and right soft keys and a clear key.
S60 is mainly used by Nokia but has also been used by a few other manufacturers, including Lenovo, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung,[tpl]citation | url = http://www.s60.com/life/thisiss60/S60forbusiness/licensees | title = Licensees | publisher = S60[/tpl] Sendo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/0310/28067.html|language=German|publisher=Golem.de|title=Symbian-Smartphone von Sendo mit Digitalkamera samt Blitz|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=21 October 2003|first=Ingo|last=Pakalski[/tpl] and Siemens Mobile.

==S60 editions==

==S60 versions and supported devices==

Many devices are capable of running the S60 software platform with the Symbian OS. Devices ranging from the early Nokia 7650 running S60 v0.9 on Symbian OS v6.1,Forum Nokia Device Specifications for S60 models(operating system information)Sony Ericsson Satio Press Release (information about S60 version) to the latest Samsung i8910 Omnia HD running S60 v5.0 on Symbian OS v9.4.Samsung OMNIAHD Dazzles at Mobile World Congress with Its HD Brilliance In Symbian^3 the version of the revised platform is v5.2.
The table lists devices carrying each version of S60 as well as the Symbian OS version it is based on. Note that new devices since Symbian^3 May be capable of upgrading to later systems, such as Symbian Anna and Symbian Belle. Therefore, you may see a device being listed in many systems.
Symbian is now progressing through a period of organisational change to metamorph into an open source software platform project. As an OS, Symbian OS originally provided no user interface (UI), the visual layer that runs atop an operating system. This was implemented separately. Examples of Symbian UIs are MOAP; Series 60; Series 80; Series 90 and UIQ. This separation of UI from underlying OS has created both flexibility and some confusion in the market place. The Nokia purchase of Symbian was brokered with the involvement of the other UI developers and all major user interface layers have been (or have been pledged to be) donated to the open source foundation who will independently own the Symbian operating system. The new Symbian Foundation has announced its intent to unify different Symbian UIs into a single UI based on the S60 platform. (Announcements made in March 2009 indicated this would be the S60 5th edition with feature pack 1).

==Competitions and the End of Symbian==

In February 2011, Nokia announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate Windows Phone 7 as their Primary OS, leaving further Symbian development in question. Nokia has promised support for Symbian and its newer devices till at least 2016, but no new Symbian devices will be released after Nokia 808 PureView.
As a part of this plan, Nokia announced on 29 April 2011, to transfer and outsource Symbian activities to Accenture along with 3000 employees.
