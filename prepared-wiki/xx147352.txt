==History==

The first written mention of Vajnory dates to 1237, when it was a village with the original Slovak Slovak name Prača / Pračany. In 1307, monastery in Austrian Heiligenkreuz purchased it and renamed the village Weinern, referring to the main occupation of the villagers, working on vineyards and making wine. A relic of this name remains today in the Slovak variant, Vajnory. It was purchased again by Bratislava in the 16th century. It was a borough only until 1851, when, shortly after the abolition of serfdom, Vajnory became an independent village again. It was made an official borough of Bratislava in 1946.
