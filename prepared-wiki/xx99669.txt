[[Football hooliganism]]

CATEGORIES: Association football hooliganism, Violence

Football hooliganism refers to unruly, violent, and destructive behaviour by overzealous supporters of football clubs, including brawling, vandalism and intimidation.[tpl]Cite news|title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease |work=The Independent|date=2004-06-17|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London[/tpl]
Football hooliganism normally involves conflict between gangs, often known as football firms (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the specific purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams.  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs (usually, but not always, geographically close) and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies), is likely to be more severe.
Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadia to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.  In such cases, shop windows may be smashed, rubbish bins set on fire, and police cars may be overturned. In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured riot police have intervened with tear gas, police dogs, armoured vehicles and water cannons.

==Hooligan Behaviour==

Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:

==Early history==

The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the phenomenon can be traced back to 14th-century England. In 1314, Edward II banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a pig's bladder across the local heath) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to social unrest, or even treason.[tpl]Cite news|title=When did football hooliganism start?|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-12-13|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,618130,00.html|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Ingle[/tpl] According to a University of Liverpool academic paper, conflict at an 1846 match in Derby, England, required a reading of the "riot act" and two groups of dragoons to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified "pitch invasions" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.[tpl]cite web|title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html|work=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Pearson, G.|date=December 2007[/tpl]
The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the modern game allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when gangs of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after Preston North End beat Aston Villa 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were pelted with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as "howling roughs". The following year, Preston fans fought Queen's Park fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were tried for hooliganism, including a "drunk and disorderly" 70-year-old woman, following their match against Blackburn Rovers.
Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its historyDunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor & Francis (e.g. Millwall's ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in Latin American football. In the 1955–56 English football season, Liverpool and Everton fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label "football hooliganism" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint

==Causes==

Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called "ritualized male violence".Ramón Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries "Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity."[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] "Numerous causal factors have been offered in previous literature in relation to hooliganism," including "...alcohol and irregular tickets sales, as well as the “…criminal insouciance (disinterest) of the organisers” and the “…cowardly ineptitude” of the police. The main causes are "the media, the police, the football authorities and opposing fans." Rowe (2002) states that "football violence is often explained by focusing on genetic and sociological theories."
One observer stated that in the UK, "high-profile outbreaks of violence involving fans are much rarer today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn't bear comparison - either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.  Football has moved on thanks to banning orders and better, more sophisticated policing.
And while it is too simplistic to say that the higher cost of watching football has pushed unsavoury elements out, there has been a shift in the way people are expected to behave inside grounds. Offensive chants are still way too commonplace but actual fighting doesn't happen very often."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22158585 |title=BBC Sport - Millwall & Newcastle violence: Who is to blame for football chaos? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]

==Subculture==

Football hooligans often appear less interested in the football match itself than in the associated violence, engaging in behaviour which will risk their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium or ejected during the progress of the match.
Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific part of their team's stadium, called in England an "end", and sometimes use this in naming their firms.
In the UK, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the skinhead subculture.  Subsequently, the "casual" subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing skinhead-style, working class clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, firm members began wearing designer clothes and expensive "offhand" sportswear (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations).[tpl]cite news|title=FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/style/fashion-on-the-street-a-rainbow-of-raincoats.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 1989|author=Staff[/tpl]

==Politics==

In a number of countries, football hooliganism is associated with nationalist and far-right politics, often at a superficial level such as crude racism.  Racist abuse of non-white players is common in Europe.

==International Hooliganism==

Hooligans who can afford the time and money may follow the national team on its journeys to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team.  They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public.  While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.

==Nomenclature==

Other terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include "army", "boys", "casuals", and "crew".  Hooligan-led violence has been called "aggro" (short for "aggravation") and "bovver" (the Cockney pronunciation of "bother", i.e. trouble).  To "run" opposing hooligans is to make them flee.

==Anti-Hooligan Measures==

Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:

==Europe==

===Belgium===

Hooliganism was especially prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, when riots between supporters of major teams, such as Club Brugge, RSC Anderlecht, Standard de Liège, Union Royale Namur, Beerschot and Antwerp FC were common. On May 23, 2008, riots occurred between Anderlecht hooligans and immigrant youth in Brussels. On June 3, 2011, during the Belgium-Turkey match, riots took place in the city center of Ghent, and 30 people were injured.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Football hooliganism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as FK Sarajevo (Horde Zla), FK Željezničar Sarajevo (The Maniacs),  HŠK Zrinjski Mostar (Ultrasi) and FK Borac Banja Luka (Lešinari).  Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include FK Sloboda Tuzla (Fukare), NK Čelik Zenica (Robijaši), FK Velež Mostar (Red Army) and NK Široki Brijeg.
Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions.  Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar.  Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, FK Slavija, and FK Drina Zvornik (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of NK Široki Brijeg (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.
Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as Ustaše, Četnici and Nazis.[tpl]cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. - www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/ne-nacizmu/46262 |title=Ne nacizmu! |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues.[tpl]cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. - www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/veliki-neredi-u-jablanici-spasavala-se-ziva-glava/106331 |title=Veliki neredi u Jablanici, spašavala se živa glava |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.[tpl]cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. - www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/sprijecen-sukob-navijaca-borca-i-zrinjskog-u-jablanici/104194 |title=Spriječen sukob navijača Borca i Zrinjskog u Jablanici |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]

===Bulgaria===

Ultra groups are associated with teams including CSKA Sofia (Ofanziva, 14, Lulin Boys, Torcida Plovdiv, UCSH, SWCR), Levski Sofia (Sofia Zapad, South Division, HD Boys, Ultra Varna), Botev Plovdiv (CSC), Lokomotiv Plovdiv (Lauta Hools), Minyor Pernik (Teva Boys), Beroe Stara Zagora (Zara Boys), Slavia Sofia (BOYS SOFIA,La Vechia Scuola) and others. Most groups express far-right political views, especially against Roma and immigrants.  There are particular rivalries between fans of CSKA and Levski Sofia (the two most successful clubs in Bulgarian football), and between those of Botev and Lokomotiv Plovdiv.

===Croatia===

Football hooliganism in Croatia has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the Yugoslav federation in the 1990s.[tpl]Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/football-war.html |accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl] Two of the best known hooligan firms are Torcida (Hajduk Split) and Bad Blue Boys (Dinamo Zagreb).[tpl]Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Ultra Scene in Croatia and Serbia: Football Hooliganism Balkan Style |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/hooligans.html |accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl] However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American Torcida supporters groups and Ultras groups, with organised Tifos and so on.
On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club Red Star Belgrade was in Zagreb to play Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with armoured vehicles and water cannons, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player Zvonimir Boban kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism, although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.
Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, Sydney United (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and Bonnyrigg White Eagles (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the New South Wales Premier League. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. Football NSW held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.[tpl]Cite news|title=Football riot's stupidity, not ethnic, say clubs|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2005-03-14|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Football/Football-riots-stupidity-not-ethnic-say-clubs/2005/03/14/1110649117701.html|accessdate=2007-06-19[/tpl]

Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.
Another incident occurred in Genoa in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made nazi salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in Osijek during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and Kohorta occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.
A large riot occurred in 2008 in Prague prior to the Sparta Prague-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić.[tpl]hr icon[/tpl]Index.hr BBB se susreću s ljubiteljima Karadžića i Mladića, Aug 8, 2008 Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local Romani people by giving nazi salutes.
A large riot occurred in 2010 on 1.May at the Maksimir stadium when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the FC Timişoara-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident Romanian police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the FC Timişoara stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at FC Timişoara fans resulting in severe injuries.
Many Croatian hooligan groups have also displayed nazi flags at matches and have neo-nazi skinheads in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of black skin descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a Cameroon player was attacked in Koprivnica resulting in severe injuries.
In December 2010. 10-15 Tornado (Zadar) hooligans attacked an Partizan traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30-40 Bad Blue Boys attacked an PAOK traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

===Denmark===

Football hooliganism is regarded as a serious problem in Denmark both for the sport itself and for the Danish society in general. In an attempt to control hooliganism in Denmark the Danish parliament introduced a hooligan registry in 2008.
Initially, hooligans followed an "honor code" fighting only among themselves and not using weapons, but this is no longer the case.
Hooligan groups in Denmark are often linked to radical right-wing groups such as the Danish Front.
Besides the "official" members of these groups there are also many "hangarounds" who are not permanently attached to a group.
Football hooligans reportedly have a counterpart, the Roligans, a peaceful group which opposes hooliganism.

===France===

Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in social conflict, including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland.[tpl]Cite news| title =Racist insults infiltrate French soccer stadium|url =http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm | publisher =The Boston Bay State Banner| date= 2006-04-20 | accessdate = 2006-10-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060715011039/http%3A//www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm |archivedate = July 15, 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] There is a long standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and Olympique de Marseille (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.
On 24 May 2001, fifty people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between PSG and Turkish club Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.UEFA launched an immediate investigation with the possibility of serious penalties for the club.[tpl]Cite news| title = PSV and PSG face Uefa wrath |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/1232425.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 2001-03-20 | accessdate = 2007-04-29[/tpl] PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000.

The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.The Turkish press accused the security, media and PSG club of attempting to cover up the injuries.[tpl]Cite news| title =Lies, damned lies, Paris statistics|url =http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=22416 | publisher =Turkish Daily News| date= 2001-03-19 | accessdate = 2006-10-21[/tpl]
On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4-2 to Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv at the Parc des Prince in a UEFA Cup match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches.[tpl]Cite news| title = France faces up to football hooliganism |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6189888.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 2006-11-27 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt[/tpl] The fan who was shot, was linked with the Boulogne Boys, a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the Kop of Boulogne (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.
The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a "one-sided" account of the incident. French President Jacques Chirac condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges.[tpl]Cite news| title = Chirac condemns football violence |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6182414.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 2006-11-25 | accessdate = 2007-04-29[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| title = Paris fan shot dead by policeman |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179418.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 2006-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-04-29[/tpl]
[tpl]Citation needed span|text=Before a home match against Sochaux on 4 January 2006, two Arab youths were punched and kicked by white fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of Indian origin, Vikash Dhorasoo was told to "go sell peanuts in the metro".|date=January 2012[/tpl] In the recent years, following UK's example, France's legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

===Germany===

Some football hooliganism in Germany has been linked to neo-Nazism and far right groups.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/126040.stm |title=Fears of neo-Nazi return to World Cup |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-07-03 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] In June 1998, after a FIFA World Cup match in France between Germany and Yugoslavia a French policeman was beaten to the point of brain damage by German fans.

===Spain===

Football hooliganism in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some black players have been victims of ethnic slurs. Samuel Eto'o, a former FC Barcelona player from Cameroon, has denounced the problem. The second source is the strong rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, Luís Figo's appearance in Barcelona's Nou Camp Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish Primera División. Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the General Franco fascist regime days (some Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Espanyol, Real Betis Balompie or Valencia CF ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as Deportivo La Coruña, Athletic Club Bilbao, Sevilla FC, Celta de Vigo, Rayo Vallecano) and the independentist movements in Catalonia (like FC Barcelona) and the Basque region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called grupos ultra. Two notorious ones are the Boixos Nois and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively.

===Argentina===

====1920s====

The first murder related with the Argentine football occurred on 2 November 1924 in Montevideo (Uruguay), after the final match of the South American Championship of this year between Uruguay and Argentina. In the Colón Hotel (where the Argentina national football team was staying) broke out a fight of Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers. Consequentially, a Uruguayan fan died.To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby Pelota Afuera

====1930s====

On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of Lanús (in the city of Lanús, in the Greater Buenos Aires), the violence claimed its first fatality in Argentine territory. In a match of the minor divisions of Boca Juniors and the local team, after a foul by a player of Lanús, players began to fight. Seeing this, the Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli, a 9-year old.An undesirable list who grow... La Nación

====1940s====

But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and San Lorenzo de Almagro at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of Rosario), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.The shortest match of the history La Capital

====1950s====

Although in Argentine football violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups (barras bravas) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of Independiente, San Lorenzo de Almagro, Lanús, Rosario Central, Vélez Sarsfield, Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of Belgrano, Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. Every major and minor football club in Argentina has its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent. In that country, there are the largest and strongest organized supporter groups in the world,The most dangerous hooligans of the world are in Argentina Deustche Welle and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of Independiente (La Barra Del Rojo) followed by the barra bravas of Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys.//http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/09/05/deportes/d-04401.htm[tpl]cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota1/d-07701.htm |title=Clarín digital | Deportes. River: la barra más temida |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]
But this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed for several years), with the murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (in a Vélez Sársfield - River Plate match at the José Amalfitani stadium). Because of the murder of this fan of Vélez Sársfield, in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called "industrialization of football" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:
In this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these "benefits" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.The origins of an evil without remedy Clarín, especial "Violencia en el fútbol"
After the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by "habituation" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or "accidents", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.

====1980s====

From the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the FIFA World Cups. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or ultras) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.
An example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the Bombonera stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.The lost flare La Redo

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in Argentina stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of knife and shotgun casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).The Boca group, known as La Doce (The Twelfth) has a long history of violence. In 2002 Diego Maradona was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. Argentine hooligans revere Maradona

===Brazil===

Fans in Brazil join in organized groups often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other "torcidas organizadas" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul (Avaí Futebol Clube), Força Jovem Vasco (CR Vasco da Gama), Galoucura (Atlético Mineiro) and Mancha Verde (SE Palmeiras), the alliance between Torcida Independente (São Paulo F.C.), Torcida Jovem (CR Flamengo), Máfia Azul (Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and Leões da TUF (Fortaleza Esporte Clube) and some other alliances.

===El Salvador===

The Football War (Spanish: La guerra del fútbol), also known as the Soccer War or 100 hour War, was a brief war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second North American qualifying round of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Honduras and El Salvador met in the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.[tpl]cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816-1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&pg=PA195&dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 [/tpl] A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time.
The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire on the night of July 18 (hence "100 hour War"), which took full effect on July 20. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".Anderson, Thomas P. The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969. p.105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981. This led to border clashes between the two nations.

===Mexico===

Football hooliganism in Mexico appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of Monterrey and Morelia at a Primera División match in Monterrey in 2003.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2992422.stm |title=Fatal Mexican football win |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-15 |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl] In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexican football fans rioted after the Mexico national football team lost to Germany in the World Cup, a result that eliminated Mexico from the tournament.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/123024.stm |title=One killed in Mexican World Cup riots |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-06-30 |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl] After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested.  In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas.  Several police were hospitalized.  As a result Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.http://soccerly.com/article/jonnyrico/chivas-bans-supporter-groups-for-el-clasico-after-violent-acts-in-gdl-derby

===United States and Canada===

While football is traditionally viewed as a family-friendly event, violence does occur. On July 20, 2008, in a friendly match between Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew and English Premier League club West Ham United, in Columbus, Ohio, a fight broke out between rival fans.

That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed Giants Stadium as members of the New York Red Bulls supporters club, Empire Supporters Club (ESC), and members of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the New Jersey State Police were called to quell the situation.[tpl]Cite news| first=Ives | last=Galarcep | coauthors= | title=More mistreatment for Red Bulls fans at Giants Stadium | date=July 21, 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/07/red-bulls-to-bl.html | work =Soccer By Ives | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = [/tpl] There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans.

==Asia==

===Azerbaijan===

In Azerbaijan, the biggest problems come from fans of PFC Neftchi Baku (Flagman) (Ultra Neftchi) and Khazar Lankaran (Bosman) (12 Player).

===Bangladesh===

Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a B-League match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. When the referee disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire tear gas at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.[tpl]Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/08/11/socceriot010811.html |title=At least 100 injured in Bangladeshi soccer riot |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2001-08-11 |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl]

===China===

Football hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s.[tpl]Cite news|title=Chinese football fans riot over penalty |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-03-25 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1892421.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Chinese football fans go on rampage|publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-10 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2036050.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl] After a match in 2000 between Shaanxi Guoli and Chengdu Wuniu in Xi'an, football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd.

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.
In June 2002, riots in Fuzhou, Fujian province had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police.  The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the World Cup match between China and Brazil at an outside broadcast. On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when China lost the final of the AFC Asian Cup to Japan, 3-1.  Japanese flags were burned and a Japanese Embassy official's car vandalised.  Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety.[tpl]Cite news|title=Chinese riot after Japan victory|publisher=BBC News |date=2004-08-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3541380.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=China probes football violence|publisher=BBC News |date=2004-08-24 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3582364.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl] The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War.

===India===

In India, football riots basically take place in Kolkata. Everytime the Calcutta derby takes place between Mohun Bagan A.C. and East Bengal F.C., tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at Eden Gardens on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium. Though nobody was killed, Syed Nabi, a Mohun Bagan A.C. footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by Mohun Bagan A.C. supporters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens |title=Eden Gardens - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/soccer/violence-mars-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-match--2492.html |title=Violence mars Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match |publisher=Indiatvnews.com |date=2012-12-09 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]

===Indonesia===

Hooligan action in Indonesia marked by conflicting between supporters often occurred in several major cities, such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Solo, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Malang. Fans club that often involved a brawl in: Persija, Persib, PSIS, Persis, PSIM, PSS, Persebaya, and Arema. It is following the clubs rivalities. For examples, Persija versus their big enemies: Persib and Persebaya. Or Indonesian El Classico, Arema contra Persebaya. While the sides of PSIS, Persis, PSIM, and PSS fight enmity between them.
More than 30 people have been killed as a result of clash between supporters. Just in the league season 2012/2013, 10 fans were killed. In addition to clashes between supporters, also often occurred between supporter versus residents who live along the railway line. Bad habit of supporter (buying food and drink without paying along the bypassed stations), being them as a target throw stones.
Supporters had the initiative to found the Association of Indonesian Football Supporters (ASSI) to reduce that bad habit. But the association led by Sigit Nugroho did not stem the brutal action of supporter, especially without significant support from Indonesian Football Association (PSSI). Sigit has also twice held the big event called Jamboree of Indonesian Football Supporters in Bogor and Bali, but it’s only mark a peace agreement, which has not been followed by concrete action in the field.
Nevertheless the creative action at stadium by fans, at least can neutralize the bad side of Indonesian soccer. The action led by Aremania (Malang), now already mushrooming across the country. They sing, dance, and show several unique choreographies.

===Jordan===

Football riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country's Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/12/2010121020416452506.html |title=Rival Jordan football fans clash - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl]

About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals. According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009.http://wikileaks.adhelis.com/cable/2009/07/09AMMAN1689.html

===North Korea===

There was brief unrest from North Korean fans at an international match vs Iran in North Korea in 2005. It appears that a North Korean player got into an argument with the Syrian referee, and then things got out of hand.Andrei Lankov (April 19, 2005) "North Koreans think the unthinkable". Asia Times Online. Retrieved 2009-12-15.

===Qatar===

Football hooliganism in Qatar stems from the many strong local-derbies held within the country as a result of the majority of the league being based in Doha. Casual football culture has been brought over to Qatar where vandals dress in casual white gowns rather than in football jerseys, making it difficult for police to make any arrests at big games.

===Syria===

On March 12, 2004 a fight between Arab and Kurdish supporters of rival Syrian football clubs at a match in Qamishli, [tpl]convert|450|mi|km[/tpl] north east of Damascus, escalated into full scale riots that left 25 people dead and hundreds injured.[tpl]Cite news|title=Syria urged to free riot Kurds|publisher=BBC News |date=2004-04-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3607059.stm|accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl]

In January 2006 riot police attacked Libyan fans in the Cairo International Stadium after they threw missiles at the Egyptian fans in the tier above them during a match between the Egypt national football team and the Morocco national team. The Libyan fans had stayed on to watch the match after they had seen Libya lose 2-1 to Côte d'Ivoire and had started taunting the home supporters. The Egyptian fans responded by asking them to leave the stadium and verbally attacking them at half time, and when, despite a plea to stop, it continued into the second half, the riot police were called in. The Libyan Football Association were fined $7,000 by the Confederation of African Football disciplinary Commission.[tpl]Cite news| title = Egypt, Libya fined for crowd violence | publisher = ezilon infobase | date = 27 January 2006 | url = http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_15644.shtml | accessdate = 2007-11-23 [/tpl]

A mob of al-Masry supporters attempted to storm the prison where the sentenced were held; in the subsequent rioting 30 people were killed, including two police officers, and some 300 injured.

===Gambia===

Massive riots occurred during and after a Cup of African Nations qualifying game between rival neighbours Senegal and Gambia at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, Senegal in June 2003. Gambian supporters hurled missiles towards Senegalese fans and were subsequently charged by soldiers. After the game, violent clashes were reported in both Gambia and Senegal. In Gambia several severe beatings of Senegalese citizens occurred, which led to over 200 Senegalese seeking shelter at their embassy. Also, there were rumours of a fatal beating of a Senegalese citizen. In Senegal a Gambian BBC reporter was attacked and robbed by a group of youths. The riots eventually led to the closing of the border between Gambia and Senegal until order was restored.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2976446.stm |title=Africa | Border shut after soccer clash |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-09 |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=Copnall |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/2973194.stm |title=BBC SPORT | Football | African | Violence mars Senegal win |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-08 |accessdate=2010-03-24[/tpl]

==Media portrayal==

Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as I.D., The Firm, Cass, The Football Factory, Green Street, Rise of the Footsoldier and Awaydays. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as The Football Factory and Among the Thugs. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.
