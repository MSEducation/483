CATEGORIES: Companies based in Los Angeles County, California

ScreenShoe provides a complete resource for actors, filmmakers, and crew members associated with film, television, theatrical and commercial production.
ScreenShoe is a website dedicated to connecting members of the film industry through an intricate online directory. Upon signing up for ScreenShoe, users are provided with their own individual web space. This personalized web page allows them to showcase their resume, experience, accolades and media.
Additionally, there is a section of the ScreenShoe web site that is devoted entirely to 'event planning.' Here, directors and producers are able to announce their newest projects in search of cast and crew. Furthermore, all members are encouraged by the founders to utilize the 'forum and blog system' to enhance the richness of ScreenShoe's community.
The company web site is currently in beta and is scheduled for launch in early September 2006.
