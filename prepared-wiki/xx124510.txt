Dexter Gilman Wansel (born August 22, 1950) is an American keyboardist, raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He contributed to the development of the Philly Sound and worked with producers Gamble and Huff at Philadelphia International Records. Wansel led the musical group, Yellow Sunshine.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p21317/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Dexter Wansel|last=Hogan|first=Ed|publisher=AMG|accessdate=7 May 2010[/tpl] He has worked with Phyllis Hyman, The Jacksons, MFSB, Teddy Pendergrass, Patti Labelle, The Jones Girls, Evelyn "Champagne" King, Grover Washington Jr. and Lou Rawls, amongs many others. He also wrote The Jones Girls 1981 soul music song "Nights over Egypt" and Patti Labelle's 1983 #1 R&B hit, "If Only You Knew", with Cynthia Biggs. His "Theme from the Planets" has been sampled and was featured on the breakbeat compilation album, Ultimate Breaks and Beats.
Whilst Wansel was relatively unknown outside the U.S., many have suggested[tpl]Who|date=January 2009[/tpl] that his influence on pop music, as both a producer and performer in the mid-1970s, led to the development of new age soul and jazz funk. His most successful album was Life On Mars, released on the Philadelphia International record label in 1976. Wansel played keyboards, Derek Graves played bass guitar whilst a session singer, Terri Wells, was on vocals. The remaining sound was filled in by Dexter's rhythm section called The Planets featuring Darryl Brown, Calvin Harris, Bobby Malach, Al Harrison and the aforementioned Graves.
During the second half of the 1970s, space travel and sci-fi were important themes in the ambient U.S. culture and therefore in funk, jazz, and jazz funk, and were reflected in Dexter's titles and music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Listening to other tracks on the album, like "Stargazer", "Theme from the Planets" and "Rings of Saturn", it can be seen that a space theme runs through his music.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] His "Funk Attack" on the 1979 album Time is Slipping Away  and "I'll Never Forget (My Favorite Disco)" have stood the test of time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Instrumental arrangements appeared on his album Voyager (1978).  In addition to this he presented a disco theme with "Disco Lights" from the album What The World is Coming To (1977); and jazz funk such as "Latin Love" on Voyager; or "Ode Infinitum" on What The World Is Coming To.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl]
Wansel has produced and recorded many soul ballads including the Time is Slipping Away title track, "New Beginning" on that same album, "The Sweetest Pain" (which was sampled by The Solid Doctor for his trip hop track "Lights On The Vibe", by DJ Cam for his track "Dieu Reconna√Ætra Les Siens", and by Global Communication for their track "The Way")   and "You Can Be What You Wanna Be" from 1976. He also co-wrote and produced the Pieces of a Dream track, "Warm Weather". The track "Rings of saturn" was sampled by Dela for his track "Long Life" featuring Talib Kweli. Purists consider his "I'm In Love Once Again",  released on Philadelphia International Records by Jean Carn in 1976, to be his finest work, combining sublime chord sequences with a lavish production.
