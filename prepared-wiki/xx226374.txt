[[Disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention]]

CATEGORIES: European Patent Organisation

Article 83 of the European Patent Convention (EPC)[tpl]EPC Article|83[/tpl] relates to the disclosure of the invention under the European Patent Convention. It prescribes that a European patent application must disclose the invention (which is the subject of the European patent application) in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. 
In order to meet the requirements of Article 83 EPC, a European patent application must therefore contain sufficient information to allow a person skilled in the art, using his common general knowledge, to perceive the technical teaching inherent in the claimed invention and to put it into effect accordingly. Decision G 2/93 of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office dated December 21, 1994, Reasons 4. In other words, the disclosure of the invention must be reproducible without undue burden. Decision T 63/06 of 24 June 2008, reasons 2.2, ".. according to the well established case law of the Boards of Appeal .. the disclosure must be reproducible without undue burden." See also [tpl]EPO Case law book|ii|c|5|6[/tpl] This requirement must be complied with as from the date of filing because a deficiency in a European patent application as filed, consisting in an insufficient identification of the subject-matter claimed, cannot subsequently be cured without offending against Article 123(2) EPC which provides that the subject-matter content of a European patent application as filed may not be extended. Decision G 2/93 (cited above), Reasons 10.
An insufficiently clear and complete disclosure of the invention is a ground of opposition,[tpl]EPC Article|100|b[/tpl] and revocation.[tpl]EPC Article|138|1|b[/tpl]

==Article 83 EPC and the generally accepted laws of physics==

Although the European Patent Convention does not exclude the patenting of "revolutionary" inventions, Decision T 1329/07 of the Technical Board of Appeal 3.4.02 of 11 November 2010, point 2.2.3

==Burden of proof in opposition==

The burden of proof generally lies upon an opponent to establish insufficiency of disclosure. Decision T 63/06 of 24 June 2008, headnote.  However, "when the patent does not give any information of how a feature of the invention can be put into practice" and if the opponent plausibly argues that "common general knowledge would not enable the skilled person to put this feature into practice", the burden of proof can be shifted to the patentee to show that "common general knowledge would indeed enable the skilled person to carry out the invention."

==Relationship between Article 83 and 84 EPC==

Depending upon the circumstances, an ambiguity in the claims (i.e. a lack of clarity under [tpl]EPC Article|84[/tpl]) may very well lead to an insufficiency objection. Decision T 608/07 of 27 April 2009 of EPO Board of Appeal 3.3.03, Reasons 2.5.2.  As held in decision T 608/07 of 27 April 2009 (in opposition appeal proceedings), 

==Implementing regulations, especially Rule 42 EPC==

[tpl]EPC Rule|42[/tpl] specifies the content of the description of a European patent application and constitutes an implementing rule of Article 83 EPC. Rule 42(1)(e) EPC (previously [tpl]EPC 1973 Rule|27|1|e[/tpl]) notably specifies that "the description shall ... describe in detail at least one way of carrying out the invention claimed, using examples where appropriate and referring to the drawings, if any." In that respect,
