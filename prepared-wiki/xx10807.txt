Enzymes from thistle or ''[[cynara]]'' are used in some traditional cheese production in the [[Mediterranean]]. Phytic acid, derived from unfermented [[soy]]beans, or Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) may also be used.
Vegetable rennets are also suitable for vegetarians. Vegetable rennet might be used in the production of kosher and halal cheeses but nearly all kosher cheeses are produced with either microbial rennet or FPC.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Worldwide, there is no industrial production for vegetable rennet.  Commercial so-called vegetable rennets usually contain rennet from the mold Mucor miehei - see microbial rennet below.

===Microbial rennet===

Some molds such as Rhizomucor miehei are able to produce proteolytic enzymes. These molds are produced in a fermenter and then specially concentrated and purified to avoid contamination with unpleasant byproducts of the mold growth.  At the present state of scientific research, governmental food safety organizations such as the European Food Safety Authority deny QPS (Qualified Presumption of Safety) status to enzymes produced especially by these molds.
The flavor and taste of cheeses produced with microbial rennets tend towards some bitterness, especially after longer maturation periods.[ref]
