==Discussion==

Bush's use of the English language in formal and public speeches has spawned several books that document the statements. The first, Bushisms/President George Herbert Walker Bush in His Own Words, was released in 1992. A poem entitled "Make the Pie Higher", composed entirely of Bushisms, was compiled by cartoonist Richard Thompson.Comics Reporter: Interview with Richard Thompson, January 25, 2008.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/piehigher.asp| title = Make the Pie Higher!| accessdate = October 12, 2006| year = 2002| publisher = Snopes.com[/tpl] Various public figures and humorists, such as Jon Stewart of The Daily Show and Garry Trudeau, creator of the comic strip Doonesbury have popularized some more famous Bushisms, particularly those of George W. Bush.
Linguist Mark Liberman of Language Log has suggested that Bush is not unusually error-prone in his speech, saying: "You can make any public figure sound like a boob, if you record everything he says and set hundreds of hostile observers to combing the transcripts for disfluencies, malapropisms, word formation errors and examples of non-standard pronunciation or usage... Which of us could stand up to a similar level of linguistic scrutiny?"Mark Liberman, "You say Nevada, I say Nevahda". January 3, 2004.  Nearly a decade after George W. Bush said "misunderestimated" in a speech, Philip Hensher called the term one of his "most memorable additions to the language, and an incidentally expressive one: it may be that we rather needed a word for 'to underestimate by mistake'."[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/sarah-palin/7901926/Sarah-Palins-struggle-with-English-language.html| title=Sarah Palin's struggle with English language | last= Hensher| first=Philip | authorlink= Philip Hensher| date=July 21, 2010 | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = July 28, 2010 | location=London[/tpl]
Journalist and pundit Christopher Hitchens published an essay in The Nation titled "Why Dubya Can't Read", writing:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/why-dubya-cant-read |title=Why Dubya Can't Read |publisher=The Nation |accessdate=2011-07-25[/tpl] [tpl]Quotation|I used to have the job of tutoring a dyslexic child, and I know something about the symptoms. So I kicked myself hard when I read the profile of Governor George W. Bush, by my friend and colleague Gail Sheehy, in this month's Vanity Fair. All those jokes and cartoons and websites about his gaffes, bungles and malapropisms? We've been unknowingly teasing the afflicted. The poor guy is obviously dyslexic, and dyslexic to the point of near-illiteracy.[/tpl]
Stanford Graduate School Lecturer and former Bush economic policy advisor Keith Hennessey has argued that the number of Bush's verbal gaffes is not unusual given the significant amount of time that he has spoken in public.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/04/25/george_w_bush_is_smarter_than_you_118125.html  Furthermore, if Barack Obama's speeches were given the same level of scrutiny, there would be a similar number of gaffes.  Hennessey goes on to say that Bush tried to position himself as an average American, not as a "Cambridge or Upper East Side elite."
