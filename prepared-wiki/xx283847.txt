RV ''Falkor'' is an oceanographic research vessel, the flagship vessel of the Schmidt Ocean Institute.

==History==

RV Falkor was originally built as Seefalke in 1981 in Lübeck, Germany as a fishery protection vessel.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/47| title=RV Falkor| publisher=Schmidt Ocean Institute| accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] During an extensive refit at Peters Schiffbau shipyard in Wewelsfleth, Germany,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/80| title=RV Falkor Refit| publisher=Schmidt Ocean Institute| accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] from 2009 to early 2012, she was converted to an oceanographic research vessel. The conversion was funded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt with the intent of allowing researchers to use it free of charge, provided they make their findings free to the public within two months of the research.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/3288/20130801/google-money-funds-falkor-research-vessel-third-mission-year.htm| author=James A.

==Facilities==

Falkor has a 20,000 lb SWL A-frame over the transom, a 7,000 lb SWL f-Frame and 2 articulating cranes providing at least 2 ton weight lifting over the whole of the aft working deck. The cable of the CTD/Hydro winch can be routed to any of these.
On the main deck, a dry lab includes a 28 m2 ROV / Echosounder Control Room, a 26 m2 Lab / Office Space and 17 m2 Data Lab. The wet laboratory is 32 m2.
Falkor has dynamic positioning and can deploy light ROVs. There are shallow- and deep-water multibeam echosounders for acoustic research. The 6.3m aluminium hull, 350 hp jet-drive boat has a bow ramp.
