</ref> This ion occurs in the compound [tpl]chem|AuXe|4|(Sb|2|F|11|)|2[/tpl], and is remarkable in having direct chemical bonds between two notoriously unreactive atoms, xenon and [[gold]], with xenon acting as a transition metal ligand.
The compound [tpl]chem|Xe|2|Sb|2|F|11[/tpl] contains a Xe–Xe bond, the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 Å).
In 1995, M. Räsänen and co-workers, scientists at the University of Helsinki in Finland, announced the preparation of xenon dihydride (HXeH), and later xenon hydride-hydroxide (HXeOH), hydroxenoacetylene (HXeCCH), and other Xe-containing molecules.[ref]
