==Club career==

The son of a footballer who had to retire from the game at 27 after a road accident, Míchel was born in Madrid and joined Real Madrid at the age of thirteen,Real Madrid fans biography [tpl]es icon[/tpl] his technique and physicality on the pitch quickly standing out. He moved quickly through the ranks to the first team, appearing – and scoring – once in the 1981–82 season, in a 2–1 away win against CD Castellón on 11 April 1982.
A member of the renowned Quinta del Buitre, which also featured Emilio Butragueño, Miguel Pardeza, Rafael Martín Vázquez and Manuel Sanchís, Míchel never played less than 31 La Liga contests from 1985 to 1994. After helping Castilla CF to the second division title in 1984, he was instrumental in the capital side's conquests, which included six leagues and two consecutive UEFA Cups; he opened the score in the 1985 final of the latter competition, against Videoton FC.
In 1989 Míchel announced he would leave Real Madrid after having signed with an Italian s, but this never came to pass and he ended up staying until 1996. In his penultimate season he suffered a severe knee injury which rendered him unavailable for most of the successful league campaign, but still bounced back for a final solid year, after which he left for Club Celaya in Mexico – where Butragueño was also playing – shortly after the arrival at Madrid of president Lorenzo Sanz. He retired from football in 1997.
Míchel's career was not without incident: in 1988 he was hit by a bottle while on the pitch and, three years later, he was sanctioned by UEFA for using an unorthodox method of disrupting the concentration of Colombian Carlos Valderrama, in a game against Real Valladolid. The presiding judge in the case noted that "manipulating in public that of your neighbour which is a gift given exclusively to males by nature" violated a federation rule protecting a player's dignity.Míchel "palpa" a Valderrama (Míchel "feels" Valderrama) [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
