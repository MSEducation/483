Visitor (band) is a UK-based electronic music group, formed in London in late 2009. Its two founding members, Kyle Gibson and Lucas Gianello, were born in Australia and met at high school, where they formed their first band, one of many leading up to the creation of Visitor. Visitor's debut single, Los Feeling, was released by Vulture Music in 2010http://www.discogs.com/Visitor-Los-Feeling/master/364753 headed up by Alan Braxe. The duo have maintained a working relationship with the producer Diamond Cut, who having remixed an earlier song created by the duo, effectively serves as a silent member of the group.
