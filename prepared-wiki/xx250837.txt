==History of Trinity Episcopal Church==

Trinity Episcopal Church was established on August 14, 1865.  The first structure, which was located at Third Avenue and Jefferson Street, was not erected until 1870. This wooden building was consumed in the Great Fire of 1889. Chicago based architect Henry F. Starbuck was chosen to design the church in the English Gothic Revival style at the current location at Eighth Avenue and James Street on First Hill. In 1902, a fire swept through the interior leaving only the exterior walls. Seattle architect John Graham, Sr. was hired to rebuild the church as well as increase its size. Despite the additions, Graham maintained the English Gothic Revival style while adding German stained glass windows and an altar of Italian marble.
The stained glass windows were designed by the Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany. The Carrara marble altar was designed and fabricated in Italy with mother of pearl, ceramic tile and Venetian gold glass
The Rev. Jeffrey Shilling Gill is the current rector of Trinity Parish Church. Trinity is a parish in the The Episcopal Diocese of Olympia, known as the Episcopal Church in Western Washington, a diocese of the Episcopal Church in Washington state west of the Cascade Range.
The parish was severely damaged in the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, but the altar, reredos and windows all survived fully intact. It was rebuilt, restored and earthquake-retrofitted. This work was completed in 2005.  Architects for this project were Bassetti Architects.
Trinity is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and also has both City and State landmark status.
