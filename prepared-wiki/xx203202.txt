Infanta Isabel was a Velasco-class unprotected cruiser of the Spanish Navy.

==Technical Characteristics==

Infanta Isabel was built at the naval shipyard at Cadiz. Her keel was laid in 1883, she was launched on 26 June 1885, and she was completed in 1888 or 1889.  She had one rather tall funnel.  She had an iron hull and was rigged as a barque.
Infanta Isabel was rebuilt in 1911, and by 1921 her armament had become one 66-mm (2.6-inch) and ten 57-mm (2.25-inch) guns and her complement had risen to 194.  She was stricken in 1927, by far the longest-lived ship of her class.
