[[Crawdaddy (album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1990 albums, The Darling Buds albums, Albums produced by Stephen Street, Epic Records albums

Crawdaddy was The Darling Buds' third album.  It was released on Epic Records in 1990 and featured the singles "Tiny Machine" and "Crystal Clear". 
The album's sound was more accomplished than on the band's debut album Pop Said.... The arrangements were lush, and with tracks like "Tiny Machine" clocking in at just under six minutes, the song lengths were relatively epic compared to the two minute average on Pop Said....
