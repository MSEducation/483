==Accidents and incidents==

==Controversies==

In June 2011, a court in London had ordered United Airways to repaint its fleet and change its brand after a legal action was taken by American carrier United Airlines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/court-orders-bangladesh39s-united-airways-to-repaint-358886/|title=Court orders Bangladesh's United Airways to repaint fleet|date=28 June 2011|publisher=Flightglobal|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] Lawyers for United Airlines said that United Airways had "illegally violated" its trademark and "wrongly associated its services with" those of the American airline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asiaiplaw.com/article/2/283/|title=United Airways Ordered to Change its Brand|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Asia IP|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airlinereporter.com/2011/06/united-airlines-takes-on-united-airways-can-we-guess-the-victor/|title=United Airlines takes on United Airways – Can we guess the victor?|date=30 June 2011|publisher=Airlinereporter.com|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] The problem arose when United Airways had services to London Gatwick Airport, which may have confused passengers flying with United Airlines.
In November 2012, United Airways was alleged of inflating its FY 2012-2013 first quarter earnings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=257243|title=United Airways inflates first quarter earnings|date=13 November 2012|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] The Securities and Exchange Commission later formed a panel to look into its irregularities. Earlier in an investigation, the Dhaka Stock Exchange found anomalies in preparing financial statements by United Airways. It also detected a manipulative trading pattern by an individual investor to create artificial demand for the airline shares. The carrier falsified its first quarter earnings' report to show positive earnings per share. United Airways later admitted that it did not show deferred tax in its financial statement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?ref=MjBfMTFfMThfMTJfMV8yXzE1MDM2Mg==|title=DSE seeks regulator's advice on United Airways' revised EPS estimate|date=18 November 2012|publisher=The Financial Express|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl]
In April 2014, CAAB threatened to suspend the carrier's operations due to outstanding aeronautical and non-aeronautical fees of around BDT 77 crore.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/united-airways-in-trouble-20215|title=United Airways in trouble|date=16 April 2014|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/business/2014/04/06/united-airways-saves-licence-paying-tk-10-mln|title=United Airways saves licence paying Tk 10 mln|date=6 April 2014|publisher=bdnews24.com|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] The regulator also imposed a ban on sale or purchase of aircraft by United Airways until it clears all current and outstanding charges in the next one year. CAAB also criticized the airline for not making payments on-time in the past.
