Mimosa Rocks National Park starts at the northern end of Tathra Beach and runs north for about 16 km.

It has five access roads from the Tathra-Bermagui main road.  There are four main campsites in the Mimosa Rocks National Park; Gillards, Middle Beach, Aragannu, and Picnic Point. All campsites have barbecues and non-flush toilets available.
