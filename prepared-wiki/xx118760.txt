Bonnie, aged 14, (Witt) and Hillary, aged 15, (Humphrey) meet at a bus stop in Los Angeles, California and begin a friendship. They stroll around their city, chuck rocks onto a highway from an overpass bridge, run rampant in shopping malls, and play video games. 
Their day escalates into an eruption of violence and rage when they brutally stab an elderly woman to death. They then run to a gas station and attempt to wash off the blood from their clothes. After their arrest, they claim that the murder was purely just for "fun". The story moves from the juvenile detention centre where the girls are kept, to the girls on the day of the killing.
