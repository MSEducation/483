[[Castle Junction]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Alberta, Banff National Park

Castle Junction, also known as the locale of Castle Mountain, is a highway junction where the north extent of the Windermere Highway (Highway 93) intersects with the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1), the Bow River, the historic CPR rail line, and Highway 1A in Banff National Park, Alberta. It is named after the nearby Castle Mountain, clearly visible from the junction.
Work started here in 1910 on the Auto Route of the Great Divide, a project to build a highway across the Rocky Mountains, when construction began on a road from Castle Junction to Banff. Following an interruption caused by the outbreak of World War I, construction wrapped up between 1920 and 1922 when the newly constructed road between Calgary and Banff was joined to the Windermere Highway via the road between Castle Junction and Banff.[tpl]cite news |last=Liddell |first=Ken |title = Mountain Road Built to Fit the Contour | newspaper = Calgary Herald | location = Calgary, Alberta | page = 14 | date = 1953-06-24 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0y9kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9XsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6449,4147684 | accessdate = 2012-09-21[/tpl]
Prime Minister Mackenzie King changed the name of Castle Mountain to Mount Eisenhower in 1946 to honour the World War II general Dwight D. Eisenhower.[tpl]cite news |title = Majestic Mount Eisenhower Is Home of Chinook Wind, Legend Claims | newspaper = Ottawa Citizen | location = Ottawa, Ontario | page = 19 | date = 1946-01-11 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0fwuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E9wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4024,1659378 | accessdate = 2012-09-21[/tpl] Correspondingly, Castle Junction was called Eisenhower Junction.
