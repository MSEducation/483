Maple Town, known as [tpl]Nihongo|Maple Town Stories|メイプルタウン物語|Maple Town Monogatari[/tpl] in Japan is a 1986 anime series created by Chifude Asakura and directed by Junichi Sato. The series is animated by Toei Animation, consisting of 52 half-hour episodes, which aired on TV Asahi in Japan from January 19, 1986 to January 11, 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anime.marumegane.com/1986/mapletown.html|title=Maple Town (メイプルタウン物語) cast and crew information|language=Japanese|publisher=Takashi Murakami|accessdate=2010-01-06[/tpl] It focuses on the adventures of Patty Rabbit, Bobby Bear, and their families, in a small utopian anthropomorphic city named Maple Town. The series gave way to a 50-episode sequel, New Maple Town Stories: Palm Town Chapter, which made Patty Rabbit (and her voice actor, Maya Okamoto) the only ongoing member from both series, although Maple Town's citizens made cameos from time to time. To date, this has not seen an official English release.
The program spawned collectible figurines with changeable clothing as well as houses, furniture, and vehicles; Tonka was the licensee and manufacturer in the US market.[tpl]cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Barbara|title=No blockbusters in sight to boost holiday toy sales|journal=Drug Topics|date=1986-10-20|volume=130|page=46|accessdate=2010-01-06|publisher=Copyright Medical Economics Company[/tpl]

==Production==

Produced of Toei Animation, Asatsu and Asahi Broadcasting, Maple Town was created by Chifude Asakura and directed by Sailor Moon's Junichi Sato. It served as one of the first projects for Kunihiko Ikuhara, who would later go on to join the crew of Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jrt.jp/ikuniweb/works/works1.htm|title=おしごと一覧（東映時代）|language=Japanese|accessdate=2010-01-06|work=ikuniweb|publisher=Shikoku Broadcasting Co., Ltd[/tpl] Ikuhara served as an assistant director and production manager[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:http://www.geocities.jp/paxkoo/mapletvstuff.html|title=Maple Town staff credits (メイプルタウン物語スタッフ)|language=Japanese|url=http://www.geocities.jp/paxkoo/mapletvstuff.html|date=1998-05-29|accessdate=4 January 2010|archivedate=21 December 2009|publisher=Paxkoo's Furry Animation Data Lists[/tpl] for some of the show's later episodes.

===In the United States===

In October 1986, toy manufacturer Tonka acquired the property for US$2.5–3 million[tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&p_theme=mn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EFE48FC426DD736&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|last=Wascoe Jr.|first=Dan|title=Toy makers tuning in to TV show connections|date=16 February 1987|accessdate=25 September 2010|format=Registration required to read article|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|page=03M|quote=In an era when the investment to launch an animated cartoon show ranges from $12 million to $15 million, shrinking viewership means 'the economics are becoming strained,' Toys' president Pat Feely said. 'We don't do it unless we feel we've got a strong product line.' In the case of Tonka's Maple Town series, the cost was much less—between $2.5 million and $3 million—because it's an edited and dubbed version of a popular Japanese show, Feely said.[/tpl] and became its US licensee, launching a toy line and ad campaign early the following year. An English-dubbed version, airing in tandem with the toys' promotion, starred actress Janice Adams as Mrs. Maple in its book-ending live-action segments. Mrs. Maple was the only human inhabitant of the title town in this version, and she offered every episode's moral lesson to audiences. The voice cast included Reba West as Patty Rabbit and Steve Kramer as Wilde Wolf.
The English version of Maple Town was produced by Saban Entertainment and The Maltese Companies,[tpl]cite journal|url=|journal=Television/Radio Age|volume=36|page=55|year=1988|accessdate=2009-12-31|publisher=Television Editorial Corp.|quote=Last season Maltese produced the barter-syndicated series Maple Town and Spiral Zone for Tonka Toys; the former is on Nickelodeon[/tpl] the latter of which also produced Spiral Zone, another syndicated series in which and in whose licensing Tonka was involved, and the 1988 animated feature Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw.

==Broadcast history==

The original Maple Town series aired on Sunday mornings in Japan on TV Asahi, from 19 January 1986 until 11 January 1987. Following its last of 52 episodes, its follow-up, [tpl]Nihongo|New Maple Town Story: Palm Town Chapter|新メイプルタウン物語-パームタウン編 |Shin Maple Town Monogatari: Palm Town Hen[/tpl], aired in the same 8:30 a.m. slot.
In late 1986, Saban Entertainment and toy maker Tonka picked it up for the North American market; the latter invested US$7 million on television ads for the toy line.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Sara E.|last2=Forkan|first2=James P.|title=Fantasy dolls stay in action; High-tech toys finding big consumer interest|date=2 February 1987|accessdate=16 December 2010|work=Advertising Age|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|page=33[/tpl] An English dub premiered in barter syndication the following year before settling into a re-run cycle. The show could also be seen on the children's cable channel Nickelodeon, where it aired until 2 April 1993. A 65-episode run was originally announced,[tpl]cite book|last=Eitzen|first=D.
