Coos Bay is an S-shaped inlet where the Coos River enters the Pacific Ocean, approximately 10 miles (16Â km) long and two miles (three km) wide, on the Pacific Ocean coast of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The city of Coos Bay, once named Marshfield, was renamed for the bay and is located on its inner side. The Port of Coos Bay is the largest and deepest port between San Francisco, California and the Columbia River.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]

Coos Bay is the proposed site of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by Jordan Cove Energy Project. The terminal would export liquified natural gas primarily to overseas market through the proposed [tpl]convert|36|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter[/tpl] Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline which would extend 234 miles from Malin, near Klamath Falls to Jordan Cove on Coos Bay. The terminal and pipeline projects are under regulatory review.
