[[Beer in the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Beer and breweries in the United Kingdom

Beer in the United Kingdom has a long history, and has quite distinct traditions.
The United Kingdom has a rich history of brewing. Historically Bitters, Porters, Stouts and Milds have been the main styles brewed, rather than Lagers or Pilsners. In addition cask conditioned beer is still common, with the beer finishing its maturing in casks in the cellar of the pub rather than at the brewery.

==Economy==

Production of beer in the UK faces a challenge from the rising cost of raw materials and the annual rise in Duty by the government. The regional breweries are developing contract brewing to keep up production, while the production of ale by the newer, smaller breweries grows. Despite an overall drop in beer sales, real ale has increased its market share.http://www.wlancscamra.org.uk/Alecry/Spring%202009.pdf  Brewers such as Shepherd Neame, Greene King and Marston's have invested in cheaper, faster and more efficient production facilities which increase capacity.
Imported beers are increasingly popular. Brewers from Eastern Europe are introducing their brands to the UK. Polish brands Okocim, Lech, Tyskie and Zywiec have also gained a foothold in some areas, especially amongst young Polish migrant workers.
