Frankie and Johnny Are Married is a 2003 comedy film written and directed by Michael Pressman, starring Pressman as well as Lisa Chess and Alan Rosenberg. The film chronicles the troubles a producer has trying to mount a production of the Terrence McNally play, Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune. The production is beset by one problem after another, including a hard to handle male lead (Rosenberg). This eventually leads Pressman to take on the male lead role himself.
