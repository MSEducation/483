[[Hurra (song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1995 singles, Die Ärzte songs, Songs written by Farin Urlaub

"Hurra" (in the booklet of the album, "Hurra!") is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It is the third track and the second single from their 1995 album Planet Punk. In the fadeout, a sample from the movie Clerks can be heard.  The song lyrics state that the situation in Germany after reunification is much better than before, which is meant sarcastically.

==The video==

The video uses the single version of the song, which is slightly altered by some background voices and child's voice in the beginning and in the end. The video features the band performing the song in darkness; all band members are frowning, while the song sounds happy. This affirms that the song is meant sarcastically.
