Kentucky Route 932, also known as KY 932, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Part of the Rural Secondary System, it runs from U.S. Highway 119 northeast of Oven Fork east to the Virginia state line. In Virginia, the road continues east as secondary State Route 671 to the town of Pound. The easternmost five miles (8Â km) of SR 671 were once part of primary State Route 83, but this route never extended to the state line.Map of Wise County, revised July 1, 1936
