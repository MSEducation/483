The Foundation Cup is a rugby league match in Australia held annually before the commencing National Rugby League (NRL) season each year. The Cup was introduced in 2007 and is contested between the Sydney Roosters and Wests Tigers to celebrate the foundation of rugby league in Australia. 
The Sydney Roosters are one of only two clubs still existing from the foundation of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1908. This competition was the predecessor of the current NRL. 
While the Wests Tigers has only been in existence since 2000, it was formed as a merger of two foundation clubs, the Western Suburbs Magpies and the Balmain Tigers.
In 2014 the game was not played due to the already demanding schedule on the teams.[tpl]cite news|last=Proszenko|first=Adrian|title=Foundation Cup all but dead as an NRL pre-season event|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/foundation-cup-all-but-dead-as-an-nrl-preseason-event-20140226-33i4q.html|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 February 2014[/tpl]
