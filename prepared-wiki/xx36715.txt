Lemvig is a municipality (Danish, kommune) in Region Midtjylland on the west coast of the Jutland peninsula in west Denmark.  The municipality covers an area of 510 km², and has a population of 22,067 (2008).  Its mayor is Erik Flyvholm, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.
The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Lemvig.  The town has a population of 7,282.
The current municipality was enlarged on January 1, 2007 as the result of Kommunalreformen ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007) when the former Thyborøn-Harboøre municipality was merged into the existing Lemvig municipality.
A significant part of its southern border is defined by the waters of Bøvling Fjord, Indfjorden and Nissum Fjord.  A string of islands define the western perimeter of the waters south of the municipality; some of these islands belong to the municipality, and others belong to its southern neighbor, Ulfborg-Vemb.  These waters at the municipality's southern border, encompassing the three fjords, plus Fejsted Kog is a national park.
The Lem Cove (Lem Vig) leads into the town of Lemvig from Nissum Bredning.  Lake Ferring (Ferring Sø) lies north of the town of Ferring.
The municipality was originally created in 1970 as the result of a kommunalreform ("Municipal Reform") that merged a number of existing parishes:
