He was born in the village of Truedstorp, Scania, Sweden and died in Gregersboda, Sweden of bone cancer. Kulle was one of the leading Swedish stage actors of his generation and often appeared in TV productions, at the Royal Dramatic Theatre of Stockholm as well as in a number of films, several of these directed by Ingmar Bergman. Taking on many star parts of the classical and modern repertory, appearing in contemporary TV drama and musicals and armed with remarkable gifts for both comedy, romantic drama and slightly declamatory but controlled pathos, he was one of Sweden's most loved modern actors.
In 1965 he won the award for Best Actor for his role in Swedish Wedding Night at the 2nd Guldbagge Awards.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=4689&iv=Awards |title=Swedish Wedding Night |accessdate=2014-02-15 |work=The Swedish Film Database[/tpl] He won his second Guldbagge Best Actor award for Fanny and Alexander at the 19th Guldbagge Awards in 1983.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=5922&iv=Awards |title=Fanny och Alexander (1982) |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |date=9 March 2014[/tpl]
