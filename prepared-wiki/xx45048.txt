==Biography==

===Early life===

Okada was born in what is now Fukui Prefecture to an ex-samurai family. He attended the 15th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, graduating 7th out of a class of 80 cadets in 1889. He served as a midshipman on the ironclad warship Kongō and the cruiser [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2[/tpl]. He was commissioned an ensign on 9 July 1890. He later served as lieutenant on the [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Itsukushima||2[/tpl] and [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Takachiho||2[/tpl] as well as the corvette Hiei.Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy
In the First Sino-Japanese War, Okada served on the [tpl]ship|Japanese battleship|Fuji||2[/tpl]. After his graduation from the Naval Staff College, he subsequently served on the [tpl]ship|Japanese battleship|Shikishima||2[/tpl] and as executive officer on the [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Yaeyama||2[/tpl]. He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 December 1894, to lieutenant-commander on 29 September 1899 and to commander on 13 July 1904.
During the Russo-Japanese War, Okada served as executive officer on a successor of vessels, including the [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Chitose||2[/tpl], [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2[/tpl] and Asahi. He was promoted to captain on 25 September 1908 and given his own command, the Kasuga on 25 July 1910. He later transferred to the [tpl]ship|Japanese cruiser|Kashima||2[/tpl] in 1912.
Promoted to rear admiral in 1 December 1913, Okada served in a number of desk jobs thereafter, including that of the Naval Shipbuilding Command. He was promoted to vice admiral on 1 December 1917 and to full admiral on 11 June 1924.
Okada assumed the post of Commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet in 1924. In 1927, he became Navy Minister in the administration of Tanaka Giichi, but resigned in 1929 to assume the post of military councillor on the Supreme War Council.
Okada was one of the few supporters (Treaty Faction) within the upper ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy of the arms reduction treaty resulting London Naval Conference of 1930, of which he helped negotiate, and he worked hard for its ratification.  He again served as Navy Minister in the Saitō Makoto cabinet of 1932. 
Okada entered the reserves on 21 January 1933 and retired five years later.

===Political career===

In July 1934, Okada was named Prime Minister of Japan holding simultaneously the portfolio of Minister of Colonial Affairs. In the month of September 1935, he also briefly held the portfolio of Minister of Communications. Okada was one of the democratic and moderate voices against the increasing strength of the militarists, and was therefore a major target for extremist forces pushing for a more totalitarian Japan. He narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident of 1936, largely because rebel troops killed his brother-in-law by mistake, as well as his personal secretary, colonel Denzō Matsuo. Okada emerged from hiding on 29 February 1936. However, he left office a few days later.
Okada was adamant in his opposition to the war with the United States. During World War II, Okada formed a group of like-minded politicians and military officers seeking an early end to the hostilities. After the defeat of Japanese forces at the Battle of Midway and Battle of Guadalcanal, Okada pushed for negotiations with the Allies, and played a leading role in the overthrow of the Hideki Tōjō cabinet in 1944.
Okada died in 1952, and his grave is at the Tama Reien Cemetery, in Fuchū, Tokyo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=20539 |title=Find-a-Grave website |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23[/tpl]
