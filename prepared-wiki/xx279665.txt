[[Railway stations in Chennai]]

CATEGORIES: Railway stations in Chennai, Chennai railway division

The city of Chennai, the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and also the headquarters of the Southern Railway Zone,http://www.sr.indianrailways.gov.in/ is served by several railway stations that form a part of the city's complex local and regional rail network.
There are primarily two train stations in the city namely the Chennai Central railway station and the Chennai Egmore railway station, that form the major railway hubs of the city with direct links to all other major cities in the country.
The rest of the stations function mainly to handle the local traffic though certain train stations like Tambaram, Chennai Beach, Perambur, and Avadi are fast becoming important transit hubs in the regional rail traffic.
Fundamentally Chennai has 4 suburban railway lines,[tpl]cite web|title=Project Brief of Chennai Metro Rail|url=http://chennaimetrorail.gov.in/pdf/project_brief_updated_aug08.pdf|work=CMRL|publisher=Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL)|accessdate=24 May 2013[/tpl] namely North line, West line, South line and MRTS line. The South West line, West North line and West South line are merely minor extensions or modifications of the aforementioned suburban lines. The MRTS is a suburban railway line that chiefly runs on an elevated track exclusively used for running local EMUs or suburban local trains. No express trains or passenger trains run on MRTS line.
