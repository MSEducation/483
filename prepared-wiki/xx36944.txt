==Broager municipality==

Until January 1, 2007, Broager was also a municipality (Danish, kommune). The area was formerly known as Northern Schleswig. The municipality covered an area of 43 km², and had a total population of 6,290 (2005). Its last mayor was Jørn Lehmann Petersen, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party.
The municipality was established in 1922 by merging Egernsund and Broager parishes.  The municipality escaped further municipal reforms in 1970 as its population was then over 6,000 inhabitants. Today it's 11,000. However, Broager municipality ceased to exist due to Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007). It was combined with Augustenborg, Gråsten, Nordborg, Sundeved, Sydals, and Sønderborg municipalities to form the new Sønderborg municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 499 km² and a total population of 49,886 (2005).
