==History==

The McDowell's No.1 brand began with the launch of McDowell's No.1 Brandy in 1963-64 by McDowell and Company, a company that the United Breweries Group had acquired in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1121110/jsp/frontpage/story_16181340.jsp |title=Diageo bottles Mallya genie |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=2012-11-10 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl] In 1959, owner Vittal Mallya established McDowell and Company's first distillery at Cherthala, Kerala on the banks of the Vembanad lake. McDowell's began bottling Bisquit Brandy and Dorville French Brandy, from imported concentrates. The company commissioned India's first ever distillation plant to produce extra neutral alcohol (ENA), with French collaboration, at Cherthala in 1961. McDowell's launched its own McDowell's No.1 Brandy in 1963-64, following the termination of the import contract for No.1 Bisquit Brandy. The brand created the template for the many "No. 1" brands that the company would launch later. The company launched McDowell's No.1 whisky in 1968, which went on to become USL's flagship brand. McDowell's No.1 Rum was launched in Celebration (Dark) and Caribbean (White) variants in 1990-91.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unitedspirits.in/mcdowells-no-1-celebration-rum.aspx |title=McDowell's No.1 Celebration Rum |publisher=Unitedspirits.in |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]
The company was incorporated in the year 1999 as McDowell Sprits Ltd, and changed its name from McDowell Sprits Ltd to McDowell & Company Ltd on 1 April 2000. The company changed their name again to the current name United Spirits Limited (USL), with effect from 17 October 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/Company/Background/Company-Profile/United-Spirits-Ltd/532432 |title=United Spirits Ltd Background details about Company Profile |publisher=Indiainfoline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] In 2000, Claessens International, a London-based design consulting firm, to revamp the bottle design and packaging of the entire McDowell's No.1 series. The company terminated its existing arrangement with Paul Simmons & Associates. McDowell's No.1 whisky introduced a "guala" cap, restricting the easy flow of the liquor, in February 2002, replacing the earlier metal one. The name on the label was changed from "No. 1 McDowell" to "McDowell No.1". The shape of the bottle was also changed, with "shoulders" being incorporated instead of the previous flat look. The changes were designed by Cleassons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2002/02/26/stories/2002022601080900.htm |title=UB relaunches flagship brand McDowell No. 1 |publisher=Business Line |date=2002-02-26 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl] In December 2004, the packaging of the 750ml pack of McDowell's No.1 whisky was changed to a 3 layered combination of MetPET (metalised PET) with a Polyester layer on either sides, which made the pack 100% tamper proof. Once opened the pack cannot be sealed again hence making counterfeiting impossible.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2004-12-02/news/27387266_1_pack-alok-gupta-counterfeiting |title=McDowell’s No.1 gets a new packaging |publisher=The Economic Times |date=2004-12-02 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]
