==History==

The cave paintings at Roca dels Moros, El Cogul, are the most important vestiges of prehistoric settlement in Les Garrigues. A Neolithic tomb has been found at Les Borges Blanques. During the Iberian era, the comarca was settled by the Ilergetians. There is documentation also for Roman summer residences and country villas,  particularly in the north, but the Roman influence died out soon after. http://www.grec.net/cgibin/dificil.pgm?USUARI=&SESSIO=&PGMORI=E&NDCHEC=0029271
