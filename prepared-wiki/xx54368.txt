The Mass in B minor (BWV 232) by Johann Sebastian Bach is a musical setting of the complete Latin Mass. The work was one of Bach's last compositions, not completed until 1749, the year before his death. Much of the Mass gave new form to vocal music that Bach had composed throughout his career, dating back (in the case of the "Crucifixus") to 1714, but extensively revised. To complete the work, in the late 1740s Bach composed new sections of the Credo such as "Et incarnatus est".
It was unusual for composers working in the Lutheran tradition to compose a Missa tota and Bach's motivations remain a matter of scholarly debate. The Mass was never performed in totality during Bach's lifetime; the first documented complete performance took place in 1859. Since the nineteenth century it has been widely hailed as one of the greatest compositions in history, and today it is frequently performed and recorded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stlsymphony.org/calendar/view.aspx?id=3023 |title=Bach Mass in B minor |publisher=STL Symphony |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coasttocoasttickets.com/concerts/massinbminor_tickets.shtml |title=Mass in B Minor Tickets – Mass in B Minor Concert Tour Schedule – Mass in B Minor Ticket Broker |publisher=Coasttocoasttickets.com |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2012-05-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classictic.com/en/Bach-Mass-in-B-minor/20212/143124 |title=Bach: Mass in B minor, Rome |location=it |publisher=Classictic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityrecitalhall.com/events/id/1213/Bach-s-Mass-in-B-Minor/ |title=Bach's Mass in B Minor » St James' Church |publisher=Cityrecitalhall.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27[/tpl] Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach had archived this work as the Great Catholic Mass. 

==Background and context==

On February 1, 1733 Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, died. Five months of mourning followed, during which all public music-making was suspended. Bach used the opportunity to work on the composition of a Missa, a portion of the liturgy sung in Latin and common to both the Lutheran and Roman Catholic rites. His aim was to dedicate the work to the new sovereign Augustus III, a Catholic, with the hope of obtaining the title "Electoral Saxon Court Composer". Upon its completion, Bach visited Augustus III and presented him with a copy of the Missa, together with a petition to be given a court title, dated July 27, 1733; in the accompanying inscription on the wrapper of the mass he complains that he had "innocently suffered one injury or another" in Leipzig.An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T. David and Arthur Mendel, The Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents, W. W. Norton & Company, 1945, p. 128. (Also in The New Bach Reader: A Life of Johann Sebastian Bach in Letters and Documents revised by Christoph Wolff, W. W. Norton & Co Inc, 1998, ISBN 978-0-393-04558-1, p. 158.) The petition did not meet with immediate success, but Bach eventually got his title; he was made court composer to Augustus III in 1736.
In the last years of his life, Bach expanded the Missa into a complete setting of the Latin Ordinary. It is not known what prompted this creative effort. Wolfgang Osthoff and other scholars have suggested that Bach intended the completed Mass in B minor for performance at the dedication of the new Hofkirche in Dresden, which was begun in 1738 and was nearing completion by the late 1740s. However, the building was not completed until 1751, and Bach's death in July, 1750 prevented his Mass from being submitted for use at the dedication. Instead, Johann Adolph Hasse's Mass in D minor was performed, a work with many similarities to Bach's Mass (the Credo movements in both works feature chant over a walking bass line, for example).Stauffer, pp. 258–59. Other explanations are less event-specific, involving Bach's interest in "encyclopedic" projects (like The Art of Fugue) that display a wide range of styles, and Bach's desire to preserve some of his best vocal music in a format with wider potential future use than the church cantatas they originated in (see "Movements and their sources" below).

==Chronology==

The chronology of the Mass in B minor has attracted extensive scholarly attention. Recent literature suggests:

==Title==

Bach did not give the B minor Mass a title. Instead, he organized the 1748–49 manuscript into four folders, each with a different title. That containing the Kyrie and Gloria he called "1. Missa"; that containing the Credo he titled "2. Symbolum Nicenum"; the third folder, containing the Sanctus, he called "3. Sanctus"; and the remainder, in a fourth folder he titled "4. Osanna | Benedictus | Agnus Dei et | Dona nobis pacem". John Butt writes, "The format seems purposely designed so that each of the four sections could be used separately."John Butt, "Mass in B Minor", in Oxford Composer Companions: J. S. Bach, ed. Malcolm Boyd and John Butt, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 284 On the other hand, the parts in the manuscript are numbered from 1 to 4, and Bach's usual closing formula (S.D.G = Soli Deo Gloria) is only found at the end of the Dona Nobis Pacem. Further, Butt writes, "What is most remarkable about the overall shape of the Mass in B Minor is that Bach managed to shape a coherent sequence of movements from diverse material."John Butt, "Mass in B Minor", in Oxford Composer Companions: J. S. Bach, ed. Malcolm Boyd and John Butt, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 286 ButtJohn Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 92–101 and George StaufferGeorge B. Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, Schirmer Books, 1997, pp. 250–55 detail the ways in which Bach gave overall musical unity to the work.
The first overall title given to the work was in the 1790 estate of the recently deceased C.P.E. Bach, who inherited the score. There, it is called "Die grosse catholische Messe" (the "Great Catholic Mass"). It is called that as well in the estate of his last heir in 1805, suggesting to Stauffer that "the epithet reflects an oral tradition within the Bach family".George Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, p. 180 The first publication of the Kyrie and Gloria, in 1833 by the Swiss collector Hans Georg Nägeli with Simrock, refers to it as "Messe"http://www.zb.uzh.ch/ausstellungen/exponat/006071/ Finally, Nageli and Simrock produced the first publication in 1845, calling it the "High Mass in B Minor" (Hohe Messe in h-moll).http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/bach,-johann-sebastian.-3-c-buujhcs55e The adjective "high", Butt argues, was "strongly influenced by the monumental impact of Beethoven's Missa solemnis."John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 92–101 It soon fell from common usage, but the prepositional phrase "in B Minor" survives, even though it is in some ways misleading: only five of the work's 27 movements are in B minor, while twelve, including the final ones of each of the four major sections, are in D major (the relative major of B minor). The opening Kyrie, however, is in B minor, with the Christe Eleison in D major, and the second Kyrie in F-sharp minor; as Butt points out, these tonalities outline a B minor chord.John Butt, "Mass in B Minor", in Oxford Composer Companions: J. S. Bach, ed. Malcolm Boyd and John Butt, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 287
==Orchestration== 
The piece is orchestrated for two flutes, two oboes d'amore, one natural horn (in D), three trumpets (in D), timpani, violins I and II, violas and basso continuo (cellos, basses, bassoons, organ and harpsichord).

==Performance history==

===In Bach's lifetime===

Bach conducted the Sanctus, in its first version, at the 1724 Christmas service in Leipzig, and re-used it in Christmas services in the mid-1740s.Gregory Butler, "Johann Sebastian Bachs Gloria in excelsis Deo BWV 191: Musik für ein Leipziger Dankfest", Bach Jahrbuch 78 (1992), pp. 65–71 Scholars differ on whether he ever performed the 1733 Missa. Arnold Schering (in 1936) asserted that it was performed in Leipzig on April 26, 1733, when Augustus III of Poland visited the town, but modern scholars reject his argument for several reasons: 1) the proposed date fell during an official period of mourning "when concerted music was forbidden in Saxon churches";George F. Stauffer, Bach, the Mass in B Minor: The Great Catholic Mass, Yale University Press, 2003, ISBN 0-300-09966-5, ISBN 978-0-300-09966-9, p. 34. 2) the extant parts (on which Schering based his hypothesis) are written on a paper found only in documents in Dresden, so were probably copied in Dresden when Bach went there in July;Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 34. and 3) the copyists were not Bach's usual ones, but Bach and immediate family members (who traveled with him to Dresden)—his wife Anna Magdalena, sons Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel—and a Dresden copyist.Stauffer, Bach, the Mass in B Minor: The Great Catholic Mass p. 34. John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press, 1991, ISBN 978-0-521-38716-3, pp. 10–11.
Scholars differ, however, on whether the Missa was performed in July in Dresden. Christoph Wolff argues that on July 26, 1733 at the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Wilhelm Friedemann Bach had been organist since June, it "was definitely performed ... as evidenced by the extant Dresden performing parts and by the inscription on the title wrapper" given to the king the next day.Christoph Wolff, Bach: The Learned Musician, W.W. Norton, 2000, pp. 368–370, ISBN=0-393-04825-X Hans-Joachim Schulze made this case by pointing to the use of the past tense in the wrapper's inscription: "To his royal majesty was shown with the enclosed Missa...the humble devotion of the author J. S. Bach.""Gegen /S..Koniglichen Hoheit und/ ChurFurstlichen Durchlaucht zu/ Sachssen/ besizgte mit inliegener/ Missa.... Seine unterthanigste Devotion der Autor J. S. Bach"; translation John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor pp. 11–12. However, Joshua Rikfin rejects the argument, pointing out that the past-tense wording was typical of formal address often not related to performance.Joshua Rifkin, Review of facsimile editions of Bach's Mass in B Minor, Notes 44 (1988), pp. 787–98 Also skeptical is Peter Williams, who notes that "there is no record of performers being assembled for such an event, and in August 1731 Friedemann reported that the Sophienkirche organ was badly out of tune."Peter Williams, J.S. Bach: A Life in Music, Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 219–20, ISBN=978-0-521-87074-0 However, there is evidence of an organ recital by Bach at the Sophienkirche on 14 September 1731, and Friedemann Bach was only chosen as Organist for the institution on 23 June 1733. He would again perform a 2-hour Organ recital on 1 December 1736 at the Frauenkirche Dresden to inaugurate the new Gottfried Silbermann organ.
Scholars agree that no other public performances took place in Bach's lifetime, although Butt raises the possibility that there may have been a private performance or read-through of the Symbolum Nicenum late in Bach's life.John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, pp. 20–21.

===Later 18th century===

The first public performance of the Symbolum Nicenum section (under the title "Credo or Nicene Creed") took place 36 years after Bach's death, in Spring of 1786, led by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach at a benefit concert for the Medical Institute for the Poor in Hamburg.Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 182–83.

===19th century===

As recounted by George Stauffer,Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 187–98. the next documented performance (not public) in the nineteenth century was when Carl Friedrich Zelter—a key figure in the 19th-century Bach revival—led the Berlin Singakademie in read-throughs of the "Great Mass" in 1811, covering the Kyrie; in 1813 he led read-throughs of the entire work. The first public performance in the century—of just the Credo section—took place in Frankfurt in March, 1828, with over 200 performers and many instrumental additions. In the same year in Berlin, Gaspare Spontini led the Credo section, adding 15 new choral parts and numerous instruments. A number of performances of sections of the Mass took place in the following decades in Europe, but the first attested public performance of the Mass in its entirety took place in 1859 in Leipzig, with Karl Riedel and the Riedel-Verein.

===20th century===

The Bach Choir of Bethlehem performed the American premiere of the complete Mass on March 27, 1900, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, though there is evidence that parts of the Mass had been performed in the USA as early as 1870.Butt, p. 31.
From early in the century, authors such as Albert Schweitzer, Arnold Schering, and Frederick Smend called for smaller performance forces, and experiments with (relatively) smaller groups began in the late 1920s.Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 198–203. 
The first complete recording of the work was made in 1929, with a large choir and the London Symphony Orchestra led by Albert Coates.http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Articles/MBM-TNT.htm As of 2013, a database lists over 200 recordings with many different types of forces and performance styles.http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV232-Rec1.htm The work has played a central role in the historical performance movement: Nikolaus Harnoncourt made the first recording with period instruments in 1968 (his second Bach choral recording), and won High Fidelity's best record of the year award; Joshua Rifkin's first recording using the one-voice-per-part vocal scoring he proposes was made in 1982,Nonesuch 79036-2, 1982 and won a 1983 Gramophone Award.

==Status==

The Mass in B minor is widely regarded as one of the supreme achievements of classical music. Alberto Basso summarizes the work as follows:  The Mass in B minor is the consecration of a whole life: started in 1733 for "diplomatic" reasons, it was finished in the very last years of Bach's life, when he had already gone blind. This monumental work is a synthesis of every stylistic and technical contribution the Cantor of Leipzig made to music. But it is also the most astounding spiritual encounter between the worlds of Catholic glorification and the Lutheran cult of the cross."The 'Great Mass' in B minor" in the booklet to the recording by Philippe Herreweghe and Collegium Vocale Gent, released from Harmonia Mundi, HML5901614.15, 1999.http://www.harmoniamundi.com/uk/album_fiche.php?album_id=1130 
Scholars have suggested that the Mass in B minor belongs in the same category as The Art of Fugue, as a summation of Bach's deep lifelong involvement with musical tradition—in this case, with choral settings and theology. Bach scholar Christoph Wolff describes the work as representing "a summary of his writing for voice, not only in its variety of styles, compositional devices, and range of sonorities, but also in its high level of technical polish ... Bach's mighty setting preserved the musical and artistic creed of its creator for posterity."Christoph Wolff, Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician, W. W. Norton & Company, 2000, ISBN 0-393-32256-4, pp. 441–42.
The Mass was described in the 19th century by the editor Hans Georg Nägeli as "The Announcement of the Greatest Musical Work of All Times and All People" ("Ankündigung des größten musikalischen Kunstwerkes aller Zeiten und Völker").'Markus Rathey, Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B Minor: The Greatest Artwork of All Times and All People The Tangeman Lecture delivered April 18, 2003 Even though it had never been performed, its importance was appreciated by some of Bach's greatest successors—by the beginning of the 19th century Forkel and Haydn possessed copies, and Beethoven made two attempts to acquire a score.John Butt Mass in B Minor—Bach's only complete setting of the latin ordinary of the Mass

===Sources and editions===

Two autograph sources exist: the parts for the Kyrie and Gloria sections that Bach deposited in Dresden in 1733, and the score of the complete work that Bach compiled in 1748–50, which was inherited by C.P.E. Bach (the autograph has been published in facsimile from the source in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.Facsimile Announcement However, for his 1786 public performance of the Symbolum Nicenum, C.P.E. Bach, as was typical practice in the era, made additions to the autograph score for performance—adding a 28-bar introduction, replacing the now-obsolete oboe d'amore with newer instruments (clarinets, oboes, or violins) and making other changes in instrumentation for his own aesthetic reasons—and also wrote in his own solutions to reading some passages made nearly illegible by Bach's late-life handwriting problems.Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 183–85.Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, p. 26. For this and other reasons, the Mass in B minor poses a considerable challenge to prospective editors, and substantial variations can be noted in different editions, even critical urtext editions. When the Bach Gesellschaft edition was published in 1856, problems were so evident that the society published a revised edition the next year—which was, however, eventually recognized to be even less accurate.Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, pp. 30-31 Similarly, the 1954 edition by the Neue Bach-Ausgabe was shown to be severely faulty within five years.[tpl]cite book|title=Friedrich Smends Ausgabe der h-moll-Messe von J.S.

Recent decades have seen the publication of two new scholarly editions: those of Christoph Wolff, published by Peters in 1997,Johann Sebastian Bach, Messe in h-Moll BWV 232. Neue Ausgabe (C. F. Peters: Frankfurt/Main, 1997), 408 pp. and Joshua Rifkin, published by Breitkopf & Härtel in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.breitkopf.com/inventory/werk/8492?sr.komponistId=42&sr.epochen=&was=2%2C1&sr.query=rifkin&sr.besetzungen=|title=Breitkopf & Härtel - Bach, Johann Sebastian (1685-1750): Messe h-moll BWV 232|language=German|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl] Wolff uses two copies of the 1748–50 manuscript made before C.P.E. Bach's adulterations to try to reconstruct Bach's original readings, and seeks to recover performance details by using all available sources including movements that Bach reworked in the B minor Mass.George Stauffer, Bach: Mass in B Minor, Schirmer, 1997, p. 268 Rifkin, too, seeks to remove the C.P.E. Bach emendations, but differs from Wolff in arguing that the 1748–50 work is, to quote John Butt, "essentially a different entity from the 1733 Missa, and that a combination of the 'best' readings from both does not really correspond to Bach's final (and virtually completed) conception of the work";[tpl]cite web|title=notes to the recording of the B minor Mass by the Dunedin Consort, Linn CDK 354|author=John Butt|url=http://www.linnrecords.com/recording-j-s-bach-mass-in-b-minor-breitkopf-hartel-edition-edited-by-j-rifkin-2006.aspx|accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl] Rifkin's version seeks to adhere to this final version.

==Movements and their sources==

The work consists of 27 sections. Tempo and metrical information and parodied sources come from Christoph Wolff's 1997 critical urtext edition, and from George Stauffer's Bach: The Mass in B Minor.Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, p. 294. except where noted. Regarding sources, Stauffer, summarizing current research as of 1997, states that "Specific models or fragments can be pinpointed for eleven of the work's twenty-seven movements" and that "two other movements "Domine Deus" and "Et resurrexit" are most probably derived from specific, now lost sources."Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, pp. 48–49. But Stauffer adds "there is undoubtedly much more borrowing than this." Exceptions are the opening four bars of the first Kyrie,Butt, p. 44. the Et incarnatus est and Confiteor.Butt, p. 56. 
Butt points out that "only with a musical aesthetic later than Bach's does the concept of parody (adapting existing vocal music to a new text) appear in an unfavourable light" while it was "almost unavoidable" in Bach's day;John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press, 1991, ISBN 978-0-521-38716-3, p. 42. he further notes that "by abstracting movements from what he evidently considered some of his finest vocal works, originally performed for specific occasions and Sundays within the Church's year, he was doubtless attempting to preserve the pieces within the more durable context of the Latin Ordinary."John Butt, "Mass in B Minor", from Oxford Composer Companions: J. S. Bach, ed. Malcolm Boyd and John Butt, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 285 Details of the parodied movements and their sources are given below.
