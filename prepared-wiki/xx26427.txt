Ely left the band after Forever Now, though he would return for the 1988 single "All That Money Wants" and the 1989 album Book of Days. Phill Calvert played drums on their subsequent tour, but left before the recording of The Furs' 1984 release Mirror Moves. Mirror Moves was produced by Keith Forsey (who also programmed the drums and became the band's drummer), and featured the songs "The Ghost in You" and "Heaven". Both charted in the UK, and "Heaven" became the band's highest charting UK hit at the time, peaking at No. 29. Columbia Records opted for "Here Come Cowboys" for the corresponding US release but it failed to chart, but "The Ghost In You" was a hit on the Billboard Hot 100. 
In Canada, "The Ghost In You" also charted and Toronto's new wave radio station CFNY listed the parent album Mirror Moves as the No. 1 LP of 1984.The CFNY Spirit Of Radio Fan Page  Mirror Moves became a Top 20 album on the Canadian LP chart.  
By the mid-1980s, the band had become a staple on both US college and modern rock radio stations.  Simultaneously, they were experiencing consistent mainstream success, placing several singles in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Still, according to biographer Dave Thompson, they would "have more impact on future musicians than they ever did in the marketplace".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In 1986, the band recorded a new version of "Pretty in Pink" for the soundtrack of the film of the same name.  Released as a single, it became their biggest hit to that time in the US, and their biggest UK hit. Butler later claimed that the success of "Pretty in Pink" caused the band to be pressured into entering the recording studio to record a follow-up release before they were ready.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] The result was Midnight to Midnight, their biggest Top 40 success to date, but an album Richard Butler later characterized as "hollow, vapid and weak".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] A more overtly commercial effort than the Furs had ever recorded before, the album also featured the single "Heartbreak Beat", which charted in the US Top 40.  The album also featured drummer Paul Garisto and saxophonist Mars Williams, both of whom continue to tour with the band.
In the wake of Midnight To Midnight, the Furs issued "All That Money Wants", a 1988 track recorded for a best-of compilation album All of This and Nothing.  1989's Book of Days also saw a return of Ely, while 1991's World Outside was their final commercial release.
From 1988 on, The Furs' singles had steady chart success with three No. 1 hits on the newly established US Modern Rock chart between 1988 and 1991. "All That Money Wants" was a No. 1 hit in 1988, while "House" topped the chart in 1990, and "Until She Comes" was No. 1 in 1991.

===Hiatus and reunion===

The band went on extended hiatus in the early 1990s, with the Butler brothers going on to found Love Spit Love together with Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer.  After spending most of the decade apart, the Butlers along with Ashton re-formed The Psychedelic Furs in 2000 with Ferrer and Fortus, and released a live album Beautiful Chaos: Greatest Hits Live, which included a new studio recording, "Alive (For Once In My Lifetime)".  A DVD version of the performance included live versions of "Alive" and three other previously unreleased songs: "Anodyne (Better Days)", "Cigarette" and "Wrong Train".
In 2006, lead singer Richard Butler has released an eponymous solo album, Richard Butler. Since reforming in 2001, band continues to tour around the world. The current Psychedelic Furs touring line-up is Richard Butler, Tim Butler, Paul Garisto, Mars Williams, Amanda Kramer and Rich Good.
In 2011, the band launched a World Tour performing the album Talk Talk Talk in its entirety.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stevestav.com/2011/05/psychedelic-furs-talk-talk-talk.html/ |title=The Psychedelic Furs' 'Talk Talk Talk Interview' |author=Stav, Steve |date=6 May 2011 |work=Intermittent Signals |accessdate=10 May 2011 [/tpl]
