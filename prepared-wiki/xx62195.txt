In professional American football, the Pro Bowl is the all-star game of the National Football League (NFL). From the merger with the rival American Football League (AFL) in 1970 up through 2013, it was officially called the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl, matching the top players in the American Football Conference (AFC) against those in the National Football Conference (NFC).  Beginning in 2014, the teams will not be based on the two conferences, and will instead be chosen by two team captains in a televised fantasy draft four days prior to the game.
Unlike most other North American sports leagues, which hold their all-star games roughly midway through their respective regular seasons, the Pro Bowl is played around the end of the NFL season. Between the 1970 merger and 2009, it was usually held on the weekend after the Super Bowl. Since 2010, the Pro Bowl has been played on the weekend one week after the Conference Championship games, one week before the Super Bowl.
The NFL's all-star game has a tattered image.[tpl]cite news |title=NFC reels in five picks to throttle AFC in Pro Bowl |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=January 30, 2011 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=310130032 |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |quote=The NFC's 55-41 victory, a game not nearly as interesting as that score would indicate, did nothing to repair the tattered image of the NFL's all-star contest.

==History of the Pro Bowl==

The first "Pro All-Star Game," featuring the all-stars of the 1938 season (as well as three players from the Hollywood Stars and Los Angeles Bulldogs, who were not members of the league), was played on January 15, 1939 at Los Angeles's Wrigley Field.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Fred R.|title=The First Pro Bowl Game|journal=The Coffin Corner|year=1990|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/12-04-407.pdf|accessdate=January 31, 2012|format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/657266pyx |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gill |first=Bob |title=The Best Of The Rest: Part One |journal=The Coffin Corner |year=1983|volume=5|issue=11|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/05-11-162.pdf |accessdate=January 31, 2012|format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6572Gzjau |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The NFL All-Star Game was played again in Los Angeles in 1940 and then in New York and Philadelphia in 1941 and 1942 respectively. Although originally planned as an annual contest, the all-star game was discontinued after 1942 because of travel restrictions put in place during World War II.[tpl]cite news|title=Pro Bowl game approved by National Grid League|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=evQiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ds0FAAAAIBAJ&dq=pro%20bowl&pg=1317%2C3616331|accessdate=January 30, 2012|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=June 4, 1950|agency=AP|page=21[/tpl] During the first five all-star games, an all-star team would face that year's league champion. The league champion won the first four games before the all-stars were victorious in the final game of this early series.
The concept of an all-star game would not be revived until June 1950, when the newly christened "Pro Bowl" was approved. The game was sponsored by the Los Angeles Publishers Association. It was decided that the game would feature all-star teams from each of the league's two divisions rather than the league champion versus all-star format which had been used previously. This was done to avoid confusion with the Chicago College All-Star Game, an annual game which featured the league champion against a collegiate all-star team. The teams would be led by the coach of each of the division champions.
The first 21 games of the series (1951–1972) were played in Los Angeles, California. The site of the game was changed annually for each of the next seven years before the game was moved to Aloha Stadium in Halawa, Hawaii for thirty consecutive seasons from 1980 through 2009. The 2010 Pro Bowl was played at Sun Life Stadium, the home stadium of the Miami Dolphins and host site of Super Bowl XLIV, on January 31, the first time ever that the Pro Bowl was held before the championship game, with the new rule that the conference teams do not include players from the teams that will be playing in the Super Bowl. The Pro Bowl then returned to Hawaii in 2011, but again held during the week before the Super Bowl.
The 2012 game was met with criticism from fans and sports writers for the lack of poor play by the players (see below). On October 24, 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had second thoughts about the Pro Bowl, telling a Sirius XM show that if the players did not play more competitively the 2013 Pro Bowl, he was "not inclined to play it anymore."[tpl]cite web|last=Hofmann|first=Sarah|title=NFL commissioner may axe Pro Bowl|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/23/nfl-commissioner-may-axe-pro-bowl/|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=25 October 2012[/tpl]Players defend Pro Bowl after 62-35 NFC win. Associated Press. Retrieved January 28, 2013. During the ensuing off-season, the NFL Players Association lobbied to keep the Pro Bowl, and negotiated several rule changes to be implemented for the 2014 game. Among them, the teams will no longer be AFC vs. NFC, and instead be selected by captains in a fantasy draft. For the 2014 game, Jerry Rice and Deion Sanders were chosen as alumni captains, while their captains were Drew Brees and Robert Quinn (Rice), along with Jamaal Charles and J. J. Watt (Sanders).
On April 9, 2014, the NFL announced that the 2015 Pro Bowl will be played the week prior to the Super Bowl at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona on January 25, 2015. The game will then move back to Hawaii in 2016. It was also announced that the "unconferenced" format will continue.[tpl]cite web |title=2015 Pro Bowl to be Played in Arizona; 2016 Pro Bowl Slated for Hawaii |url=http://nflcommunications.com/2014/04/09/2015-pro-bowl-to-be-played-in-arizona-2016-pro-bowl-slated-for-hawaii/ |publisher=National Football League |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409212415/http://nflcommunications.com/2014/04/09/2015-pro-bowl-to-be-played-in-arizona-2016-pro-bowl-slated-for-hawaii/ |archivedate=April 9, 2014 |date=April 9, 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Player selection==

Currently, players are voted into the Pro Bowl by the coaches, the players themselves, and the fans. Each group's ballots count for one third of the votes. The fans vote online at the NFL's official website. There are also replacements that go to the game should any selected player be unable to play due to injuries. Prior to 1995, only the coaches and the players made Pro Bowl selections.
In order to be considered a Pro Bowler for a given year, a player must either have been one of the initial players selected to the team, or a player who accepts an invitation to the Pro Bowl as an alternate; invited alternates who decline to attend are not considered Pro Bowlers. Being a Pro Bowler is considered to be a mark of honor, and players who are accepted into the Pro Bowl are considered to be elite.
Starting in 2014, players will not play on their respective conferences, and will instead be placed in a draft pool, and be chosen by team captains.[tpl]cite web|author=Associated Press|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl-pro-bowl-rosters-determined-180337907--nfl.html|title=NFL Pro Bowl rosters to be determined by draft|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2013[/tpl]

==Coaching staffs==

When the Pro Bowl was held after the Super Bowl, the head coaches were traditionally the head coaches of the teams that lost in the AFC and NFC championship games for the same season of the Pro Bowl in question. From 1978 through 1982, the head coaches of the highest ranked divisional champion that lost in the Divisional Playoff Round were chosen.[tpl]cite news |title=Marchibroda, Knox Pro Bowl Coaches |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=feST4K8J0scC&dat=19771228&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |date=December 28, 1977 |accessdate=December 26, 2013[/tpl] For the 1983 Pro Bowl, the NFL resumed selecting the losing head coaches in the conference championship games. In the 1999 Pro Bowl, New York Jets head coach Bill Parcells, after his team lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game, had to decline due to health reasons and Jets assistant head coach Bill Belichick took his place.[tpl]cite news |title=Parcells Needs Rest, Passes on Pro Bowl |publisher=LA Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/27/sports/sp-2166 |date=January 27, 1999 |accessdate=January 28, 2013[/tpl]
After the Pro Bowl was moved to the weekend between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl, the team that lost in the Divisional Playoff Round with the best regular-season record would have their coaching staffs lead their respective conference Pro Bowl team returning to the format used from 1978-1982. If the losing teams of each conference had the same regular season record the coaches from the higher-seeded team will get the Pro Bowl honor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story?id=09000d5d81554233&template=with-video-with-comments&confirm=true |title=Pro Bowl selections, like game itself, will have new wrinkles |first=Steve |last=Wyche |work=NFL.com |publisher=National Football League |date=December 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2010 [/tpl] Starting in 2014, the Pro Bowl coaches will come from the two teams with the best records that lost in the Divisional Playoffs.

==Game honors==

A Player of the Game was honored from 1951–56. From 1957–71, awards were presented to both an Outstanding Back and an Outstanding Lineman. In 1972, there were awards for both an Outstanding Offensive Player and an Outstanding Defensive Player. From 1973–2007, only one Player of the Game award was honored (though three times this award has been presented to multiple players in a single game). In 2008 the award was changed to Most Valuable Player (MVP).[tpl]cite journal |title=All-Time Results|magazine=2011 NFL Pro Bowl Official Game Program |publisher=NFL Publishing |year=2011 |pages=191–92 |url=http://www.probowlgameprogram-nfl-hozimman.com/probowlgameprogram/2011#pg194 |accessdate=February 2, 2011[/tpl]
Players are paid for participating in the game with the winning team receiving a larger payout. In the 2011 season, a record $50,000 was awarded for a win versus $25,000 for the losers. In 2012, this was increased to $65,000 and $40,000, respectively, only to be reduced back to the $50,000 and $25,000 purses for 2013.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] The next year, the winners took  $53,000 and the losers $26,000.

==Rule differences==

The Pro Bowl has different rules from other NFL games to make the game safer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blogandtackle.net/2011/01/27/2011-afc-nfc-pro-bowl-facts-and-figures/ |title=2011 AFC-NFC Pro Bowl Facts and Figures |accessdate=January 30, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://boston.sbnation.com/new-england-patriots/2011/1/30/1964417/pro-bowl-2011-time-probowl-rosters-coaches-afc-nfc-rules-weather |title=2011 Pro Bowl: Time, Announcers, Rosters And More For NFL's All-Star Event |accessdate=January 30, 2011 [/tpl]
In case of a tie after regulation, multiple 15-minute OT periods will be played (with each team receiving three time outs per two OTs), and teams receive one possession to score unless one of them scores a touchdown or safety on its first possession. True sudden death rules apply thereafter if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. (In general, beyond the 1st overtime, whoever scores first wins.)

==Pro Bowl uniforms==

The teams are made of players from different NFL teams, so using their own uniforms would be too confusing. The players each wear the helmet of their team, but the home jerseys and pants are either a solid blue for the NFC or solid red for the AFC, with white jerseys with blue or red accents, respectively, for the away team. While it had been speculated that the color of Pro Bowl jerseys was determined by the winner of the Super Bowl—as it had been played post-Super Bowl for many years—this is untrue. The design of Pro Bowl uniforms is changed every two years, and the color and white jerseys are rotated along with the design change. This has been Pro Bowl tradition since the switch to team specific helmets, which started with the January 1979 game. The two-year switch was originally created as a marketing ploy by Nike, and was continued by Reebok, which won the merchandising contract in 2002. Nike subsequently won back the contract in 2011.
The early Pro Bowl, contested by the National Football League's Eastern and Western Division stars and played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, featured the same uniforms from the 1950s to mid-1960s; the Eastern team wore scarlet jerseys with white numerals and a white crescent shoulder stripe, white pants with red stripe, red socks, and a plain red helmet. The Western team wore white jerseys with royal-blue numerals and a Northwestern University-style Ukon triple stripe on the sleeves, white pants with blue stripe and socks and a plain blue helmet. Perhaps oddly, the Eastern team wore home dark jerseys, although the host city team, the Los Angeles Rams, were members of the Western Conference. From January 1967 to January 1970 both teams wore gold helmets with the NFL logo on the sides; the Eastern helmets featured a red-white-red tri-stripe and the Western a similar blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In fact, the players brought their own game helmets to Los Angeles, which were then spray-painted and decorated for the contest. For the 1970 game the helmets featured the '50 NFL' logo, commemorating the league's half-century anniversary.
In the earliest years of the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl, the players did not wear their unique helmets, as they do now. The AFC All-Stars wore a solid red helmet with a white A on it, while the NFC players wore a solid white helmet with a blue N on it. The AFC's red helmets were paired with white jerseys and red pants, while the NFC's white helmets were paired with blue jerseys and white pants.
Two players with the same number who are elected to the Pro Bowl can now wear the same number for that game. This was not always the case in the past.
The 2008 Pro Bowl included a unique example of several players from the same team wearing the same number in a Pro Bowl. For the game, Washington Redskins players T Chris Samuels, TE Chris Cooley, and LS Ethan Albright all wore the number 21 (a number normally inappropriate for their positions) in memory of their teammate Sean Taylor, who had been murdered during the 2007 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2008-02-10-pro-bowl_N.htm|title=Peterson helps NFC roar back for Pro Bowl crown|first=Jim|last=Corbett|work=USA Today|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=October 20, 2008[/tpl]
On October 7, 2013, Nike unveiled the uniforms for the 2014 Pro Bowl, which revealed that the red, white and blue colors that the game uniforms bore throughout its entire history will no longer be used for this game. As the NFC–AFC format will no longer be used either, team 1 will sport a white uniform with bright orange and team 2 will sport a grey uniform with volt green.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1802736-nfl-nike-elite-51-uniforms-revealed-for-2014-pro-bowl The new uniforms received mixed reviews from fans and sports columnists alike, one even mentioning that the game would look like an "Oregon vs. Oklahoma State" game.[tpl]cite web|last=Percy|first=Ethan|url=http://bmore2boston.com/2013/10/08/new-nfl-pro-bowl-uniforms-look-more-like-oregon-vs-oklahoma-state/|title=New NFL Pro Bowl Uniforms Look More Like Oregon Vs.

===Blackout of game in Hawaii===

Although Hawaii does not have an NFL team of its own, the Pro Bowl is still subject to the NFL's blackout policies, requiring the game to be blacked out within the state of Hawaii if it does not sell out all of its seats.[tpl]Cite web|title=NFL lifts TV blackout as Pro Bowl nears sell out |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2008719411_apfbnprobowltv.html|date=2009-02-07|work=The Seattle Times|publisher=The Seattle Times Company|accessdate=2013-02-16|location=Seattle, WA, USA[/tpl]Pro Bowl Blackout Date Extended (KHOU-TV) This restriction was not in effect in Hawaii for the 2010 game, but was transferred to the Miami media market.

==Criticism==

===Lack of quality===

For decades, the Pro Bowl has been criticized as a glamour event more than a football game. This is due to two causes: the voluntary nature of the game, and the understandable fear of player injury.
While players are financially compensated for participating in the Pro Bowl, for a star player, the pay can be less than 1% of their salary. Many star players have excused themselves from participation over the years, meaning that the very best players are not necessarily featured. Not having the best players in the Pro Bowl was exacerbated by the introduction of fan voting (see section below).
Another criticism of the game is that the players—particularly on defense—are not playing "full speed". This is because player injury plays a much greater part in a team's success in the NFL as compared to the other major American sports. For this reason, unlike the NBA, NHL, and MLB (which host their all-star events as a mid-season break), the Pro Bowl was historically held after the completion of the season and playoffs. This means that a player injured in the Pro Bowl would have at least six months to rehab before the next season begins. However, starting in 2010, the Pro Bowl was moved from the week after the Super Bowl to the week before the Super Bowl. Because of the above-noted fear of injury, players from the two teams participating in the Super Bowl were banned from participation, meaning that the absence of star players was only increased.
With the dearth of stars making the game the subject of much derision (SI.com refused to even include one pre-game story on the event in 2012), the players on the field appear to be taking it less seriously as well. In the 2012 game, the lack of defensive effort was apparent, not only to anyone watching the game, but to anyone who saw the score—100 points were scored in the game. One NFL player watching the game said, "They probably should have just put flags on them,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/01/30/brett-keisel-on-the-pro-bowl-they-should-have-just-put-flags-on-players/ |title=Keisel on Pro Bowl: They "should have just put flags" on players |publisher=Profootballtalk.com |date=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2012[/tpl] indicating that game was about on the level of a child's game of flag football. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the game needed to improve, otherwise it would be eliminated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/02/05/roger.goodell.pro.bowl.criticism.ap/index.html?sct=hp_t2_a3&eref=sihp |title=NFL commissioner Roger Goodell criticizes quality of play in Pro Bowl |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000083920/article/roger-goodell-indicates-pro-bowls-future-in-doubt |title=Roger Goodell indicates Pro Bowl's future in doubt |work=National Football League |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2012 [/tpl]

===Selection process===

Fan voting has increased criticism of the Pro Bowl. Voting by fans makes up 1/3 of the vote for Pro Bowl players. Some teams earn more selections of their players because fans often vote for their favorite team and not necessarily the best player. In the 2008 Pro Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys had thirteen players on the NFC roster, an NFL record. "If you're in a small market, no one really gets to see you play," said Minnesota Vikings cornerback Antoine Winfield, who spent much of his early career with the small-market Buffalo Bills. "If you're a quiet guy, it's hard to get the attention. You just have to work hard and play." Winfield made the Pro Bowl in 2008 after ten seasons of being shut out.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hill/081209&sportCat=nfl |title=Take away the fan vote |first=Jemele |last=Hill |publisher=ESPN |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 [/tpl]
The player voting has also been subject to significant criticism. It is not uncommon for the players to pick the same players over and over again; former offensive lineman (and SI.com analyst) Ross Tucker has cited politics, incumbency, personal vendettas, and compensation for injury in previous years as primary factors in player's choices among themselves. Thus, players who have seen their play decline with age will still be perennially elected to the Pro Bowl due to their popularity among the players, a situation particularly common among positions such as the offensive line, where few statistics are available.Tucker, Ross. NFL Pro Bowl voting among players should be consistent. SI.com For example, in 2010, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs admitted voting for Ryan Fitzpatrick (then the backup quarterback of the Buffalo Bills) over eventual league most valuable player Tom Brady not because he thought Fitzpatrick was the better player but as a vote of disrespect toward Brady's team, the New England Patriots.Terrell Suggs: Teams hate Patriots. ESPN.com. Retrieved February 27, 2013.
Some players have had a surprisingly small number of Pro Bowl selections despite distinguished careers. Hall of Fame running back John Riggins was only selected once in his career from 1971 to 1985. He was not selected in the year where he set the record for rushing touchdowns in a season and his team made it to the Super Bowl (though he did make the All-Pro team). Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Nitschke only made the Pro Bowl once, despite being named All-Pro seven times and being the MVP of the 1962 NFL Championship Game. Defensive back Ken Riley never made the Pro Bowl in his 15 seasons, even though he recorded 65 interceptions, the fourth-highest total in NFL history at the time of his retirement. Former Jacksonville Jaguars halfback Fred Taylor, who is 15th in all-time rushing yards, was elected to his only Pro Bowl in 2007, despite averaging 4.6 yards per carry for his career, better than all but five running backs ranked in the top 30 in all-time rushing.
