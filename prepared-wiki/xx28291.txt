Ramoth-Gilead, (Hebrew: [tpl]hebrew|רָמֹת גִּלְעָד[/tpl]; Douay-Rheims: Ramoth Galaad; meaning "Heights of Gilead"), is a city of refuge east of the Jordan river; called "Ramoth in Gilead" (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8; 21:38).  It was in the tribal territorial allotment of the tribe of Gad.

==Historical events==

Here, during the battle of Ramoth Gilead between Israel and Arameans, Ahab of Israel joined Jehoshaphat in the battle but was mortally wounded by an arrow and died (1 Kings 22:1-36), he was propped up in his chariot facing his men but by evening, Ahab died and the Arameans won. 
Later an incident occurred when Ahaziah and Joram fought against Hazael, king of Syria, and Joram was wounded (2 Kings 8:28). 
In this city, Jehu, Joram's commander, was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets (9:1, 4).
