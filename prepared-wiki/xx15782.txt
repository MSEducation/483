==Overview==

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is managed by UT-Battelle, a limited liability partnership between the University of Tennessee and the Battelle Memorial Institute, formed in 2000 for that purpose.[tpl]cite web|title=About UT-Battelle|url=http://www.ut-battelle.org/about.shtml|publisher=UT-Battelle|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] The annual budget is US$1.65 billion; 80% of which is from the Department of Energy, the remainder is from various sources paying for use of the facilities.[tpl]cite web|title=About ORN|url=http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/about.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] As of 2012 there are 4,400 staff working at ORNL, 1600 of which are directly conducting research, and an additional 3000 guest researchers annually.[tpl]cite web|title=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/docs/fact.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=9 February 2013|year=2012[/tpl]
There are five campuses on the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge reservation; the National Laboratory, the Y-12 National Security Complex, the East Tennessee Technology Park (formerly the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant), the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, and the developing Oak Ridge Science and Technology Park, although the four other facilities are unrelated to the National Laboratory.[tpl]cite web|title=Who We Are Not|url=http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/who_we_are_not.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Oak Ridge Site|url=http://energy.gov/em/oak-ridge-site|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl] The total area of the reservation 150 square kilometres (58 sq mi) of which the lab takes up 18 square kilometres (7 sq mi).[tpl]cite web|title=Labs at-a-Glance: Oak Ridge National Laboratory|url=http://science.energy.gov/laboratories/oak-ridge-national-laboratory/|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=9 February 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The town of Oak Ridge was established by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Clinton Engineer Works in 1942 on isolated farm land as part of the Manhattan Project.[tpl]cite web|title=Solving the Big Problems|url=http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/ornl_brochure.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=11 November 2012|year=2007[/tpl] In 1943, construction of the "Clinton Laboratories" was completed, later renamed to "Oak Ridge National Laboratory". The site was chosen for the X-10 Graphite Reactor, used to show that plutonium can be extracted from enriched uranium. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues developed the world's second self-sustaining nuclear reactor after Fermi's previous experiment Chicago Pile-1, the X-10 was the first designed for continuous operation.[tpl]cite web|title=X-10 Reactor, Graphite Reactor|last=Rettig|first=Polly| url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/66000720.pdf| publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=December 8, 1975[/tpl] After the end of World War II the demand for weapons-grade plutonium fell and the reactor and the laboratory's 1000 employees were no longer involved in nuclear weapons,[tpl]cite web|title=Swords to Plowshares: A Short History of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (1943–1993)|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/swords/swords.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=April 8, 2006[/tpl] instead it was used for scientific research. In 1946 the first medical isotopes were produced in the X-10 reactor, by 1950 almost 20,000 samples had been shipped to various hospitals. As the demand for military science had fallen dramatically the future of the lab was uncertain. Management of the lab was contracted by the US government to Monsanto, however, they withdrew in 1947. The University of Chicago assumed responsibility but withdrew shortly after, until in December 1947 Union Carbide and Carbon Co., which already operated two other facilities at Oak Ridge, took control of the laboratory and Alvin Weinberg was named Director of Research ORNL, and in 1955 Director of the Laboratory.[tpl]cite web|title=ORNL contractor gives $25K to Weinberg memorial effort|url=http://www.oakridger.com/article/20110908/NEWS/309089996|newspaper=Oak Ridger|accessdate=November 16, 2012|date=September 8, 2011[/tpl]
In 1950 the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology was established with two courses in reactor operation and safety; almost 1000 students graduated. Much of the research performed at ORNL in the 1950s was relating to nuclear reactors as a form of energy production both for propulsion and electricity; more reactors were built in the 1950s than the rest of the ORNL's history combined. Though experiment X-10 was the first light water reactor, it remains the most common type of nuclear reactor as of 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=The Graphite Reactor|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/news/cco/graphite.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=11 November 2012[/tpl] The US Military funded much of the reactor development leading to the nuclear-powered submarines and ships of the US Navy. The US Army contracted portable nuclear reactors in 1953 for heat and electricity generation in remote military bases.[tpl]cite web|title=ORNL Review Timeline|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v36_1_03/timeline/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=11 November 2012[/tpl] The reactors were designed at ORNL, produced by American Locomotive Company and used in Greenland, the Panama Canal Zone and Antarctica. The United States Air Force (USAF) also contributed funding to three reactors; the lab's first computers; and its first particle accelerators. ORNL designed and tested a nuclear-powered aircraft in 1954 as a proof-of-concept for a proposed USAF fleet of long range bombers, although it never flew. The provision of radionuclides by X-10 for medicine grew steadily in the 1950s with more isotopes available; ORNL was the only Western source of californium-252. ORNL scientists lowered the immune systems of mice and performed the world's first successful bone marrow transplant.
In the early 1960s there was a large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered desalination plants where deserts met the sea to provide water. The project called Water for Peace was backed by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and presented at a 1964 United Nations conference but increases in the cost of construction and public confidence in nuclear power falling caused the plan to fail. The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate dosage limits, dosimeters and improved radiation shielding. In 1964 the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment began with the construction of the reactor. It was operated from 1966 until 1969 (with six months down time to move from U-235 to U-233 fuel) and proved the viability of molten salt reactors while also producing fuel for other reactors as a byproduct of its own reaction.  The High Flux Isotope Reactor built in 1965 with the highest neutron flux of any reactor at the time. It improved upon the work of the X-10 reactor producing more medical isotopes as well as allowing higher fidelity of materials research. Researchers in the Biology Division studied the effects of chemicals on mice including petrol fumes, pesticides and tobacco. In the late 1960s cuts in funding led to plans for another particle accelerator to be cancelled and the United States Atomic Energy Commission cut the breeder reactor program by two thirds leading to a downsizing in staff from 5000 to 3800.
In the 1970s the prospect of fusion power was strongly considered sparking research at ORNL. A tokamak called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first tokamak to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin.[tpl]cite web|title=Responding to Social Needs|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter6.shtml|work=ORNL Review|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 22, 2013|year=2002[/tpl] After the success of the fusion experiments it was enlarged and renamed ORMAK II in 1973 however the experiments ultimately failed to lead to fusion power plants. The US Atomic Energy Commission required improved safety standards in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance. In 1972 the AEC held a series of public hearings where emergency cooling requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent. ORNL was involved in analysing the damage to the core of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station after the accident in 1979. Also in 1972 Peter Mazur, a biologist at ORNL, froze with liquid nitrogen, thawed and implanted mouse embryos in a surrogate mother. The mouse pups were born healthy. The technique is popular in the livestock industry as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus through in vitro fertilisation have many more offspring than would naturally be possible. In 1974 Alvin Weinberg, director of the lab for 19 years, was replaced by Herman Postma, a fusion scientist. In 1977 construction began for 6 metre (20 foot) superconducting electromagnets intended to control fusion reactions. The project was an international effort, three electromagnets were produced in the US, one in Japan, one in Switzerland and the final by remaining European states and experimentation continued into the 1980s.
The 1980s brought more changes to ORNL, a focus on efficiency became paramount. An accelerated climate simulation chamber was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into heat resistant ceramics for use in truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research that began in the nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan's economic policy of less government expenditure. In 1981 the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility, a 25 MV particle accelerator, was opened at ORNL. At the time, Holifield had the widest range of ion species and was twice as powerful as other accelerators attracting hundreds of guest researchers each year. The Department of Energy was concerned with the pollution surrounding ORNL and it began clean-up efforts. Burial trenches and leaking pipes had contaminated the groundwater beneath the lab and radiation tanks were sitting idle, full of waste. Estimates of the total cost of clean-up were into the hundreds of millions of US dollars. The five older reactors were subjected to safety reviews in 1987, ordered to be deactivated until the reviews were complete. By 1989 when the High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted the US supply of certain medical isotopes was depleted. In 1989 the former executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Alvin Trivelpiece, became director of ORNL, he remained in the role until 2000.
In 1992, a whistleblower, Charles Varnadore, filed complaints against ORNL, alleging safety violations and retaliation by his superiors. While an administrative law judge ruled in Varnadore's favor, the Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, overturned that ruling. However, Varnadore's case saw prime contractor Martin Marietta cited for safety violations, and ultimately led to additional whistleblower protection within DOE.Martin, Douglas, Charles Varnadore, whistleblower at lab, dies at 71, New York Times, August 5, 2013, p.B8

==Areas of research==

ORNL conducts research and development activities that span a wide range of scientific disciplines. Many research areas have a significant overlap with each other; researchers often work in two or more of the fields listed here. The laboratory's major research areas are described briefly below.

===Energy===

The laboratory has a long history of energy research; nuclear reactor experiments have been conducted since the end of World War II in 1945. Because of the availability of reactors and high-performance computing resources an emphasis on improving the efficiency of nuclear reactors is present.[tpl]cite web|title=Fuel Cycle and Isotopes Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/division_fcid.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/rnsd/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl] The programs develop more efficient materials, more accurate simulations of aging reactor cores, sensors and controls as well as safety procedures for regulatory authorities.
The Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program (EEETP) aims to improve air quality in the US and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies.[tpl]cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/ees/factsheets/fs_eere.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl] There are three key areas of research; electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes by 2020.[tpl]cite web|title=Program Areas - Building Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_building.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl] Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.[tpl]cite web|title=Wind & Water Power Program|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_wind_hydro.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Geothermal Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_geothermal.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Solar Energy Technologies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/eere/research_solar.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl]
Fusion is another area with a history of research at ORNL, dating back to the 1970s. The Fusion Energy Division pursues short term goals to develop components such as high temperature superconductors, high-speed hydrogen pellet injectors and suitable materials for future fusion research.[tpl]cite web|title=Fusion Energy Division Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/factsheets/fs_fusion_energy.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Fusion Energy Division|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/nsed/division_fed.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl] Much research into the behaviour and maintenance of a plasma takes place at the Fusion Energy Division to further the understanding of plasma physics, a crucial area for developing a fusion power plant.

===Neutron science===

There are three neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA) and the Spallation Neutron Source. HFIR provides neutrons in a stable beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas ORELA and SNS produce pulses of neutrons as they are particle accelerators.[tpl]cite web|title=Neutrons at ORNL|url=http://neutrons.ornl.gov/about/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Koehler|first=P. E.|title=The Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator  Pulsed Neutron Source|url=http://www.phy.ornl.gov/nuclear/orela/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 21, 2013[/tpl] HFIR went critical in 1965 and has been used for materials research and as a major sources of medical radioisotopes since.[tpl]cite web|title=The High Flux Isotope Reactor at ORNL|url=http://neutrons.ornl.gov/facilities/HFIR/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 21, 2013[/tpl] As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. As part of a US non proliferation effort the HFIR is scheduled to switch from highly enriched uranium (>90%, weapons grade) to low-enriched (3–4%) in 2020; the last reactor in the US to do so.[tpl]cite web|last=Munger|first=Frank|title=ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor may be last reactor to convert to low-enriched fuel|url=http://blogs.knoxnews.com/munger/2012/05/will-ornls-high-flux-isotope-r.html|publisher=Knox News|accessdate=January 21, 2013|date=May 8, 2012[/tpl] Berkelium used to produce the world's first sample of ununseptium was produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor as part of an international effort.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/news_items/news_100407.shtml|title=International team discovers element 117|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|first=Bill|last=Cabage|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.
The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a particle accelerator that has the highest intensity neutron pulses of any man-made neutron source.[tpl]cite web|title=Spallation Neutron Source|url=http://neutrons.ornl.gov/facilities/SNS/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] SNS was made operational in 2006 and has since been upgraded to 1 megawatts with plans to continue up to 3 megawatts.[tpl]cite web|title=Neutron Review|url=http://neutrons.ornl.gov/media/pubs/pdf/2010neutronreview.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=April 2011[/tpl] High power neutron pulses permit clearer images of the targets meaning smaller samples can be analysed and accurate results require fewer pulses.[tpl]cite web|title=Spallation Neutron Source First Of Its Kind To Reach Megawatt Power|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090929181816.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=October 1, 2009[/tpl]

===Materials===

Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducts research into materials science in a range of areas. Between 2002 and 2008 ORNL partnered with Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) to form a new material for their diesel engines that can withstand large temperature fluctuations.[tpl]cite web|title=New Steel Advances Engine Exhaust System|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/cf8cplus/pdf/09-G01217_Steel.pdf|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=January 19, 2013|date=February 2010[/tpl] The new steel, named CF8C Plus, is based on conventional CF8C stainless steel with added manganese and nitrogen; the result has better high–temperature properties and is easier to cast at a similar cost. In 2003 the partners received an R&D 100 award from R&D magazine and in 2009 received an award for "excellence in technology transfer" from the Federal Laboratory Consortium for the commercialisation of the steel.
There is a high-temperature materials lab at ORNL that permits researchers from universities, private companies and other government initiatives to use their facilities. The lab is available for free if the results are published; private research is permitted but requires payment.[tpl]cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://www.html.ornl.gov/what.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl] A separate lab, the Shared Equipment User Facility, is one of three DOE sponsored facilities with nano-scale microscopy and tomography facilities.[tpl]cite web|title=Shared Research User Facility|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/share/|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2013[/tpl]
The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) researches the behaviour and fabrication of nanomaterials. The center emphasises discovery of new materials and the understanding of underlying physical and chemical interactions that enable creation of nanomaterials.[tpl]cite web|title=SCIENCE AT THE CNMS|url=http://cnms.ornl.gov/about_cnms/about_cnms.shtm|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] In 2012, CNMS produced a lithium-sulfide battery with a theoretical energy density three to five times greater than existing lithium ion batteries.[tpl]cite web|title=High Energy Lithium-Sulfur Batteries|url=http://cnms.ornl.gov/news/Liang_AdvFuncMat_2012.shtm|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 20, 2013|date=June 2012[/tpl]

===Security===

Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides resources to the US Department of Homeland Security and other defense programs. The Global Security and Nonproliferation (GS&N) program develops and implements policies, both US based and international, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material.[tpl]cite web|title=Global Security & Nonproliferation Programs Mission Factsheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/adm/directorates/gsd/factsheets/GS&N%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 23, 2013[/tpl] The program has developed safeguards for nuclear arsenals, guidelines for dismantling arsenals, plans of action should nuclear material fall into unauthorised hands, detection methods for stolen or missing nuclear material and trade of nuclear material between the US and Russia. The GS&N's work overlaps with that of the Homeland Security Programs Office, providing detection of nuclear material and nonproliferation guidelines. Other areas concerning the Department Homeland Security include nuclear and radiological forensics, chemical and biological agent detection using mass spectrometry and simulations of potential national hazards.[tpl]cite web|title=Department of Homeland Security Programs – Key Competencies|url=http://www.ornl.gov/adm/directorates/gsd/dhs_compentencies.shtml|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=January 23, 2013[/tpl]
