==History==

Macalester College was founded in 1874 by Rev. Dr. Edward Duffield Neill, who served as a chaplain in the Civil War and held positions in three U.S. presidential administrations. After journeying to the Minnesota Territory in 1849 to do missionary work, he founded two churches and served as the state’s first superintendent of public education and first chancellor of the University of Minnesota. He believed that only a private college could offer both the academic quality and the values needed to prepare for leadership. He planned a college that would be equal in academic strength to the best colleges in the East. It would be Presbyterian-affiliated but nonsectarian, making it inclusive by the standards of his day.
Charles Macalester, a prominent businessman and philanthropist from Philadelphia, made the establishing gift by donating the Winslow House, a noted summer hotel in Minneapolis. With additional funding from the Presbyterian Church and from the new College’s trustees, Macalester opened in 1885 with five professors, six freshmen, and 52 preparatory students.
In 1887, a classical scholar named James Wallace joined the faculty and quickly established himself as a fine and demanding teacher. He earned a national reputation for scholarship when he published two Greek textbooks that were widely used across the country. When he took on added duties as dean of the College and then as president, he dedicated himself to creating the strongest possible academic experience for Macalester students. He recruited excellent faculty members and carefully added new areas of study to the curriculum.
In spite of academic success, James Wallace’s early years at Macalester were financially difficult. Gradually, his efforts built up a group of donors whose support, together with tuition from a growing student body, put the college on steady footing. By the time he rejoined the faculty in 1906, Wallace had enabled the college to pay off its debt, maintain a balanced budget, and begin to establish an endowment to offer some protection against hard times.
In the 1940s and 1950s President Charles J. Turck gave new emphasis to the College’s internationalism by recruiting foreign students, creating overseas study opportunities, and hiring faculty from diverse backgrounds. As a symbol of commitment to international harmony, he raised the United Nations flag on campus in 1950, and it has flown every day since then, just below the United States flag. Under his leadership, Macalester also broadened its base of community service and intensified its continuing interest in civic and national affairs.
The College engaged in a remarkable period of advancement throughout the 1960s, made possible by DeWitt and Lila Wallace, founders of Reader’s Digest and major benefactors of Macalester. Under the leadership of President Harvey M. Rice, the College strengthened the academic credentials of its faculty, enhanced the academic program, and increased its visibility, attracting students from across the nation and around the world. A major building campaign resulted in a fine arts center and new science facilities which were among the best in the United States.
During this time, Macalester committed itself to a liberal arts curriculum and asserted five traditional and distinguishing values: involvement of students with faculty in the pursuit of learning; creation of a diverse campus community; incorporation of an international perspective in the curriculum and campus life; involvement of the College in the life of the metropolitan area; and espousal of service as a way of life.
The 1990s were another period of significant advancement for Macalester. In 1991, the College’s endowment became significantly stronger than it had been, enabling Macalester to pursue its high ideals with renewed vision and confidence. The College increased the number of faculty positions, adding new depth and more broadly diverse perspectives to the educational program. The improved student-faculty ratio also made possible more flexible and personalized teaching approaches, including significant enhancement of an already strong emphasis on faculty-student collaborative research and writing. The College also increased international study opportunities for students and faculty and strengthened co-curricular programs from athletics to residential life to community service.
Through a comprehensive campus improvement program, virtually every academic and residential building on campus was renovated, as were the athletic facilities. Extensive renovation of the science facilities, which merged two buildings into the Olin-Rice Science Center, was completed in 1997. George Draper Dayton residence hall opened in 1998, the Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center in 2001, and the renovated Kagin Commons student services building in 2002. A comprehensive fund-raising campaign completed in 2000 raised $55.3 million to help support some of those building projects as well as scholarship funds, student-faculty research stipends, academic programs, and annual operations.
Macalester’s Institute for Global Citizenship, created in 2005, serves as a catalyst for strengthening programs by which students connect academic study with off-campus applications through internships and service-learning opportunities both in the United States and abroad, and programs by which students explore ways to engage some of the world’s most challenging issues through their chosen professions.
In fall 2008 Macalester publicly launched a $150 million campaign, raising funds for scholarships, faculty support, program enhancement, operating support, and new facilities. As the campaign went public, alumni and friends had already contributed more than $100 million. A new athletic and wellness complex, the Leonard Center, opened in August 2008 housing programs aimed at creating a healthier and more cohesive campus community. In 2009, construction was completed on Markim Hall, a new home for the Institute for Global Citizenship. Plans called for the building to qualify for Platinum certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system, a building rating system devised by the U.S. Green Building Council that evaluates the sustainability and environmental impact of structures across the nation. In fall 2012, Macalester opened its renovated and expanded Janet Wallace Fine Arts Center.

===Awards and recognition===

==Athletics==

Macalester College is a member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC). The college's team nickname is the Scots. The football team, after many years of poor performance in the MIAC, has competed independently since 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/whatshappening/press/11_01/11_27_01.html |title=Macalester News |publisher=macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] The college actually dissolved the football program in 1906, pronouncing, according to the Mac Weekly: "Thoroughly aroused to the evils, real or imaginary, of this game, the public is clamoring for the entire abolition or reform on this 'relic of barbarism.'"
Soccer has always been a popular sport. Both men and women's teams remain competitive, appearing in multiple NCAA playoffs since 1995. The women's team won the NCAA championship in 1998.[tpl]cite web|url=http://athletics.macalester.edu/index.aspx?tab=soccer2&path=wsoc |title=Macalester College Athletics |publisher=Athletics.macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06[/tpl]  The 2010 men's team won the MIAC regular-season championship and both the men and women's teams received at-large bids for the 2010 NCAA Division III tournament.  Both teams are well-supported by students, parents and alumni. One of Macalester sports fans' most (in)famous cheers – "Drink Blood, Smoke Crack, Worship Satan, Go Mac!" – was cited as one of "7 Memorable Sports Chants" by Mental Floss.[tpl]cite web|author=Will Treece |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/60166 |title=mental_floss Blog » 7 Memorable Sports Chants |publisher=Mentalfloss.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06[/tpl]
The Cross Country Ski team became a club team in 2004, when skiing was eliminated as an MIAC sanctioned sport. It was the first team to be dismantled since hockey was cut (and turned club) in the 1970s.  A women's hockey team formed in 2000 and continues to play at the club level.
Macalester Athletics compete in a new athletic facility, the Leonard Center, which opened in August 2008.  The $45 million facility encompasses 175,000 square feet. The Leonard Center includes a 200-meter track, a natatorium, a fitness center, several multipurpose rooms, and  a health and wellness center for the college community.  Materials from the former facility were disposed of in environmentally friendly ways, and some materials were incorporated into the new structure.

==Campus==

===Housing===

As at many small liberal arts colleges, students at Macalester are required to live on campus for their first two years.

====Residence halls====

====Specialty housing====

====All-gender housing====

Recently, Macalester has made news by offering limited all-gender housing options for first-years, juniors, and seniors. George Draper Dayton Hall, the Grand-Cambridge Apartments, Kirk Hall, and the six cottages all offer all-gender housing options. As of the 2012-2013 academic year, one floor of the first-year residence hall Doty is designated as all-gender for first-year students. However, these housing options still do not provide the opportunity for students of different sexes to share a room. Student-led groups are working to increase all-gender options and make all-gender bathrooms more widely available across campus.

===Food services===

Food services on campus are provided by Bon Appétit, a national company. The cafeteria, located in the Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center, is called Café Mac. Three different meal plans are available for students who live on campus (excepting those in specialty housing or co-ops). The standard option (and the only option for first-year students) is 19 all-you-can-eat meals per week (3 per weekday and 2 on each day of the weekends). For the same price, 10- or 14-meal plans are available, which offer additional flexible "dining dollars" for à la carte meals.  Café Mac includes several different stations, all of which provide vegan and gluten-free options. Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and food containing nuts or peanuts are flagged so that all students can manage their dietary concerns. Students who live off-campus may opt for a plan that includes 75 meals per semester.
