A script for a Doctor Who mini-episode was written by students of the school as part of a Doctor Who competition (Script to Screen). Some children from Oakley Junior School (Adam Shephard, Daniel Heaton, Ben Weston and Katie Hossick) won the competition and had it shown on Doctor Who Confidential. The children are now the youngest people to have written a Doctor Who episode.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-15043743 | work=BBC News | title=Dr Who star Matt Smith surprises Basingstoke school | date=23 September 2011[/tpl]http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw/news/bulletin_110707_03
