Compass-G1, also known as Beidou-2 G1 is a Chinese navigation satellite which will become part of the Compass navigation system. It was launched in January 2010, and became the third Compass satellite to be launched after Compass-M1 and Compass-G2.
Compass-G1 was launched at 16:12 GMT on 16 January 2010,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rhedu.gov.cn/jyxz/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=14955|title=关于执行"07-38"任务的通知|publisher=仁怀教育信息网|language=Chinese|date=2010-01-07|accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl] and was the first orbital launch to be conducted in 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] The launch used a Long March 3C carrier rocket, flying from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre. It was the first flight of a Long March 3 series rocket since an upper stage engine problem in August 2009 which left the Palapa-D satellite in a lower than planned orbit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cgwic.com/news/2009/1221_LM-3B_Investigation.html|title=LM-3B Flight Anomaly Investigation Concluded|publisher=China Great Wall Industry Corporation|date=2009-12-21|accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl] The injection systems on the rocket's third stage engines had filters fitted to them in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of this failure. The Compass-G1 launch demonstrated this new system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/091119-burn-through-blamed-long-march-mishap.html|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|publisher=Space News|first=Peter B.|last=de Selding|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl]
