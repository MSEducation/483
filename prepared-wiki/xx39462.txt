Queens of the Stone Age is the self-titled debut album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age. Following the collapse of negotiations with Roadrunner Records,[tpl]cite web|url=http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2009/03/04/monteconnerinterview/#more-790 |title=Blog Archive » EXCLUSIVE: Roadrunner Records’ Monte Conner Talks Stoner Rock |publisher=The Obelisk |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] the album was released on September 22, 1998 on Loosegroove Records, operated by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was primarily written and recorded by founding member Josh Homme and former Kyuss drummer Alfredo Hernández, and features a riff-oriented songwriting style that Homme subsequently dubbed "robot rock". Regarding this aesthetic, Homme stated, "I just wanted to start a band that within three seconds of listening, people knew what band it was."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/utr/interviewMore/CID/270/N/Queens-of-the-Stone-Age.utr |title=Queens of the Stone Age - Interviews at Undertheradar |publisher=Undertheradar.co.nz |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl]
The album was re-released on March 4, 2011 in Australia through Liberator Music and March 7, 2011 in the UK through Domino Records. The US release occurred on May 17 and is available as a joint release through Homme's own label, Rekords Rekords with distribution from Ipecac Recordings. The release includes relevant b-sides embedded within the track listing, and was accompanied by a tour in support of the album.

==Song information==

Avon is a re-recording from the Desert Sessions' Volume 3: Set Coordinates for the White Dwarf!!!. It is the first of seven Desert Sessions songs to be re-recorded by Queens of the Stone Age. The song has been a staple of the majority of live sets since the album's release and was still occasionally played by the band on the Era Vulgaris tour.
If Only is a re-recording of "If Only Everything", which Queens of the Stone Age originally recorded on the Kyuss / Queens of the Stone Age split CD. It is the sole song from the album which was released as a promotional single.
Mexicola is a fan favorite and frequently performed in live settings. In 2007, it was released as a downloadable single on iTunes for people who had bought tickets for Queens of the Stone Age concerts through Ticketmaster.
Hispanic Impressions is an instrumental track. The song is jerky and unfluent, with abrupt halts and starts. 
You Can't Quit Me Baby is considered to be a fan favorite, having won a poll conducted on the official Rekords Rekords message board.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] The song is still played infrequently live by the band today as part of the Era Vulgaris tour, often lasting longer than the album version due to extended jams. To date the song has made two appearances on the soundtracks for movies, namely the 2003 horror film Wrong Turn (alongside If Only) and the 2002 action Highway (alongside many bands similar to Queens of the Stone Age, including multiple tracks from the Desert Sessions).
Give the Mule What He Wants is a re-recording of an early recording session known as "The Gamma Ray Sessions." The song was not released until it was recorded for this album.

==2011 re-release==

After releasing a "deluxe edition" of the band's second studio album, Rated R, in 2010, Josh Homme stated that the band would re-release its debut, Queens of the Stone Age.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VQHTxGY4J8 |title=Interview with Them Crooked Vultures (part 2 of 2) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] On January 11, 2011, initial distributors, Ipecac, announced on their official Twitter page that the re-release was postponed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://notpopular.com/2011/01/11/queens-of-the-stone-age%E2%80%99s-self-titled-reissue-postponed/ |title=Queens Of The Stone Age’s Self-Titled Reissue Postponed |publisher=notPopular.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-08-13[/tpl] On January 13, Domino Records subsequently took over re-issue duties after a deal with Joshua Homme's Rekords Rekords label.
In February 2011, Homme stated that the reasons for its reissue was because the album "was impossible to get. It'd been outta' print for so long. I’m not very nostalgic by nature so it wasn’t like 'Guys, remember the days,' it was more like in the internet age this record should be able to get got, you know? ... I’m just glad that it's not like some bad haircut when I listen to it. I've listened to it and I love that record and it’s been really fun to try and put myself back in that headspace where I was just obsessed with trying to trance out on guitar."
The 2011 line-up of the band (Homme, Van Leeuwen, Castillo, Shuman & Fertita) scheduled a tour in support of the album's reissue. Homme stated that the inspiration for the tour came from the band, Cheap Trick: "They were doing shows where they were playing their first three records, three nights in a row, and so we started talking ... what if we just focused on the first record? I dunno' if that means we’re going to play it exactly start-to-finish; we haven’t really decided. It's kind of a cool idea."

==Critical reception==

Queens of the Stone Age was certified silver in the UK on February 6, 2006 with sales exceeding 60,000 copies.
Critically, the album did very well. Both Allmusic and Rolling Stone gave the album four stars out of five. The album was the only one by Queens of the Stone Age to be featured in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
