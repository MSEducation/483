[tpl]nihongo|Sakura Domain|佐倉藩|Sakura-han[/tpl] was a Japanese domain of the Edo period, located in Shimōsa Province (modern-day Chiba Prefecture), Japan. 
In the han system, Sakura was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150.  In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West.

==History==

The domain was centered on Sakura Castle in what is now part of the city of Sakura. It was ruled for most of its history by the Hotta clan. 
Sakura Domain was originally created for Takeda Tadateru, a son of Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1593, near the site of an ancient castle of the Chiba clan, which had fallen into ruins in the early Sengoku period. The domain subsequently passed through a bewildering number of hands during the 1600s, before coming under the control of the Hotta clan in the mid-18th century. During the Bakumatsu period, Hotta Masayoshi was one of the major proponents of rangaku and an ending to the country’s national isolation policy. He was one of the signers of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States. His son, Hotta Masatomo was a key supporter of the Tokugawa shogunate in the early stages of the Boshin War. After the Meiji Restoration, he was pardoned, and eventually made a count (hakushaku) in the kazoku peerage.
