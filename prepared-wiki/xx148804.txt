"Wings of a Dove" (also known as "Wings of a Dove (A Celebratory Song)") is a song by Madness. It was released in 1983 as a stand-alone single and later in 1984 and it was included on the American version of their album Keep Moving. The single spent 10 weeks in British charts peaking at number 2. It peaked at number 1 in Ireland.
"Wings of a Dove" was written by Suggs and Chas Smash and they also share lead vocals here. The song is quite unusual for Madness, featuring steel drums by Creighton Steel Sounds and a gospel choir from the First Born Inspirational Church of the Living God.
The song enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity in 1999 when it was featured in the movie 10 Things I Hate About You.

==Music video==

The music video for the song depicts all involved in the record (including the steel band and choir) performing in a party atmosphere on board an aeroplane piloted by Chas Smash. They all bail out in a small white van after Smash loses control of the plane, the final sequence showing the van parachuting gently back down to earth. It's the first generation of an Iveco Daily, however there is the back of a Ford Transit shown on the plane before the fall.
The clip of the van was originally filmed for a French television advert. Dave Robinson had bought the rights to the footage some time earlier with the intention of including it in a Madness video and the lyrical content of "Wings of a Dove" gave him the opportunity to use it.
