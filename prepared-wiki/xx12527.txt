At first, in the United States most Jews were of Sephardic origin, and hence did not speak Yiddish. It was not until the mid to late 19th century, as first German, then Eastern European, Jews arrived in the nation, that Yiddish became dominant within the immigrant community. This helped to bond Jews from many countries. [tpl]lang|yi|פֿאָרווערטס[/tpl] (forverts – Yiddish Forward) was one of seven Yiddish daily newspapers in New York City, and other Yiddish newspapers served as a forum for Jews of all European backgrounds. The Yiddish Forward still appears weekly and is also available in an online edition.[tpl]yi icon[/tpl] פֿאָרווערטס: The Forward online. It remains in wide distribution, together with [tpl]lang|yi|דער אַלגעמיינער זשורנאַל[/tpl] (der algemeyner zhurnal – Algemeiner Journal; algemeyner = general) a Lubavitcher newspaper which is also published weekly and appears online.[tpl]yi icon[/tpl] דער אַלגעמיינער זשורנאַל: Algemeiner Journal online The widest-circulation Yiddish newspapers are probably the weekly issues [tpl]lang|yi|Der Yid[/tpl] (דער איד = The Jew) and [tpl]lang|yi|Der Blatt[/tpl] (דער בלאַט; blat = paper) and [tpl]lang|yi|Di Tzeitung[/tpl] (די צייטונג; = the newspaper) . Several additional newspapers and magazines are in regular production, such as the monthly publications [tpl]lang|yi|דער שטערן[/tpl] (Der Shtern; shtern = star) and [tpl]lang|yi|דער בליק[/tpl] (Der Blick; blik = view). (The romanized titles cited in this paragraph are in the form given on the masthead of each publication and may be at some variance both with the literal Yiddish title and the transliteration rules otherwise applied in this article.) Thriving Yiddish theater, especially in the New York City Yiddish Theater District, kept the language vital. Interest in klezmer music provided another bonding mechanism.
Most of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of Ellis Island considered Yiddish their native language; however, native Yiddish speakers tended not to pass the language on to their children, who assimilated and spoke English. For example, Isaac Asimov states in his autobiography, In Memory Yet Green, that Yiddish was his first and sole spoken language and remained so for about two years after he emigrated to the United States as a small child. By contrast, Asimov's younger siblings, born in the United States, never developed any degree of fluency in Yiddish.
Many "Yiddishisms," like "Italianisms" and "Spanishisms," entered the spoken New York dialect, often used by Jews and non-Jews alike, unaware of the linguistic origin of the phrases. Yiddish words used in English were documented extensively by Leo Rosten in The Joys of Yiddish; see also the list of English words of Yiddish origin.
In 1976, the Canadian-born American author Saul Bellow received the Nobel Prize in literature. He was fluent in Yiddish, and translated several Yiddish poems and stories into English, including Isaac Bashevis Singer's "Gimpel the Fool".
In 1978, the Polish-born Yiddish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, a resident of the United States, received the Nobel Prize in literature.
Legal scholars Eugene Volokh and Alex Kozinski argue that Yiddish is “supplanting Latin as the spice in American legal argot.”[tpl]cite journal |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |authorlink= |coauthors=Kozinski, Alex |year=1993 |title=Lawsuit, Shmawsuit |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=463–467 |doi=10.2307/797101|accessdate= |quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc. |postscript=. |jstor=797101 [/tpl]Note: an updated version of the article appears on Professor Volokh's UCLA web page, [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/yiddish.htm |title=Judge Alex Kozinski & Eugene Volokh, "Lawsuit, Shmawsuit"  |publisher=Law.ucla.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

====Present U.S. speaker population====

In the 2000 census, 178,945 people in the United States reported speaking Yiddish at home. Of these speakers, 113,515 lived in New York (63.43% of American Yiddish speakers); 18,220 in Florida (10.18%); 9,145 in New Jersey (5.11%); and 8,950 in California (5.00%). The remaining states with speaker populations larger than 1,000 are Pennsylvania (5,445), Ohio (1,925), Michigan (1,945), Massachusetts (2,380), Maryland (2,125), Illinois (3,510), Connecticut (1,710), and Arizona (1,055). The population is largely elderly: 72,885 of the speakers were older than 65, 66,815 were between 18 and 64, and only 39,245 were age 17 or lower.Language by State: Yiddish, MLA Language Map Data Center, based on U.S. Census data. Retrieved 25 December 2006.
In the six years since the 2000 census, the 2006 American Community Survey reflected an estimated 15 percent decline of people speaking Yiddish at home in the U.S. to 152,515.[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&-_geoSkip=0&-CONTEXT=dt&-mt_name=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_C16001&-redoLog=false&-_skip=0&-geo_id=01000US&-_showChild=Y&-format=&-_lang=en&-_toggle=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_C16001 |title=Detailed Tables – American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]
There are a few predominantly Hasidic communities in the United States in which Yiddish remains the majority language. Kiryas Joel, New York is one such; in the 2000 census, nearly 90% of residents of Kiryas Joel reported speaking Yiddish at home.Data center results Modern Language Association

===United Kingdom===

There are well over 30,000 Yiddish speakers in the United Kingdom, and several thousand children now have Yiddish as a first language. The largest group of Yiddish speakers in Britain reside in the Stamford Hill district of North London, but there are sizable communities in Golders Green, Stoke Newington, Greater Manchester (in parts of Salford; mainly in the Broughton and Kersal areas, North Manchester and in the north Manchester suburb of Prestwich) and Gateshead.Times on Yiddish in the UK[tpl]accessdate|2011-01-18[/tpl]
The Yiddish readership in the UK is mainly reliant upon imported material from the United States and Israel for newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. However, the London-based weekly Jewish Tribune, has a small section in Yiddish called [tpl]lang|yi|אידישע טריבונע[/tpl] Idishe Tribune.

===Canada===

====Montreal (Quebec)====

Montreal had and to some extent still has one of the most thriving Yiddish communities in North America. Yiddish was Montreal's third language (after French and English) for the entire first half of the twentieth century. Der Kanader Adler ("The Canadian Eagle", founded by Hirsch Wolofsky), Montreal’s daily Yiddish newspaper, appeared from 1907 to 1988.CHRISTOPHER DEWOLF, "A peek inside Yiddish Montreal", Spacing Montreal, February 23, 2008.http://spacing.ca/montreal/2008/02/23/a-peek-inside-montreals-yiddish-universe/ The Monument National was the center of Yiddish theater from 1896 until the construction of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts, inaugurated on September 24, 1967, where the established resident theater, the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre, remains the only permanent Yiddish theatre in North America. The theatre group also tours Canada, US, Israel, and Europe.Carol Roach, "Yiddish Theater in Montreal", Examiner, May 14, 2012.www.examiner.com/article/jewish-theater-montreal; "The emergence of Yiddish theater in Montreal", "Examiner", May 14, 2012 www.examiner.com/article/the-emergence-of-yiddish-theater-montreal
Even though Yiddish has receded, it is the immediate ancestral language of Montrealers like Mordecai Richler, Leonard Cohen as well as former interim city mayor Michael Applebaum. Besides Yiddish-speaking activists, it remains today the native everyday language of 15,000 Montreal Hassidim.

===Religious communities===

The major exception to the decline of spoken Yiddish can be found in Haredi communities all over the world. In some of the more closely knit such communities Yiddish is spoken as a home and schooling language, especially in Hasidic, Litvish or Yeshivish communities such as Brooklyn's Borough Park, Williamsburg and Crown Heights, and in the communities of Monsey, Kiryas Joel and New Square in New York State (over 88% of the population of Kiryas Joel is reported to speak Yiddish at home.MLA Data Center Results: Kiryas Joel, New York, Modern Language Association. Retrieved 17 October 2006.) Also in New Jersey Yiddish is widely spoken mostly in Lakewood but also in smaller towns with yeshivos such as Passaic, Teaneck and elsewhere. Yiddish is also widely spoken in the Antwerp Jewish community and in Haredi communities such as the ones in London, Manchester and Montreal. Yiddish is also spoken in many communities throughout Israel. Among most Ashkenazi Haredim, Hebrew is generally reserved for prayer, while Yiddish is used for religious studies as well as a home and business language. In Israel, however, Haredim commonly speak Hebrew, with the notable exception of many Hasidic communities. However, some Haredim who use Modern Hebrew also understand Yiddish. There are some who send their children to schools in which the primary language of instruction is Yiddish. Members of movements such as Satmar Hasidism, who view the commonplace use of Hebrew as a form of Zionism, use Yiddish almost exclusively.
Hundreds of thousands of young children around the globe have been, and are still, taught to translate the texts of the Torah into Yiddish. This process is called [tpl]lang|yi|טײַטשן[/tpl] (taytshn)—"translating" . Most Ashkenazi yeshivas' highest level lectures in Talmud and Halakha are delivered in Yiddish by the rosh yeshivas as well as ethical talks of mussar. Hasidic rebbes generally use only Yiddish to converse with their followers and to deliver their various Torah talks, classes, and lectures. The linguistic style and vocabulary of Yiddish have influenced the manner in which many Orthodox Jews who attend yeshivas speak English. This usage is distinctive enough that it has been dubbed "Yeshivish".
While Hebrew remains the language of Jewish prayer, the Hasidim have mixed some Yiddish into their Hebrew, and are also responsible for a significant secondary religious literature written in Yiddish. For example, the tales about the Baal Shem Tov were written largely in Yiddish. The Torah Talks of the late Lubavitch leaders are published in their original form, Yiddish. In addition, some prayers, such as the Got fun Avrohom, were composed and are recited in Yiddish.

===Modern Yiddish education===

There has been a resurgence in Yiddish learning in recent times among many from around the world with Jewish ancestry. The language which had lost many of its native speakers during WWII has been making somewhat of a comeback.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/9529/edition_id/182/format/html/displaystory.html |title=Yiddish making a comeback, as theater group shows | j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=1998-09-18 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] In Poland, which traditionally had Yiddish speaking communities, a particular museum has begun to revive Yiddish education and culture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/09/30/poland.jewish.revival/index.html |title=Poland's Jews alive and kicking |publisher=CNN.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Located in Kraków, the Galicia Jewish Museum offers classes in Yiddish Language Instruction and workshops on Yiddish Songs.

There are various Universities worldwide which now offer Yiddish programs based on the YIVO Yiddish standard. Many of these programs are held during the summer and are attended by Yiddish enthusiasts from around the world. One such school located within Vilnius University (Vilnius Yiddish Institute) was the first Yiddish center of higher learning to be established in post-Holocaust Eastern Europe. Vilnius Yiddish Institute is an integral part of the four-century-old Vilnius University. Published Yiddish scholar and researcher Dovid Katz is among the Faculty.[tpl]cite web|author=Neosymmetria (www.neosymmetria.com) |url=http://www.judaicvilnius.com/en |title=Vilnius Yiddish Institute |publisher=Judaicvilnius.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Other schools which offer Yiddish programs include Tel Aviv University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=165354 |title=Tel Aviv Yiddish Summer Program 2009 |publisher=H-net.org |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Brandeis University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/nejs/undergraduate/minors/yiddish.html |title=Yiddish and East European Studies Minor |publisher=Brandeis.edu |date=2010-01-08[/tpl] Monash University, Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://arts.monash.edu.au/jewish-civilisation/study-areas/yiddish-language-culture/ |title=Program in Yiddish language and Culture |publisher=arts.monash.edu.au|date=2011-10-05[/tpl] University College London,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/courses/courses.php |title=Courses – Department of Hebrew & Jewish Studies – University College London |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] University of Oxford,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/hjs/yiddish.html|title=Studying Yiddish at Oxford|accessdate=2011-11-05[/tpl] University of Maryland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishstudies.umd.edu/courses/index.html|title=University of Maryland Meyerhoff Center for Jewish Studies|accessdate=2011-09-11[/tpl] YIVO, New York University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://yivo.as.nyu.edu/page/home |title=Uriel Weinreich Program in Yiddsh Language, Literature, and Culture > Home |publisher=Yivo.as.nyu.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Hampshire College campus at Amherst[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yiddishsummer.org/internship-information.html |title=Summer Yiddish Internship 2010 |publisher=Yiddish Summer.org |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] (home of the National Yiddish Book Center), Binghamton University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.binghamton.edu/judaic-studies/courses.html |title=judaic studies |publisher= binghamton.edu |accessdate=2010-10-12[/tpl] Harvard University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~nelc/yiddish.html |title=Yiddish Language and Literature |publisher=Fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Stanford University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/hebrew/yiddish/ |title=Yiddish at Stanford |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] University of Pennsylvania,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/register/ydsh.html |title=Yiddish (Ydsh) |publisher=Upenn.edu |date=2003-02-28 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Indiana University, Bloomington,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~germanic/dutch/#yiddish |title=Dutch, Norwegian & Yiddish | Germanic Studies, Indiana University Bloomington |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] The Ohio State University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://germanic.osu.edu/undergrad/yiddish/ylang.cfm |title=The Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures |publisher=Germanic.osu.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20060901102915/http://germanic.osu.edu/undergrad/yiddish/ylang.cfm |archivedate = September 1, 2006[/tpl] University of Düsseldorf,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/ijs/studium-und-lehre/ |title=Philosophische Fakultät der HHUD: Studium und Lehre |publisher=Phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] University of Chicago,[tpl]cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/german/06_courses/coursesYDDH.html |title=Department of Germanic Studies |publisher=Humanities.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Columbia University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/german/programs/yiddish/about.htm|title=Columbia University Yiddish Studies Program|accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl] Vassar College,[tpl]cite web|url=http://silp.vassar.edu/yiddish.html |title=Vassar College SILP – Yiddish |publisher=Silp.vassar.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] UMass Amherst,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/ug_catalog/archive_2002/judaic/judaiccourses.html#yiddish |title=UMass Course Catalog: Judaic & Near Eastern Studies Courses |publisher=Umass.edu |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] McGill University,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/jewishstudies/category/tags/yiddish |title=yiddish | Jewish Studies מדעי היהדות -
