==Early life and family==

Her brother Gerry explained the change simply: "Bronstein's Orchestral Service was a bit of a mouthful."[tpl]cite news|last=Westbrook|first=Caroline|title=Gerry Bron interview|pages=|publisher=Something Jewish|date=3 April 2007|url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/2267_gerry_bron_interview.htm|accessdate=24 April 2007[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early work===
