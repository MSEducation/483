King's Bridge, which carries the A74 across the river, was built in 1933 and has four 21 metre spans containing a series of rivetted steel plate girders which support the reinforced concrete bridge deck. With deep foundations, the piers divide at low level to create the arches. The bridge is a low level bridge and was designed by TPM Somers.[tpl]cite web|title=King's Bridge|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8039|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=11/8/13[/tpl]
