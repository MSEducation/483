Concours Eurovision is the Swiss Eurovision national selection. This has been held on an irregular basis since 1956. During the 1980s, the contest tended to have ten participating songs - three in French, three in German, three in Italian and one in Romansch. 
A number of Swiss entrants have made multiple appearances in the contest, such as Mariella Farré 1981,83,85, Daniela Simmons in 1983,85, 86 and Arlette Zola in 1982,84 and 85. The legendary Peter, Sue & Marc appeared on six occasions - 1973,74,75,76,79 and 81. Céline Dion won the 1988 final by just seven points over her nearest rivals, Furbaz.
In 2005 the show was indefinitely cancelled when SRG SSR started to stage internal selection contests. For the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 a new open selection format called Die grosse Entscheidungs Show was established. This new show is being held annually since then.
