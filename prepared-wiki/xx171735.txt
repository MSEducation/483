==History==

Originally built in 1907 as the Southern Manual Training High School for boys. The Philadelphia School District administrators opened the School merely as a three year training facility for immigrant children, mostly Jewish and Italian, and children who lacked intellectual skills who “could only work with their hands”. But Israel Goldstein, a student, and first alumni scholarship winner in 1911, showed to school administrators that there was more promise for academics. He graduated the school at age 14 and then graduated the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 17. Israel Goldstein became a Rabbi, an author, spiritual leader and founder of Brandeis University in Waltham Mass. He became a leader of the Zionist movement in America and founder of the National Conference for Christians and Jews. Due in part to young Israel Goldstein as an example of student possibilities the 3-year training facility became a full four-year co-ed High School.
In the late 1960s the population in South Philadelphia changed from predominately poor Jewish and Italian immigrant and first generation children to include low-middle income Afro-American and immigrant Asian-American children. The number of student enrollment from 1960 to 2009 declined from over 1,000 to less than 500 students.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In the 2000s the school had an Asian American population that made up around 20% of the school, and that population consisted mostly of new immigrants. Tammy Kim of Hyphen said "the school, despite its otherwise nefarious reputation, has become well known for its English as a second language program."Kim, Tammy.

In December 2009, several Asian American students accused the school district of mishandling racial attacks that targeted Asian-American students.Asian students protest violence at South Philly High ABC News, Dec. 7th, 2009. On December 4, 2009, 26 Asian-American students, most of whom were of Chinese and Vietnamese descent, were attacked by a large group of African American students near campus.26 Asian Students Attacked at Philly High School NBCPhiladelphia.com December 4, 2009. Officials involved in resolving the incident, including Superintendent Arlene Ackerman and retired U.S. District Court Judge James T. Giles, were accused of failing to address the rising racial tension between different ethnic groups within the school, mishandling key evidence and eyewitness accounts in recent related attacks, and falsely accusing and punishing Asian-American students for inciting the attacks. Their actions prompted national outrage and boycotts from local Asian-American communities.Gammage, Jeff and Kristen A. Graham. "An Asian's anguish at S. Phila.

==Architecture==

The original school building was constructed 1907 in a Norman Romanesque style designed by Board of Education Architect Lloyd Titus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/pj_display.cfm/157134%7cArchitect |title=Lloyd Titus Philadelphia Architects and Building Profile original building name Southern Manual Training School |publisher=Philadelphiabuildings.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29[/tpl] The main building had an exterior grey stone façade, with two additions added.
Student capacity was three hundred fifty boy students. It expanded in 1914 for more boy students and a duplicate structure built for a new Girls' School with a passage connecting the two buildings that was referred to as "The Tunnel". In 1941 an open field located seven blocks south at 10th and Bigler streets was purchased by a student fund raising and added to the school property as an athletic field to enhance the athletic program. The field was competely renovated in 2008 by the School District of Philadelphia as a supercomplex for larger District-wide events. The original School of 1907 was demolished in 1955.
A new rectangular shaped building was constructed and opened in 1956 on half of the site. The single building was built as a co-ed facility. The frontage included a new grand sized patio plaza entrance, large ashalpted school yard and significant green space enclosed with a regal looking four foot black iron railing tipped in gold painted points. The modern architecture style utilized interior walls of cinder block, cement flooring and staircases, with a facade of light colored tan brick and large glavanized steel metal framed classroom windows.  It contained four stories of 190 classrooms with an all modern infra-structure, a large gymnasium, auditorium and lunchroom with 1,500 seats.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In 2013 South Philadelphia High School in partnership with the Lower Moyamensing Civic Association gathered resources for a new sustainable master plan on urban crowdsourcing platform Projexity. The master plan anticipates the creation of rooftop agriculture, outdoor classrooms, porous pavement, solar panels, and many more improvements.http://www.gridphilly.com/grid-magazine/2013/4/9/a-blossoming-vision-for-south-philly-high-school.html
