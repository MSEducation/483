Sugar House Prison, previously the Utah Territorial Penitentiary, was a prison in the Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. The [tpl]convert|180|acre|sing=on[/tpl] prison housed more than 400 inmates. It was closed in 1951 due to encroaching housing development, and all of its inmates were moved to the new Utah State Prison in Draper. The site is now occupied by Sugar House Park and Highland High School.[tpl]cite news|first=Olga|last=Muñoz|title=Life behind bars intrigues young hearts|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=6526477&itype=NGPSID&keyword=&qtype=|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|location=Salt Lake City|date=2 Aug 2007|accessdate=6 May 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Territorial prison===

Plans for a penitentiary to serve the newly established Utah Territory were drawn up in March 1853. In the following October, territorial governor Brigham Young selected the [tpl]convert|10|acre|sing=on[/tpl] government-owned site, then known as "The Big Field Survey", about six miles from central Salt Lake City. Sixteen "cozy cells dug into the ground, with iron bars on top" comprised the original prison at a cost of $32,000. The facility that became known as the Utah Territorial Penitentiary was opened in January 1855. In 1867, the Utah Territorial Legislature determined that the prison was inadequate and once considered moving it onto an island in the Great Salt Lake. From 1871 to 1896, the penitentiary was federally operated by U.S. Marshals. The inmate capacity was expanded in 1885 to accommodate 200 individuals with the construction of a new cell house and prison walls.[tpl]cite news|last=Arave|first=Lynn|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/640192787/Prison-once-stood-where-park-now-is.html|title=Prison once stood where park now is|newspaper=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret Digital Media|location=Salt Lake City|pages=1–2|date=14 Jul 2006|accessdate=6 May 2013[/tpl]

===State prison===

After becoming a state in 1896, Utah assumed operation of the penitentiary, also called the "state pen", from the federal government. Starting in 1900, executions by the state were carried out in the prison. Prior to that, death penalties were administered in the counties where the crimes had been committed.[tpl]cite news|last=Schindler|first=Hal|title=Taylor's Death Was Quick . . .

With the continuing growth of Salt Lake City, the local residents eventually wanted the prison population relocated away from the neighborhood of Sugar House. In 1937, plans were approved for a new prison, 22 miles south of the city in Draper. By 1941, work began on the 1009-acre (408 ha) site, then called "Point of the Mountain", to replace the aging penitentiary. However, construction of the new facility was delayed because of shortages stemming from World War II. On March 12, 1951, the 575 inmates at the old prison were transferred by bus to the newly completed Utah State Prison. After nine sticks of dynamite had little effect on the heavy walls of the shuttered penitentiary, the demolition of many sections had to be carried out stone by stone.[tpl]cite news|last=Arave|first=Lynn|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/640192787/Prison-once-stood-where-park-now-is.html|title=Prison once stood where park now is|newspaper=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret Digital Media|location=Salt Lake City|page=3|date=14 Jul 2006|accessdate=6 May 2013[/tpl]

===State park===

Following the razing of the old prison, proposals to repurpose the land included an amusement park, campground, golf course, and shopping center. The former site eventually became Sugar House Park while [tpl]convert|30|acres|ha[/tpl] were set aside for the future campus of Highland High School.
