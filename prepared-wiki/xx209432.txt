It was Baker's first album for Blue Note Records and her first album of new material in ten years. For her comeback album, Baker wanted to be "in control" of everything, and once again teamed up with Barry J. Eastmond and George Duke. Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds also contributed. Most of the tracks were cut live (meaning the band played while Baker sang).
Baker wrote or co-wrote eight of the album's ten tracks. The last track, "Men in My Life" was written for her husband and two sons.
