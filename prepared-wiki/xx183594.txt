George Robinson Cartier (May 26, 1869 in Ludington, Michigan – October 21, 1944 in Tacoma, Washington) was an American football player and lumber baron in the Pacific northwest.
George Cartier holds the distinction of being the quarterback for the very first game in the history of the Notre Dame football program—a 0-8 loss to Michigan on November 23, 1887. George was the younger brother of philanthropist Warren A. Cartier, for whom the university's Cartier Field is named.
After graduating from Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Cartier relocated to South Bend, Washington, where he became co-founder and manager of the South Bend Mills & Timber Company, and would be elected mayor of the city in 1910. In 1919, he built the Copper Creek Lodge near Mount Rainier in Ashford, Washington, and lived there with his wife and daughter until 1931.
