St. Louis baker Gustav Papendick bought Rohwedder's second bread slicer and set out to improve it by devising a way to keep the slices together at least long enough to allow the loaves to be wrapped.  After failures trying rubber bands and metal pins, he settled on placing the slices into a cardboard tray. The tray aligned the slices, allowing mechanized wrapping machines to function.Hammack, William. (2003). Commentary from Bill Hammack's Engineering and Life radio program.

W.E. Long, who promoted the Holsum Bread brand, used by various independent bakers around the country, pioneered and promoted the packaging of sliced bread beginning in 1928.Holsum - History. In 1930 Wonder Bread, first sold in 1925, started marketing sliced bread nationwide.

==Effects==

As commercially sliced bread resulted in uniform and somewhat thinner slices, people ate more slices of bread at a time, and ate bread more frequently, because of the ease of eating another piece of bread. This increased consumption of bread and, in turn, increased consumption of spreads, such as jam, to put on the bread.

==1943 U.S. ban on sliced bread==

During 1943, U.S. officials imposed a short-lived ban on sliced bread as a wartime conservation measure.Levenstein, Harvey (2003). Paradox of Plenty: A Social History of Eating in Modern America. University of California Press, p. 82.Burton, Bill. "Liberty: Best Thing Since Sliced Bread". Bay City Weekly, January 25, 2001. The ban was ordered by Claude R. Wickard who held the position of Food Administrator, and took effect on January 18, 1943. According to the New York Times, officials explained that "the ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out." It was also intended to counteract a rise in the price of bread, caused by the Office of Price Administration's authorization of a ten percent increase in flour prices.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sliced Bread Put Back on Sale; Housewives' Thumbs Safe Again |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA061FFF3C59147B93CBA91788D85F478485F9 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=March 6, 1943 |page=16 [/tpl] ban took effect Jan 18; explained as paper-saving due to ready-sliced loafs needing heavier wrapping; also explained as cost-cutting measure; unpopularity of measure; rescinded March 8th; "four month's supply" of wax paper in the hands of bakers.
In a Sunday radio address on January 24, Mayor LaGuardia suggested that bakeries that had their own bread-slicing machines should be allowed to continue to use them, and on January 26, 1943, a letter appeared in the New York Times from a distraught housewife:
On January 26, however, John F. Conaboy, the New York Area Supervisor of the Food Distribution Administration, warned bakeries, delicatessens, and other stores that were continuing to slice bread to stop, saying that "to protect the cooperating bakeries against the unfair competition of those who continue to slice their own bread... we are prepared to take stern measures if necessary."[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Bread-Slicing Ban Extended Further |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60614F63D59147B93C4AB178AD85F478485F9 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=January 26, 1943 |page=16 [/tpl]
On March 8, 1943, the ban was rescinded. Wickard stated that "Our experience with the order, however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected, and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry.

==Around the world==

Due to its convenience, sliced bread is popular in many parts of the world, and the usual thickness varies by company and country:

==In popular culture==

The phrase "the greatest thing since sliced bread" is a commonly used hyperbolic means of praising an invention or development. A writer for The Kansas City Star wrote that "the phrase is the ultimate depiction of innovative achievement and American know-how."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascitystar/6405440.htm|title=History of sliced bread little known on 75th anniversary|newspaper=The Kansas City Star|date=2003-07-29|accessdate=2007-08-26|archivedate=2003-08-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030812080649/http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascitystar/6405440.htm[/tpl]
