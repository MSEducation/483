==Etymology==

According to the city's official website, the early Polish name of the settlement was Lasogród ("forest castle").Official Page of Wałbrzych History section 
The German name Waldenburg (also meaning "forest castle") refers to the castle Nowy Dwór, whose ruins stand south of the city; the name came to be used for the entire settlement.Weczerka, p.555. It first appeared in the 15th century coming from the words Wald ‘forest’ and Berg ‘mountain’ later associated with castlePoradniajezykowa.us.edu.pl The modern Polish name for the settlement,"Wałbrzych", comes from the German name Walbrich, a late medieval linguistic variation of the older names "Wallenberg" or "Walmberg".Barbara Czopek, Adaptacje niemieckich nazw miejscowych w języku polskim, 1995, pp.55, ISBN 83-85579-33-8

==History==

===Middle Ages===

According to the Geographical Dictionary of Poland published by Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, the city's predecessor, Lasogród, was an early medieval Slavic settlementSłownik geograficzno-krajoznawczy Polski Maria Irena Mileska 1994 page 781 Wydawn. Nauk. PWN, 1994 whose inhabitants engaged in hunting, honey gathering, and later agriculture. Lasogród eventually developed into a defensive fort, the remains of which were destroyed in the 19th century during expansion of the city.[tpl]cite web| title=Historia Wałbrzycha| url=http://www.um.walbrzych.pl/strony/nasze_miasto_poznaj_historia.htm|publisher=Wałbrzych City Office|accessdate=2 April 2009[/tpl]
Some German publications argue that no archaeological or written records support claims of a Slavic settlement or the existence of a castle before the late 13th century,Vorgeschichtliche Funde innerhalb des Stadtgebietes sind spärlich und zweifelhaft in der Deutung, so daß eine frühe Dauersiedlung nicht angenommen werden kann. Für die Existenz einer "Waldenburg" im Bereich der Altstadt gibt es keinerlei Anhaltspunkte. Weczerka, p.555 and that during the Middle Ages the area of Wałbrzych was part of the unpopulated Silesian Przesieka.Auch der Grenzwald spricht dagegen. Weczerka, p.416 and 555Badstübner, p.2.Petry, p.11. According to a writing from 1667 by jurist and historian Ephraim Ignatius Naso, Wałbrzych already existed as a small village in 1191.Kronika wałbrzyska Wałbrzyskie Towarzystwo Kultury, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe 1985 page 231 This claim was rejected by an 1886 publication from the German Empire,Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Band 23, page 261, Markgraf, Duncker & Humblot, 1886 and by German historian Hugo Weczerka,Die Behauptung, die "Waldenburg" sei 1191 erbaut worden (Naso), ist nicht haltbar. Weczerka, p.555 who says the city was founded between 1290 and 1293, and was mentioned as Waldenberc in 1305.
He places the city near Nowy Dwór ([tpl]lang-de|Neuhaus[/tpl]), built by Bolko I the Strict of the Polish royal Piast dynasty (Silesian branch) of Świdnica-Jawor ([tpl]lang-de|Schweidnitz-Jauer[/tpl]). The city website, however, mentions the building of the castle as a separate event in 1290.Um.walbrzych.pl A part of Nowy Dwór castle, a manor built in the 17th century, was destroyed in the 19th century.Weczerka, p.341.
The city was chartered in 1426, but it did not receive the rights to hold markets or other privileges due to the competition of nearby towns and the insignificance of the local landlords. Subsequently, the city became the property of the Silesian knightly families, initially the Schaffgotsches in 1372, later the Czettritzes, and from 1738, the Hochberg family, owners of Fürstenstein Castle.

===Modern Era===

Coal mining in the area was first mentioned in 1536. The settlement was transformed into an industrial centre  at the turn of the 19th century, when coal mining and weaving flourished. In 1843 the city obtained its first rail connection, which linked it with Breslau (Wrocław). In the early 20th century a glassworks and a large china tableware manufacturing plant, which are still in operation today, were built. In 1939 the city had about 65,000 inhabitants.
After World War II, became once more part of a  Polish state, and as in all of post-war Poland most of the German population was expelled[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]. However, Walbrzych was one of the few areas where several GermansWerner Besch, Dialektologie: Ein Handbuch zur Deutschen und allgemeinen Dialektforschung, Walter de Gruyter, 1982, p.178, ISBN 3-11-005977-0 were held back as they were deemed indispensable for the economy.Stefan Wolff, German Minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging, Berghahn Books, 2000, p.79, ISBN 157181504 A continuous post-war German society has been maintained in Walbrzych since 1957.
The city was relatively unscathed by the Second World War, and as a result of combining the nearby administrative districts with the town and the construction of new housing estates, Wałbrzych expanded geographically. At the beginning of the 1990s, because of new social and economic conditions, a decision was made to close down the town's coal mines. In 1995, a Museum of Industry and Technology was set up on the facilities of the oldest coal mine in the area, KWK THOREZ. The 2005 the film Komornik was filmed in and around Wałbrzych.
