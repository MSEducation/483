RDOS (''Real-time Disk Operating System'') was a real-time operating system released in 1972OS History - Data General [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] for the popular Data General Nova and Eclipse minicomputers. RDOS was capable of multitasking, with the ability to run up to 32 "tasks" (similar to threads on modern computer CPUs) simultaneously on each of two grounds (foreground and background) within a 64Â KB memory space. Later versions of RDOS were compatible with Data General's 16-bit Eclipse minicomputer line.
A cut-down version of RDOS, without real-time background and foreground capability, was called Data General Diskette Operating System (DG-DOS); another related operating system was RTOS, a Real-Time Operating System for diskless environments.  RDOS on microNOVA-based "Micro Products" micro-minicomputers was sometimes called DG/RDOS.  
RDOS was superseded in the early 1980s by Data General's AOS family of operating systems, including AOS/VS and MP/AOS (MP/OS on smaller systems).
