Farmhouse Kitchen was a cookery series that was produced by Yorkshire Television and aired on the ITV network from 1971 until 1989. It was hosted by Dorothy Sleightholme and later by Grace Mulligan.
The programme, which was shown weekly and usually on a weekday afternoon, was aimed at housewives and homemakers, and sought to educate its viewers by presenting visual demonstrations of old-fashioned British cookery as well as thrifty ways to feed a family on a budget.  Yorkshire Television published a number of cookbooks containing recipes from the show.  Following the death of Dorothy Sleightholme in a car accident, Grace Mulligan took over presenting duties.  Celebrity guest cooks such as Mary Berry were invited onto the programme, and viewers were invited to send in their own recipes to be cooked onscreen,
The memorable, vibraphone-heavy theme music was "Fruity Flute", played by Alan Hawkshaw and his band.
