Jesse Frank Ford, known as Frank Ford (January 16, 1933 - February 2, 2011), was a Texas farmer and health-foods advocate who in 1960 founded Arrowhead Mills, the largest natural foods wholesaler in the United States. The company is based in his native Hereford, the seat of  Deaf Smith County west of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Arrowhead Mills removes impurities from corn and wheat and farms without pesticides.

==Arrowhead Mills==

Arrowhead Mills operates four warehouses, containing over [tpl]convert|30000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of storage space, and holds tons of food for shipment to a nationwide network of distributors.Frank Ford 
Ford sought to provide large-scale stone grinding of grain and to maintain  natural soil nutrition. He took the view that all farming should first maintain and then improve the soil. He served as chairman of the trade association, the National Nutritional Food Association. During the formative years of Arrowhead Mills, Ford personally did most of the growing, grinding, sacking, trucking, warehousing, shipping, and bookkeeping. Slowly, the investment of time, money, and energy began to pay dividends from the increased national awareness of organic foods and sound nutrition. Ford also was an advertising spokesman for the natural food industry during the 1960s and 1970s.http://www.naturalfoodsmerchandiser.com/ASP/articleDisplay.asp?strArticleId=973&strSite=NFMSite&Screen=HOME
Ford said that he is convinced that "the natural-foods movement is not over the hill at all. In fact, I think it's just coming into its own. The rest of the country is finally beginning to realize that we have to conserve our resources and utilize them correctly . . . that whole foods are best and natural growing methods are really the most efficient."Frank Ford

==Social activist==

Ford claimed to represent the "common man" in public affairs. A labor activist, he tried to pay higher wages at Arrowhead Mills than other such companies offer. He never drew a salary from the company that was more than three times that of his lowest-paid employee. Ford was a spokesman for small farmers through his position on an agricultural advisory committee in Washington, D.C. He helped to formulate plans for sewage recycling projects. In the 1980s, he led the opposition to an attempt by the United States Department of Energy to locate a controversial nuclear waste site in Deaf Smith County, an action which Ford claimed would have imperiled Arrowhead Mills as well as the pivotal Ogallala Aquifer, the source of most West Texas water. The site was instead located at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
