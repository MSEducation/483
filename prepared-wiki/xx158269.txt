Dennis Lawrence "Dan" McGann (July 15, 1871 – December 13, 1910), also known as Cap McGann, was a professional baseball player who played first base in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1896 to 1908. He was a member of the NL pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas in 1899 and New York Giants in 1904 and 1905. He was also a member of the 1905 World Series champions.
After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895, McGann played in  MLB for the Boston Beaneaters (1896), Baltimore Orioles (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899), Washington Senators (1899), and St. Louis Cardinals (1900–1901) of the National League (NL) before jumping to the rival American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles in 1902. He returned to the NL, playing for the New York Giants (1902–1907) and Boston Doves (1908). In 1909–10, he played for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association.
McGann had a troubled personal life. He suffered from depression, and several members of his family committed suicide. After the 1910 season, with rumors of McGann signing with another minor league team, McGann committed suicide with a firearm.

==Career==

===Early career (1891–1897)===

McGann began his professional baseball career in minor league baseball with a team representing his hometown, Shelbyville, Kentucky, in 1891. He also played for Kentucky teams representing Harrodsburg in 1892, Lexington in 1893, and Maysville in 1894.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/8a6f31e5|title=Dan McGann|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=March 23, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1646063562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Mar+03%2C+1902&author=&pub=The+Sun+%281837-1985%29&desc=Article+1+--+No+Title&pqatl=google|title=Article 1|newspaper=The Sun|page=6|date=March 3, 1902|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required|date=April 2012[/tpl] McGann played for the Norfolk Clams/Crows of the Class-B Virginia State League in 1895 and the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Class-B Virginia League in 1896. He initially played all positions except for pitcher, catcher, and first baseman.
In August 1896, the Boston Beaneaters of the National League (NL) purchased McGann from Lynchburg to fill in for injured second baseman Bobby Lowe. McGann batted .322 with the Beaneaters, hitting for power, but he committed 21 errors in 43 games. The Beaneaters released him following the completion of the season. McGann played the 1897 season with the Toronto Canucks of the Class-A Eastern League. He moved to first base and batted .354, leading the Eastern League with 20 triples.

===Major League Baseball (1898–1908)===

The Washington Senators of the NL purchased McGann, Butts Wagner, Bob McHale and Cooney Snyder from Toronto for $8,500 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|8500|1897[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms) on September 22, 1897. The Senators traded McGann with Gene DeMontreville and Doc McJames to the Baltimore Orioles of the NL for Doc Amole, Jack Doyle and Heinie Reitz that December.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcganda01.shtml|title=Dan McGann Statistics and History|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl] He played one season with the Orioles, in which he batted .301 with 106 runs batted in (RBI) in 1898, good for fifth place in the NL.
When Orioles manager Ned Hanlon was hired to manage the Brooklyn Superbas during the 1899 season, receiving an ownership stake in the team to  do so, he assigned several of his star players, including McGann, Joe McGinnity, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler to the Superbas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/40189310.html?dids=40189310:40189310&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+21%2C+1999&author=John+Steadman&pub=The+Sun&desc=%27Where+They+Ain%27t%27%3A+robbing+Baltimore&pqatl=google|title='Where They Ain't': robbing Baltimore|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|first=John|last=Steadman|date=March 21, 1999|accessdate=April 3, 2012|page=12.F[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required|date=April 2012[/tpl] McGann finished second on the team in RBIs with 106, behind Kelley.
McGann batted .243 for the Superbas through July 14, 1899, when they traded him with Aleck Smith to the Senators for Deacon McGuire. For the Senators, McGann batted .343 during the rest of the 1899 season. Short on money, the Senators sold McGann and Gus Weyhing to the St. Louis Cardinals for $5,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|5000|1899[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms) on March 9, 1900. McGann left the Cardinals before the end of 1901 season, for unknown reasons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5whhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SmQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2721,2988231&dq=dan-mcgann&hl=en|title=Baseball Briefs|newspaper=The Toledo Bee|page=6|date=September 24, 1901|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl] The Cardinals replaced McGann with Bill Richardson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DRAbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kEgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4482,3385448&dq=dan-mcgann&hl=en|title=Baseball Gossip |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|page=8|date=September 26, 1901|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl]
With the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, McGann joined many fellow NL players who jumped to the AL. Following Cardinals teammate John McGraw, who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season, McGann signed with the Orioles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0713FE345F13738DDDAE0894DA415B838DF1D3|title=War that Crippled National League: Ban Johnson's Campaign Swept Star Players Out of the  Old Organization|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 7, 1913|accessdate=March 23, 2012|format=PDF[/tpl] 
However, the Orioles struggled with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|12000|1902[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms).[tpl]cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/17b00755|title=Joe Kelley|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|first=Jimmy|last=Keenan|accessdate=March 24, 2012[/tpl] Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares.[tpl]cite web|first=Jimmy|last=Keenan|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/fae12278|title=Sport McAllister|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl] On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/408614551.html?dids=408614551:408614551&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jul+17%2C+1902&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=FREEDMAN+BUYS+BALTIMORE+CLUB&pqatl=google|title=Freedman Buys Baltimore Club: President, Mahon Sells Out American Magnates to National League.

With the Giants, McGraw installed McGann at first base, moving Christy Mathewson to pitcher. McGann stole 36 bases in the 1903 season. After the season, McGann and some of his Giants teammates threatened to quit the team due to the treatment of Brush, now the Giants owner, for allegedly going back on a promise to provide the Giants with a monetary bonus for having the Giants finish in the top three of the NL and a share of the gate receipts from exhibition games, in which they were paid $56.35 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|56.35|1903[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms), though Brush allegedly had made over $200,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|200000|1903[/tpl][/tpl] in current dollar terms).

McGann developed a reputation as a fighter in 1905. On April 21, 1905, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, McGann punched catcher Fred Abbott after McGann was thrown out at home plate. Abbott hit McGann in the back with the ball, resulting in both players being ejected from the game.[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B1FFA3F5E12738DDDAA0A94DC405B858CF1D3|title=Fight on the Diamond — McGann Loses His Temper and Strikes Catcher Abbott|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 23, 1905|accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl] McGann batted .299 with 14 triples in 1905 as the Giants won NL pennant for the second consecutive year.
