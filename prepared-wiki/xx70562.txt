Shamoke (died 222) was the king of the tribal people of the five valleys in Wuling during the late Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history. During the Battle of Xiaoting between the warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, Shamoke led his troops to support Liu and was granted an official post by Liu. Shamoke was later killed in action when Sun Quan's forces, led by Lu Xun, defeated Liu's armies in a fire attack.

==In fiction==

In Luo Guanzhong's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Shamoke is responsible for killing Sun Quan's general Gan Ning during the Battle of Xiaoting. Historically, Gan did not participate in the battle.
In the novel, Shamoke's appearance was described to be as such:
Upon seeing this, Gan Ning, who was sick at the time, realized he could not win against Shamoke, and he began to retreat on horseback. As he tried to escape, however, Shamoke shot him in the back of the head with an arrow, killing him. Later in the battle, Shamoke was caught in the middle of a fire attack and fled, where he was pursued by Zhou Tai, who caught up and cut him down after a short fight.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 83-84.
