The town was named after the nearby Aprelevka River. While the name is quite similar to the Russian word "[tpl]lang|ru|апрель[/tpl]" (April), it bears no etymological connection to it. Rather, it is derived from the word "[tpl]lang|ru|прель[/tpl]", meaning a "damp place" or a "bog".ISBN 530900257Х.  Г. П.  Смолицкая. "Топонимический словарь Центральной России".
