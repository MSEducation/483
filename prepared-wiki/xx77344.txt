CATEGORIES: District of Acre, States and territories established in the 19th century, Sanjaks of the Ottoman Empire

The Sanjak of Acre ([tpl]lang-tr|Akka Sancağı[/tpl]) was a prefecture (sanjak) of the Ottoman Empire, located in modern-day northern Israel. The city of Acre was the sanjak's capital.
Acre was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I in 1517, but the city fell into disuse soon thereafter. Acre was the center of a major economic boom under the leadership of Dahar al-Omar during the late 18th century.
Acre Sanjak was created c. early 19th century as a prefecture of the Sidon Eyalet. The Sidon Eyalet later became known as the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841 when Acre was designated as the eyalet's capital city. Following the promulgation of the Vilayet Law as per the then-ongoing Tanzimat, or administrative reforms, in 1864, the sanjak of Acre was annexed to the newly created Syria Vilayet. In 1888, the sanjaks of Acre, Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, and Nablus were separated from the Syria Vilayet and transferred to the Beirut Vilayet.Eurosis European Multidisciplinary Society for Modelling and Simulation Technology
