The Democratic Republic of the Congo ([tpl]lang-fr|République démocratique du Congo[/tpl]), often referred to as DR Congo, DRC or RDC, and formerly known or referred to as Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-Léopoldville, Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire (or Zaïre in French), is the third largest country by area on the African continent. Though it is located in the Central African UN subregion, the nation is economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It borders the Central African Republic and Sudan on the north, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi on the east, Zambia and Angola on the south, the Republic of the Congo on the west, and is separated from Tanzania by Lake Tanganyika on the east.[tpl]cite book |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |title=CIA - The World Factbook|chapter=Democratic Republic of the Congo |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html|date=10 January 2006|id=ISSN 1553-8133[/tpl] The country enjoys access to the ocean through a forty-kilometre stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly nine-kilometre wide mouth of the Congo river which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. The name "Congo" (meaning "hunter") is coined after the Bakongo ethnic group who live in the Congo river basin.
