The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Morarji Desai submitted a special interim report on "Problems of Redressal of Citizen's Grievances" in 1966. In this report, the ARC recommended the setting up of two special authorities designated as 'Lokpal' and 'Lokayukta' for the redressal of citizens' grievances.
The LokAyukta, along with the Income Tax Department and the Anti Corruption Bureau, mainly helps people publicize corruption among the Politicians and Government Officials.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/a-watchdog-without-teeth/639851/0|title=A watchdog without teeth |accessdate= 2010-06-30 |publisher=Indian Express[/tpl] Many acts of the LokAyukta have not resulted in criminal or other consequences for those charged.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_fed-up-with-corruption-karnataka-lokayukta-santosh-hegde-resigns_1400381 |title=Fed up with corruption, Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde resigns|accessdate= 2010-06-24 |publisher=Daily News and Analysis[/tpl]

==History==

Orrisa was the first state to introduce the institution of Lokayukta through The Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas Act in 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=The Maharashtra Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayuktas Act, 1971|url=http://gad.maharashtra.gov.in/Sitemap/gad/pdf/LokAayuktaActEng.pdf|publisher=General Administration Department, Government of Maharashtra|accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Lokayukta a 'paper tiger' in Anna's home state|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-18/mumbai/29900222_1_upa-lokayukta-powers-report|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Aug 18, 2011[/tpl] This was followed by similar acts being enacted by states of Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi.
Maharashtra Lokayukta is considered as weak due to lack of powers, adequate staff, funds and no independent investigating agency.[tpl]cite news|title=Let's look at Lokayukta for a change!|url=http://www.mid-day.com/opinion/2011/dec/261211-opinion-Lets-look-at-Lokayukta-for-a-change.htm|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=Mid-Day|date=2011-12-26[/tpl] Karnataka Lokayukta is considered as the most powerful Lokayukta in the country.

==Constitutional Amendment for Effectiveness==

An amendment to the Constitution has been proposed to implement the Lokayukta uniformly across Indian states. The proposed changes will make the institution of Lokayukta uniform across the country as a three-member body, headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or high court chief justice and comprising the state vigilance commissioner and a jurist or an eminent administrator as other members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/78301/lokayukta-may-get-constitutional-status.html |title=Lokayukta may get constitutional status|accessdate= 2010-06-30 |publisher=Deccan Herald[/tpl]
