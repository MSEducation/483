==Philosophy==

Chipimo recently established the Restoration Forum which is an organization that aims to encourage every Zambian to take more of a measure of responsibility and better manage the five important areas that underpin personal responsibility: managing time; living up to our commitments; vision and planning; fact-based rather than emotional driven decision-making; greater independence in thought and action. Chipimo has published a book based on his opinion of the leadership in Zambia and the current state of the nation. The book, titled “Unequal to the Task”, is available in bookstores around Zambia.
