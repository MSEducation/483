[[List of NBA season leaders in three-point field goal percentage]]

CATEGORIES: National Basketball Association lists, National Basketball Association statistical leaders

In basketball, a three-point field goal (also known as a "three-pointer" or "3-pointer") is a field goal made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/baskBasi/glos.asp|title=Basketball glossary|work=FIBA.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010[/tpl] A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The National Basketball Association's (NBA) three-point shooting leader is the player with the highest three-point field goal percentage in a given season. The statistic was first recognized in the 1979–80 season when the three-point line was first implemented that season. To qualify as a three-point shooting leader, the player must have at least 55 three-point field goals made. This has been the entry criteria since the 1999–2000 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/rate_stat_req.html|title=Rate Statistic Requirements|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=March 5, 2010[/tpl]
Craig Hodges, Steve Kerr, Jason Kapono and Kyle Korver have each led the league in three-point shooting for two seasons. Kapono is the only player to do so in consecutive seasons.  Korver, who shot 53.6% from beyond the arc in the 2009–10 season, holds the all-time record for three-point field goal percentage in a season.
None of the leaders in this statistic have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
