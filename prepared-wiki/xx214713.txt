Stunts are on a larger scale and more extreme than stunts shown in the TV show. 
The film also features the first cross over battle between two stunt groups. In their tour of Japan, the Dirty Sanchez team battles the Tokyo Shock Boys to see who is more extreme. In the end the Tokyo Shock Boys refuse to do a live show with Dirty Sanchez due to their disgusting antics.

The movie premiered on television on MTV One at 10.30pm on 5 August 2007. Many of the scenes and stunts were cut short or not shown due to viewing reasons. TMF broadcast the movie later that month.
The movie premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.
