[[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by continent]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of countries by continent, Country classifications, Dependent territories

This is a list of sovereign states and dependent territories of the world by continent, displayed with their respective national flags and capitals, including the following entities:
This list divides the world using the seven-continent model, with islands grouped into adjacent continents. The continents are:
In other models, Asia and Europe can be combined as Eurasia, while North and South America can be combined as the Americas (for a detailed description of how the world is divided into continents, including different models, see Continent: definitions and application).
There are sovereign states and dependent territories that can be considered to belong to more than one continent, according to geographical, political, or historical criteria.

==Classification according to United Nations geoscheme==

In this list, the sovereign states and dependent territories are classified according to the geoscheme created by the United Nations Statistics Division.[tpl]cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division[/tpl] According to the UN, the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.[tpl]cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm| title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division[/tpl]

==Continental intergovernmental organizations==

There are a number of intergovernmental organizations with continental scope and having the most wide and possibly non-overlapping membership:
Therefore, a member of one of these organizations may be considered as belonging to that particular continent according to political criteria. Considering this, the following changes from the previous list occur:
However, in general only internationally recognized sovereign states are members of intergovernmental organizations, and not every one of them is a member of one of the organizations listed above.

===Dependent territories===

Dependent territories, through political ties with their mother countries, may be associated with another continent other than its own geographical continent. For example, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Réunion, all overseas departments of France, are part of the EU and use the euro as their official currency. Other dependent territories of EU members, such as Greenland, while not part of the EU, enjoy special relationships with the EU.
The following dependent territories, all of them sparsely populated islands remote from continental mass, may be grouped into more than one continent, as there is no general convention as to which continent they belong to:
