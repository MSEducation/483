The Burkittsville Historic District comprises the small town of Burkittsville, Maryland.  Located at a crossroads in western Frederick County, the town is a consistent collection of early 19th-century Federal style houses mixed with a few Victorian style houses that has remained virtually unchanged since 1900.  The town is surrounded on three sides by an open, farmed landscape, and nestles against South Mountain on its western side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=350&COUNTY=Frederick&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Frederick|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
The town was involved in a number of Civil War actions, including the Battle of Crampton's Gap in 1862.
