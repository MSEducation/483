Work on the series started during Dürer's first trip to Italy (1494–95), and the set was published simultaneously in Latin and German at Nuremberg in 1498, at a time when much of Europe anticipated a possible Last Judgment at 1500. The most famous print in the series is The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (ca. 1497–98),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/durr/ho_19.73.209.htm|title= Albrecht Dürer: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=2008-07-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080905022342/http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/HD/durr/ho_19.73.209.htm| archivedate= 5 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] referring to [tpl]niv|Revelation|6:1–8|Revelation 6:1–8[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%C3%BCrer_the_four_horsem.aspx|title= Albrecht Dürer The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, a woodcut|publisher=BritishMuseum.org |accessdate=2008-07-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080820012919/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/a/albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_the_four_horsem.aspx| archivedate= 20 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The layout of the cycle with the illustrations on the recto and the text on the verso suggests the privileging of the illustrations over the text. The series brought Dürer fame and wealth as well as some freedom from the patronage system, which, in turn, allowed him to choose his own subjects and to devote more time to engraving. In 1511, Dürer published the second edition of Apocalypse in a combined edition with his Life of the Virgin and Large Passion; single impressions were also produced and sold.Bartrum, 124

Jean Duvet's major work was an engraved series from the 1550s, influenced by Dürer but very different in style. Frans Masereel called his World War I series of 25 drawings The Apocalypse of Our Time; in 1943, Benton Spruance made a lithograph titled Riders of the Apocalypse. In 1945 [tpl]Ill|fr|Édouard Goerg[/tpl] published 20 lithographs in a series named The Apocalypse. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and another Dürer engraving called The Sea Beast appeared in the 2007 Russian TV series The Sea Devils 2 (Морские дьяволы-2).
