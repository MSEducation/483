[[Partial fraction decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Algebra, Elementary algebra, Partial fractions

In algebra, the partial fraction decomposition or partial fraction expansion of a rational fraction (that is a fraction such that the numerator and the denominator are both polynomials) is the operation that consists in expressing the fraction as a sum of a polynomial (possibly zero) and one or several fractions with a simpler denominator.
The importance of the partial fraction decomposition lies in the fact that it provides an algorithm for computing the antiderivative of a rational function.
In symbols, one can use partial fraction expansion to change a rational fraction in the form
where ƒ and g are polynomials, into an expression of the form
where gj (x) are polynomials that are factors of g(x), and are in general of lower degree. 
Thus, the partial fraction decomposition may be seen as the inverse procedure of the more elementary operation of addition of rational fractions, which produces a single rational fraction with a numerator and denominator usually of high degree.
The full decomposition pushes the reduction as far as it will go: in other words, the factorization of g is used as much as possible. Thus, the outcome of a full partial fraction expansion expresses that fraction as a sum of fractions, where:

==Basic principles==

The basic principles involved are quite simple; it is the algorithmic aspects that require attention in particular cases. On the other hand, the existence of a decomposition of a certain kind is an assumption in practical cases, and the principles should explain which assumptions are justified.
Assume a rational function R(x) = ƒ(x)/g(x) in one indeterminate x has a denominator that factors as
over a field K (we can take this to be real numbers, or complex numbers). If P and Q have no common factor, then R may be written as
for some polynomials A(x) and B(x) over K. The existence of such a decomposition is a consequence of the fact that the polynomial ring over K is a principal ideal domain, so that
for some polynomials C(x) and D(x) (see Bézout's identity).
Using this idea inductively we can write R(x) as a sum with denominators powers of irreducible polynomials. To take this further, if required, write:
as a sum with denominators powers of F and numerators of degree less than F, plus a possible extra polynomial. This can be done by the Euclidean algorithm, polynomial case.  The result is the following theorem:
