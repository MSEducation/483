  R:Assign [[arithmetic mean]] of #X and #Y to #AM
  C:#AM=(#X+#Y)/2

  J:*RESTART

  R:Search accept buffer for "TRUTH", the value of $MEXICO and "YOUTH", in that order
  M:TRUTH,$MEXICO,YOUTH

The first match string (if any) that is a substring of the accept buffer is assigned to the special variable $MATCH.  The buffer characters left of the first match are assigned to $LEFT, and the characters on the right are assigned to $RIGHT.
The match flag is set to 'yes' or 'no', depending on whether a match is made.  Any statement that has a Y following the command letter is processed only if the match flag is set.  Statements with N are processed only if the flag is not set.

  R:Output a literal string
  T:Thank you for your support.
  R:Output a variable expression
  T:Thank you, $NAME.

  R:Call subroutine starting at label *INITIALIZE
  U:*INITIALIZE

  R:Type message if x>y+z
  T(#X>#Y+#Z):Condition met

Between 1979 and 1983 the UK PILOT User Group was run by Alec Wood a teacher at Wirral Grammar School for Boys, Merseyside UK.  Several machine code versions of a mini PILOT were produced for the microcomputers of the time and a school in Scotland developed an interactive foreign language tutorial where pupils guided footprints around a town asking and answering questions in German, French etc. An article in Issue 1 December 1979 of Computer Age covered an early implementation called Tiny Pilot and gave a complete machine code listing.
Versions of PILOT overlaid on the BASIC interpreters of early microcomputers were not unknown in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and Byte Magazine at one point published a non-Turing complete derivative of PILOT known as Waduzitdo by Larry Kheriarty as a way of demonstrating what a computer was capable of.[tpl]Cite web |title= Waduzitdo 2001 |author= Brian Connors |date= April 6, 2001 |url= http://www.reocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Station/2266/tarpit/waduzitdo/wdzref.html |accessdate= October 13, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title= WADUZITDO: How To Write a Language in 256 Words or Less |work= Byte |author= Larry Kheriarty |date= September 1978 [/tpl]
