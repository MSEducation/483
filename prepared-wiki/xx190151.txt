Middle Pillar Presents is a New York based record label that specializes in ambient, gothic, and experimental music. The label began as distributor for other labels and artists entitled Middle Pillar Distribution. Eventually Kevin Dunn and James Babbo established Middle Pillar Presents to showcase artists unable to get signed elsewhere. The British independent label 4AD served as an inspiration to the founding of Middle Pillar Presents.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.morbidoutlook.com/music/articles/1999_00_middlepillar.html|title=Middle Pillar Presents |accessdate=2008-04-29 |last=McCutchan |first=Laura |quote=I like the idea of putting out just a lot of really great dark music that audiences can follow, like the glory days of 4AD.
