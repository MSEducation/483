</ref> For several days, Ama Dablam dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to [[Mount Everest]] basecamp.
Ama Dablam was first climbed on 13 March 1961 by Mike Gill (NZ), Barry Bishop (USA), Mike Ward (UK) and Wally Romanes (NZ) via the Southwest Ridge.  They were well-acclimatised to altitude, having wintered over at 5800 metres near the base of the peak as part of the Silver Hut Scientific Expedition of 1960-61, led by Sir Edmund Hillary.[tpl]Cite journal  | last = Kennedy  | first = Michael  | authorlink =   | author2 = Michael Ward  | title = Mountain Profile: Ama Dablam  | journal = Alpinist Magazine  | volume =   | issue = X  | page = 26  | publisher = Alpinist LLC  | location = Jackson, WY, USA  | date = March 2005  | url =  http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP10/profile-ama-dablam | issn = 1540-725X  | doi =   | accessdate = [/tpl]
