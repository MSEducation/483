==Career==

Sobieski was spotted by a talent scout who noticed her while he was scouting the cafeteria of a New York City private school. After that encounter, she became a candidate for the role of Claudia in Interview with the Vampire (1994), which she eventually lost out to Kirsten Dunst. She portrayed the character of Anna Yates in the 1994 TV movie Reunion, which starred Marlo Thomas. Next, she played a lead role in A Horse for Danny, a made-for-television film which was released in 1995. Later, she had a major role in the comedy feature film Jungle 2 Jungle, with Tim Allen. In the film, she played the daughter of Martin Short's character.
She rose to fame in her mid-teens with her appearance in the movie Deep Impact (1998).[tpl]cite web | title = Yahoo! - Biography | work = | url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019203/bio | accessdate = 2008-06-14[/tpl] The film was a major financial success, grossing over $349 million worldwide on a $75 million production budget. Deep Impact brought her to the attention of many casting directors. That same year Sobieski appeared in the Merchant Ivory film A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries. Sobieski's performance received praise from the critics; Emanuel Levy of Variety wrote that "the graceful Sobieski registers strongly as a potential star, combining physical charm with technical skill."[tpl]cite news|last=Levy |first=Emanuel |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117477810?refcatid=31 |title=Variety Reviews - A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries |publisher=Variety.com |date=1998-09-03 |accessdate=2010-11-20[/tpl] The film also garnered her a Young Artist Award nomination, as well as a nomination by the Chicago Film Critics Association.
In 1999, she was cast as a supporting role in the teen comedy feature Never Been Kissed, which was starring Drew Barrymore. Sobieski also played a modern Lolita in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. The film opened to generally positive reviews, but it generated several censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes. Recalling acting alongside Tom Cruise, she said he was "very kind and considerate with me," and says her most vivid recollection of Stanley Kubrick was that he "genuinely seemed to hold something magic".[tpl]cite journal | first = Yianni | last = Vassiliou | year = 2008 | title = 24 things in the life of Leelee Sobieski | journal = Wound Magazine | issue = 3| pages = 50–53 | location = London | issn = 1755-800X[/tpl] The title role in the TV movie Joan of Arc (1999) earned her an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe nomination, and she became the youngest actress ever to portray Joan of Arc in a movie.[tpl]cite web | title = Biography for Leelee Sobieski | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005447/bio | work = Internet Movie Database[/tpl] She received a second nomination for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Tosia Altman in the 2001 TV film Uprising.

In January 2009, Sobieski began dating fashion designer Adam Kimmel. Kimmel is the son of American real estate developer Martin Kimmel and grandson of American boat racer and designer Donald Aronow. They were engaged on May 28, 2009 but chose to keep the news private. It was made public June 23, 2009, when fans at the premiere of Public Enemies spotted that Sobieski was wearing an engagement ring.

Sobieski revealed that she remained a virgin until marrying Kimmel in 2009, saying "I guess 26 is kind of old to lose your virginity, but it was important to me that I remained a virgin until after I was married. It wasn’t for any religious reasons or anything like that, but simply because, to me, my virginity was the most precious gift that I could ever give to a man, and I wanted to be sure I was giving it to the right man".

During an interview, Sobieski spoke about her views on having happiness and a positive attitude: "I think that happiness is a very strange thing. And we really feel that we have a right to this happiness. But I feel like it's constantly fluctuating, and that you can make yourself happy. I think it's an outlook. Having a positive attitude probably sounds like a corny thing to say, but a positive attitude really helps, and respecting your job really helps, and having the support of your family and friends really helps."[tpl]cite web |url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20080418111840tsop.nb/topstory.html |title=Leelee Sobieski "88 Minutes" Interview with Kam Williams | publisher=Newsblaze.com | date=2008-04-18 |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 December 2012[/tpl]
Sobieski, in a 2001 interview with IGN, spoke about her thoughts on if the movies she was doing were escapist or that they had a message for society: "Joy Ride isn't a film you would make a statement with. It's a fun, jump out of life film. That's great. I love those films. Those films are great in times like these too. You can make a point with a film and help society or not. Take a film like Bulworth, a fantastic film. There are certain films like that, that can appeal to everybody and have a message in it and that's really great."
