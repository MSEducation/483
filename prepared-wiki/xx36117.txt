Kenya Airways is currently a public-private partnership. The largest shareholder is the Government of Kenya (29.8.%), followed by KLM, which has a 26.73% stake in the company. The rest of the shares are held by private owners; shares are traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, and the Uganda Securities Exchange.
Kenya Airways is widely considered as one of the leading Sub-Saharan operators; [tpl]As of|2013|1|lc=y[/tpl], the carrier was ranked [tpl]ordinal to word|4[/tpl] among the top ten ones that operate in Africa by seat capacity, behind South African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and EgyptAir.

==History==

Kenya Airways was established by the Kenyan government on [tpl]date|1977-1-22[/tpl], following the break-up of the East African Community and the consequent demise of East African Airways (EAA). On [tpl]date|1977-2-4[/tpl],[tpl]rp|90[/tpl] two Boeing 707–321s leased from British Midland Airways inaugurated operations, serving the Nairobi–Frankfurt–London route.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=97[/tpl] On internal and regional flights, the carrier deployed aircraft formerly operated by the EAA consortium, such as one Douglas DC-9-52 and three Fokker F-27-200s.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=97[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Flight International also reported that Kenya Airways flew Douglas DC-9-32s previously operated by EAA.|group="nb"[/tpl] In late 1977, three Boeing 707s were acquired from Northwest Orient.[tpl]cite journal|title= Airliner market|journal= Flight International|date= [tpl]date|1977-10-1[/tpl]|page= 937|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%202905.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/69b9jqMfL|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-8-1[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-8-1[/tpl]|quote= Kenya Airways has purchased three Boeing 707s from Northwest Orient[/tpl] The following year, the company formed a charter subsidiary named Kenya Flamingo Airlines, which leased aircraft from the parent airline in order to operate international passenger and cargo services.[tpl]cite journal|title=World airline directory[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Kenya Flamingo Airways|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1984/1984%20-%200565.html|journal=Flight International|pages=855|format=pdf|date=31 March 1984|accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl] Aer Lingus provided the company with technical and management support in the early years.[tpl]cite journal|title= World airline directory[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Kenya Airways|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201444.html|journal= Flight International|pages= 1382–1383|format= pdf|date= [tpl]date|1979-4-28[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]date|2011-4-2[/tpl]|quote= Aer Lingus is providing technical and management assistance under contract.[/tpl]
At [tpl]start date|1980|7[/tpl], the airline had 2,100 employees and a fleet of three Boeing 707-320Bs, one Boeing 720B, one DC-9-30 and three Fokker F-27-200s. At this time, Addis Ababa, Athens, Bombay, Cairo, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Jeddah, Kampala, Karachi, Khartoum, London, Lusaka, Mauritius, Mogadishu, Rome, Salisbury, Seychelles and Zurich were part of the airline's list of international destinations, whereas domestic services radiating from Nairobi to Kisumu, Malindi, Mombasa and Mumias were also operated. A Nairobi–Bombay nonstop route was launched in 1982 using Boeing 707-320B equipment.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=97,98[/tpl] A year later, the company commenced serving Tanzania. Flights to Burundi, Malawi and Rwanda were launched in 1984. Capacity on the European routes was boosted in [tpl]start date|1985|11[/tpl] with the incorporation of an Airbus A310-200 leased from Condor. Kilimanjaro was first served in [tpl]start date|1986|3[/tpl].[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=98[/tpl] That year, the airline ordered two Airbus A310-300s. Kenya Airways became the first African carrier in acquiring the type, and they were the first wide-bodies ordered by the company. Funded with a [tpl]US$|20000000|1986|link=yes[/tpl] loan, the delivery of these two aircraft took place in [tpl]MONTHNAME|5[/tpl] and [tpl]start date|1986|9[/tpl].[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=98[/tpl] They were put on service on the Kenya–Europe corridor, and permitted Kenya Airways to return the A310-200 to the lessor.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=98[/tpl] In early 1988, the carrier ordered two Fokker 50s; aimed at operating domestic routes, the airline received the first of these aircraft at the end of the year. Also in 1988, the lease of a third A310-300 was arranged with the International Lease Finance for a ten-year period;[tpl]cite journal|title= Orderbook|journal= Flight International|issn= 0015-3710|volume= 134|number= 4128|date= [tpl]Date|1988-8-27[/tpl]|page= 49|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1988/1988%20-%202291.html|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Ke5dWdZI|archivedate= [tpl]Date|2013-10-26[/tpl][/tpl] the aircraft joined the fleet in [tpl]start date|1989|11[/tpl].[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl] Leased from Ansett Worldwide, the first Boeing 757-200 was handed over to the company in [tpl]start date|1990|1[/tpl], whereas a third Fokker 50 was incorporated in [tpl]MONTHNAME|1990[/tpl] the same year. By late 1991, two Boeing 737-200s had been leased from Guiness Peat Aviation.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl]
In 1986, Sessional Paper Number 1 was published by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline would be better off if owned by private interests, thus resulting in the first attempt to privatise the airline. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the Public Enterprise Reform paper was published, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In [tpl]start date|1992|9[/tpl], Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl] Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation,[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl] working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company that provided Kenya Airways with privatisation advice.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl] In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to provide assistance in the privatisation process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost [tpl]US$|90[/tpl] million in debts and would convert another [tpl]US$|31[/tpl] million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate [tpl]US$|78[/tpl] million.[tpl]sfnp|Guttery|1998|p=99[/tpl] British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines that expressed interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.
KLM was eventually awarded the privatisation of the company, which restructured its debts and made a master corporation agreement with the Dutch airline that bought 26% of the shares, becoming the largest single shareholder since then. Shares were floated to the public in [tpl]Start date|1996|3[/tpl], and the airline started trading on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. The Government of Kenya kept a 23% stake in the company, and offered the remaining 51% to the public; however, non-Kenyan shareholders could at most had a participation of 49% in the airline. Despite 40% of the shares being kept by foreign investors following privatisation (including KLM[tpl]'s[/tpl] 26% stake), top management positions were held by Kenyans. Following the takeover, the government of Kenya capitalised [tpl]US$|70[/tpl] million, while the airline was awarded a [tpl]US$|15[/tpl] million loan from the International Finance Corporation to modernise its fleet. In a deal worth [tpl]US$|82[/tpl] million, two Boeing 737-300s were ordered in [tpl]start date|1996|7[/tpl].
In [tpl]start date|2000|1[/tpl], the airline experienced its first fatal accident when an Airbus A310 that had been bought new in 1986 crashed off Ivory Coast, shortly after taking off from Abidjan. By [tpl]MONTHNAME|4[/tpl] the same year, the aircraft park consisted of four Airbus A310-300s,[tpl]#tag:ref|It is likely that Flight International records had not been updated at the time of publish. Another source informed that the number of A310s in fleet immediately after the crash was three.|group="nb"[/tpl] two Boeing 737-200 Advanced and four Boeing 737-300s. At this time the company had a staff of 2,780, including 400 engineers, 146 flight crew and 365 cabin crew. From its main hub at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, scheduled services were operated to Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Amsterdam, Bujumbura, Cairo, Copenhagen, Dar es Salaam, Douala, Dubai, Eldoret, Entebbe/Kampala, Harare, Johannesburg, Karachi, Khartoum, Kigali, Kinshasa, Lagos, Lilongwe, Lokichoggio, London, Lusaka, Mahe Island, Malindi, Mombasa, Mumbai, and Zanzibar.[tpl]rp|90[/tpl]
In [tpl]start date|2012|6[/tpl] the company announced the issuance of rights worth KSh20 billion, aimed at increasing capital to support expansion plans.[tpl]cite press release|title= Kenya Airways Rights Issue–Amended Timetable|publisher= Kenya Airways|date= [tpl]date|2012-5-30[/tpl]|url= http://www.kenya-airways.com/uploadedFiles/Global/About_Kenya_Airways/Investor_Information/Financial_Reports/KQ%20Rights%20Issue%20Time-table%20Change.pdf|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68IzRzZVr|archivedate= [tpl]date|2012-6-10[/tpl]|accessdate= [tpl]date|2012-6-10[/tpl][/tpl] Following the allocation of shares, KLM increased their stake in the company from 26% to 26.73%, while the Kenyan government boosted their participation into the company from 23% to 29.8%, becoming the new major shareholder of the carrier.
