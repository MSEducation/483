Cydista is a genus that consists of more than twenty species of lowland, showy, evergreen, ornamental shrubs and woody vines, ranging from central and southern Mexico to Paraguay and eastern Brazil. The genus is characterized by the lack of a nectariferous disk and is associated with the multiple-bang flowering syndrome. All species are lianas with clusters of funnelform flowers, bloomig twice a year in spring and fall. The flowers start of purple and change to a lighter shade of lavender with age, then fading to almost white, followed by linear oblong fruits and winged seeds. The plants are multi-stemmed with opposite, oval, glossy, dark-green leaves and 2 leaflets, and climb by tendrils arise from the leaf axils. Leaves smell like garlic when crushed.
