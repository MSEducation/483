==Reception and critique==

Due to the general lack of accurate record keeping by respective filming commissions in Asian countries back in the 1970s, The exact earnings of this film was unknown. However, it was certainly not a top grossing film that year. Its legacy might be that it inspired a successful remake many years later. 
Critically, the film drew mixed reviews. One critic called the script “insipid and dull” while others expressed approval of the fictional and fantasized story line. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] The love scene in the film deserves a special mention, given that most Chinese romance movies at the time avoided sexual themes and only featured light, conservative “dry” kisses, Tang and Yu embrace in a very passionate kissing scene, with Tang baring his chest and Yu wearing only lingerie. The kissing scene along with the partial undressing, exceeded usual standards at this time and appeared well ahead of its time.

==1994 remake==

This film was remade into a made-for-TV movie for a Chinese TV sub-network in the United States in 1994. The low-budget remake, starring actor Tim Chang, and introducing a very young, singer-actress Sandy Wu, became a surprise hit. It was directed by H. C. Tang, a successful producer-director in the Chinese-American entertainment industry.
The remake followed much of the storyline as the original, with the only major change being its location-from Hong Kong to the US. It also focused more on the love story of the leading couple and paid less attention to the supporting roles. Whereas comparing to the fighting scenes in the original, leading man Tim Chang did some singing instead in the remake, while Wu sings for the title song herself.
The love scene in the remake by Chang and Wu was also highly sexualised and realistic. The remake has not been released worldwide.
