[[Mopalia hindsii]]

CATEGORIES: Mopaliidae

Mopalia hindsii is a species of medium sized chiton that grows up to 7 cm long. Most commonly found in intertidal zones, M. hindsii enjoys protected areas and has a white ventral side unlike most intertidal chitons that are orange underneath.

==Range==

M. hindsii have been observed from South California all the way North to Alaska.

==Habitat==

M. hindsii are most common in protected environments like shallow bays, underneath rocks and on shaded pilings.

==Diet==

While most chitons are herbivores, M. hindsii will graze on just about anything in its path that doesnâ€™t escape including polychaetes, amphipods, barnacles, sponges and algae. This uncommon lifestyle most likely explains why M. hindsii are able to survive in areas too silty for other chitons
