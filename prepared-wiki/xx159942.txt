[[Negarchy]]

CATEGORIES: Political philosophy, Political science terms, International relations theory

Negarchy was a term coined by Daniel Deudneyhttp://www.ciaonet.org/wps/kuc01/ to mean a form of status quo maintained by the inter-relations of the power structure and authority that modern states hold in relation to each other which negate each other due to their respective influence. The situation of this kind of power compromise results in putting limits upon and reining in the rule of all such states by reducing their individual power and potential influence. Thus it is a rule of their own creation that they are also unwillingly subject to. Comparisons have been drawn between 'negarchy' and natural law structureshttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3671/is_199504/ai_n8727895/pg_9[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] as well as with intranational markets.http://www.engagingcommunities2005.org/abstracts/Ralph-Natalie-final.pdf Negarchy is described as being a form of governing between "anarchy and hierarchy".http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol6/No4/art1-04.html
