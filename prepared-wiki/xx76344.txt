The Grey Shrikethrush or Grey Shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), formerly commonly known as Grey Thrush, is one of the best-loved and most distinctive songbirds of Australasia. It is moderately common to common in most parts of Australia, but absent from the driest of the inland deserts. It is also found in New Guinea.
Of medium size (about 24 cm (9 in) long) and lacking bright colours, the Grey Shrikethrush—usually just thrush in casual conversation—has an extraordinary gift for ringing melody, unmatched by any other Australasian species save perhaps the two lyrebirds and its northern relative, the Sandstone Shrike-thrush.
The Grey Shrikethrush is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
