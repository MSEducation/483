Wynberg Girls' High School is a public school for girls in Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa.
Founded in 1884, Wynberg Girls High School is one of the oldest all-girls schools in South Africa. The first headmistress, Miss Margaret Stewart, was supported by two teachers and catered to 27 pupils. Initially a co-educational school, WGHS soon became an all-girls school and was known as Ladies' Seminary. 
WGHS is part of the Wynberg Campus of schools, along with Wynberg Girls Junior School, Wynberg Boys' Junior School, and Wynberg Boys' High School. The school is located in Aliwal Road in the suburb of Wynberg. 
School activities at Wynberg are founded on four pillars: Academics, Sport, Service and Culture. The school has excelled in all four of these areas and has subsequently produced well-rounded pupils capable of entering a wide variety of careers. font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:
