It is located approximately 700 metres west of Tottenham railway station. The next station down the line is the Sunshine railway station.

==History==

White City was opened on 11 November 1927 as Coursing Platform, and was renamed White City on 25 August 1929.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] (an alternate opening date is 10 December 1927.[tpl]cite book | author = S.E.

It primarily existed to service the local industry (in particular the Olympic Tyres factory) and the greyhound racing track in the area, known as White City Coursing Club. The station only ever had a westbound platform, even though at its peak, fifty services a week stopped at the station. Due to its proximity to Tottenham station, White City's signals were operated from there.
Workmen's trains from the city commenced stopping at the station on 10 June 1940 but it was not until 28 June 1948 that citybound trains commenced stopping at the station when an afternoon up working started from the station's single platform, using the crossover at the up end of the platform. White City was made a regular suburban station in December 1949.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
In the early 1980s, Tottenham station underwent renovations. The line was raised in order to avoid the level crossing at Ashley Street. A new high-level island platform was built there, and it was decided to remove the nearby White City station as a result. On 4 October 1981, White City was officially closed. It was later demolished, and no trace of its presence remains today.
