==History==

The earliest fabric in the church dates from around 1300 or earlier but, as it is near the earthworks of a motte-and-bailey castle, it is possible that a church has been present on the site since the 10th century.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.lancashirechurches.co.uk/melling.htm |title=Lancashire Churches: Melling, St Wilfrid |accessdate=30 April 2008 |publisher=Tony Boughen [/tpl]  Most of the present church dates from the late 15th century, with a restoration in 1763 when the clerestory was added.[tpl]Citation | last =Hartwell| first =Clare| authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England| title =Lancashire: North |edition= | publisher =Yale University Press | year =2009 | origyear=1969 | location = New Haven and London| pages = 451–452| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-300-12667-9[/tpl]  In 1891 a further restoration was carried out by the Lancaster architects Paley, Austin and Paley.  This included reseating the church, and cost £1,100 (£[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|1100|1891|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-4[/tpl][/tpl] as of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).[tpl]Inflation-fn|UK[/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = Brandwood| first = Geoff| author-link = | last2 = Austin| first2 = Tim| last3 = Hughes| first3 = John| last4 = Price| first4 = James| publication-date = | date = | year = 2012| title = The Architecture of Sharpe, Paley and Austin| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Swindon| place = | publisher = English Heritage| pages = | page = 239| format = | id = | isbn = 978-1-84802-049-8| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =[/tpl]  A chapel known as the Morley chapel had been created as a chantry from a pre-existing chapel by John Morley who fought at Agincourt in 1415.  This was heavily re-modelled in 1841 when the altar was removed, and was restored as a chapel in 1994–95.

==Architecture==

The church is built in sandstone rubble with a stone slate roof.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a nave and chancel under a continuous roof with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch and a south chapel.  The tower has diagonal buttresses and an embattled parapet.  The west window of the south aisle dates from around 1300.  This window includes a fragment of medieval stained glass.  Internally, the aisle pews date from the 18th century but the nave pews, the screens, the pulpit, and the communion rails are from the late 19th century.  In the chapel is an aumbry without a door and a squint.  There are numerous memorial wall tablets.  Discovered during the restoration and built into the vestry wall is a piece of Norman chevron ornament, part of a crucifix, and part of a grave slab.  The stained glass in the east window was designed by Henry Holiday.  The organ was built in 1891 by J. W. Walker of London.[tpl]citation  |url= http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=S00090 |title= Mellor St. Wilfrid |accessdate=17 August 2008 |publisher= British Institute of Organ Studies [/tpl]  There is a ring of six bells which were recast in 1754 from three bells made in the 15th century by Rudhall of Gloucester.
