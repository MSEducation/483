==History==

It is believed that the first settler in Noggin Cove was named Doyle from Tilting on Fogo Island, he lived on the western side for a few years before returning to Tilting. The 1857 Census of Newfoundland recorded a population of six, most likely the Doyle family, and they were all Roman Catholic. The next recorded family was Robert and Sarah Wheaton's family of 13, but they moved again in 1874. It was in the late 1870s before permanent settlement began in Noggin Cove. Most settlers came from Ochre Pit Cove, the first being Levi Pennell and Charles White. Other names include Parsons, Gillingham, Angells, Snow, and Whites. By 1884 the population was 46. In 1911 the population was recorded as 112. The main employers for people in Noggin Cove was the Labrador fishery, the cod fishery, summer fishery off the Wadham Islands, and later logging, sawmills and lobster fishing were important.

==Church History==

Almost all of the earliest permanent settlers were Methodist and since there was no church in Noggin Cove they went to the nearby community of Frederickton to attend the Methodist church. They was a school built in the early 20th century which they also used as a chapel. Noggin Cove came under the Carmanville Methodist Circuit in the 20th century.
