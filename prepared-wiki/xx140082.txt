Little Men is a Canadian television show that first aired on November 7, 1998 on the PAX TV network and was shown in Canada on CTV beginning January 1, 1999.  The show is set as a continuation from the Louisa May Alcott novel Little Men (1871) as a follow-up to Little Women.  Due to low ratings, the show was cancelled after 2 seasons, with the final episode aired on December 17, 1999.

==Synopsis==

The show opens in Concord, Massachusetts, one month after the death of Jo's husband, Fritz Bhaer.  Josephine Bhaer (Michelle Rene Thomas) must take over the Plumfield School, a school in the barn on the Bhaer property, once taught by her husband.  As she tries to adjust to the pressures to find a new teacher, a merchant marine Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) enters the scene to act as a caretaker of the school.  Franz (Robin Dunne), Jo's nephew, must take over  teaching the class of young teens, notably Dan (Corey Sevier), Nat (Trevor Blumas), Emil (Alex Cambell), Nan (Brittney Irvin) and Bess (Rachel Skarsten).  The show follows the children's adventures at Plumfield, as well as the blossoming relationship between Jo and Nick.  Appearances by the other living March sisters, Meg (Jennifer Wigmore) and Amy (Amy Price-Francis) ground the plot as another chapter in the continuing saga of the March girls of Little Women. Jo's young son, Rob Bhaer, is portrayed by Munro Chambers and his brother Thomas.
