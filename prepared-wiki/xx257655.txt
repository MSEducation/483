Hitra church ([tpl]lang-no|Hitra kirke[/tpl]) is a main parish church in the municipality of Hitra in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The church is located in the village of Melandsjøen, on the northern coast of the island of Hitra.
The church was built in 1927 to replace the medieval Dolm church which had burned down in 1920.  The new church was built in Melandsjøen to make it more accessible to the people since it was going to be the main church for the parish.  It is a stone building that is square-shaped with a large copper dome on top.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkdalsmenighetene.no/hitra/hitra_kirke.htm|title=Hitra kirke|language=Norwegian|publisher=Orkdals prosti|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]
