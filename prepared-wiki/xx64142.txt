==Magnetic solenoid effect==

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics be invariant with respect to the gauge choice for the electromagnetic potential, of which the magnetic vector potential A forms part.
In quantum mechanics the same particle can travel between two points by a variety of paths.  Therefore this phase difference can be observed by placing a solenoid between the slits of a double-slit experiment (or equivalent). An ideal solenoid (i.e. infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution) encloses a magnetic field B, but does not produce any magnetic field outside of its cylinder, and thus the charged particle (e.g. an electron) passing outside experiences no magnetic field B. However, there is a (curl-free) vector potential A outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux, and so the relative phase of particles passing through one slit or the other is altered by whether the solenoid current is turned on or off. This corresponds to an observable shift of the interference fringes on the observation plane.

The first claimed experimental confirmation was  by Robert G. Chambers in 1960,[tpl]cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.5.3[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nphys1619[/tpl] in an electron interferometer with a magnetic field produced by a thin iron whisker, and other early work is summarized in Olariu and Popèscu (1984). However, subsequent authors questioned the validity of several of these early results because the electrons may not have been completely shielded from the magnetic fields.P. Bocchieri and A. Loinger, Nuovo Cimento Soc. Ital. Fis. 47A, 475 (1978); P. Bocchieri, A. Loinger, and G. Siragusa, Nuovo Cimento Soc. Ital. Fis. 51A, 1 (1979); P. Bocchieri and A. Loinger, Lett. Nuovo Cimento Soc.

Lett. 44, 111 (1980)  An early experiment in which an unambiguous Aharonov–Bohm effect was observed by completely excluding the magnetic field from the electron path (with the help of a superconducting film) was performed by Tonomura et al. in 1986.Akira Tonomura, Nobuyuki Osakabe, Tsuyoshi Matsuda, Takeshi Kawasaki, and Junji Endo, "Evidence for Aharonov-Bohm Effect with Magnetic Field Completely Shielded from Electron wave", Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 56, pp. 792–795 (1986).  The effect's scope and application continues to expand. Webb et al. (1985) demonstrated Aharonov–Bohm oscillations in ordinary, non-superconducting metallic rings; for a discussion, see Schwarzschild (1986) and Imry & Webb (1989). Bachtold et al. (1999) detected the effect in carbon nanotubes; for a discussion, see Kong et al. (2004).

===Monopoles and Dirac strings===

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect is also closely related to Dirac's argument that the existence of a magnetic monopole can be accommodated by the existing magnetic source-free Maxwell's equations if both electric and magnetic charges are quantized.
Like the electromagnetic potential A the Dirac string is not gauge invariant (it moves around with fixed endpoints under a gauge transformation) and so is also not directly measurable.

==Electric effect==

Just as the phase of the wave function depends upon the magnetic vector potential, it also depends upon the scalar electric potential. By constructing a situation in which the electrostatic potential varies for two paths of a particle, through regions of zero electric field, an observable Aharonov–Bohm interference phenomenon from the phase shift has been predicted; again, the absence of an electric field means that, classically, there would be no effect.
where t is the time spent in the potential.
The initial theoretical proposal for this effect suggested an experiment where charges pass through conducting cylinders along two paths, which shield the particles from external electric fields in the regions where they travel, but still allow a varying potential to be applied by charging the cylinders. This proved difficult to realize, however. Instead, a different experiment was proposed involving a ring geometry interrupted by tunnel barriers, with a bias voltage V relating the potentials of the two halves of the ring. This situation results in an Aharonov–Bohm phase shift as above, and was observed experimentally in 1998.

==Aharonov–Bohm nano rings==

Nano rings were created by accident while intending to make quantum dots. They have interesting optical properties associated with excitons and the Aharonov–Bohm effect. Application of these rings used as light capacitors or buffers includes photonic computing and communications technology. Analysis and measurement of geometric phases in mesoscopic rings is ongoing.
Several experiments, including some reported in 2012,[tpl]cite journal|author= M. Tsubota, K. Inagaki, T. Matsuura and S. Tanda|title= Aharonov-Bohm effect in charge-density wave loops with inherent temporal current switching|journal=EPL (Europhysics Letters)|year=2012|volume=97|issue=5|pages=57011|doi= 10.1209/0295-5075/97/57011|url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0295-5075/97/5/57011/ |arxiv = 0906.5206 |bibcode = 2012EL.....9757011T [/tpl]  show Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in charge density wave (CDW) current versus magnetic flux, of dominant period h/2e through CDW rings up to 85 µm in circumference above 77 K. This behavior is similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference devices (see SQUID).

==Mathematical interpretation==

Effects with similar  mathematical interpretation can be found in other fields. For example, in classical statistical physics, quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment can be interpreted as an Aharonov–Bohm effect induced by a gauge field acting in the space of control parameters.
