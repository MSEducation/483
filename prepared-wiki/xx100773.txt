==Family==

Tuke came from a long line of Quakers from York who were interested in mental illness and concerned with those afflicted.  His great-grandfather William Tuke and his grandfather Henry Tuke co-founded the Retreat, which revolutionized the treatment of insane people.  
His father Samuel Tuke carried on the work of the York Retreat and reported on its methods and its results.  Daniel's older brother James Hack Tuke (1819 - 1896) was the next overseer of the York Retreat. Daniel was the youngest son of Samuel Tuke and Priscilla Hack, his wife.
Tuke's son was the painter Henry Scott Tuke.

In 1858, in collaboration with John Charles Bucknill, he published a Manual of Psychological Medicine, which was for many years regarded as a standard work on lunacy.
In 1853 he visited a number of foreign asylums, and later returning to York he became visiting physician to the York Retreat and the York Dispensary, lecturing also to the York School of Medicine on mental diseases. 
In 1859 ill health obliged him to give up his work, and for the next fourteen years he lived at Falmouth. In 1875 he settled in London as a specialist in mental diseases. In 1880 he became joint editor of the Journal of Mental Science.
