==History==

From 1889 until 1974, the governor served a two-year term.  Until the 1940s, the governor was allowed to serve unlimited terms; since that time, governors have been limited to two consecutive terms.  Beginning in 1974, the governor is elected to a four-year term, and may serve two consecutive terms.  The governor is elected on a ticket with the Lieutenant Governor.
The first governor of South Dakota was Arthur C. Mellette, who was also the last governor of the Dakota Territory.
Two of South Dakota's governors have left office before their term expired.  In 1978, Richard F. Kneip resigned office six months before the expiration of his term to accept an appointment as United States Ambassador to Singapore.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdhalloffame.com/html/bio.cfm?inductee_id=575|title=Richard Kneip from Elkton, SD|publisher=South Dakota Hall of Fame|accessdate=31 March 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  On April 19, 1993, George S. Mickelson was killed in a plane crash near Dubuque, Iowa; Mickelson is the only South Dakota governor to die in office.  Mickelson and his father, George T. Mickelson, are the only father-son duo to serve as governor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/21/obituaries/george-mickelson-52-governor-of-south-dakota-dies-in-a-crash.html?pagewanted=1|title=George Mickelson, 52, Governor Of South Dakota, Dies in a Crash|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 April 1993|accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl]
South Dakota's longest serving governor was Bill Janklow.  Janklow was the first governor to complete two four-year terms, and he did it twice, serving from 1979 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/05/us/the-1998-elections-state-by-state-midwest-south-dakota.html|title=THE 1998 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE -- MIDWEST; SOUTH DAKOTA|publisher=The New York Times|date=5 November 1998|accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Matthew L. | last=Wald[/tpl] Janklow is also the only person to serve non-consecutive terms as governor.
