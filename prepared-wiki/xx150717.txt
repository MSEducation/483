[[The Thomas Jefferson Hour]]

CATEGORIES: American radio programs, Bismarckâ€“Mandan

The Thomas Jefferson Hour is a syndicated public radio program produced in Bismarck, North Dakota.  It features author-historian Clay S. Jenkinson in a first-person portrayal of Thomas Jefferson, the third US President, and is co-hosted by David Swenson.  Jenkinson remains in-character as Jefferson throughout the first half of the program, delivering monologues and answering listener questions regarding  Jefferson's personal and political life and the history of early America.  The character of Jefferson generally confines his discussion to matters of history, politics, and philosophy as indirect context for modern times, but at times provides a limited analysis of current events (carefully attempting to limit his analysis to matters on which the actual Jefferson's view might be meaningfully determined).  In the second portion of the program, Jenkinson steps out of character to discuss his in-character answers during the first half of the show and also to talk generally about the topic of the episode.
