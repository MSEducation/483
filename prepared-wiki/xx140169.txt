The Dr. D. Y. Patil Stadium (Marathi: डॉ. डी. वाय. पाटील स्टेडीयम) is a cricket stadium at D. Y. Patil  campus, Nerul,  Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The stadium has all the facilities of an international cricket stadium, and has been designed by Hafeez Contractor, one of India's premier architects. The stadium was officially inaugurated on 4 March 2008, and was the home ground for IPL team  Mumbai side Mumbai Indians . It hosted 3 IPL matches for the Mumbai Indians and has also hosted the 2008 Indian Premier League Final.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] The stadium also has other facilities including 9 tennis hard courts, 4 indoor badminton courts and an Olympic sized swimming pool. A unique feature of the stadium is the cantilever roof which eliminates the need for any supports thus providing the spectators with an unobstructed view of the match from any place within the stand. The 7th India vs Australia ODI during Australia's 2009 tour of India (to be played on 11 November 2009) was supposed to be the first international cricket match to take place here but was cancelled due to heavy rain. In IPL 2010, it hosted 6 matches including the opening match, the semi-finals, the 3rd place playoff and the final.

==Capacity==

The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 people.

==Roof==

The stadium roof is made from fabric imported from Pakistan.

==Sound system==

It is the first cricket stadium in the world to have full fledged concert level reinforced music system.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

==Lighting==

The masts are the tallest in the country, providing excellent lighting throughout the ground. Moreover, the high-quality illumination ensures that the stadium is adequately prepared for the latest television technologies such as HDTV. Permanent diesel generators have been installed to ensure uninterrupted power supply during games.

==Pitch and outfield==

For the ground, 250 tons of clay were imported from South Africa. The pitch was prepared based on the advice and guidance of Neil Tainton and John Klug from South Africa. Stadiums around India typically have outfields made from red soil. When it rains, the outfield tends to become sluggish and heavy. To minimise the interruption because of rain, the outfield here is sand based. A completely concealed underground drainage system helps quickly remove water. A practise ground with 10 practice pitches is also on the campus next to the main stadium.

==Spectator comfort and safety==

The stadium has been designed keeping in mind spectator comfort and safety. Every spectator has an individual bucket seat. There are no pillars obstructing views of the ground. Two giant LED screens – the biggest in India – provide scores, replays and other information.
Spectators are monitored by a network of digital cameras producing images of very high quality, which are sent to security agencies. Axis cameras (the product of a Sweden-based company), like the ones installed in Mons-Bergen football stadium in Belgium, have been installed for the first time in India. The surveillance system is highly advanced when compared to conventional CCTVs. The stadium is designed to be earthquake-proof, with fire-fighting and evacuation facilities.

==Dressing rooms==

Players are provided with comfortable dressing room facilities including ice-baths and recovery areas.

==Media centre==

The stadium has an air-conditioned media centre, that can accommodate 120 people, with state-of-the-art communication and support facilities.

==Event management==

The stadium often hosts high profile matches with capacity crowds. This requires professional event management capabilities and a highly skilled staff, provided by the D. Y. Patil Vidyanagar university.

==Hospitality==

Luxury suites with attached rest rooms ensure that guests stay in comfort. Catering support is provided in the main pavilion area.

==Corporate facilities==

There are 60 spacious corporate boxes on the upper level of the viewing galleries.
