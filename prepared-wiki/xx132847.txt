==Career==

Larry Seabrook was first elected to office in 1984, winning a seat in the New York State Assembly. Seabrook's district in the Bronx was heavily African-American. Seabrook defeated the 10-year Italian incumbent Vincent Marchiselli in the Democratic primary. (In many legislative districts in New York City, winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to winning the general election since the Republican Party is so weak at the local level.) Seabrook served in the Assembly for 11 years.
In February 1996, Seabrook moved up to the New York State Senate, winning a special election to fill the unexpired term of State Senator Joseph Galiber, who died. Seabrook was re-elected in November 1996 and then in 1998.
In 1996 and 1998, Seabrook considered challenging Congressman Eliot Engel in the Democratic primary, but backed out both times. After it was redrawn after the 1990 Census, Engel's district became heavily Hispanic and African-American.
In 2000, Seabrook gave up his seat in the State Senate and finally challenged Engel, who fell out of favor with the Bronx Democratic Party organization. In a bitter campaign, Engel defeated Seabrook in the Democratic primary.
In 2001, Seabrook was elected to the New York City Council. Seabrook was re-elected to the Council in 2005 and in 2009 (after the term-limts law was amended).
In 2010, Seabrook was indicted by the federal government on corruption charges. He was convicted on nine felony counts on July 26, 2012,http://politicker.com/2012/07/larry-seabrook-convicted-on-9-counts subsequently removed from the city council, and is serving five years in prison.
