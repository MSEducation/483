CATEGORIES: 1897 deaths, Iranian governors, Iranian Arab people, Year of birth unknown

Maz'al ibn  Jabir (18?? â€“ 1897, styled Muaz us-Sultana) was the son of Jabir al-Kaabi and succeeded him as tribal leader of the Bani Kaab and Sheikh of Mohammerah upon his father's death. This was confirmed by an Imperial Qajar farman (executive order). Some accounts state that he was assassinated by his younger brother, Khaz'al Khan, while others state that this was done by a palace guard under orders from Khaz'al.
