Hero (or Heron) of Alexandria  (c. 10 – 70 AD) was an ancient Greek mathematician and engineer who was active in his native city of Alexandria, Roman Egypt. He is considered the greatest experimenter of antiquity[tpl]cite book | title=The Hutchinson dictionary of scientific biography | author = Research Machines plc. | location = Abingdon, Oxon | publisher = Helicon Publishing | year = 2004 | pages = 546 | quote = Hero of Alexandria (lived c.

Hero published a well recognized description of a steam-powered device called an aeolipile (sometimes called a "Hero engine").  Among his most famous inventions was a windwheel, constituting the earliest instance of wind harnessing on land. He is said to have been a follower of the Atomists. Some of his ideas were derived from the works of Ctesibius.
Much of Hero's original writings and designs have been lost, but some of his works were preserved in Arabic manuscripts.

==Career==

It is almost certain that Hero taught at the Musaeum which included the famous Library of Alexandria, because most of his writings appear as lecture notes for courses in mathematics, mechanics, physics and pneumatics.  Although the field was not formalized until the 20th century, it is thought that the work of Hero, his automated devices in particular, represents some of the first formal research into cybernetics.[ref]
