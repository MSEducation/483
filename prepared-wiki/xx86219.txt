Waterzooi is a Belgian dish of stew, originating in Flanders. Its name derives from the Dutch term "zooien" meaning "to boil".  It is sometimes called Gentse Waterzooi which refers to the Belgian town of Ghent where it originated. The original dish is often made of fish, either freshwater or sea, (known as Viszooitje), though today chicken waterzooi (Kippenwaterzooi) is more common. The most accepted theory is that rivers around Ghent became too polluted and the fish there disappeared.gentblogt.be It is said to have been the favourite dish of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor who was born in Ghent.
