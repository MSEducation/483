[tpl]Nihongo|Neon Genesis Evangelion|新世紀エヴァンゲリオン|Shin Seiki Evangerion|literally "Gospel of a New Century"[/tpl], commonly referred to as NGE, Evangelion or Eva, is a Japanese science-fantasy mecha dystopia genre animation series that first aired from October 1995 to March 1996. The 26 episode series was created by the anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno. The original Japanese cast of the show includes the voice actors and singers Megumi Ogata as Shinji Ikari, Megumi Hayashibara as Rei Ayanami, and Yūko Miyamura as Asuka Soryu. The music was composed by Shirō Sagisu and would top the Oricon charts upon release; the theme song continues to receive recognition for its lasting impact in the decades after its release. The Evangelion franchise also includes a movie tetralogy called Rebuild of Evangelion, as well as several other spin-off anime, manga and video game series. 
Evangelion is an apocalyptic anime in the mecha genre. The series is set in a futuristic Tokyo, fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm. The main story centers around Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by the shadowy organization NERV to pilot a giant bio-machine called an Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels. The series explores the experiences and emotions of other Evangelion pilots and members of NERV as they attempt to prevent another catastrophe. Evangelion prominently features religious symbolism and themes throughout the series, including Kabbalah, Christianity, Judaism, and Shinto imagery.
Evangelion is one of the most successful and critically acclaimed anime television series of the 1990s. Considered both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre, the series has become a cultural icon and has resulted in the artistic and technical revival of the anime industry. The show's characters, music and individual scenes have been recognized by the Japanese public, and homage to its controversial ending resulted in the creation of two movies; each provided an alternate ending for the abstract and psychological analysis of the characters for episodes 25 and 26. The subsequent film, manga, home video and other products in its franchise have achieved record sales in Japan and strong sales in overseas markets, with revenues grossing over 150 billion yen by 2013.

==Plot==

The show begins fifteen years after a global cataclysm, known as Second Impact, with the arrival of fourteen-year-old Shinji Ikari in the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 in response to the summons of his estranged father Gendo Ikari, the director of the special paramilitary force NERV. Upon reaching the city, Shinji witnesses the NERV forces battling an Angel, one of a race of large monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. NERV's giant Evangelion bio-machines, controlled from within by pilots whose nervous systems must be synched to the Evangelions, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. NERV officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the NERV complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into deploying the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own. Following a hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato to recover and begins settling in to life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle Shinji violently destroys an Angel but is later overcome with emotion and attempts to run away. Misato confronts Shinji, who ultimately decides to remain a pilot. Meanwhile, Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired and Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, a mysterious and emotionally cold teenage girl named Rei Ayanami. A strategy developed by Misato, termed the Yakushima Plan, is implemented to successfully defeat another Angel, but Shinji is nearly killed in the battle.
Ritsuko Akagi, NERV's chief scientist, reveals to Shinji that the global cataclysm known as the Second Impact was not caused by a meteor strike as officially reported, but instead resulted when the first Angel to arrive on Earth, code named Adam, exploded in the Antarctic. The pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, teenage girl Asuka Langley Soryu, comes to live with Misato and Shinji and joins her copilots in defeating the Angels as they appear. A boy named Toji Suzuhara is selected to pilot Unit-03 but during his first test synchronization with the Evangelion, Unit-03 morphs into an Angel. When Shinji refuses to destroy the rogue unit, his control over Unit-01 is cut off and supplanted by a separate Dummy Plug system that causes his Evangelion to savagely rip apart Unit-03 and crush the internal cockpit containing Toji. Shinji is traumatized by the attack on his friend and temporarily quits piloting the Evangelion, but is forced to return in order to destroy an Angel that has overcome both Asuka and Rei. Asuka loses her self-confidence following her defeat and spirals into a deep depression. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji later visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming to be "the third Rei". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of NERV, the Evangelion graveyard and the Dummy Plug system which operates using clones of Rei.
Asuka is reduced to a catatonic state by her depression and Kaworu Nagisa replaces her as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji, is soon revealed to be the final Angel. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates, then kills Kaworu. This act triggers the forced evolution of humanity, termed the "Human Instrumentality Project", in which the souls of all mankind are merged into one. In the final scenes of the last episode, Shinji's soul mentally grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative attitudes and emotions that tormented him throughout the series. The episode ends with all the characters applauding him, as Shinji smiles and thanks everyone.

==Characters==

Anno attempted to create characters for the Neon Genesis Evangelion series that reflected different parts of his own personality.[tpl]cite news|last=Kosukegawa|first=Yoichi|title=Cartoon 'Eva' captures sense of void among Japanese youth|newspaper=Japan Economic Newswire|date=May 8, 1997|quote=In the September 1996 issue of the Quick Japan information magazine, Hideaki Anno, the director of Evangelion, described Eva as a 'personal film,' each character reflecting part of his own personality.[/tpl] The characters of Evangelion struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems,[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=425[/tpl] and traumatic events in their pasts.[tpl]sfn|Miller|2012|p=85[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ishikawa|2007|p=76[/tpl] The deeply human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.[tpl]cite video | people = | date = | title = Evangelion: Death & Rebirth; End of Evangelion | medium = DVD commentary track | location = | publisher = Manga Entertainment [/tpl]
Shinji Ikari is the main protagonist of the series and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing his mother's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. Shinji is emotionally fragile and does as instructed out of fear of rejection. Throughout the series he repeats "I mustn't run away!", but habitually withdraws in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who "shrinks from human contact" and has "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person".[tpl]Cite book|last=Sadamoto| first=Yoshiyuki|authorlink= Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|others=Essay by Hideaki Anno; translated by Mari Morimoto, English adaptation by Fred Burke|title=Neon Genesis Evangelion, Vol. 1|date=December 1998|origyear=1995|publisher=VIZ Media LLC| location=San Francisco|isbn=1-56931-294-X|pages=170–171|chapter=What were we trying to make here?[/tpl]

The withdrawn and mysterious pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, is a clone made from the salvaged remains of Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari, and is plagued by a sense of negative self-worth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Roderick|title=Meet the voice of AD Vision: Amanda Winn|url=http://www.ex.org/2.5/12-news_winn.html|work=Volume 2, Issue 5|publisher=EX Magazine|accessdate=October 15, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050329093608/http://www.ex.org/2.5/12-news_winn.html|archivedate=March 29, 2005[/tpl]
Misato Katsuragi serves as the caretaker and commanding officer for Shinji and Asuka. Her professional demeanor at NERV contrasts dramatically with her carefree and irresponsible behavior at home. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto conceived her as an older "girl next door" and promiscuous loser who failed to take life seriously.[tpl]cite web | title=EVA If it weren't for Sadamoto -- Redux  | work=Translation of interview with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto about designing the series | url=http://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-November/003855.html | accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl] Misato has an Electra complex and is consumed with conflicting love and hate for her father, which manifests as a driving force in her decision to work at NERV and her attempts to "seek her father in Kaji's embrace."Neon Genesis Evangelion Episode 26 Anno described Shinji and Misato as "afraid of being hurt" and "unsuitable—lacking the positive attitude—for what people call heroes of an adventure."
The teenaged Evangelion pilots are ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father and the commander of NERV. He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only to serve as an Evangelion pilot. Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's soul and body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels. He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win, a man who "takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose."[tpl]cite journal | title=Anime Expo '96 interview | author=Graham, Miyako | journal=Protoculture Addicts |date=November 1996 | issue=43 | pages=40–41[/tpl] According to Sadamoto, the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series UFO.
Yoshiyuki Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities "could be understood more or less at a glance".[tpl]sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=204[/tpl] The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters' designs contributed to high sales of Neon Genesis Evangelion merchandise. The design of Rei in particular enjoyed such strong popularity that the media referred to the character as "Premium Girl" due to the high sales of books with Rei on the cover.[tpl]sfn|Fujie|Foster|2004|p=39[/tpl]

===Cast===

==Production==

Anno fell into a deep depression following completion of work on Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water[tpl]sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=180[/tpl] and the 1992 failure of the Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise sequel project.[tpl]sfn|Takeda|2002, 2005|pp=155-158[/tpl] According to Yasuhiro Takeda, Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi Ōtsuki;[tpl]sfn|Takeda|2002, 2005|p=164[/tpl] King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for "something, anything".[tpl]cite web|title=庵野秀明：公式|url=http://khara.weblogs.jp/hideakianno/personal-biography.html|accessdate=September 7, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120507231516/http://khara.co.jp/hideakianno/|archivedate=May 7, 2012[/tpl] Anno expressed the intention to create a show "with a soul",[tpl]cite journal|title=Kazuhiko Shimamoto (Gyakyoo Nine) and Hideaki Anno (Nadia)|journal=Animage|publisher=Tokuma Shoten|date=September 1991[/tpl] in contrast to his recent Nadia project which he viewed as "too childish". Anno began development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of Aoki Uru, an earlier Anno project that had failed to move into production.[tpl]sfn|Takeda|2002, 2005|pp=15, 165-166[/tpl]
Early into the production, Anno stated his intent to have Evangelion increase the number of otaku (anime fans) by attracting interest in the medium.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kei Watanabe|author2=Daichi Nakagawa|author3=Tsunehiro Uno|title=Evangelion Special: From phenomenon to legacy|journal=Mainichi Times|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-145511765/evangelion-special-phenomenon-legacy.html|date=18 May 2006|accessdate=September 8, 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] In the early design phase of the Evangelion project several formats were considered, including a film, a television series and an original video animation (OVA) series. The producers finally opted for the television series as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that time. The proposed title Alcion was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds.[tpl]cite book|chapter=Interview with Sadamoto Yoshiyuki|title=Der Mond: The Art of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto - Deluxe Edition|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=1999|isbn=4-04-853031-3[/tpl]
Evangelion borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a narrative device from a previous Anno project entitled Gunbuster, which was developed around the concept of conflict between humans and the gods.[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=66[/tpl] He incorporated the narrative structure of Nadia and multiple frames of reference to leave the story open to interpretation.[tpl]sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=165[/tpl]  Over the course of the writing process, elements of the Evangelion storyline evolved from the original concept. A female protagonist was initially proposed for the series, but the idea was scrapped. Originally, the first episode presented the battle between an Angel and Rei, while the character of Shinji was only introduced after the Angel had been defeated.[tpl]Cite book|author=Gainax|title=Neon Genesis Evangelion Newtype 100% Collection |date=February 1998 |publisher=Kadokawa Shoten |language=Japanese |isbn=4-04-852700-2[/tpl] Further changes to the plot were made following the Aum Shinrikyo sect's sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March. Azuma Hiroki explained that the original Evangelion story and the sect's philosophy shared a lack of concern for indiscriminate violence. Although Anno took steps to address the consequences of violence in the story, Hiroki criticized Evangelion for subtly denigrating the very type of viewer it sought to attract, observing that both the Aum sect and the otaku culture are the consequence of social rejection and isolation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Krystian Woznicki|title=Towards a cartography of Japanese anime - Anno Hideaki's Evangelion Interview with Azuma Hiroki|journal=BLIMP Filmmagazine|publisher=Tokuma Shoten|date=September 1991[/tpl]

The development of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run. The initial cuts of the first two episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television.[tpl]sfn|Takeda|2002, 2005|pp=161-162[/tpl] By episode 13 the series began to deviate significantly from the original story, and the initial script was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to 17 instead of the original 28, and the writers changed the story's ending, which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the moon. Starting with episode 16, the show changed drastically, focusing on the characters and discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters.[tpl]Cite book|last=Thouny |first=Christophe|chapter=Waiting for the Messiah: The Becoming-Myth of "Evangelion" and "Densha otoko"|year=2009|title=War/time|journal=Mechademia|volume=4|page=111|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Wef0-7tdw2sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mechademia+4#v=onepage&q=the%20series%20soon%20becomes%20a%20social%20phenomenon%20capturing%20the%20attention%20of%20cultural%20theorists&f=false |isbn=978-0-8166-6749-9 |accessdate=September 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Azuma|first=Hiroki|title=Animé or Something Like it: Neon Genesis Evangelion|url=http://www.ntticc.or.jp/pub/ic_mag/ic018/intercity/higashi_E.html|publisher=NTT InterCommunication Center|accessdate=August 13, 2012[/tpl] This change coincided with Anno's development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness.[tpl]cite web|author=Lawrence Eng|url=http://www.cjas.org/~echen/articles/spring97/05_03b.html|title=In the Eyes of Hideaki Anno, Writer and Director of Evangelion|publisher=CJas.org|accessdate=September 7, 2013[/tpl] This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes.[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=425[/tpl] The production ran so close to the airing deadline that the completed scenes used in the preview of the twenty-fifth episode had to be redesigned to work with the new ending.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shinichiro Inoue|title=Interview with Hideaki Anno|journal=Newtype|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=June 1996|language=Japanese|pages=162–177[/tpl] These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation,[tpl]sfn|Camp|Davis|2007|p=19[/tpl] flashbacks,[tpl]sfn|Haslem|Ndalianis|Mackie|2007|p=114[/tpl] simple line drawings, photographs[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|p=60[/tpl] and fixed image scenes with voice-over dialogue.[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=428[/tpl] Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article183723.ece|title=DStv Pick of the week - Neon Genesis Evangelion : Monday, 15:45, Animax|author=Matthew Vice|publisher=The Times|accessdate=September 8, 2013|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20100505191413/http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article183723.ece|archivedate=May 5, 2010[/tpl] but Toshio Okada stated that they were the result of the ending being decided only three months before airing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking10.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000126012803/http://www.j-pop.com/anime/archive/feature/04_gal_999/otaking10.html|archivedate=26 January 2000|title=Return of the Otaking|publisher=J-pop.com|accessdate=September 7, 2013[/tpl] These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series, including significant vitriol directed at Anno himself.[tpl]sfn|Saito|Azuma|2009|p=25[/tpl] Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax released in 1997, two animated feature films: Death & Rebirth and The End of Evangelion.[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|pp=54-55[/tpl]

==Themes==

The Evangelion series is permeated with references to Kabbalah, Christianity, Judaism, Shinto, and Gnosticism, complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation of the series.[tpl]sfn|Ortega|2010|p=217[/tpl] Of particular influence are the Midrash, the Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts on the Book of Genesis,[tpl]sfn|Ortega|2010|p=220[/tpl] which are reworked within the series to create a new Evangelion-specific mythology while still maintaining a connection with the original texts.[tpl]sfn|Ortega|2010|pp=217-218[/tpl] Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki said the religious references were intended to make the series more "interesting and exotic",[tpl]cite web|title=Interview mit Tsurumaki Kazuya (Studio GAINAX)|url=http://www.tomodachi.de/html/archiv/funime/f27_kurz_1.html|publisher=Anime No Tomodachi|accessdate=September 8, 2013[/tpl] and denied the existence of a "Christian meaning".[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|p=59[/tpl]
The series contains numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the sacred texts of Shinto. The Shinto notion of Black and White Moons is referenced in the series, and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami are used as weapons in battles between Evangelions and Angels.[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|p=58[/tpl] Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus,[tpl]sfn|Camp|Davis|2007|p=249[/tpl] the Dead Sea Scrolls,[tpl]sfn|Fujie|Foster|2004|p=63[/tpl] and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, among many others.[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|p=58[/tpl] The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project at the end of the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam.[tpl]sfn|Haslem|Ndalianis|Mackie|2007|p=124[/tpl] The Evangelions have been likened to the figure of the golem in Jewish folklore,[tpl]sfn|Haslem|Ndalianis|Mackie|2007|p=123[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~fenn/eva/eva1.html|title=Speaking Once as They Return: Gainax's Neon Genesis Evangelion|accessdate=September 7, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120329122552/http://www.stanford.edu/~fenn/eva/eva1.html|archivedate=March 29, 2012|last=Horn|first=Carl G[/tpl] and their visual design in the series resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).[tpl]Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Amos|date=January 1996 |title=Interview with Hideaki Anno, director of 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'|journal=Aerial Magazine |url=http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno |accessdate=May 4, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070613125248/http://www.aoianime.hu/evangelion/index.php?page=interanno|archivedate=June 31, 2007[/tpl] Buddhist[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=427[/tpl] and Zoroastrian terminology are also incorporated at points throughout the story.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Broderick|first=Mick|year=2002|title=Anime's Apocalypse: Neon Genesis Evangelion as Millennarian Mecha|journal=Gender, History, and Culture in the Asian Context|volume=7[/tpl]
Evangelion has been interpreted as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's own emotional struggles. The series invokes psychological themes in character dialogue and the phrases used on intercut title screens throughout each episode; movements of the original score also derive many of their titles from psychological theory. Examples of both include "Thanatos", "Oral stage", "Separation Anxiety", and "Mother Is the First Other".[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=428[/tpl] In particular, the series references elements of the works of Sigmund Freud,[tpl]sfn|Fujie|Foster|2004|pp=147, 150[/tpl] Jacques Lacan,[tpl]sfn|Napier|2002|p=434[/tpl] Arthur Schopenhauer,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/creative-synthesis/201201/social-media-and-the-hedgehogs-dilemma | title=Social Media and the Hedgehog's Dilemma | publisher=Psychology Today | date=January 8, 2012 | accessdate=August 15, 2013 | author=Rivero, Lisa[/tpl] Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Jean Paul Sartre and others.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.animedorks.com/issues/10/evae.html | title = Prison of Self-Consciousness: an Essay on Evangelion | last = Tsuribe | first = Manabu | publisher = Evamonkeys |archiveurl = http://www.evamonkey.com/writings_tsuribe01.php|archivedate = December 24, 2002[/tpl]

In May 1996, Gainax announced an Evangelion film[tpl]cite web|title=Gainax Official News|url=http://www.gainax.co.jp/news.html|publisher=Gainax|accessdate=September 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961018230645/http://www.gainax.co.jp/news.html#100103|archivedate=October 18, 1996[/tpl] in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale.[tpl]sfn|Cavallaro|2007|pp=54–55[/tpl] In advance of the promised film, on March 15, 1997 Gainax released Death & Rebirth, consisting of 60 minutes of clips taken from the first 24 episodes of the series and 40 minutes of the upcoming movie, The End of Evangelion.[tpl]sfn|Tavassi|2012|p=275[/tpl]
The End of Evangelion, which premiered on July 19, 1997, provided a complete retelling of the final two episodes of the television series. Rather than depicting series' climax within the characters' minds, the film provides a more conventional, action-based resolution to the series' plot lines. The film won numerous awardsCarl Horn, "My Empire of Dirt" (2002), for Viz Communications Animation Kobe 1997: An Attendee's Report and grossed 1.45 billion yen within six months of its release.December 1997 Newtype, p.90[tpl]Title missing[/tpl] EX.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best 'All-Time Show', with the television series at #2.Press.

===Manga===

Ten months prior to the television broadcast of Evangelion, Anno worked with author and illustrator Yoshiyuki Sadamoto to publish a manga version of the story designed to generate popular interest in the upcoming anime series. The first installment of the manga was published in the February issue of Shōnen Ace in December 1994 with subsequent installments produced on an irregular basis over an eighteen-year period. The final installment was published in June 2013.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gainax.co.jp/anime/eva/news/0379.html | title = 貞本義行『新世紀エヴァンゲリオン』ついに完結! | accessdate = February 18, 2014 | publisher = Gainax | date = May 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://mantan-web.jp/2013/07/04/20130703dog00m200048000c.html | title = 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン ： 貞本版マンガ最終回が再掲載　安野モヨコらの祝福コメントも | accessdate = February 18, 2006 | publisher = Mantan-web.jp | date = July 4, 2013[/tpl] Several publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation, viewing him as "too passé to be bankable".[tpl]sfn|Takeda|2002, 2005|p=167[/tpl] These concerns proved unfounded upon the strong commercial success of the manga: the first 10 volumes sold over 15 million copies,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.animenewsservice.com/archives/septxo.htm |title= 9-9-06 (8:55AM EDT)---- Further Evangelion Shin Gekijou Ban Details |publisher=Anime News Service |accessdate=December 2, 2012[/tpl] and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts,[tpl]cite web| title=News: Japanese Comic Ranking, March 29-April 4| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-07/japanese-comic-ranking-march-29-april-4 | work=Anime News Network | date=April 7, 2010 | accessdate=[/tpl] selling an additional two million copies.Takasuka, S.

===Other media===

Several video games based on the series have been developed, ranging from RPG and adventure games to mahjong and card games. The series has also spawned numerous art books and visual novels, one of which inspired the derivative manga series Angelic Days. The story has been adapted into two other manga series in addition to the original Sadamoto project: Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, a parody series which received its own original net animation serial show, and Campus Apocalypse, a character-focused story that omits the Evangelion robots. Several radio dramas have been released on CD and cassette to make the material more accessible to non-traditional audiences.

==Reception==

[tpl]Quote box | quote  = Even fans of the sci-fi genre who avoid anime altogether have likely heard of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell, which were each landmarks of both style and substance. But arguably the greatest and certainly most thematically dense of the three 90's sci-fi anime masterpieces is Neon Genesis Evangelion. It has one of the most enduring worldwide cult franchises and passionate fanbases in all of geekdom ... the most celebrated cast in anime ... and poster boy/protagonist Shinji is one of the most nuanced, popular, and relatable characters in anime history. | source = — Nick Verboon, Unreality Mag (13 June 2013)[tpl]cite web |last = Verboon | first = Nick | date =June 13, 2013 | title= 90's Flashback: Neon Genesis Evangelion |url= http://unrealitymag.com/index.php/2013/06/13/90s-flashback-neon-genesis-evangelion/ | publisher= Unreality Mag |accessdate=November 17, 2013[/tpl] | width  = 40em | align = right[/tpl]

==Influence and legacy==

Evangelion has had a significant impact on Japanese popular culture. The series also had a strong influence on anime, at a time when the anime industry and televised anime series in particular were in a slump period. CNET reviewer Tim Hornyak credits the series with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation knew a period of crisis and decreased production[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=55[/tpl] that coincided with the economic crisis in Japan.[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=60[/tpl] This was followed by a crisis of ideas in the years to come.[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=105[/tpl] Against this background, Evangelion imposed new standards for the animated serial, ushering in the era of the "new Japanese animation serial",[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Donati|2013|p=141[/tpl] characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry. The production of anime serials began to reflect greater author control, the concentration of resources in fewer but higher quality episodes (typically ranging from 13 to 26), a directorial approach similar to live film, and greater freedom from the constraints of merchandising.[tpl]sfn|Tavassi|2012|pp=247–248[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Giacomo Navone|author2=Massimo De Donno|title=Genio in 21 giorni|language=italian|year=2012|publisher=Sperling & Kupfer| isbn=978-88-200-5241-6| page=233[/tpl]
Evangelion has influenced numerous subsequent anime series, including Serial Experiments Lain, RahXephon, Texhnolyze, Gasaraki, Boogiepop Phantom,[tpl]sfn|Camp|Davis|2007|p=249[/tpl] Blue Submarine No. 6,[tpl]sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|pp=184–185[/tpl] Mobile Battleship Nadesico,[tpl]sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=123[/tpl] Rinne no Lagrange,[tpl]cite web|last=Hale|first=Mike|title=Watchlist: 'Lagrange,' Anime With Echoes of 'Evangelion'| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/watchlist-lagrange-anime-with-echoes-of-evangelion/?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=September 8, 2013[/tpl] Dual!
