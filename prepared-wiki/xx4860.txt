In the history of the European colonization of North America, the term "Indian massacre" was often used to describe either mass killings of people of European descent by indigenous people of the North American continent (Indians) or mass killings of indigenous people perpetrated by the people of European descent and/or other indigenous people.

==Overview==

Determining how many people died in these massacres overall is difficult. In the book The Wild Frontier: Atrocities during the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee, lawyer and amateur historian William M. Osborn tallied every recorded incident he considered an atrocity in the area that would eventually become the continental United States, from first contact (1511) to the closing of the frontier (1890), and determined that 7,193 people died from atrocities perpetrated by whites, and 9,156 people died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.Osborn, William M. (2001). The Wild Frontier: Atrocities During The American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee. Garden City, NY: Random House. ISBN 978-0-375-50374-0. Osborn has been criticized by Anthony Day of the Los Angeles Times as being biased towards whites and against Native Americans.Day, Anthony (January 12, 2001). "One-Sided Take on the Old West".
