==History==

Knox College was founded in 1837 by anti-slavery social reformers, led by George Washington Gale. Many of the founders, including the Rev. Samuel Wright, actively supported the Underground Railroad. The original name for the school was Knox Manual Labor College, but it has been known by its present name since 1857.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
The college's name came about through a compromise among its founders. Though founded by a colony of Presbyterians and Congregationalists, the county in which the college is located was already named Knox County, after Henry Knox, the first United States Secretary of War. Arguments have been made that the college was named for Calvinist leader John Knox, but it is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a great-great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that 
 "contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father ... Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX. Certainly most of them were pious enough to want the churchman and fighters enough to want the soldier as well."Calkins, Earnest Elmo. (1937) They Broke the Prairie, University of Illinois Press. ISBN 0-252-06094-6 
Knox was the site of the fifth debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in 1858. The Old Main building is the only site from the debates that stands today. Two years after the debates, and during his presidential campaign, Lincoln was awarded the first honorary doctorate ever conferred by Knox College—a Doctor of Laws degree, announced at the commencement exercises of 5 July 1860.Muelder, Hermann R.

===Academic program===

Knox employs a 3–3 academic calendar rather than a traditional semester-based approach. In each of the three 10-week terms, students take only three courses. Faculty members teach only two courses each term, giving them more time for one-on-one mentoring.Academic Calendar — the Knox College website
No matter what course of study students decide to pursue, education at Knox contains common elements, including an educational plan that students design.Curriculum — the Knox College website
Knox College introduced the school's honor code in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/Offices-and-Services/Registrar/Catalog/Academic-Program.html |title=The Academic Program |publisher=Knox College |location=Galesburg, Illinois |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl] All students are held responsible for the integrity of their own work, and students are required to abide by the code. Because of this policy, tests are not proctored, and in many cases students may take their exams in any open, public place within the same building. Any cases of students caught disobeying the system are evaluated by their peers through the Honor Board, a committee consisting of three seniors, three juniors, three sophomores, and three faculty members.
With the implementation of Renewed Knox, the 2003 curriculum overhaul, the school expanded its academic offerings to meet the needs of a liberal arts education in the 21st century. In 2003, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute awarded the school a $1 million grant to create a new major in neuroscience; in 2005, the college signed agreements with The George Washington University to create an early admission program into the university's medical school,Early Admissions — from Knox College website and with the University of Rochester to create a direct admissions program into the university's Simon School of Business's MBA program;Business and Management — from Knox College website in 2007 the Peace Corps launched a new program at Knox, establishing the Peace Corps Preparatory Program, the first of its kind in the country;Peace Corps Program — from Knox College website Chinese language instruction, Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, and Film Studies were all added;Courses of Study — from Knox College website and new abroad studies programs have been created: the Japan Term,Japan Term — from Knox College website and Knox in New York.Art Special Programs — from Knox College website

Knox also promotes top-notch undergraduate research, annually awarding students more than $250,000 in grants to support research and creative projects. Among the programs are the Ford Foundation Research Fellows Program, which funds the scientific, scholarly, and creative projects of 20 students each year, and the summer research program at Knox's Lincoln Studies Center. More than 10 percent of Knox students receive support for independent research and study from the Richter Memorial Foundation Program and the Pew Research Fellowships, which offers Knox students support for off-campus research in science and mathematics. In addition, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund supports student research in ecology and environmental studies and the AAAS/Merck Grant funds interdisciplinary scientific research.Undergraduate Research — from Knox College website

It culminates in a major thesis or creative portfolio that is presented to and defended before an honors committee that includes Knox faculty and a specialist from outside the college.Honors Program — from Knox College website  In 2007, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded Knox a $228,750 grant to create a new Center for Research and Advanced Studies, which "will coordinate Knox's numerous existing programs that support advanced work in the natural and social sciences, humanities, and creative and performing arts."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/News-and-Events/News-Archive/Mellon-Grant-for-Research-Center.html |title=Knox Receives Grant for New Campus Research Center | Knox College |publisher=Knox.edu |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]

==Student life==

===Fraternities and sororities===

Knox College is home to nine Greek-letter organizations, the oldest of which has been on campus since 1855.  Providing a network of alumni to enhance job and life connections, fraternity (men's) and sorority (women's) chapters provide Knox students with living, organizational and learning opportunities. Through their respective inter-Greek governance organizations, chapters conduct a formal recruitment process during each winter term to ensure first-year students have a chance to adjust to college life and classes before joining. Most offer residential housing for members. Some chapters formerly present have closed; of these, alumni members are often still active with the college's alumni association, and recolonization of dormant chapters remains an opportunity for potential new founders.

====Women's Sororities====

These organizations are governed by Knox's Panhellenic Council

====Men's Fraternities====

These organizations are governed by Knox's Interfraternity Council 

===Traditions===

Pumphandle is an annual tradition dating back to 1885 during which new members of the community are welcomed to Knox.  On the afternoon before the start of the academic year, all members of the Knox community gather on the south lawn outside Old Main.  The President of the college “leads the welcoming line, shaking each person's hand in turn. Everyone shakes the hands of those who have gone before, and the line grows, snaking around the campus.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/About-Knox/We-Are-Knox/Our-Traditions.html |title=Our Traditions |publisher=Knox College |location=Galesburg, Illinois |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]
Flunk Day is an annual spring carnival that allows students, staff, and faculty to mingle and have fun.

The date of Flunk Day changes every year and is a secret until the entire student body is woken up at around 5am the day of.

The current Knox College mascot is the Prairie Fire, a name it adopted in 1993 due to controversy surrounding the former mascot, the Old Siwash. The word Siwash is rooted in the language of the Chinook Indians of the Pacific Coast of Canada. It was a derogatory term used by European traders to refer to the local people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billcasselman.com/cwod_archive/siwash_updated.htm |title=Siwash — Racist Insult Still Proudly Displayed in Vancouver's Stanley Park |first=Bill |last=Casselman |work=Bill Casselman's Canadian Word of the Day |publisher=Bill Casselman |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]  The term Old Siwash was popularized by George Helgesen FitchEtymology of Siwash — Merriam-Webster.com (Knox Class of 1897) in his book At Good Old Siwash, and was soon adopted as the school's mascot. However, in 1992 a college publication urged the school to reconsider the name given its pejorative and derogatory implications.North American Society for Sport History — Siwash — NASSH Proceedings The Prairie Fire refers to the annual spring burning of the prairie lands at Green Oaks. First conducted in the 1950s by Knox professor Paul Shepard, the burn protects prairie grasses from intrusions of woodland scrub and competition with "exotic" species that have been introduced to Illinois from other regions or countries—to the detriment of organisms that have evolved over millions of years in delicate balance with the environment and each other.Prairie Burn — via Knox.edu
