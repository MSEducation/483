[[Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase Deficiency type 1]]

Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1 is also called myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. It a recessive genetic metabolic disorder that affects approximately 1–2% of populations of European descent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-monophosphate-deaminase-deficiency |title=Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency |work=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |date=July 2008[/tpl] It appears to be considerably rarer in Asian populations. The genetic form is caused by a defect in the gene for AMP deaminase though there is also an acquired form of AMP deficiency.

==Causes==

AMP deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process. It is a part of the metabolic process that converts sugar, fat, and protein into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a cell converts one of the above fuels into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the mitochondria. Cellular processes, especially muscles, then convert the ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
During heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase — so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the Purine nucleotide cycle. Instead of being converted to IMP, the AMP builds up in the cells of affected individuals, spills into the blood, and is eventually metabolized in the liver. In persons with a defective enzyme, 5'-nucleotidase removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of cellular and circulating adenosine by 16x - 25x.[tpl]cite journal |pages=720–30 |doi=10.1172/JCI111265 |title=Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

==Effects of failure to deaminate the AMP molecules==

This failure to deaminate the AMP molecules has three major effects.  First, significant amounts of AMP are lost from the cell and the body.  Second, ammonia is not freed when the cell does work.  Third, the level of IMP in the cell is not maintained.

==Symptoms==

The majority of people with the AMPD gene are asymptomatic, but others have symptoms  including early fatigue, muscle pain and muscle cramping.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mda.org/disease/mad.html |title=Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency |publisher=Muscular Dystrophy Association[/tpl]

==Treatment==

It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently from normal individuals.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://web.squ.edu.om/med-Lib/MED_CD/E_CDs/health%20development/html/clients/WAWFSA/html/papers/pap001.htm |title=What is this Adenosine stuff? |first=Robert |last=Lang |year=1998 |journal=Australasian Anaesthesia |issn=1032-2515[/tpl]
Symptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering ribose orally at a dose of approximately 10 grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day. and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.[tpl]cite journal |pages=297–302 |doi=10.1159/000177660 |title=Effects of Oral Ribose on Muscle Metabolism during Bicycle Ergometer in AMPD-Deficient Patients |year=1991 |last1=Wagner |first1=D.R. |last2=Gresser |first2=U. |last3=Zöllner |first3=N. |journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism |volume=35 |issue=5 |pmid=1776826[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pages=1281–90 |doi=10.1007/BF01785710 |title=Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency: Successful symptomatic therapy by high dose oral administration of ribose |year=1986 |last1=Zöllner |first1=N. |last2=Reiter |first2=S. |last3=Gross |first3=M. |last4=Pongratz |first4=D. |last5=Reimers |first5=C.

Creatine monohydrate is also helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue.[tpl]cite book |pmid=18652078 |year=2007 |last1=Tarnopolsky |first1=Mark A. |chapter=Clinical Use of Creatine in Neuromuscular and Neurometabolic Disorders |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=HjU1FYjjoRcC&pg=PA182 |volume=46 |pages=183–204 |title=Creatine and Creatine Kinase in Health and Disease |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6486-9_10 |series=Subcellular Biochemistry |isbn=978-1-4020-6485-2 |editor1-first=Gajja S. |editor1-last=Salomons |editor2-first=Markus |editor2-last=Wyss[/tpl]
There is also clinical association of various muscular dystrophies with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which needs further clinical study for confirmation.

==Potential Complications==

There is an increased risk that statin (cholesterol reducing drugs) will cause myopathy (muscle weakness) in individuals with MADD.[tpl]cite journal |pages=153–62 |doi=10.1002/mus.20567 |title=Genetic risk factors associated with lipid-lowering drug-induced myopathies |year=2006 |last1=Vladutiu |first1=Georgirene D. |last2=Simmons |first2=Zachary |last3=Isackson |first3=Paul J. |last4=Tarnopolsky |first4=Mark |last5=Peltier |first5=Wendy L. |last6=Barboi |first6=Alexandru C. |last7=Sripathi |first7=Naganand |last8=Wortmann |first8=Robert L. |last9=Phillips |first9=Paul S. |displayauthors=9|journal=Muscle & Nerve |volume=34 |issue=2 |pmid=16671104[/tpl]
Anesthesia has the potential to cause malignant hyperthermia, an uncontrolled increase in body temperature, and permanent muscle damage in patients with MADD. Individuals with MADD are advised to notify their an anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery.
In most where myopathy is present with MADD, a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation.[tpl]cite journal |pages=10–8 |doi=10.1006/mgme.2000.3066 |title=Synergistic Heterozygosity: Disease Resulting from Multiple Partial Defects in One or More Metabolic Pathways |year=2000 |last1=Vockley |first1=Jerry |last2=Rinaldo |first2=Piero |last3=Bennett |first3=Michael J. |last4=Matern |first4=Dietrich |last5=Vladutiu |first5=Georgirene D. |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=71 |pmid=11001791 |issue=1–2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |pages=185–94 |doi=10.1016/S0733-8619(05)70184-5 |title=MYOADENYLATE DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY: A Common Inherited Defect with Heterogeneous Clinical Presentation |year=2000 |last1=Sabina |first1=Richard L. |journal=Neurologic Clinics |volume=18 |pmid=10658174 |issue=1[/tpl]
