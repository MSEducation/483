The Almquist shell (also known as A Shell, ash and sh) is a lightweight Unix shell originally written by Kenneth Almquist in the late 1980s. Initially a clone of the System V.4 variant of the Bourne shell, it replaced the original Bourne shell in the BSD versions of Unix released in the early 1990s. Derivative versions of ash are still installed as the default shell (/bin/sh) on FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, MINIX and Android,[tpl]cite web|title=Android sh source|deadurl=yes|url=https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/sh/TOUR[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

and in some Linux distributions.
Debian and derived Linux distributions such as Ubuntu ship a version of ash, known as dash (Debian Almquist shell), as the default /bin/sh, although Bash is the default login shell for interactive use./usr/share/adduser.conf in Ubuntu package adduser.[tpl]cite book |author1=Christopher Negus |author2=Francois Caen |title=Ubuntu Linux Toolbox |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L_IXUtw_w-AC&pg=PA49 |pages=49[/tpl] The reason for using dash is faster shell script execution,[tpl]cite book |author=Neal Krawetz |title=Ubuntu: Powerful Hacks and Customizations |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |pages=178 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h_zclqESvu8C&pg=PT178[/tpl] especially during startup of the operating system. (Other Linux distributions commonly use Bash for this purpose as well.)
Ash is also fairly popular in embedded Linux systems; its code was incorporated into the BusyBox catch-all executable often employed in this area.

==History==

ash was first released via a posting to the comp.sources.unix Usenet news group, approved and moderated by Rich Salz on May 30, 1989. It was described as "a reimplementation of the System V shell with most features of that shell, plus some additions."[tpl]Cite web| title=v19i001: A reimplementation of the System V shell, Part01/08 | url=https://groups.google.com/d/topic/comp.sources.unix/A6cnyKX-Gq4/discussion | date=May 30, 1989 | editor=Rich Salz | author=Almquist, Kenneth | publisher=Usenet newsgroup, comp.sources.unix[/tpl]
The following is extracted from the ash package information from Slackware[tpl]When|date=March 2012[/tpl]:

Fast, small, and reasonably compatible with the POSIX standard's specification of the Unix shell, ash did not feature line editing[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2010[/tpl] or command history mechanisms, because Almquist felt that such functionality should be moved into the terminal driver; however, current variants support it.
Ash has since been replaced on both Debian and Ubuntu.  Dash became the replacement for ash in Debian and became the default /bin/sh in Debian Squeeze.Dash as /bin/sh Dash became the default /bin/sh in Ubuntu starting with the 6.10 release in October 2006.Dash as /bin/sh in Ubuntu 6.10
During the transition by Ubuntu, numerous scripts making use of Bash-specific functionality (but not declaring it) were discovered.Ubuntu bug #61463: script that are using bash could be broken with the new symlinkUbuntu bug #141481: dash as #!/bin/sh introduces countless incompatibilities
