===Roster changes===

University of Miami safety Kenny Phillips and defensive end Calais Campbell made the decision to forgo their senior years and declare for the NFL Draft. Phillips was drafted in the first round, No. 31 overall by the New York Giants. Campbell was drafted in the second round, No. 50 overall to the Arizona Cardinals. Linebacker Tavaris Gooden was also drafted in the third round, No. 79 overall to the Baltimore Ravens.  Senior quarterback Kirby Freeman, who split time with now undrafted free-agent Kyle Wright in 2007, was informed by the University of Miami coaching staff that he would begin the year third on the depth chart, behind redshirt freshman Robert Marve and true freshman Jacory Harris.  Shocked at this news, Freeman decided to transfer, ending up back in his native Texas at Baylor University.[tpl]cite news |title=QB Freeman Requests Release from Scholarship, Kirby Freeman Plans to Leave UM, Meaning the Canes Would Have No Experienced Quarterbacks Next Season|first=Barry|last=Jackson|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/colleges/um/story/328477.html|newspaper=The Miami Herald|date=December 28, 2007|accessdate=December 28, 2007|page=D1[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Freeman Confirms Transfer Plans|first=Jerry|last=Hill|url=http://www.wacotrib.com/sports/content/sports/college/2007/12/29/12292007wacfreeman.html|newspaper=Waco Tribune-Herald|date=December 29, 2007|accessdate=December 29, 2007[/tpl]

The Bears jumped out to an early 14–0 lead, but Harris was able to lead the Hurricanes back with touchdown passes in the second and third quarter while the Miami defense was able to shut out the Cal offense in the second quarter and limited them to a field goal in the third. The go ahead score came late in the fourth quarter when Bears linebacker Zack Follett forced a fumble in the backfield by Harris that the Bears recovered and were able to convert into a touchdown. The game marked the third straight loss for the Hurricanes, while the bowl win finished Cal's season with three wins in a row.
