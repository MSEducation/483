Eyton on Severn (pronounced: Eye-ton on Severn) is a small village in the English county of Shropshire. It is located on a ridge above the northern bank of the River Severn. The significant tributory of the Cound Brook joins the Severn at Eyton, albeit on the opposite bank.
There is a historical octagonal tower here, built in 1607 as the summerhouse of a mansion then belonging to the Newport family of High Ercall. Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury, whose mother was a Newport, was born there in 1583 and lived there till the age of nine.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickins|first=Gordon|title=An Illustrated Literary Guide to Shropshire|year=1987|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|pages=38, 96|isbn=0-903802-37-6[/tpl]  Wroxeter, the village located at a ruined Roman city, is only a mile NW of the village. The hamlet of Dryton is just E of Eyton. All lie in the parish of Wroxeter and Uppington.
There is also a racecourse, with point-to-point races held mainly on bank holidays and other special occasions.
