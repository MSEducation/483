The Leonids ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ən|ɪ|d|z[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LEE|ə-nidz[/tpl]) is a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel-Tuttle. The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to radiate from that point in the sky. Their proper Greek name should be Leontids (Λεοντίδαι, Leontídai), but the word was initially constructed as a Greek/Latin hybrid[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] and it is being used since. They peak in the month of November.
Earth moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of a comet. The stream comprises solid particles, known as meteoroids, ejected by the comet as its frozen gases evaporate under the heat of the Sun when it is close enough – typically closer than Jupiter's orbit. The Leonids are a fast moving stream which encounter the path of Earth and impact at 72 km/s.Space.com The Power of a Shooting Star Larger Leonids which are about 10 mm across have a mass of half a gram and are known for generating bright (apparent magnitude -1.5) meteors. An annual Leonid shower may deposit 12 or 13 tons of particles across the entire planet.
The meteoroids left by the comet are organized in trails in orbits similar to though different from that of the comet. They are differentially disturbed by the planets, in particular Jupiter[tpl]Citation | last = McNaught | first = Robert H. | author-link = Robert H.

Old trails are spatially not dense and compose the meteor shower with a few meteors per minute. In the case of the Leonids, that tends to peak around November 18, but some are spread through several days on either side and the specific peak changes every year. Conversely, young trails are spatially very dense and the cause of meteor outbursts when the Earth enters one. Meteor storms (large outbursts) exceed 1000 meteors per hour, to be compared to the sporadic background (5 to 8 meteors per hour) and the shower background (several per hour).

==History==

===1800s===

The Leonids are famous because their meteor showers, or storms, can be among the most spectacular. Because of the superlative storm of 1833 and the recent developments in scientific thought of the time (see for example the identification of Halley's Comet) the Leonids have had a major effect on the development of the scientific study of meteors which had previously been thought to be atmospheric phenomena. The meteor storm of 1833 was of truly superlative strength.

Another strong appearance of the Leonids in 1868 reached an intensity of 1000 per hour in dark skies. It was in 1866–67 that information on Comet Tempel-Tuttle was gathered pointing it out as the source of the meteor shower. When the storms failed to return in 1899, it was generally thought that the dust had moved on and storms were a thing of the past.

In 1981 Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the Leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of Comet Tempel-Tuttle.[tpl]Citation | last = Yeomans | first = Donald K. | title = Comet Tempel-Tuttle and the Leonid meteors | journal = Icarus | volume = 47 | issue = 03 | pages = 492–499 | date = September 1981 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WGF-472SWT6-47&_user=10&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F1981&_rdoc=24&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236821%231981%23999529996%23352441%23FLP%23display%23Volume)&_cdi=6821&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=27&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=046256996df6c39dac2b886a7b10fcfd&searchtype=a | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(81)90198-6 | id = | bibcode=1981Icar...47..492Y[/tpl] A graph http://web.archive.org from it was adapted and re-published in Sky and Telescope.Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and the Leonid Meteors(1996, see p. 6) It showed relative positions of the Earth and Tempel-Tuttle and marks where Earth encountered dense dust. This showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet, but paths of the Earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity. But overall the 1998 Leonids were in a favorable position so interest was rising. Leading up to the 1998 return, an airborne observing campaign was organized to mobilize modern observing techniques by Peter Jenniskens at NASA Ames Research Center. There were also efforts to observe impacts of meteoroids, as an example of transient lunar phenomenon, on the Moon in 1999. A particular reason to observe the Moon is that our vantage from a location on Earth sees only meteors coming into the atmosphere relatively close to us while impacts on the Moon would be visible from across the Moon in a single view.A Leonid on the Moon? by Dr. Tony Phillips A sodium tail of the Moon tripled just after the 1998 Leonid shower which was composed of larger meteoroids (which in the case of the Earth was witnessed as fireballs.)[tpl]Cite web | last = McNaught | first = Robert H. | authorlink = Robert H.

The work of David J. Asher, Armagh Observatory and Robert H. McNaught, Siding Spring Observatory and independently by Esko Lyytinen[tpl]Citation | last = Lyytinen | first = Esko | journal = Meta Research Bulletin | volume = 8 | pages = 33–40 | year = 1999 | url = http://metaresearch.org/publications/bulletin/#VOL8[/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = Lyytinen | first = Esko J. | last2 = Flandern | first2 = Tom Van | title = Predicting the Strength of Leonid Outbursts | journal = Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume = 82–83 | issue = 00 | pages = 149–166 | date = January 2000 | ISSN = 1573-0794| url =http://www.springerlink.com/content/r4k5712584539740/fulltext.pdf?page=1 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017068618114| id = [/tpl], in 1999, following on from the Kazan research, is considered by most meteor experts as the breakthrough in modern analysis of meteor storms. Whereas previously it was hazardous to guess if there would be a storm or little activity, the predictions of Asher and McNaught timed bursts in activity down to ten minutes by narrowing down the clouds of particles to individual streams from each passage of the comet, and their trajectories amended by subsequent passage near planets. However, whether a specific meteoroid trail will be primarily composed of small or large particles, and thus the relative brightness of the meteors, was not understood. But McNaught did extend the work to examine the placement of the Moon with trails and saw a large chance of a storm impacting in 1999 from a trail while there were less direct impacts from trails in 2000 and 2001 (successive contact with trails through 2006 showed no hits.)

===2000s===

Viewing campaigns resulted in spectacular footage from the 1999, 2001 and 2002, storms producing up to 3,000 Leonid meteors per hour. Predictions for the Moon's Leonid impacts also noted that in 2000 the side of the Moon facing the stream was away from the Earth but that impacts should be in number enough to raise a cloud of particles kicked off the Moon by impacts would cause a detectable increase in the sodium tail of the Moon. Research using the explanation of meteor trails/streams have explained the storms of the past. The 1833 storm was not due to the recent passage of the comet, but from a direct impact with the previous 1800 dust trail.Armagh Observatory Leonid dust trail positions in 1833.

Peter Jenniskens has published predictions for the next 50 years.[tpl]cite book |last=Jenniskens |first=P. |title=Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-85349-4 [/tpl] However, a close encounter with Jupiter is expected to perturb the comet's path, and many streams, making storms of historic magnitude unlikely for many decades. Recent work tries to take into account the roles of differences in parent bodies and the specifics of their orbits, ejection velocities off the solid mass of the core of a comet, radiation pressure from the sun, the Poynting–Robertson effect, and the Yarkovsky effect on the particles of different sizes and rates of rotation to explain differences between meteor showers in terms of being predominantly fireballs or small meteors.
