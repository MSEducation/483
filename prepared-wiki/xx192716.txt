HMS ''Bermuda'' was an 18-gun Bermuda sloop of the Royal Navy.
Bermuda was built in Bermuda of Bermuda cedar in 1805, as the lead ship of her class.  The Bermudas were modified versions of the Dasher class of 1797, and eventually consisted of six ships.  She was launched in 1805, and commissioned in October that year under the command of William Henry Byam, from Busy, Halifax.  She only spent three years in service before being wrecked on Memory Rock, Little Bermuda on 22 April 1808.  All the crew were saved and Captain Byam went on to command HMS Opossum.
