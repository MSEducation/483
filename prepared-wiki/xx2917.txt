</ref> The second and third generation contain charged leptons, the [[muon]] and the [[tau (particle)|tau]], which are identical to the electron in charge, [[spin (physics)|spin]] and [[fundamental interaction|interactions]], but are more massive. Leptons differ from the other basic constituent of matter, the [[quark]]s, by their lack of [[strong interaction]]. All members of the lepton group are fermions, because they all have half-odd integer spin; the electron has spin [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl].<ref name="raith">

===Fundamental properties===

The invariant mass of an electron is approximately [tpl]val|9.109|e=-31[/tpl] kilograms, or [tpl]val|5.489|e=-4[/tpl] atomic mass units. On the basis of Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511 MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836. Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for at least half the age of the universe, as is predicted by the Standard Model.
Electrons have an electric charge of [tpl]val|-1.602|e=-19[/tpl] coulomb,[ref]The original source for CODATA is
