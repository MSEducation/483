The Hop Looper or Hop Vine Moth (Hypena humuli) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It is found from coast to coast in Canada south in the east to Florida and Arkansas in the west to California. It is apparently absent from the south-central states. In Canada it is only absent from Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island and the far north.
The wingspan is 25–32 mm. The moth flies all year round in the south and west and from April to November in the northeast. There are two generations per year northward over most of East.
The larva, or Hop Worm, is about an inch long when full grown, of a greenish-white color, watery-looking or semi-transparent, and slightly striped and dotted, having fourteen legs. The mouth is yellowish, and the tips of the jaws black. The larvae appear early in June, and continue until late in August.[tpl]Cite book|title=The American home garden|author=Alexander Watson|year=1859|pages=109–10|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P-A1AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA109[/tpl] They feed on Laportea species, including hop, nettle and wood nettle.
