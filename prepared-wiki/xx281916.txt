"Atlas" has charted in 16 countries and reached top ten positions in three of them, and has also received mostly positive reviews from music critics.

==Background==

"Atlas" is Coldplay's first new track in almost two years, as the band's fifth studio album Mylo Xyloto was released in October 2011. The song was written specifically for Catching Fire and marks the first time that Coldplay have ever recorded an original song for a motion picture, or any piece of media outside the music industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/coldplay/72510 |title=Coldplay reveal new song 'Atlas', taken from 'The Hunger Games' soundtrack - listen |work=NME|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl] According to Billboard magazine, "the lyrics abstractly touch upon main characters Katniss and Peeta's mutual reliance."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5687178/coldplay-heads-to-hunger-games-on-atlas-single-listen |title=Coldplay Heads To 'Hunger Games' on 'Atlas' Single: Listen|date=6 September 2013|work=Billboard |accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl]
"I have great respect and admiration for Coldplay, and we are thrilled with how well they have connected to the themes and ideas within the film. Their unwavering passion and excitement for the project elevated the collaboration even further, and we can't wait to share this music with audiences around the world," said the film's director Francis Lawrence.
"We are so honored that Coldplay, one of the iconic rock bands of our generation, will perform the first song out on the new soundtrack. Knowing that Chris Martin is a fan of the books makes this even more meaningful. The Coldplay single underscores the stature of recording artists we've assembled for this powerful soundtrack," added Tracy McKnight, Lionsgate's Head of Film Music.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-et-ms-coldplay-atlas-hunger-games-catching-fire-soundtrack-20130809,0,2542760.story |title=Coldplay's 'Atlas' is first single from 'Hunger Games' soundtrack |work=Los Angeles Times |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl]

==Composition, recording and production==

"Atlas" was written by Coldplay members, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Chris Martin, and recorded in London between April and July 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-listen-to-coldplays-new-hunger-games-single-atlas-20130906,0,7689153.story |title=Listen to 'Atlas,' Coldplay's single for the new 'Hunger Games' film |first= Mikael |last=Wood |work=Los Angeles Times |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013 [/tpl]
The song is a down-tempo ballad, featuring delicate piano refrain with a "moody, haunting melody", and showcasing Martin's lower-register vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radiocremebrulee.com/reviews/coldplay-unveils-their-new-single-atlas |title=Coldplay unveils their new single "Atlas" |publisher=Radio Creme Brulee |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] According to some reviewers, it sounds "less like more recent Coldplay tracks and more like a throwback to their sound on A Rush of Blood to the Head,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-09-06/coldplay-catching-fire-atlas/ |title=Does Coldplay’s New Catching Fire Single "Atlas" Sound Like Their Old Stuff? |publisher=VH1 |first=Meghan |last=O'Keefe |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl] and "like a tossed-off remnant from the outfit's early days, before it began experimenting with deep rhythms and vivid textures." The piano builds to a bolder, "anthemic-quality" chorus with richly layered production, reminiscent of the band's fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto. The song was produced by Coldplay, Rik Simpson (with whom the band has previously worked on the Grammy Award-winning album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends and Mylo Xyloto), and Daniel Green (Mylo Xyloto).

==Critical reception==

Upon release, "Atlas" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Michael Nelson of Stereogum called the track "a swooning, appropriately cinematic ballad."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1461382/coldplay-atlas/mp3s/ |title=Coldplay – "Atlas" |first=Michael |last=Nelson |publisher=Stereogum |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl] Erin Coulehan of Rolling Stone magazine wrote, "The dreamy tune features a classic Coldplay presentation, with twinkling piano that builds as Chris Martin croons 'I'll carry your world'."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/coldplay-return-with-atlas-20130906 |title=Coldplay Return With 'Atlas' |first=Erin |last=Coulehan |work=Rolling Stone|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl] "The dreamy, piano-driven track was clearly written specifically for ‘Catching Fire,’ with lyrics like “some bend the bow” — about bow-and-arrow-wielding heroine Katniss, presumably — and “caught in the fire” (pretty self-explanatory)," wrote Karen Lanza of PopCrush.[tpl]cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/coldplay-atlas-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-soundtrack/|title=Listen to Coldplay, 'Atlas' From 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'|first=Karen|last=Lanza|publisher=PopCrush|date=7 September 2013|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl]
The Needle Drop's Anthony Fantano complimented Coldplay for returning to their sound prior to Mylo Xyloto. Fantano praised the contrast between the "soaring, beautiful, uplifting" chorus and "dark, dreary" verses, also comparing its verses to Radiohead. In the same collaborative review with Fantano, Sami Jarroush of the Rock it Out! Blog stated the song was similar to a "religious experience" and praised Martin for utilizing a lower vocal register in the song and complimented the uplifting emotions in the song, although both reviews noted that, while the song had "epic" moments, it was generally uninteresting and would likely be played during the end credits of the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/rock-it-out-blog-and-the-needle-drop-unite-to-review-coldplays-atlas/ |title=Rock it Out!

Though the band may have zero insider-cred, 'Atlas' proves that 'Clocks' played at three-quarter speed with most of the chorus scooped out still runs rings around most of the current zeitgeist."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/original-soundtrack-the-hunger-games-catching-fire |title=Original Soundtrack The Hunger Games: Catching Fire |first=Blue |last=Sullivan |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl]
