[[CJC-1295]]

CATEGORIES: Growth hormone secretagogues

CJC-1295 is a tetrasubstituted 30-amino acid peptide hormone, primarily functioning as a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It was invented by ConjuChem, a Canadian biotechnology company.
One of the advantages of CJC-1295 over traditional GHRH or rHGH is its ability to bioconjugate with serum albumin, thus increasing its half-life and therapeutic window. It accomplishes this by using protecting groups around the amino acids of GHRH typically susceptible to enzymatic degradation.[tpl]cite web|last=Teichman|first=Sam|title=Prolonged Stimulation of Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Secretion by CJC-1295, a Long-Acting Analog of GH-Releasing Hormone, in Healthy Adults|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/91/3/799.full|publisher=JCEM|accessdate=27 September 2013[/tpl]

==Bioconjugation==

The reason why CJC-1295 possesses the ability to lengthen the half-life within the active agent has to do with the scientific process known as bioconjugation. This technology, which is relatively new, is defined by its ability to take a reactive group and bond it to a peptide. This attachment causes a reaction with a nucleophilic unit, a typically partially molecule that is found within the bloodstream of an animal test subject. This reaction in turn causes a more stable bond to occur. This specific peptide has an especially high attraction to albumin, a globular protein that is soluble in water. This affinity prohibits natural degradation, which in turn increases the peptideâ€™s half-life. Additionally, clinical research performed on animal test subjects has thus far shown that there have been no signs of DPP-IV degradation present when CJC-1295 was introduced.[tpl]cite web |url=http://extremepeptides.com/blog/cjc1295/ |title=Current Research Findings Regarding CJC-1295 |last1=Stand |first1=Kim |date=24 September 2013 |publisher=EP |accessdate=27 September 2013[/tpl]
