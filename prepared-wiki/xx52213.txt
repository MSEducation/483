Warlords is a collectible card game, similar to Magic: The Gathering, published in 1997 by Iron Crown Enterprises.  Based on the acclaimed "Warlords III" computer game, Warlords is a simple, fast, fun, multi-player fantasy game. You assemble your heroic followers, gather your armies, and build citadels. Venturing out to explore, find treasure, or wage war, you avoid or crush cruel beasts and outmaneuver your foes' warriors and armies. Using strength and guile, you try to be the first to rise as the supreme Warlord.
