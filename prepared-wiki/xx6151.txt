Kwanzaa is a week-long celebration held in the United States and also celebrated in the Western African Diaspora in other nations of the Americas. The celebration honors African heritage in African-American culture, and is observed from December 26 to January 1, culminating in a feast and gift-giving.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/kwanzaa.html|publisher="Ron Karenga"|title=Why Kwanzaa Video[/tpl] Kwanzaa has seven core principles (Nguzo Saba). It was created by Maulana Karenga, and was first celebrated in 1966–67.

==History and etymology==

Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 as the first specifically African-American holiday.[tpl]cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00B1EFD395C0C738FDDAB0994DB484D81|work=New York Times"|title=The Evening Hours|date=1983-12-30 |accessdate=2006-12-15 | first=Ron | last=Alexander[/tpl]  Karenga said his goal was to "give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning "first fruits of the harvest".

Klein Klein  
Kwanzaa was a celebration that has its roots in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s, and was established as a means to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of African traditions and Nguzo Saba, the "seven principles of African Heritage" which Karenga said "is a communitarian African philosophy".
During the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an "oppositional alternative" to Christmas.Madhubuti, Haki R. (1972) Kwanzaa: A Progressive and Uplifting African-American Holiday However, as Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so that practicing Christians would not be alienated, then stating in the 1997 Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture, "Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday."
Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/20/garden/in-blacks-homes-the-christmas-and-kwanzaa-spirits-meet.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=In Blacks' Homes, the Christmas and Kwanzaa Spirits Meet | first=Lena | last=Williams | date=1990-12-20 | accessdate=2010-05-07[/tpl]

==Principles and symbols==

Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba—the seven principles of African Heritage), which Karenga said "is a communitarian African philosophy," consisting of what Karenga called "the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world." These seven principles comprise *Kawaida, a Swahili term for tradition and reason.  Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:
Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat (Mkeka) on which other symbols are placed, corn (Muhindi) and other crops, a candle holder kinara with seven candles (Mishumaa Saba), a communal cup for pouring libation (Kikimbe cha Umoja), gifts (Zawadi), a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.

==Observance==

Families celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art; colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women; and fresh fruits that represent African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice, Kikombe cha Umoja, passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is "Joyous Kwanzaa".
A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani?Official Kwanzaa site | Greeting which is Swahili for "What's the News?"Swahili Meaning
At first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.
Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song and poetry.The Spirit of Kwanzaa[http://www.danceinstitute.org/aboutus3g.html The Dance>Kwanzaa featured on this year's holiday U.S. postage stamp
The holiday has also spread to Canada, and is celebrated by Black Canadians in a similar fashion as in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/society/celebrations/clips/16226/ |title=The principles of Kwanzaa |publisher=CBC |date= Broadcast Date: Dec. 28, 1993 |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]

==Popularity==

In 2004, BIG Research conducted a marketing survey in the United States for the National Retail Foundation, which found that 1.6% of those surveyed planned to celebrate Kwanzaa. If generalized to the US population as a whole, this would imply that around 4.7 million people planned to celebrate Kwanzaa in that year."2004 Holiday Spending by Region", 'Survey by BIGresearch, conducted for National Retail Foundation', 14 October 2004 In a 2006 speech, Ron Karenga asserted that 28 million people celebrate Kwanzaa.  He has always claimed it is celebrated all over the world. Lee D. Baker puts the number at 12 million.Manning Marable, Dispatches from the Ebony Tower, p. 224. The African American Cultural Center claimed 30 million in 2009."Kwanzaa celebration unites African-American community", The Post,  Ohio University, 1 November 2011. Accessed 25 December 2012.  In 2011, Keith Mayes said that 2 million people participated in Kwanzaa.
According to Keith Mayes, the author of Kwanzaa: Black Power and the Making of the African-American Holiday Tradition, the popularity within the US has "leveled off" as the black power movement there has declined, and now between half and two million people celebrate Kwanzaa in the US, or between one and five percent of African Americans. Mayes adds that white institutions now celebrate it.Keith Mayes, cited by Megan K. Scott, "Kwanzaa celebrations continue, but boom is over", Buffalo News, 17 December 2009. Accessed 25 December 2009.
The holiday has also spread to Canada, and is celebrated by Black Canadians in a similar fashion as in the United States. According to the Language Portal of Canada, "this fairly new tradition has also gained in popularity in France, Great Britain, Jamaica and Brazil", although this information has not been confirmed with authoritative sources from these countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/bien-well/fra-eng/vocabulaire-vocabulary/clbrt-kwanzaa-eng.html |title=Celebrate Kwanzaa!  |publisher=Government of Canada |date= Date Modified: 2011-02-21  |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
In Brazil, in recent years the term Kwanzaa has been applied by a few institutions as a synonym for the festivities of the Black Awareness Day, commemorated on November 20 in honor of Zumbi dos Palmares,Celebration of Kwanzaa on Black Awareness Day in São Paulo.Celebration of Kwanzaa on the 28th anniversary of Olodum School in Salvador, Bahia. having little to do with the celebration as it was originally conceived.
In 2009, Maya Angelou narrated the documentary The Black Candle, a film about Kwanzaa.
