Beavertail State Park is a state park encompassing [tpl]convert|153|acre|ha[/tpl] on Conanicut Island in Narragansett Bay in the state of Rhode Island. Its main attraction, Beavertail Lighthouse, is an active light at the south end of the town of Jamestown.
The original lighthouse was built in 1749, was rebuilt multiple times, most recently after the Hurricane of 1938, and has undergone restoration work since. During World War II, the area was part of Fort Burnside, one of several coastal fortifications designed to protect Narragansett Bay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riparks.com/History/HistoryBeavertail.html |title=History |work=Beavertail State Park |publisher=State of Rhode Division of Parks & Recreation |accessdate=2012-12-08[/tpl]  The park includes acres of grassy fields and miles of shoreline. Beavertail's topography has been frequently compared to that of the French or Italian Riviera[tpl]Fact|date=February 2007[/tpl]. The rocky shores conceal many small beaches, though accessing these beaches is not easy.
