Fatal Recordings is a feminist record label, established by German industrial / techno artist Hanin Elias.
Fatal focuses on left-wing political music. It was formed in part because Hanin Elias felt that women did not have a place to record and create electronic music. This perspective was a result of her experience with Digital Hardcore Recordings as a member of Atari Teenage Riot.
In January 2006, Elias announced that Fatal Recordings would cease to exist by the following year. It is now defunct.
