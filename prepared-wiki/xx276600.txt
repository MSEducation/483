On 13 August 1891, the company merged with John See and Company and was renamed as the North Coast Steam Navigation Company and was based in Sydney. During 1920, the company merged with Allan Taylor & Company and continued to operate the fleets under their own names. The company acquired Langley Bros in 1925 and bought the remaining fleet of the Coastal Co-Operative Steamship Company in 1929. The company further acquired the Port Stephens Steamship Company in 1940.
Many of the company's vessels were requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy during World War II, and two ships were lost due to enemy action. On 5 December 1940 the [tpl]MV|Nimbin[/tpl] sunk approximately 8 nautical miles off Norah Head, New South Wales, after hitting a mine laid by the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin, with the loss of 7 people including the captain.

The SS Nambucca was also lost on active service, being destroyed by fire in 1945 while serving with the US Army small fleet in the Pacific islands.
The North Coast Steam Navigation Company continued to operate until 1954 and went into voluntary liquidation due to rising costs and unfavourable industrial conditions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18417541|title=Ships For Sale â€“ Coastal Firm Winding Up|work=The Sydney Mornigng Herald|date=31 March 1954|page=5|accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl]
