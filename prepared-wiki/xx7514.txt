Additionally, according to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), Malaysia hosts a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 155,700. Of this population, approximately 70,500 refugees and asylum seekers are from the Philippines, 69,700 from Burma, and 21,800 from Indonesia.[tpl]cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008|publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants|date=19 June 2008|url=http://www.refugees.org/survey[/tpl] The USCRI named Malaysia as one of the ten worst places for refugees on account of the country's discriminatory practices toward them. Malaysian officials are reported to have turned deportees directly over to human smugglers in 2007, and Malaysia employs RELA, a volunteer militia, to enforce its immigration law.

==Ethnicity==

Malaysia's population comprises many ethnic groups. People of Austronesian origin make a majority of the population, and are known as the Bumiputras. Large Chinese and Indian minorities also exist. Malays, as Bumiputra, see Malaysia as their land, and since race riots in 1969 Bumiputra have been especially privileged in Malaysia. However, since then racial stability has prevailed, if not full harmony. Mixed marriages are on the rise.[tpl]cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |work=Time magazine |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=26 August 2011[/tpl] The twenty largest ethnolinguistic groups in Malaysia are as follows:Joshua Project database for Malaysia

===Bumiputras===

Bumiputras are divided into Malays, who make up the majority of the Malaysian population at 50.4%; and other bumiputra, who make up 11% of the Malaysian population.CIA World Factbook – Based on 2004 estimate Bumiputra status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples, including ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Laws over who gets Bumiputra status vary between states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/11/4/nation/20091104194453&sec=nation |title=PM asked to clarify mixed-race bumiputra status |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl] Some Eurasians can obtain bumiputra privileges, providing they can prove they are of Portuguese descent.[ref]

====Malays====

The Malays are an ethnic group predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and parts of Sumatra and Borneo. They form the largest community in Malaysia and play a dominant role politically. They make up about half of the total population. By constitutional definition, Malays are Muslims who practice Malay customs (adat) and culture. Therefore, technically, a Muslim of any race who practices Malay customs and culture can be considered a Malay and allocated privilleged status in the form of the Bumiputra rights stipulated in the constitution. 
Their language, Malay (Bahasa Malaysia), is the national language of the country.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 152 |range= [/tpl] Citizens of Minangkabau, Bugis or Javanese origins, who can be classified "Malay" under constitutional definitions may also speak their respective ancestral tongues. However, English is also widely spoken in major towns and cities across the country. Malays from different states in Malaysia carry distinct dialects that can sometimes be unintelligible to most of their fellow countrymen. By definition of the Malaysian constitution, all Malays are Muslims. 
In the past, Malays wrote in Pallava or using the Sanskrit-based alphabet of Kawi. Arabic traders later introduced Jawi, an Arabic-based script, which became popular after the 15th century. Until then reading and writing were mostly the preserve of scholars and nobility, while most Malay commoners were illiterate. Jawi was taught along with Islam, allowing the script to spread through all social classes. Nevertheless, Kawi remained in use by the upper-class well into the 15th century. The Romanised script was introduced during the colonial period and, over time, it came to replace both Sanskrit and Jawi. This was largely due to the influence of the European education system, wherein children were taught the Latin alphabet.
Malay culture shows strong influences from Hinduism, Buddhism and animism. However, since the Islamisation movement of the 1980s and 90s, these aspects are often neglected or banned altogether. Because any Malay-speaking Muslim is entitled to Bumiputra privileges, many non-Malay Muslims have adopted the Malay language, customs and attire in the last few decades. This is particularly the case with Indian Muslims from the peninsula and the Kadayan of Borneo. The Malay ethnic group is distinct from the concept of a Malay race, which encompasses a wider group of people, including most of Indonesia and the Philippines.

====Other Bumiputras====

Malaysia has many other non-Malay indigenous people, who are given Bumiputra status. The indigenous tribes are the oldest inhabitants of Malaysia, and the indigenous groups of Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia are collectively known as the "Orang Asli". They account for about 5 percent of the total population, and represent a majority in East Malaysia of Sabah and Sarawak. In Sarawak, the dominant tribal groups are the Dayak, who are either Iban (also known as Sea Dayak) or Bidayuh (also known as Land Dayak). The Iban form the largest of all indigenous groups, numbering over 600,000 (30% of Sarawak's population), and some of still live in traditional longhouses which can hold up to 200 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geographyofwealth/iban_profile.html |title=Geography of Wealth — Iban People/Malaysia Profile |publisher=National Geographic |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] Longhouses are mostly places along the Rajang and Lupar rivers and their tributaries, although many Iban have moved to the cities. The Bidayuhs, numbering around 170,000, are concentrated in the southwestern part of Sarawak. They, together with other indigenous groups in Sarawak make up over half of the states population.
The largest indigenous tribe in Sabah is the Kadazan, most of whom are Christians[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abcsabah.com/sabahan-the-people-of-sabah/kadazandusun/ |title=KadazanDusun, Kadazan Dusun Sabahan | ABC Sabah Malaysia |publisher=Abcsabah.com |accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] and rice farmers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sabah.org.my/bi/know_sabah/people.asp |title=The People Of Sabah |publisher=Sabah.org.my |accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl]  They live as substinence farmers. Sabah has a large amount of indigenous people, 18% of the population are Kadazan-Dusuns, and 17% are Bajaus).
There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula, where they are collectively known as Orang Asli (literally meaning "original person").[ref]
