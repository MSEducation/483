[[Stercobilin]]

CATEGORIES: Metabolism, Digestive system, Tetrapyrroles

Stercobilin is a tetrapyrrolic bile pigment and is one end-product of heme catabolism.Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3Kay IT, Weimer M, Watson CJ (1963). “The formation in vitro of stercobilin from bilirubin.” J Biol Chem. 238:1122-3. PMID 14031566 It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human fecal materialBoron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3. and was originally isolated from feces in 1932.Kay IT, Weimer M, Watson CJ (1963). "The formation in vitro of stercobilin from bilirubin." J Biol Chem. 238:1122-3. PMID 14031566 Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers.Lam CW, Lai CK, Chan YW (1998). "Simultaneous fluorescence detection of fecal urobilins and porphyrins by reversed-phase high-performance thin-layer chromatography". Clin Chem. 44(2):345-6. PMID 9474036

==Metabolism==

Stercobilin results from breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes.Kay IT, Weimer M, Watson CJ (1963). “The formation in vitro of stercobilin from bilirubin.” J Biol Chem. 238:1122-3. PMID 14031566 Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin.Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3 Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated with one or two glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile.Seyfried H, Klicpera M, Leithner C, Penner E (1976). "Bilirubin metabolism". Wien Klin Wochenschr. 88:477-82. PMID 793184  In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum.Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3  This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen.Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3  Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3 Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces.Seyfried H, Klicpera M, Leithner C, Penner E (1976). “Bilirubin metabolism”. Wien Klin Wochenschr. 88:477-82. PMID 793184

==Role in disease==

===Obstructive jaundice===

In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen. The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored.Boron W, Boulpaep E. Medical Physiology: a cellular and molecular approach, 2005. 984-986. Elsevier Saunders, United States. ISBN 1-4160-2328-3

===Brown pigment gallstones===

An analysis of two infants suffering from cholelithiasis observed that a substantial amount of stercobilin was present in brown pigment gallstones. This study suggested that brown pigment gallstones could form spontaneously in infants suffering from bacterial infections of the biliary tract.Treem WR, Malet PF, Gourley GR, Hyams JS (1989). “Bile and stone analysis in two infants with brown pigment gallstones and infected bile”. Gastroenterology 96(2 Pt 1):519-23. PMID 2642880

==Role in treatment of disease==

A 1996 study by McPhee et al. suggested that stercobilin and other related pyrrolic pigments — including urobilin, biliverdin, dimethyl ester, and xanthobilirubic acid — has potential to function as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors when delivered at low micromolar concentrations. These pigments were selected due to a similar in shape to the successful HIV-1 protease inhibitor Merck L-700,417. Further research is suggested to study the pharmacological efficacy of these pigments.McPhee F, Caldera P, Bemis G, McDonagh A, Kuntz I, and Craik C (1996). “Bile pigments as HIV-1 protease inhibitors and their effects on HIV-1 viral maturation and infectivity in vitro”. Biochem. J. 320: 681–686 PMID 8973584
