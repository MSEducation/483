==History==

Established in 1999 by Boaz Wachtel, Shlomi Sandak and Rafik Kimchi, the party gained 1% of the vote in the elections that year,1999 Election Results (Final) Knesset website and 1.2% in the 2003 elections,2003 Election Results Knesset website but both times failed to pass the 1.5% threshold for representation in the Knesset. After these elections and despite the strong results in the 2003 elections, the chairman of Ale Yarok, Boaz Wachtel announced that he was giving up the leadership of the party, but remained in the position due to party members requests.
Before the 2006 elections the party announced that it intended to run for a third time, despite the threshold for representation having been raised to 2%. The party competed for votes with the supporters of the Democratic Choice (which later stepped down from running in the election) and with Meretz-Yachad, which had also promised to act for the decriminalization of soft drugs; another competitor was the Green Party with a strong ecological platform. The party gained 1.3% of the vote, and came second among those parties failing to make the threshold.2006 Election Results Knesset website After the election, Wachtel passed the chairmanship to Ohad Shem-Tov.
Before the 2009 elections, Shem-Tov was expelled from the party by Shlomi Sandak who was the temporary chairman of the Green Leaf Party. Internal disputes lead the party to split with Shem-Tov forming the Ale Yarok Alumni group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/News/InternationalNews/Holocaust-survivors-team-up-with-marijuana-activists-in-odd-coalition/tabid/417/articleID/90279/cat/61/Default.aspx |title=Holocaust survivors team up with marijuana activists in odd coalition |publisher=3 News |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl] The Alumni party later allied with the Holocaust Survivors party to contest the 2009 Knesset elections.
In 2010 Shlomi Sandak resigned the party: "Now that cannabis is recognised as a medicine, my political ride is over", he said. Today he is promoting the medical uses of cannabis.

==Ideology==

The party's current platform is based on the legalization of the Cannabis plant, marijuana and hashish, expansion of human rights, free market and institutionalization of prostitution and gambling. In official publications the movement claims that "the partition between Right-wing and Left-wing is anachronistic"; it believes that any proposed solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be put on referendum in order to be legitimate.
