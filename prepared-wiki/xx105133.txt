The 10th SS Panzer Division ''Frundsberg or '10.SS-Panzer-Division Frundsberg''' was a German Waffen SS panzer division. The division was formed at the beginning of 1943 as a reserve for the expected Allied invasion of France. However, their first campaign was in the Ukraine in April 1944. Highly motivated after combat success in the Ukraine, the unit was then transported back to the west, where it fought the Allies in France and at Arnhem. The division was later transported to Pomerania, then fought south east of Berlin in the Lausitz area until the end of the war. Unlike several of the earlier SS panzer divisions, the "Frundsberg" division did not engage in atrocities against either civilians or combatants. Based on its fighting record, it was an elite division that also had a reputation of fighting a "clean war." Postwar, the division had a very active veteran's association.

==History==

Initially, the name ''Karl der Große (Charlemagne) was used for the Division for some time in 1943. However, French volunteers in the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS used the name Charlemagne (33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)), so instead the honor title Frundsberg'' was chosen, which refers to the 16th Century German landsknecht commander Georg von Frundsberg.
The division was mainly formed from conscripts. It first saw action at Tarnopol in April 1944 and later took part in the rescue of German troops cut off in the Kamianets-Podilskyi pocket.
It was then sent to Normandy to counter the Allied landings. It, and its "twin" Division, the 9th SS Panzer-Division Hohenstaufen, played an important part in holding the British Forces back in Normandy, particularly during Operation Epsom.
It retreated into Belgium before being sent to rest near Arnhem, where it soon had to fight the Allied parachute assault during Operation Market Garden at Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, at which time it, along with the 9th SS Panzer, constituted the II SS Panzer Corps.
After rebuilding, it fought in the Alsace in January 1945. It was then sent to the Eastern Front, where it fought against the Red Army's invasion of Pomerania and, later, Saxony.
Encircled at the Halbe Pocket, the division took heavy losses but managed to break out of the encirclement and retreated through Moritzburg, before reaching the area of Teplice in Czechoslovakia at the end of the war.www.lexicon-der-wehrmacht.de 10th SS sub-page At this location, the division surrendered to the US Army.Georg Tessin, Verbände und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS, Vol. III, p. 188, Osnabrück: Biblio Verlag, 1974

==Günter Grass==

German writer and Nobel laureate Günter Grass was an assistant tank gunner with the division after having been conscripted into the Waffen-SS at the age of 17 in November 1944. He was wounded in action on 25 April 1945 and captured in a hospital.
