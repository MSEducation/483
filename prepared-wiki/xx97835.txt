West Point is the westernmost point in Seattle, Washington, USA, jutting into Puget Sound from the Magnolia neighborhood. It also marks the northern extent of Elliott Bay; a line drawn southeastward to Alki Point marks the western extent of the bay. At the point itself is the 1881 West Point Lighthouse, the first manned light station on Puget Sound. Just to the east is King County's sewage treatment plant, and beyond that, Discovery Park, formerly the U.S. Army's Fort Lawton.
