Sunforest was a short-lived psychedelic folk band formed in 1969 by Terry Tucker, Erika Eigen and Freya Hogue. They have recorded only one studio album, Sound of Sunforest under the Decca Records label. They are best known for their instrumental "The Overture to the Sun" and song "Lighthouse Keeper", which was featured in both the film A Clockwork Orange and its soundtrack.

==History==

Terry Tucker went to London with two girlfriends, Erika Eigen and Freya Hogue, to become pop singers and were discovered almost right away in a working class cafe drinking tea. A man came from Decca Records, wanted to hear their songs and they went to the studio that night and recorded a demo. Two weeks later they wanted to record an album, and he became their manager. They recorded their one and only album Sound of Sunforest in 1969. Kubrick wanted them to record the track "Overture for the Sun" for the soundtrack. It got recorded again, Terry wrote some changes in the arrangement for the film. The new version of "Overture to the sun" is instrumental, like a renaissance piece. "Lighthouse Keeper" is a song that Erica wrote and Terry sang backup on it and played the piano. Terry stayed in England about 12 years and came home to the US after the band broke up.http://www.myspace.com/sunforestband Sound Of Sunforest page on MySpace.com
