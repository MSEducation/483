==Early life and background==

Redžepova was born on 8 August 1943 in Skopje, then annexed by the Kingdom of Bulgaria.Bulgaria During the Second World War, Marshall Lee Miller, Stanford University Press, 1975, ISBN 0804708703, p. 128. She is the second youngest of six children in a Romani family. Her father worked variously as a porter, singer, drummer, circus strongman and shoeshiner. Her parents insisted that all children finish primary school. At age nine Esma was introduced by one of her brothers to a local Romani music organisation, where she was able to quickly learn complicated rhythms. Her mother encouraged her musical gifts and Esma and her brother soon joined their school's folklore group.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.passiondiscs.co.uk/articles/journeys_extract.htm|title=Extract from "Princes Amongst Men: Journeys with Gypsy Musicians"|accessdate=2006-08-02|publisher=Serpent's Tail|year=2005|author=Garth Cartwright|format=Book[/tpl]
In 1957, aged 14, she was invited to sing at a school talent contest for Radio Skopje. This concert proved to be a turning point — not only did she place first, beating 57 other schools and winning 9,000 dinars,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.esma.com.mk/concerts-2.htm|title=Esma's Personal Website - Concerts|accessdate=2006-08-02[/tpl] but national band frontman and future husband Stevo Teodosievski also happened to be in attendance. After securing permission from her parents, Esma began touring with his musical ensemble. Legend has it she left home with a single suitcase filled with one dress and one Čoček costume.

==Recent career==

In recent years, Esma has remained popular throughout the Balkans. In 2002, she recorded a duet with the famous Macedonian singer Todor Proeski called "Magija" which was included in Todor's album "Ako Me Pogledneš Vo Oči" which was released in October the same year.
Her best known single Čaje Šukarije is the feature song on the 2006 Borat movie soundtrack, which she claims was used without her permission.  Together with Naat Veliov from Kočani Orkestar she sued the producers of the film for 800,000 euro (USD 1,000,000).  Afterwards, Redžepova won a €26,000 compensation, since it turned out that Cohen got permission from her production house to take the song, which she was not notified about.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.makfax.com.mk/en-Us/Details.aspx?itemID=7503 |title=Esma wins lawsuit against Sacha Kohen|publisher=makfax.com.mk|date=2009-07-29| accessdate= 2009-07-30[/tpl]
The movie Gypsy Caravan (2007) features Esma as one of five Romani music acts on their tour through the USA.
The film Rromani Soul (2008), directed by Louis Mouchet, features Esma as the guide of the true origin of Rroma people located in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh by Roma linguist Marcel Courthiade.
