The Dixie Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game held New Year's Day at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.Foldesy, Jody. "Bowls burgeon as big business", The Washington Times. December 21, 1997. Page A1. The game was only held twice, following the 1947 and 1948 seasons, after which it was discontinued. Birmingham and Legion Field have since played host to a number of other bowl games including the Hall of Fame Classic, All-American Bowl and the BBVA Compass Bowl. Baylor hosted Wake Forest and beat them 20-7. Now in 2010, Legion Field is where the UAB Blazers play football.
Both games featured teams from the Southern Conference and the Southwest Conference, with the SWC representative winning each one.
