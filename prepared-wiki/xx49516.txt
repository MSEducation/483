After 7 is a R&B group founded in 1987 by brothers Melvin and Kevon Edmonds, and Keith Mitchell. The Edmonds brothers are the siblings of popular pop and R&B singer-songwriter-producer Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds". Mitchell was long thought to be the cousin of Babyface's then-partner, songwriter-producer Antonio "L.A." Reid, however, this was actually set up as a marketing tool for the group and was actually incorrect.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rnbhaven.com/90s-music/feature/Keith-Mitchell-Interview-Part-1/13 |title=Keith Mitchell: After 7's Untold Story |accessdate=2009-02-01 |year=2009 |publisher=R&B Haven| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090203132903/http://www.rnbhaven.com/90s-music/feature/Keith-Mitchell-Interview-Part-1/13| archivedate= 3 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
