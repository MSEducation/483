Churchill Forge Mill is a water powered forge mill. It is situated in the village of Churchill, which is near Hagley, in the English county of Worcestershire. Until the early 1970s was operated as a working business, producing metal tools such as spades, shovels and ladles. It is one of the last water powered forge mills remaining in an intact state in the UK and as such is an important example of the industrial heritage of the West Midlands.

The two water wheels at the forge have been restored to working condition and it is also possible to view the original belt driven machinery at the site as well as displays of the tools made there and photographs of the forge during its working days. The site is now maintained and operated by the Churchill Forge Trust. 

Visitors are welcomed to the site on selected dates between Easter and October; usually Easter Monday followed by the second Sunday of each month. Full details on open days are available at the Churchill Forge Website.[tpl]cite web | title = Churchill Forge Mill Website | url = http://www.churchillforge.org.uk/ | publisher =  Churchill Forge Trust | accessdate = August 2, 2006 [/tpl]
