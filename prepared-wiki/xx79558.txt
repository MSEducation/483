==Biography==

Mark Oliver Everett is the son of physicist Hugh Everett III, originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory and of the use of Lagrange multipliers for general engineering optimizations. Everett's maternal grandfather is Harold "Kid" Gore, a legendary men's basketball, football and baseball coach at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.[tpl]cite web|last=Everett|first=Mark Oliver|title=Things The Grandchildren Should Know|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yS1EZK2NCrkC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=harold+gore+things+the+grandchildren&source=bl&ots=Sfh2RvacXW&sig=oI4zQbJvMt-qEFyK4_U7APdOTF8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H4z9UJe7I5SI9gSY-IHgAQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=harold%20gore%20things%20the%20grandchildren&f=false|work=Book - Things the Grandchildren Should Know|accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]  As a child, Everett developed a love of toy instruments; this fondness would continue into adulthood and provide an integral part of his idiosyncratic sound.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
In 1987, Everett moved from his family home in Virginia and resettled in California. Here, Everett began his professional musical career with two major-label albums: A Man Called E and Broken Toy Shop. The pseudonym "E" was used for both of these early recordings. While it may have caused some confusion in record stores and radio stations, the single-letter name gave the press a playful handle. This playfulness was evident in a review by the eminent writer Daniel Levitin which began: "Excellent eponymous effort, energizingly eclectic. Early enthusiasm effectively ensures E's eminence."[tpl]cite journal|author=Levitin, D. J.|date=March 16, 1992|title=E: A Man Called (E)|journal=Recording-Engineer-Producer (REP)|volume=23|issue=2|publisher=Intertec|location=Overland Park, KS[/tpl] A Billboard magazine review of his second album was similarly positive.[tpl]cite journal|author=Levitin, D.

===Everett's family===

Everett's family has been an inspiration to him, e.g. the song "Things the Grandchildren Should Know" (he would later publish an autobiography of the same name) and the song "3 Speed", referencing the writings of his sister Liz. Everett made a documentary about both his father's theory and his own relationship with his father entitled Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives for the BBC that was aired on the PBS series NOVA in 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-06-18[/tpl]
Everett's father, Hugh, died of heart failure in 1982. His sister, Elizabeth, long troubled by schizophrenia, committed suicide in 1996, and in 1998 his mother, Nancy Everett née Gore, died of lung cancer. Following these tragedies, Everett and the Eels released Electro-Shock Blues in 1998.
His cousin, Jennifer Lewis née Gore, was a flight attendant on the plane that struck The Pentagon during the September 11, 2001 attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/attacked/victims/v_420.html |title=America At War - The Human Toll |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl] The plane struck the side of the Pentagon where his father had worked, and Everett remarks in his autobiography that he wonders whether the plane hit his father's old office.[tpl]cite book |title= Things The GrandChildren Should Know|last= Everett|first=Mark |authorlink= Mark Oliver Everett |year=2008  |publisher= Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-316-02787-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7l6ZPwAACAAJ&dq[/tpl]
In 2000 he married Anna, a Russian dentist he met at a salad factory which doubled as a psychologist's offices. The song What is this note? on the Souljacker album is in tribute to the happy days in the early days of the marriage. The marriage ended after 5 years. Although he titled his autobiography Things the Grandchildren Should Know, he does not have any children of his own.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Sunday Times|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3122665.ece |title=Review of Things the Grandchildren Should Know|accessdate=2014-04-17[/tpl]

==Career==

Everett's early solo work and Eels collaborations were hailed by critics for their innovative combination of various instruments and styles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] Everett has used everything from a toy piano in his early "Symphony for a Toy Piano in G Minor" to hammers on a radiator as percussion in 1998's "Cancer for the Cure". Despite his constant denials, he is suspected of being the man behind MC Honky, who released the album I Am the Messiah in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modernrockreview.com/2011-08/brighter-days/|title=Brighter Days|author =Leah Della Croce|publisher=Modern Rock Review |date=August 9, 2012[/tpl]
