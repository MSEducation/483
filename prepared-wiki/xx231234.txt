==The Theme of the Commentary==

According to the Maulana, the Qur'an, a book of divine warning,  stresses the importance of man’s discovery of truth at the level of realization. Its objective is to explain  God’s   Creation plan, i.e. why God created this world; the purpose  of settling man on earth, what is required from man in his pre-death life span, and how his life’s  record will  determine  what the post-death period  will  bring reward or punishment.  The Qur'an thus serves to guide man on his entire journey through life into the after-life. The main themes of the Qur'an, clearly  set  forth  in  the present translation and commentary of the Qur'an, are enlightenment, peace and closeness to God. To enable the  reader to discover God at a purely intellectual level, the Qur'an emphasizes tawassum, tadabbur, and tafakkur - reflection, thinking and contemplation on the signs of God throughout the world.
