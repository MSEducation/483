de Volkskrant ([tpl]IPA-nl|də ˈvɔɫkskrɑnt[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-en|the People's Paper[/tpl]) is Dutch daily morning newspaper. It was founded in 1919 and it currently has a circulation of approximately 250,000 nationwide. Formerly a leading centre-left catholic broadsheet, de Volkskrant today is a medium-sized centrist compact.

==History==

De Volkskrant was founded in 1919 and is a daily morning newspaper since 1921. Originally de Volkskrant was a Roman Catholic newspaper, closely linked to the Catholic People's Party and the catholic pillar. On its re-founding in 1945 its office moved from Den Bosch to Amsterdam.Sommer, Martin Zelfbewust op zoek in de Volkskrant 23 August 2006 It became a left-wing newspaper in the 1960s. Its former clear left wing stance has been watered down since 1980.Sommer, Martin Zelfbewust op zoek in de Volkskrant 23 August 2006 "Hoogtepunt en tevens laatste oprisping van het linkse levensgevoel was de beruchte Koninginnedagkrant van 1 mei 1980. .. De rellen kwamen er en de Volkskrant solidariseerde zich met het oproer. .. Zo bleef de Volkskrant de progressiviteit trouw, zij het langzamerhand steeds meer in homeopathische verdunning." On 23 August 2006 the Volkskrant published its 25,000th edition.

==Circulation==

The daily circulation was 326,000 copies in 2002, dwindling to some 235,000 in 2011, which nevertheless makes it the third biggest newspaper of the Netherlands, after the De Telegraaf and Algemeen Dagblad. The total Dutch newspaper circulation in 2002 was 4.9 million (4.2m paid and 0.7m free). The paper has since then heavily lost in circulation. The circulation drop occurred under the editorship of Pieter Broertjes, who gave up his 20-year tenure in 2010.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

In 2009 PCM Uitgevers was taken over by De Persgroep N.V., a Belgian publishing company.

==Free newspaper==

In October 2006, Volkskrant announced that it would start publishing a free version of its paper targeting youths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/02/europe/EU_GEN_Netherlands_Newspapers.php |title=Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant to launch free version for younger readers |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2012-01-31[/tpl] Its competitors would be Metro and Sp!ts, two other free dailies. However PCM gave no permission for this so the plan had to be retracted. Instead PCM intended to come with a free newspaper together with investor Marcel Boekhoorn.http://www.trouw.nl/hetnieuws/nederland/article515988.ece/PCM_en_Boekhoorn_samen_in_gratis_krant PCM later withdrew from the project and Boekhoorn started the free daily De Pers using his own resources. A year later PCM started its own free paper DAG, that lived very shortly and went digital after another year.
