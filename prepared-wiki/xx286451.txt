==Early life==

Storer was born in Leicester on 11 July 1930. He attended Alderman Newton School and after leaving at the age of 16, he worked for the family bakery which had been founded by his grandfather in 1899. Following his National service period which he spent as an instructor at the British Army bakery school, he rejoined the family firm. In 1960, the company was sold to Allied Bakeries and Storer was convinced to become a trainee manager. He wrote a book entitled Bread Salesmanship, which was used by Allied as a training manual.[tpl]cite news|title=Trevor Storer|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10243506/Trevor-Storer.html|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=14 August 2013[/tpl]

He expanded the range to include chicken and mushroom pies, turning over £12,000 in the first year. In 1964 the company was renamed to Pukka Pies at the suggestion of his wife.
