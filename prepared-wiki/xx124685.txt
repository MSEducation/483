The Albanian State Police is the national police and law enforcement agency which operates throughout the Republic of Albania.  The falling down of the Communist system and the setting up of the political pluralism after the year 1991 brought important changes in the structure of the Albanian Police. In April 1991, was established the Ministry of Public Order and the General Directorate of Police. By the new law in July 1991, was created the Police of Public Order. Nearly 80% of the old personnel of police was replaced by new personnel. On November 4, 1991 the Albanian Police was accepted in INTERPOL. The emergency number is 129.
The original Albanian Police was founded on 13 January 1913 by the government of Ismail Qemali, Albania's first prime minister."Eighty-fifth anniversary of Albanian police founding commemorated", Albanian Telegraphic Agency, 11 January 1998
