===Death of Schumachers' mother===

Ralf and Michael Schumacher raced despite the death of their mother just hours before the race. They sported black armbands and no champagne was sprayed on the podium as a mark of respect. This was also the last race for the Ferrari F2002, concluding its successful career with a win. Ferrari team principal Jean Todt took Michael's place at the post-race press conference.

===Trophy Handover from Brazilian Grand Prix===

Confusion caused by a red flag at the end of the previous race in Brazil had led to Kimi Räikkönen being declared the winner. An investigation by the FIA in the days following the race proved that Giancarlo Fisichella had been the actual victor. On the Friday of the San Marino Grand Prix meeting, a ceremony was held in which Kimi Räikkönen and Ron Dennis presented their winners' trophies from the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix to Giancarlo Fisichella and Eddie Jordan.
