However, successive promotions in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons saw Hull rise from the fourth tier to the second tier in a space of two years. After 104 years of existence, Hull were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in their history, beating Watford in the play-off semi-finals and Bristol City in the 2008 Football League Championship play-off Final.

Three years later, Hull returned to the Premier League after finishing the 2012–13 season as Championship runners-up.
Since their election to the Football League in 1905, Hull have spent 2 seasons in the first tier, 56 in the second, 30 in the third and 10 in the fourth.
