Thomas Lewis (died 1674) was an English organist.

==Career==

Lewis succeeded William Eames as Organist of Chichester Cathedral in 1636. After a five-day siege in December 1642, Cicestrian cavaliers surrendered to William Waller's forces. As the city had fallen to the puritan movement sweeping the country during the First English Civil War, all choral services were suspended. Lewis did not resume his post at the Restoration in 1661 - Bartholomew Webb became Organist in 1668.Organs and Organists of Chichester Cathedral
