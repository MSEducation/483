==Works==

Lipsius wrote principally on dogmatics and the history of early Christianity from a liberal and critical standpoint. A Neo-Kantian, he was to some extent an opponent of Albrecht Ritschl, demanding[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|a connected and consistent theory of the universe, which shall comprehend the entire realm of our experience as a whole. He rejects the doctrine of dualism in a truth, one division of which would be confined to "judgments of value", and be unconnected with our theoretical knowledge of the external world. The possibility of combining the results of our scientific knowledge with the declarations of our ethico-religious experience, so as to form a consistent philosophy, is based, according to Lipsius, upon the unity of the personal ego, which on the one hand knows the world scientifically, and on the other regards it as the means of realizing the ethico-religious object of its life |Otto Pfleiderer.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl][/tpl]
This, in part, is Lipsius's attitude in Philosophie und Religion (1885). In his Lehrbuch der evang.-prot. Dogmatik (1876; 3rd ed., 1893) he deals in detail with the doctrines of "God", "Christ", "Justification" and the "Church".[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]
From 1875 Lipsius assisted K. Hase, O. Pfleiderer andE. Schrader in editing the Jahrbücher für prot. Theologie, and from 1885 until 1891 he edited the Theol. Jahresbericht.[tpl]sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=743[/tpl]
