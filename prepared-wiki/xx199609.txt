Edward Joseph Baecht (born May 15, 1907) was a right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, and St. Louis Browns. 

==Biography==

Baecht was born in Paden, Oklahoma. Baecht made his Major League debut on April 24, 1926.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/baeched01.shtml|title= Ed Baecht|publisher= Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012[/tpl] He was the third-youngest man to appear in a Major League game that season, trailing only Rufus Meadows and Mel Ott.
Baecht posted a 2-0 record and completed his only start in his rookie season, but made his mark primarily as a reliever, a role he fulfilled in 27 games. Despite a high ERA of 6.11, Baecht was given a chance as a starter again in 1927. After allowing six runs in just eight innings of work and taking the loss, Baecht was returned to the minor leagues. He returned in 1928, pitching in 9 games, again with a single starting appearance. His ERA remained high at 6.00, and Baecht was again returned to the minors for further seasoning.
He would not return to the majors until 1931, this time as a member of the Chicago Cubs. There, he enjoyed his finest professional season, sporting a career-low ERA of 3.76 in 22 games, including a career-high six starts and two complete games. Unfortunately, this didn't translate to a lasting job in the majors, as Baecht made just one relief appearance in 1932, firing a scoreless inning.
After another extended absence from the major leagues, Baecht reemerged in 1937 at age 30 with the St. Louis Browns after signing as a free agent on August 11. He appeared in just three games,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/pitchinglogs.php?p=baeched01&y=1937|title= Ed Baecht 1937 Game by Game Pitching Logs |publisher= Baseball Almanac |accessdate=August 31, 2012[/tpl] allowing fifteen runs (nine earned) on thirteen hits, including three home runs. His ERA of 12.79 in 6[tpl]fraction|1|3[/tpl] innings was a career worst. His September 3, 1937 appearance proved to be his last at baseball's highest level.

==Death==

Baecht died on August 15, 1957 in Grafton, Illinois, and is interred in Oak Grove Cemetery in Jerseyville, Illinois.
