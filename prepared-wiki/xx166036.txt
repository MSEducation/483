The nickname 'El Turco' is because he has Syrian and Lebanese ethnicity. Arab Argentines are usually mistakenly called Turks since they came to Argentina with Ottoman documents in the 1900s. After he retired from professional football, he became a manager. He has coached clubs in Argentina, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, and El Salvador. He's been very successful in his era of coaching.
