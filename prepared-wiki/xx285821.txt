===Critical response===

When the film was released in 1947, critic Bosley Crowther, was sly in his negative review, "The moral of Key Witness, which came to the Rialto yesterday, it says, is that 'no man can escape trouble by trying to run away from it.' This wisdom is demonstrated in the adventures of a desperate young man who attempts to get out of one involvement by changing his identityâ€”and runs into others thereby ... There might also be drawn this moral from the evidence presented here: you can't often be sure of entertainment from that which is claimed to be."Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review,  July 30, 1947. Accessed: August 12, 2013.
More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz seemed to enjoy the film. He wrote, "A low-grade film noir that has its chilling moments ... Beaumont went on to be Ward Cleaver in television's Leave It to Beaver, but here he's great to watch as a sleazeball and sicko killer. It's film where it takes a suspension of belief to get through all the problems built into the implausible plot, but nevertheless the film has a certain insanity kicking in that somehow works to give it an edge."Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, April 17, 2005. Accessed: August 12, 2013.
