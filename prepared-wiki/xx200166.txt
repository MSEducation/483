==Major films==

===One More Chance (2007)===

In 2007, Molina worked with John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo for the second time in the film One More Chance (first time was in the film Close to You), released by Star Cinema. It differed from her previous films, becoming her first romantic film to contain such solid drama and a mature feeling. In an interview, she stated "This one's different, though, as it's more of a drama and not really a romantic-comedy. In romantic comedies, we usually follow the formula of the two lovers having a cute meet, then they start fighting each other, but you know that in the end, they will still end up in each other's arms. This time, the film opens showing the lovers ... breaking up right at the start of the story. That's why this is really different from any movie I've done before or any movie John Lloyd and Bea have made in the past."[tpl]cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Direk-Cathy-breaks-away-from-the-mold/artikulo/5467/|title=Direk Cathy breaks away from the mold|publisher=The Philippine Star|author=Mario E.

The board also described their performance as "very good and sensitive."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20071118-101702/%91One_More_Chance%92_gets_a_%91B%92|title=‘One More Chance’ gets a ‘B’|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|author=Marinel Cruz|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] Aside from receiving positive response from film critics, the film did well in the box-office, grossing ₱66,334,614 in its opening weekend.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1102316/business|title=One More Chance - Business|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] It grossed a total of ₱152,791,025 ($3,684,908), becoming the highest-grossing Filipino film of 2007, and the fourth highest-grossing film of 2007 in the Philippines, behind Spider-Man 3, Transformers and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/intl/philippines/yearly/?yr=2007&p=.htm|title=Philippines Yearly Box Office - 2007|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] The film also won Molina the Movie Director of the Year trophy in the 2008 PMPC Star Awards for Movies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1102316/awards|title=One More Chance - Awards|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl]

She described Geronimo as "light and kikay," saying that it was easy to work with her.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/2207/john-lloyd-and-sarah-excited-about-their-movie-quota-very-special-lovequot/1/1|title=John Lloyd and Sarah excited about their movie "A Very Special Love"|publisher=pep.ph|author=Jocelyn Dimaculangan|date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] A Very Special Love was rated A by the CEB, with its comedic and innocent concept in contrast to One More Chance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/article.aspx?articleid=400834|title=A very special premiere in NY |publisher=The Philippine Star|author=Ricky Lo|date=September 16, 2008|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] The film earned ₱58,448,223 at the box-office in its opening weekend.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243381/business|title=A Very Special Love - Business|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] It became a commercial success, grossing a total of ₱179,569,117 ($3,836,701) and becoming the highest-grossing Filipino film of 2008 (second highest-grossing film of 2008 in the Philippines behind Iron Man).[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/intl/philippines/yearly/?yr=2008&p=.htm|title=Philippines Yearly Box Office - 2008|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl] The film later overtook Ang Tanging Ina in terms of revenue, and is currently the fifth highest-grossing Filipino film of all time.

===You Changed My Life (2009)===

In 2009, Star Cinema and VIVA Films released the much-awaited sequel to A Very Special Love, entitled You Changed My Life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/features/infocus/18248/john-lloyd-cruz-sarah-geronimo-tandem-and-their-success-formula|title=John Lloyd Cruz-Sarah Geronimo tandem and their success formula|publisher=pep.ph|author=Karen A. Pagsolingan|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] The film was rushed, since the production companies wanted the sequel to have a Valentine's Day release. The film was directed, still, by Molina, with John Lloyd Cruz and Sarah Geronimo reprising their roles. Rayver Cruz was cast as Mackoy, Laida's high school best friend who later broke away for their group and went to a different college. The story revolves around the growing relationship of Miggy and Laida as a couple. Things get tough when Miggy was assigned to manage his family's business in Laguna far from Laida. Having no time for his girl, Laida finds comfort in Mackoy's arms. Like its prequel, the film was also rated A by the CEB and received positive reviews from movie critics. Karen A. Pagsolingan of Philippine Entertainment Portal stated "I have two words for the movie: Entertaining and engaging!" She described the plot as "flawless," and praised Molina's surprises and "avant garde tactics."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/3459/pep-review-you-changed-my-life-exceeds-expectations|title=PEP REVIEW: "You changed my life"|publisher=pep.ph|author=Karen A.

===Miss You Like Crazy (2010)===

In 2010, Molina's fifth project with John Lloyd Cruz and third with Bea Alonzo, entitled Miss You Like Crazy, was released under Star Cinema. Like One More Chance, the film is a romantic drama with a mature concept. Cruz and Alonzo played the roles of star-crossed lovers, Alan Alvarez and Mia Samonte. Fate throws them chances to be together, but time is not their ally. When they first meet on board the Pasig River Ferry Service, they are instantly attracted to each other. Both of them are from the middle-class and are down-to-earth. As they bond over Divisoria shopping and all-night conversations over coffee, Allan starts to doubt his feelings for his high maintenance fiancée Daphne (portrayed by Maricar Reyes) who happens to be the daughter of his boss. Sooner, Alan and Mia learn that "time is meaningless when you're in love."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/5640/top-reasons-to-love-miss-you-like-crazy|title=Top reasons to love Miss You Like Crazy|publisher=pep.ph|author=Fidel Antonio Medel|date=February 26, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] The film was shot both in the Philippines and Malaysia.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/244798/john-lloyd-bea-reunite-miss-you-like-crazy|title=John Lloyd, Bea reunite via ‘Miss You Like Crazy’|publisher=Manila Bulletin|author=CRISPINA MARTINEZ-BELEN|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] The performance of the cast was praised by critics, but the story was panned film reviewers. Philippine Entertainment Portal stated "Star Cinema's weakness is its inability to produce a realistic ending ... this perfect world only exists in fairy tales. In the real world, the more prevailing concepts are moving on and acceptance." The same opinion was given by Manila Bulletin, saying "A Cathy Molina film always ends happily, although one would probably hope it wouldn’t, for a change, and adhere to a bit of realism ... Another problem was the unexplored subplots."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/245198/mi|title='Miss You Like Crazy': Satisfying fan fodder but...|publisher=Manila Bulletin|author=ROWENA JOY A.
