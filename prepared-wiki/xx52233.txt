==Flag of the Government of Northern Ireland (1953–1972)==

The 'Ulster Banner'[tpl]cite book |last=Groom|first=Nick|title=The Union Jack: the Story of the British Flag |publisher=Atlantic Books|year=2006 |pages=295|isbn=1-84354-336-2[/tpl] is one name that was given to the flag, which may be referred to as 'the flag of Northern Ireland', the 'former Northern Ireland flag', the 'Red Hand Flag' or as the 'Ulster Flag' (not to be confused with the provincial Flag of Ulster). The Ulster Banner was the official flag that was used to represent the Government of Northern Ireland from 1953 to 1973. In common with other British flags, any civic status of the flag was not defined in law.Encyclopaedia Britannica says: 'According to British tradition, a coat of arms or flag is granted to the government of a territory, not to the people residing there. Therefore, when the government of Northern Ireland was disbanded in March 1972, its arms and flag officially disappeared; however, the flag continues to be used by groups (such as sports teams) representing the territory in an unofficial manner in sport.'
In 1924, the Government of Northern Ireland was granted arms (the Coat of arms of Northern Ireland) by Royal Warrant and had the right to display these arms on a flag or banner. This right was exercised for the Coronation in 1953. Between 1953 and 1972, this flag was the arms of the Government of Northern Ireland. When the Parliament of Northern Ireland was dissolved by the British government under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the flag ceased to have official standing but remains the only flag [tpl]As of|2007|alt=to date[/tpl] which represents Northern Ireland at international level in sport.
The flag is based on the flag of EnglandNorthern Ireland (United Kingdom)CAIN: Symbols – Flags Used in Northern Ireland and the flag of the province of Ulster.Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) As with the flag of the province of Ulster, it contains the Red Hand of Ulster at the centre. The points of the star represent the six counties that make up Northern Ireland.

==Official use of flags==

There are various practices for the flying of flags by public bodies in Northern Ireland. The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000 requires that the Union Flag be flown over specified government buildings including Parliament Buildings and state offices on specified 'named days' (honouring, for example Queen Elizabeth II's official birthday).
The regulations also provides that, on the occasion of a visit to a government building by the British Monarch, the Royal Standard shall be flown and the Union Flag can be flown, and on state visits from other heads of state the Union Flag and the national flag of the country of the visitor can be flown. Where two flagpoles exist, the flag of Europe should be flown on Europe Day alongside the Union flag. The regulations prohibit any flags being flown from the relevant buildings except as expressly permitted by the regulations.The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000
Other regulations exist for other public bodies in Northern Ireland. Use of flags by the Police Service of Northern Ireland is governed by the Police Emblems and Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002, which provides that no flag shall be used by the Service other than its own flag.

===Local authorities===

Legislation relating to flag flying does not apply to District Council buildings, and District Councils follow a range of practices varying from flying the Union Flag on a number of council buildings every day of the year as at Lisburn, to flying no flags on any building, flying only the council flag or flying flags on the designated days in the same way as government buildings.Transforming Conflict: Flags and Emblems by Dominic Bryan and Gordon Gillespie, Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University, Belfast, March 2005
In 2004, Belfast City Council commissioned a study on the flying of flags which noted that the Ulster banner was flown alongside the Union flag by a number of local authorities in Northern Ireland. These included Ards Borough Council, Carrickfergus Borough Council and Castlereagh Borough Council.http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/equality/docs/FlyingOfUnionFlagEQIA.pdf

==Displaying flags==

In Northern Ireland, some members from each of the unionist and nationalist communities use flags to declare their political allegiances and to mark territory.Dominic Bryan & Gordon Gillespie (2005) Transforming Conflict: Flags and Emblems, Belfast: Institute of Irish Studies, Queens University Belfast Unionists and loyalists fly the Union Flag and Ulster Banner to show their support for the union and/or their allegiance to Northern Ireland. Irish nationalists and republicans fly the Irish tricolour to show their support for a United Ireland. The Irish tricolour is intended to symbolise peace (represented by the colour white) between Catholics (green) and Protestants (orange).The National Flag, Department of the Taoiseach
In sport, the Ulster Banner is carried by the Northern Ireland team in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. It is also regularly displayed by supporters of the Northern Ireland national football team.

===Peace process===

After the 1998 Belfast Agreement, flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement states that:
Nationalists pointed to this to argue that the use of the Union Flag for official purposes should be restricted, or that the Irish tricolour should be flown alongside the British flag on government buildings. Sinn Féin ministers in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive instructed that the Union Flag was not to fly from buildings operated by their respective departments.Tension over flag flying at BBC News This power was removed from ministers by virtue of the Flag Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000, mentioned above.[tpl]Where|date=May 2013[/tpl]
All signatories to the Belfast Agreement also declare their acceptance of the 'principle of consent' (i.e. that there will be no change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless a majority votes for it), and Unionists argued that this provision amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] The problem was discussed in detail and various proposals made including suggestions for a new flag.Flagging concern: the controversy over flags and emblems

==Saint Patrick's Saltire==

Saint Patrick's Saltire, a red saltire on a white field, was used from 1783 in the badge of the Order of Saint Patrick. After the Acts of Union 1800, the saltire was added to the former flag of the Kingdom of Great Britain to represent Ireland in the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It is sometimes used informally to represent Northern Ireland. In 1986, government policy during state visits to London was to fly the crosses of George, Andrew and Patrick and the Welsh Dragon.HC Deb 22 July 1986 vol 102 c111W The government clarified that the Union Flag was the flag of Northern Ireland, not the Saint Patrick's Saltire or the Ulster Banner.HC Deb 25 July 1986 vol 102 c571W In 2008, David McNarry suggested it should be allowed in Northern Irish number plates analogous to the flags allowed on English, Scottish, and Welsh plates.[ref][tpl]cite news |title=St Patrick's cross 'is NI symbol' |date=16 December 2008 |work=Daily Mirror |page=8 |accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl]
