[[Scandal]]

CATEGORIES: Scandals

A scandal is a widely publicized allegation or set of allegations that damages (or tries to damage) the reputation of an institution, individual or creed.[tpl]Dubious|Talk:Alleged scandals are not scandals|date=January 2010[/tpl] A scandal may be based on true or false allegations or a mixture of both.
From the Greek σκάνδαλον (skandalon), a trap or stumbling-block,A Greek-English Lexicon the metaphor is that wrong conduct can impede or "trip" people's trust or faith.Oxford English Dictionary
Some scandals are broken by whistleblowers who reveal wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the 1970s Watergate scandal. Sometimes an attempt to cover up a possible scandal ignites a greater scandal when the cover-up fails.

In the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, scandals,  particularly political ones, are often referred to by adding the suffix "-gate" to a word connected with the events, recalling the Watergate scandal, such as "Nannygate".
