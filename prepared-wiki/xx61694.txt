The earliest information on the ethnic demographics of Eastern Rumelia, before the first census was conducted, comes from ethnographic maps of the Balkans by Western cartographers. There is however little information on the actual population numbers of the different ethnic groups before 1878. According to a British report before the 1877–1878 war, the non-Muslim population (which were mostly Bulgarians) of Eastern Rumelia, was about 60% which proportion grew due to the flight and emigration of Muslims during and after the war.Studies on Ottoman social and political history: selected articles and essay, Kemal H. Karpat, p.370
The results of the first Regional Assembly elections of 17 October 1879 show a predominantly Bulgarian character: Of the 36 elected deputies, 31 were Bulgarians (86.1%), 3 were Greeks (8.3%) and two were Turks (5.6%).Делев, "Княжество България и Източна Румелия", История и цивилизация за 11. клас. The ethnic statistics from the censuses of 1880 and 1884 show a Bulgarian majority in the province.

The repetition of the census in 1884 returned similar data: 70.0% Bulgarians, 20.6% Turks, 2.8% Roma and 6.7% others.
The Greek inhabitants of Eastern Rumelia were concentrated on the coast, where they were strong in numbers,A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, 1914, p.102 and certain cities in the interior such as  Plovdiv, where they formed a substantial minority. Most of the Greek population of the region was exchanged with Bulgarians from the Greek provinces of Macedonia and Thrace in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and World War I. As of 2001, there are about 3400 Greeks in Bulgaria, and about 4100 Sarakatsani.
Eastern Rumelia was also inhabited by foreign nationals, most notably Austrians, Czechs, Hungarians, French people and Italians.
The ethnic composition of the population of Eastern Rumelia, according to the provincial census taken in 1884, was the following:[tpl]cite web| url = https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=429995&Site=COE | title = 6.1 European population committee (CDPO) | publisher = Council of Europe | page = II.

==Ownership==

Property abandoned by Muslims fleeing the Russian army during the 1877–1878 war was appropriated by the local population. The former owners, mostly large landholders, were threatened with trial by military court if they had committed crimes during the war, so that they would not return. Two Turkish landowners who did return were in fact sentenced to death thus preventing others from desiring to come back. Those Turkish landowners who were not able to take possession of their land were financially compensated, with the funds collected by the Bulgarian peasants, some of whom were indebted as a result. For those who did return a 10% property tax was issued, forcing many to sell off their property in order to pay the tax.Jelavich, p. 164.The Balkans since 1453; Leften Stavros Stavrianos, Traian Stoianovich; p. 442 Michael Palairet claimed that land rights of Muslim owners were largely disregarded despite of being guaranteed by the powers and de-Ottomanization of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia led to the economic decline in the region,Palairet, Michael R.,"The Balkan Economies C.1800-1914: Evolution Without Development", 1997 http://books.google.com/books?id=hkQytxTkZcoC&lpg=PA175&dq=Land%20Ownership%20in%20Eastern%20Rumelia&pg=PA182#v=onepage&q=Land%20Ownership%20in%20Eastern%20Rumelia&f=false pp.174-202 which is contradicted by many other authors, who show rapid growth of the economy as well as rapid industrial development and growth of exports in Bulgaria after 1878.An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, Volume 2; Halil İnalcık, Donald Quataert; 1997; p. 381The Balkans Since 1453; Leften Stavros Stavrianos; 2000; p.425The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA; Mikulas Teich, Roy Porter; 1996; p.300
