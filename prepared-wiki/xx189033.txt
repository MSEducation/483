Bentley, p332, accessed 24 March 2008[/ref] Soon after graduating he was appointed master of Rugeley Grammar School in Staffordshire and he became the vicar of Hope in Derbyshire in 1731.[tpl]CCEd |type=person |id=42313 |name=Budworth, William |yob=1723 |yod=1737 |accessed=2 February 2014 [/tpl] In 1733, on the death of Dr. Hillman he became headmaster at Brewood Grammar School.Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, iii. 332-55, 759, vi. 469, 470 
He obtained the vicarage of Brewood on the presentation of the Dean of Lichfield, and he was presented to the donative chapel of Shareshill, near Brewood, by Sir Edward Littleton, 3rd Baronet, of Pillaton Hall, who entrusted to him the education of his cousin and heir Edward Littleton, his  uncle Fisher's son.Synopsis of the Extinct Baronetage of England, by William Courthope, 1835, p. 123 accessed 28 April 2008 In 1736 he would have engaged the celebrated Samuel Johnson as an assistant in the school, but he was apprehensive about the "strange motion of the head" which Johnson suffered from. Budworth thought this might make him an object of ridicule in the school.Lives Of The English Poets By Henry Francis Cary, p.8, 2004, Kessinger, ISBN 1-4191-3096-X, accessed 25 April 2008 Johnson is thought to have been known to Budworth as Johnson had served as an usher to the headmaster at Market Bosworth whilst Budworth was still there.
One of Budworth's pupils was Richard Hurd, afterwards Bishop of Worcester,[tpl]CCEd |type=bishop |id=633 |name=Hurd, Richard |title=Bishop of Worcester |accessed=2 February 2014 [/tpl] who says "be I possessed every talent of a perfect institutor of youth in a degree which I believe has been rarely found in any of that profession since the days of Quinctilian." Both Richard Hurd and Sir Edward Littleton were on their way to visit him in 1745 when they heard he had died in a "fit of apoplexy". Littleton paid for a memorial at his church in Shareshill.Staffordshire Encyclopedia accessed 28 April 2008
