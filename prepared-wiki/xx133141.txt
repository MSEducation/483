==Story==

The story features a number of innovative themes while maintaining the basic form of a love story. It has particularly strong female characters who are independent-minded and choose their own loves and destiny.  The conflicts are not so much between the wishes of the parents and children about whom to marry, as is a common theme in Indian movies, but it is on the more complex level of the conflicts among the main characters and the duplicitous signals men and women send each other. The movie glorifies the lives of "singing girls" not often regarded highly in Indian society.  Although it is set with Muslim characters, the movie seamlessly shows the universality of sensual love.

==Music==

The song and dance does not occur randomly as is often the case in Indian movies; instead it is an integral part of the story-line, which involves a poet and singer as well as poetry competitions that were once common.
Female singers: Asha Bhonsle, Kamal Barot, Lata Mangeshkar, Sudha Malhotra, Suman Kalyanpur 
Male singers: S. D. Batish, Balbeer, Bande Hasan, Manna Dey, Mohammad Rafi
