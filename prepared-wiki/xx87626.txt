[[Mana ERG]]

CATEGORIES: Electronica

Mana ERG is the musical project of ex recording engineer and multi-instrumentalist Bruno De Angelis. Born in Rome and grown up in London, he gained experience by recording and producing bands playing very different genres. This had a direct influence on his music, a genre-defying blend of industrial, ethereal, ebm, electronica, and rock elements.
Bruno's closest collaborators, who also assist him in the production, are Joe Erber (piano and keyboards) and Tiberio (guitars), but quite often they are joined by special guests such as soprano Deborah Roberts, who, with her crystal clear and yet warm vocals, adds an ethereal and dream-like touch to the sound. Other notable friends and collaborators are sound manipulator Antonym, Russian composer Artemiy Artemiev, Dieter Moebius, and Attrition's mastermind Martin Bowes.
