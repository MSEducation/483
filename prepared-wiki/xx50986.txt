The Death Valley pupfish (Cyprinodon salinus salinus), is found in Death Valley National Park.

==Description==

The Death Valley pupfish is a species of fish that is the last known survivor of what is thought to have been a large ecosystem of fish species that lived in Lake Manly, which dried up at the end of the last ice age leaving the present day Death Valley in California.  
The pupfish is adapted to the shallow, hot, saline water of a particular part of Salt Creek that flows above ground year-round, and is also sometimes referred to as Salt Creek pupfish.
A subspecies (Cyprinodon salinus milleri) lives in nearby Cottonball Marsh. They are both IUCN Red List endangered species.
