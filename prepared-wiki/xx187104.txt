==History==

Allied Pickfords Australia began life as a family-owned moving company named Downard Transport, established in 1926. In 1982, the British-based movers, Pickfords, bought the company to form Downard Pickfords.

In 1991, as part of a global rebranding exercise, Downard Pickfords became Allied Pickfords. In 1996, Pickfords (including the subsidiary Allied Pickfords in Australia) was sold to Allied Van Lines in a deal worth $400 million."http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/09/15/cnpik15.html" In 1999, Allied Van Lines and North American Van Lines merged and in 2002, the merged entity became known as SIRVA."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Van_Lines"
