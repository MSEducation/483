For centuries, the husbandry of Herdwick sheep has been a large factor in shaping the culture and terrain of the Lake District. Topographically, grazing by sheep continues to keep the hillsides of fells largely treeless, and the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the valleys were built to protect grazing land and to confine livestock. Linguistically, many words of Lakeland speech relate to sheep husbandry.  The ancient Yan Tan Tethera counting system for sheep is a survival of Brittonic counting systems.[tpl]cite book | last = Brown | first = Jules | title = The Rough Guide to the Lake District | publisher = Rough Guides | year = 2002| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=FGAdAyitVvIC&dq=Herdwick+sheep | isbn = 1-85828-894-0[/tpl] 

====Beatrix Potter====

In the latter half of her life, the children's author Beatrix Potter was involved with keeping and breeding Herdwicks, even acting as president of the breed association for a time. Between 1930 and 1938 she won a number of prizes for Herdwick ewes at shows across Cumbria.[tpl]cite book | last = Denyer | first = Susan | title = Beatrix Potter: At Home in the Lake District | publisher = frances lincoln ltd. | year = 2004| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=eci3pND1iTgC&dq=Herdwick | isbn = 0-7112-2381-5[/tpl] pg. 124 Upon her death in 1943, she bequeathed fifteen farms – approximately a total sum of 4,000 acres (16 km²) - to the National Trust, and per her instructions all continue to graze Herdwick flocks.

===Modern history===

In the modern era, the main industry of the Lake District has shifted from agriculture to tourism. The subsequent influx of tourists to the District has at times conflicted with traditional life, including the raising of Herdwicks. One Lake District farmer summed the problem up as, "We get 100,000 visitors across our land every year...If just one in a thousand forgets to shut a gate or can't be bothered, that's a hundred times we have to go out and round up our sheep."   
In the late 20th century, the keeping of Herdwicks became economically inviable without outside support; open market prices for Herdwick fleeces sometimes drop as low as a penny a kilogram (which is about the weight of wool from a single sheep). Without direct monetary guarantees for wool prices from the National Trust, it actually costs farmers a considerably larger amount of money to shear their Herdwicks than they would receive in compensation; the majority of farmers once burned their fleeces as waste products.[tpl]cite book |title = The secret to farming carpets | publisher = National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty | url =http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-food_farming/w-food_farming-hill_farmers/w-food_farming-herdwick_carpets.htm | isbn = 1-85828-894-0[/tpl] The Trust now acts as a wool merchant itself, thus being able to bargain for better prices directly with the British Wool Marketing Board and operate a Herdwick wool trademark.  Most farmers survive through the sale of lambs, as well as both National Trust and European Union farm subsidies. Lake District farmers in particular receive subsidies for operating in a designated Less Favored Area from the England Rural Development Programme. Those who agree to maintain their land in accordance with sustainable farming practices also receive additional subsidies. 
95% of all 50,000 or so Herdwicks live within 14 miles of Coniston, Cumbria,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article5860239.ece |title=Butchers urged to sell meat from rare British sheep  |date=March 7, 2009 |work=The Times |last=Elliot |first=Valerie  | location=London[/tpl] and this makes them particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 led to the destruction of many flocks, and to fears for the survival both of the breed and of the typical Lakeland sheep farming industry.[tpl]cite news | title = UK begins mass animal burial | work = CNN  | date = March 26, 2001 | url =http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/03/26/foot.and.mouth/index.html | accessdate = 2007-10-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071029040031/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/03/26/foot.and.mouth/index.html |archivedate = October 29, 2007[/tpl] Of the estimated 100,000 Herdwick sheep present before the outbreak, a full 25% were lost. They were not easily replaceable because long-standing herds are hefted so the introduction of new stock to the fells would have required extensive fencing. The call for vaccination rather than culling to preserve what is considered a part of the traditional identity of the fells and moors was led by parties – such as the Duke of Westminster, Earl Peel, Lord Barnard and Lord Lonsdale – who wished to save the hill sheep on their lands. Many Lake District residents saw the breed as an indispensable icon of the region. Longtime resident and writer for The Guardian A. Harry Griffin expressed this feeling:  There are other mountain sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep most likely to be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland. 
 If they and their shepherds go, that is the end of the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life.[tpl]cite news | title = If they go, it is the end of Lakeland | work = The Guardian  | date =  April 11, 2001 | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471588,00.html |accessdate =2007-11-02 | location=London[/tpl]  The destruction of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again heafing (the local term for hefting) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behavior had be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/eng/arca/dettaglio.lasso?cod=630&prs= |title= Ark of Taste|accessdate=2007-10-31 |publisher= Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was set up to "reassess the position and circumstances" in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place.[tpl]cite web | title = Herdwick Sheep Breeders' News | publisher = Herdwick Sheep Breeders Association | url = http://www.herdwick-sheep.com/herdwick_news.html | accessdate = 2007-10-31[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Jopson | first = Earnest | title =  Quite a show...even without sheep | work = Whitehaven News | date = 2007-10-18 | url =http://www.whitehaven-news.co.uk/unknown/viewarticle.aspx?c=397&id=554309 | accessdate = 2007-10-31  [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] thumb|right|Herdwicks grazing in Cumbria

==Characteristics==

Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, producing strongly flavoured lamb and mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed is one of the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres).[ref]
