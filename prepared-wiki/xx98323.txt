Buje ([tpl]lang-it|Buie[/tpl]) is a town situated in Istria, Croatia's westernmost peninsula.
Buje was known as the "sentinel of Istria" for its hilltop site located [tpl]convert|10|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] inland from the Adriatic sea. It still commands an excellent panorama.  Buje has a rich history; traces of life in the region date back to prehistoric times. The town developed from a Roman and Venetian settlement into a medieval town. Buje has been part of the Venetian republic from 1358 until 1797 and has been an Italian city from 1918 to 1945. Today it is a modern regional center. Despite its development Buje has retained many features typical of various historical periods. With its narrow streets and a central square, the old town is a fine example of medieval architecture with strong Venetian influences as the rest of the region.

==Overview==

A baroque church from the 16th century, built on the foundations of a Roman temple dominates the square. The old city was protected with stone fortifications, part of which have been preserved to modern times. Being situated on a hill, the old town offers exquisite views on the surrounding scenery, dominated by Mediterranean vegetation, vineyards and olive groves.
Outside of the old town a modern city has sprung. After World War II Buje developed into an industrial, cultural and economic center of the region. To its visitors today, Buje offers a blend of gentle Mediterranean climate, good food and a quiet setting, away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristic Istrian coastal resorts.
