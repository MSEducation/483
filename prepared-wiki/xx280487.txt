C Restaurant is a revolving restaurant at Level 33 of St Martins Tower in Perth, Western Australia.  It is presently the only revolving restaurant in Perth,  and has been described by The Sunday Telegraph of London as offering "... breathtaking views of the Swan River, the flat expanse of the suburbs and the dry hills 25 miles kilometres beyond." 

==History==

C Restaurant is the second restaurant to be located at the top of St Martins Tower.  The first, Hilite 33, was opened in 1978, and completed one revolution every 90 minutes.  Its staff included a young Shane Osborn, who was later the head chef at Pied Ã  Terre in London.  In 2000, Hilite 33's founder and owner, Alain Kuhl, sold the business and lease for just under $700,000.
The new owner, Phil Clements, renamed the business, and relaunched it on Australia Day, 26 January 2001.  Although Clements later claimed that C Restaurant offered "fun dining rather than fine dining", he also aimed to establish a national reputation.  Within less than 12 months, C Restaurant had become "all the rage", and had won the Gold Plate award for fine and occasional dining.  Soon afterwards, it was the place where, on 23 March 2002, England cricketer Ben Hollioake attended a dinner with his family before dying in a car accident on the way home.
In August 2006, Clements sold the business to two of its waiters, Olivier Letrone and Jerome Guesdon.  They revamped the menu, and instituted a two course minimum order, to deter casually dressed sightseers from ordering a coffee and lingering to admire the view.  In recent years, some of the glamour of C Restaurant's early years has dissipated, but one reviewer has nevertheless commented that the views and the ambience still "... make this a fine place to watch the world go round."  In 2011, another reviewer even wrote that "... C reminds me a little of the hotel bar in Lost in Translation; full of romantics and tourists and slightly kitsch - but mostly good fun."
[tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], C Restaurant was not listed in, nor rated by, The West Australian Good Food Guide.
