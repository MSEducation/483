==History==

Lourdes Hill College traces its origins to 1915, when the Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, invited the Order of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan to establish schools in Brisbane. Subsequently, that same year, thirteen Sisters travelled from Sydney opening convents at Bulimba and Coorparoo.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lhc.qld.edu.au/history.htm |title=History & Heritage |accessdate=31 January 2008|year =2006 |work=History |publisher=Lourdes Hill College |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830022639/http://www.lhc.qld.edu.au/history.htm  |archivedate = 30 August 2007[/tpl]
Archbishop Duhig offered the sisters one of the choicest sites in Brisbane for a convent and a secondary girls' school. Lourdes Hill College was established in January 1916, with Mother Berchmans and thirteen sisters sailing up the river on the ship "Osterley" and docking at the site.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.goodsams.org.au/spirituality/reflections/pastreflections00.htm|title= Address: 90 Years of Lourdes Hill College|accessdate=31 January 2008|last= Condon|first= Clare|date=21 July 2006|format= PDF|work= Spirituality|publisher= Sister of the Good Samaritan |pages= 1 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080101035722/http://www.goodsams.org.au/spirituality/reflections/pastreflections00.htm  |archivedate = 1 January 2008[/tpl]
The College was named after Lourdes in France, where Mary is said to have appeared to a young girl named Bernadette Soubirous. When the Good Samaritan Sisters were setting up the school, Archbishop Duhig commented that the site reminded him of Lourdes.
