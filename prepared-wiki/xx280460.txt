David J. Pine is an  American physicist who has made contributions in the field of soft matter physics, including studies on colloids, polymers, surfactant systems, and granular materials.  
A professor of physics and the director of the Center for Soft Matter Research at New York University, Pine is one of the original developers of diffusing-wave spectroscopy,D. Pine, D. Weitz, P. Chaikin, and E. Herbolzheimer, “Diffusing-wave spectroscopy,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 1134–1137 (1988). an optical technique that has proven useful to study colloid systems. Pine also has a longstanding interest in colloidal self-assembly and in the development of a broad range of colloids for these purposes, including colloidal templating,A. Imhof and D. J. Pine, “Ordered Macroporous Materials by Emulsion Templating,” Nature 389, 948–951 (1997). colloidal clusters,V. N. Manoharan, M. T. Elsesser and D. J. Pine, “Dense packing and symmetry in small clusters of microspheres,” Science 301, 483–487 (2003). lock-and-key colloids,S. Sacanna, W. T. M. Irvine, P. M. Chaikin, and D. J. Pine, “Lock and key colloids,” Nature 464, 575–578 (2010). and patchy colloids with valence.Y. Wang, Y. Wang, D. R. Breed, V. N. Manoharan, L. Feng, A. D. Hollingsworth, M. Weck and D. J. Pine, “Colloids with valence and specific directional bonding,” Nature 491, 51–55 (2012).
Pine has published over 100 articles and has received numerous fellowships and honors. In 2000, his work was recognized with the Society of Rheology Publication of the Year Award. He was a Guggenheim Fellow (1999-2000) and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2000) and a Fellow of the American Physical Society (1997). 
Prior to working at NYU, Pine was professor in the Chemical Engineering Department and the Materials Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) for 10 years; he served as chair of the Chemical Engineering Department from 2001 to 2004. He also worked as a research scientist at Exxon Corporate Research in Annandale, NJ and previously was on the physics faculty at Haverford College near Philadelphia. 
Pine received his B.S. in Physics and Mathematics in 1975 from Wheaton College, and his Ph.D. in Physics in 1982 at Cornell University.
