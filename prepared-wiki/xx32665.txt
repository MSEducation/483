[[Naglfari]]

CATEGORIES: Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, Naglfari is the father of Auðr by the personified night, Nótt. Naglfar is attested in a single mention in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) book Gylfaginning, where he is described as one of a series of three husbands of Nótt, and that the couple produced a son, Auðr.Faulkes (1995:13—14). No additional information is provided about Naglfari.Lindow (2001:235).
Rudolf Simek theorizes that Snorri invented Naglfari but states that his reason for doing so is unknown.Simek (2007:226).
