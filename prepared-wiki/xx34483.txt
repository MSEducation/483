Sammo Hung (born January 7, 1952), also known as Hung Kam-bo (洪金寶), is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, film producer and director, known for his work in many martial arts films and Hong Kong action cinema. He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo.
Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew.
In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as "Dai Goh" ([tpl]zh|t=大哥|p=dà gē[/tpl]), meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as "Dai Goh", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu "brothers", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname "Dai Goh Dai" ([tpl]zh|t=大哥大|p=dà gē dà|j=daai6 go1 daai6[/tpl]), meaning, Big, Big Brother, or Biggest Big Brother.[tpl]cite web|title = Martial Arts Movies and TV Series - Wu Jing|work = Big, Big Brother Sammo Hung|publisher = Wu Jing.org|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/News/M02/2002-02-BigBigBrother_Sammo_Hung.php|accessdate = 2008-01-31 [/tpl]
