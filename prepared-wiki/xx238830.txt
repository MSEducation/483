Saint Bernard's Seminary is a historic Roman Catholic seminary complex located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York.  It is a group of four interconnected buildings designed by noted Rochester architect Andrew Jackson Warner and built between 1891 and 1908.  The four buildings are the Center or Main Building (1891–1893), the Chapel (1891–1893), the South Building or Philosophy Hall (1900), and the North Building or Theology Hall (1908).  All four buildings use Medina Sandstone in their construction and share a Victorian Gothic style of architecture with stone walls and brick trim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4297|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Saint Bernard's Seminary|date=September 1995|accessdate=2009-10-01 |author=Elizabeth A.
