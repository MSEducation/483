[[Coronal mass ejection]]

CATEGORIES: Solar phenomena, Stellar phenomena

A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space.[tpl]cite web |url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme.html |title=Coronal Mass Ejections |work=NASA.gov |first=Eric R. |last=Christian |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]
Coronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, most notably solar flares, but a causal relationship has not been established. Most ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares. Near solar maxima, the Sun produces about three CMEs every day, whereas near solar minima, there is about one CME every five days.[tpl]cite web|title=Coronal Mass Ejections|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center @ NASA|author=Nicky Fox|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/nicky/cme-chase.html|accessdate=2011-04-06[/tpl]

==Description==

Coronal mass ejections release huge quantities of matter and electromagnetic radiation into space above the sun's surface, either near the corona (sometimes called a solar prominence), or farther into the planet system, or beyond (interplanetary CME). The ejected material is a plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons, but may contain small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and even iron. The theory of heavier element emissions during a CME is speculative information and requires further verification. It is highly unlikely that a CME contains any substantial amount of heavier elements, especially considering that the sun has not yet arrived at the point of helium flash and thus cannot begin to fuse elements heavier than helium.
Coronal mass ejections are associated with enormous changes and disturbances in the coronal magnetic field. They are usually observed with a white-light coronagraph.

Recent scientific research[tpl]cite web|title=Coronal Mass Ejections: Scientists Unlock the Secrets of Exploding Plasma Clouds On the Sun|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101108071925.htm|publisher=Science Daily[/tpl]http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast27mar_1/ NASA Science has shown that the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection is responsible for CME and solar flares. Magnetic reconnection is the name given to the rearrangement of magnetic field lines when two oppositely directed magnetic fields are brought together. This rearrangement is accompanied with a sudden release of energy stored in the original oppositely directed fields.
On the sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades—a series of closely occurring loops of magnetic lines of force. These lines of force quickly reconnect into a low arcade of loops, leaving a helix of magnetic field unconnected to the rest of the arcade. The sudden release of energy in this reconnection causes the solar flare. The unconnected magnetic helical field and the material that it contains may violently expand outwards forming a CME."The Mysterious Origins of Solar Flares", Scientific American, April 2006 This also explains why CMEs and solar flares typically erupt from what are known as the active regions on the sun where magnetic fields are much stronger on average.

==Impact on Earth==

When the ejection is directed towards Earth and reaches it as an interplanetary CME (ICME), the shock wave of the traveling mass of solar energetic particles causes a geomagnetic storm that may disrupt Earth's magnetosphere, compressing it on the day side and extending the night-side magnetic tail. When the magnetosphere reconnects on the nightside, it releases power on the order of terawatt scale, which is directed back toward Earth's upper atmosphere.
Solar energetic particles can cause particularly strong aurorae in large regions around Earth's magnetic poles. These are also known as the Northern Lights (aurora borealis) in the northern hemisphere, and the Southern Lights (aurora australis) in the southern hemisphere. Coronal mass ejections, along with solar flares of other origin, can disrupt radio transmissions and cause damage to satellites and electrical transmission line facilities, resulting in potentially massive and long-lasting power outages.[tpl]cite book|title=Severe Space Weather Events – Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts: A Workshop Report |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12507|author=Baker, Daniel N., et al.|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-309-12769-1|page=77|quote=These assessments indicate that severe geomagnetic storms pose a risk for long-term outages to major portions of the North American grid. John Kappenman remarked that the analysis shows "not only the potential for large-scale blackouts but, more troubling, ... the potential for permanent damage that could lead to extraordinarily long restoration times."[/tpl]Wired world is increasingly vulnerable to coronal ejections from the Sun, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 14 January 2013 issue, pp. 49–50: "But the most serious potential for damage rests with the transformers that maintain the proper voltage for efficient transmission of electricity through the grid."
Humans at high altitudes, as in airplanes or space stations, risk exposure to relatively intense cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are potentially lethal in high quantities. The energy absorbed by astronauts is not reduced by a typical spacecraft shield design and, if any protection is provided, it would result from changes in the microscopic inhomogeneity of the energy absorption events.Wilson, J. W.; Wood, J. S.; Shinn, J. L.; Cucinotta, F. A.;  Nealy, J. E. A proposed performance index for galactic  cosmic ray shielding, materials. Washington, DC: NASA;  Report No. TM-4444; 1993a

==Physical properties==

A typical coronal mass ejection may have any or all of three distinctive features: a cavity of low electron density, a dense core (the prominence, which appears as a bright region on coronagraph images embedded in this cavity), and a bright leading edge.
Most ejections originate from active regions on the Sun's surface, such  as groupings of sunspots associated with frequent flares. These regions have closed magnetic field lines, in which the magnetic field strength is large enough to contain the plasma. These field lines must be broken or weakened for the ejection to escape from the sun. However, CMEs may also be initiated in quiet surface regions, although in many cases the quiet region was recently active. During solar minimum, CMEs form primarily in the coronal streamer belt near the solar magnetic equator. During solar maximum, they originate from active regions whose latitudinal distribution is more homogeneous.
Coronal mass ejections reach velocities between [tpl]gaps|20|km/s[/tpl] to [tpl]gaps|3200|km/s[/tpl] with an average speed of [tpl]gaps|489|km/s[/tpl], based on SOHO/LASCO measurements between 1996 and 2003. The average mass is [tpl]gaps|1.6|×|1012|kg[/tpl]. The values are only lower limits, because coronagraph measurements provide only two-dimensional data analysis. The frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the solar cycle: from about one every fifth day near the solar minimum to 3.5 per day near the solar maximum.[tpl]cite book|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|last=Carroll|first=Bradley W.|coauthor=Dale A. Ostlie|year=2007|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8053-0402-9|page=390[/tpl] These values are also lower limits because ejections propagating away from Earth (backside CMEs) can usually not be detected by coronagraphs.
Current knowledge of coronal mass ejection kinematics indicates that the ejection starts with an initial pre-acceleration phase characterized by a slow rising motion, followed by a period of rapid acceleration away from the Sun until a near-constant velocity is reached. Some balloon CMEs, usually the slowest ones, lack this three-stage evolution, instead accelerating slowly and continuously throughout their flight. Even for CMEs with a well-defined acceleration stage, the pre-acceleration stage is often absent, or perhaps unobservable.

==Association with other solar phenomena==

Coronal mass ejections are often associated with other forms of solar activity, most notably:
The association of a CME with some of those phenomena is common but not fully understood. For example, CMEs and flares are normally closely related, but there was confusion about this point caused by the events originating beyond the limb. For such events no flare could be detected. Most weak flares do not have associated CMEs; most powerful ones do. Some CMEs occur without any flare-like manifestation, but these are the weaker and slower ones.Andrews, M. D., A search for CMEs associated with big flares, in Solar Physics, 218, pp. 261–279, 2003 It is now thought that CMEs and associated flares are caused by a common event (the CME peak acceleration and the flare impulsive phase generally coincide). In general, all of these events (including the CME) are thought to be the result of a large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field; the presence or absence of a CME during one of these restructures would reflect the coronal environment of the process (i.e., can the eruption be confined by overlying magnetic structure, or will it simply break through and enter the solar wind).

==Theoretical models==

It was first postulated that CMEs might be driven by the heat of an explosive flare. However, it soon became apparent that many CMEs were not associated with flares, and that even those that were often started before the flare. Because CMEs are initiated in the solar corona (which is dominated by magnetic energy), their energy source must be magnetic.
Because the energy of CMEs is so high, it is unlikely that their energy could be directly driven by emerging magnetic fields in the photosphere (although this is still a possibility). Therefore, most models of CMEs assume that the energy is stored up in the coronal magnetic field over a long period of time and then suddenly released by some instability or a loss of equilibrium in the field. There is still no consensus on which of these release mechanisms is correct, and observations are not currently able to constrain these models very well.

==Interplanetary CMEs==

CMEs typically reach Earth one to five days after leaving the Sun. During their propagation, CMEs interact with the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). As a consequence, slow CMEs are accelerated toward the speed of the solar wind and fast CMEs are decelerated toward the speed of the solar wind. Fast CMEs (faster than about 500 km s−1) eventually drive a shock wave. This happens when the speed of the CME in the frame of reference moving with the solar wind is faster than the local fast magnetosonic speed. Such shocks have been observed directly by coronagraphsVourlidas, A., Wu, S.T., Wang, A. H., Subramanian, P., Howard, R. A.

They are thought to form sometimes as low as 2 Rs (solar radii). They are also closely linked with the acceleration of solar energetic particles.Manchester, W. B., IV, T. I. Gombosi, D. L.

===NASA mission Wind===

On 1 November 1994, NASA launched the WIND spacecraft as a solar wind monitor to orbit Earth's [tpl]L1[/tpl] Lagrange point as the interplanetary component of the Global Geospace Science (GGS) Program within the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program. The spacecraft is a spin axis-stabilized satellite that carries eight instruments measuring solar wind particles from thermal to >MeV energies, electromagnetic radiation from DC to 13 MHz radio waves, and gamma-rays. Though the WIND spacecraft is nearly two decades old, it still provides the highest time, angular, and energy resolution of any of the solar wind monitors. It continues to produce relevant research as its data has contributed to over 150 publications since 2008 alone.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===NASA mission STEREO===

On 25 October 2006, NASA launched STEREO, two near-identical spacecraft which from widely separated points in their orbits are able to produce the first stereoscopic images of CMEs and other solar activity measurements. The spacecraft orbit the Sun at distances similar to that of Earth, with one slightly ahead of Earth and the other trailing. Their separation gradually increased so that after four years they were almost diametrically opposite each other in orbit.Spacecraft go to film Sun in 3D BBC news, 2006-10-26http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html NASA Mission Page, STEREO

==History==

===First traces===

The largest recorded geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare on 1 September 1859, and is now referred to as the Carrington Event, or the solar storm of 1859. The flare and the associated sunspots were visible to the naked eye (both as the flare itself appearing on a projection of the sun on a screen and as an aggregate brightening of the solar disc), and the flare was independently observed by English astronomers R. C. Carrington and R. Hodgson. The geomagnetic storm was observed with the recording magnetograph at Kew Gardens. The same instrument recorded a crochet, an instantaneous perturbation of Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays by Röntgen and the recognition of the ionosphere by Kennelly and Heaviside. The storm took down parts of the recently created US telegraph network, starting fires and shocking some telegraph operators.AW & ST, Wired world . .

===First clear detections===

The first detection of a CME as such was made on 14 December 1971, by R. Tousey (1973) of the Naval Research Laboratory using the seventh Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-7).R.A. Howard, A Historical Perspective on Coronal Mass Ejections The discovery image (256 × 256 pixels) was collected on a Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) vidicon tube, transferred to the instrument computer after being digitized to 7 bits. Then it was compressed using a simple run-length encoding scheme and sent down to the ground at 200 bit/s. A full, uncompressed image would take 44 minutes to send down to the ground. The telemetry was sent to ground support equipment (GSE) which built up the image onto Polaroid print. David Roberts, an electronics technician working for NRL who had been responsible for the testing of the SEC-vidicon camera, was in charge of day-to-day operations. He thought that his camera had failed because certain areas of the image were much brighter than normal. But on the next image the bright area had moved away from the Sun and he immediately recognized this as being unusual and took it to his supervisor, Dr. Guenter Brueckner,Obit with brief bio for Dr. Brueckner and then to the solar physics branch head, Dr. Tousey. Earlier observations of coronal transients or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing.

===Recent events===

On 1 August 2010, during solar cycle 24, scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) observed a series of four large CMEs emanating from the Earth-facing hemisphere of the Sun. The initial CME was generated by an eruption on 1 August that was associated with sunspot 1092, which was large enough to be seen without the aid of a solar telescope. The event produced significant aurorae on Earth three days later.
On 31 August 2012 a CME connected with Earth's magnetic environment, or magnetosphere, with a glancing blow causing aurora to appear on the night of 3 September.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/News090412-filament.html|title=NASA's SDO Sees Massive Filament Erupt on Sun|date=4 September 2012|publisher=NASA|accessdate=11 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/goto?11095|title=August 31, 2012 Magnificent CME|date=31 August 2012|publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=11 September 2012[/tpl] Geomagnetic storming reached the G2 (Kp=6) level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/alerts/archive/archive_01Sep2012.html|title=Space Weather Alerts and Warnings Timeline: September 1–16, 2012 (archive)|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=24 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date=6 September 2012|url=http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/2012/09/06/geomagnetic-storming-levels-back-to-normal/|title=Geomagnetic storming levels back to normal|author=Chillymanjaro|publisher=The Watchers|accessdate=11 September 2012[/tpl]
