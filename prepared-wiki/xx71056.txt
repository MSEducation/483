One Ninety One Peachtree Tower is a [tpl]convert|235|m|abbr=on[/tpl] 50-story skyscraper in Atlanta, Georgia. Designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects and Kendall/Heaton Associates Inc, the building was completed in 1990 and is the fourth tallest in the city, winning the BOMA Building of the Year Awards the next year, repeating in 1998 and 2003. Throughout the 1990s 191 Peachtree was considered Atlanta's premier business address.  However when two of its largest tenants, law firm King & Spalding, and Wachovia moved to Midtown's new 1180 Peachtree and Atlantic Station respectively in 2006, most of the building was left vacant. That same year, Cousins Properties purchased the building from Equity Office Properties, which marked a return to 191 for the company as it helped originally develop the building.  Cousins relocated their headquarters to the building,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2007/02/05/daily8.html |title=Cousins posts $232 million in annual net income |work=The Atlanta Business Chronicle |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] signed a number of small tenants to subdivided space and in January 2008, signed an agreement with Deloitte to extend and expand the consulting firm's current lease from [tpl]convert|100000|to|260000|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] bringing the building back to 87 percent occupancy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/01/14/daily49.html?jst=b_ln_hl |title=Deloitte grows at One Ninety One Peachtree |work=The Atlanta Business Chronicle |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl]
In the Spring of 2010, Atlanta's historic Commerce Club located in Five Points merged with the One Ninety One Club located on the fourth floor of 191 Peachtree Tower. The new Commerce Club opened November 6, 2010, on the 49th floor of One Ninety One Peachtree Tower.  The space had formerly been occupied by King & Spalding law firm and underwent a $7 million renovation resulting in a world class space for the Commerce Club with spectacular 360-degree views of Atlanta's skyline and impressive high-tech amenities.  The Commerce Club features the Lane Ballroom with a 200-guest capacity, a multimedia room with a 103-inch flat-screen television and seven state-of-the-art private meeting rooms. It also offers a wine room with availability to secure personalized wine lockers and convenient Touchdown Rooms designed as office-away-from-office spaces.  The Commerce Club atop One Ninety One Peachtree Tower is managed by Dallas-based ClubCorp.
The building is located on the former site of the Hotel Majestic, which in the early 20th century was one of the city's major hotels.Atlanta and Its Builders: A Comprehensive History of the Gate City, Volume 2, Thomas H. Martin, pp. 106-107

==Design==

The building was originally proposed in July 1987 at 48 floors. The building's facade is made of flame finished Rosa Dante granite and the windows are made of gray tinted glass.  Each "tower" possesses a rooftop crown that is illuminated at night. The lighted double crown figured prominently in night footage taken by helicopter during the 1996 Olympics. The primary entrance to the building is through a soaring 102-foot (7 stories / 31 m) tall atrium adjacent to Peachtree Street in Downtown Atlanta.
