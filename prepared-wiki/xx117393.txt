The The East Texas Arboretum & Botanical Society "ETABS"  The Arboretum is open to the public and everyone is invited to enjoy this beautiful oasis. So come on out and experience the unique beauty, learn about the ecological importance of America's native flora and enjoy 2 miles of naturalistic hiking trails, live (enclosed) honeybees and our Historic Wofford House Museum.  The Arboretum is dedicated to the preservation of the natural environment and the creation of formal and informal plant collections arranged in formal and informal gardens and a native plant area with nature trails.
One hundred acres of wooded beauty, trees, flowers, and wildlife await your discovery at the East Texas Arboretum.  The forest appears to come alive as you meander along two miles of woodland trails. Camouflaged frogs, insects, and even deer often scurry away as you pass. Make your way along winding, spring-fed streams connected by a 115-foot suspension bridge.
Experience life in early Henderson County at the historic Wofford House Museum. Built in 1850, the home was relocated to the Arboretum several years ago. It now stands as a reminder of early pioneer days complete with period furnishings, memorabilia, and a seasonal garden.  
The Arboretum is available to host reunions, meetings, retreats, weddings, receptions, and picnics.
