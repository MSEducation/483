[tpl]cquote|America's libraries are the fruits of a great democracy. They exist because we believe that memory and truth are important. They exist because we believe that information and knowledge are not the exclusive domain of a certain type or class of person, but rather the province of all who seek to learn. A democratic society holds these institutions in high regard.[tpl]cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/06/20020604-12.html |title=Opening Remarks by Mrs. Bush at the White House Conference on School Libraries |publisher=The White House |date=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=2009-05-08[/tpl]|20px|20px|Dr. Robert S.
