 The alternative life experiences explored by the Situationists were the construction of situations, [[unitary urbanism]], [[psychogeography]], and the union of play, freedom and critical thinking.<ref name="PoliOntheReport">Debord harshly denounced the degradation in the quality of life under capitalism, also in his 1957 ''Report''.

A major stance of the SI was to count on the force of a revolutionary proletariat. This stance was reaffirmed very clearly in a discussion on “To what extent is the SI a political movement?”, during the Fourth SI Conference in London. The SI remarked that this is a core Situationist principle, and that those that don't understand it and agree with it, are not Situationist. Reactionary forces always try to hinder the still topical power of the working class. It was not by chance that May '68, whose main feature was the largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced industrial countryThe Beginning of an Era, from Situationist International No 12 (September 1969). Translated by Ken Knabb. and the first wildcat general strike in history, was instead depicted by most media outlets as "student protests". That was precisely to mystify the still very topical role of a revolutionary proletariat.

===Art and politics===

The SI rejected all art that separated itself from politics, the concept of 20th century art that is separated from topical political events.(1963) The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb. The SI believed that the notion of artistic expression being separated from politics and current events is one proliferated by reactionary considerations to render artwork that expresses comprehensive critiques of society impotent. They recognized there was a precise mechanism followed by reactionaries to defuse the role of subversive artists and intellectuals, that is, to reframe them as separated from the most topical events, and divert from them the taste for the new that may dangerously appeal the masses; after such separation, such artworks are sterilized, banalized, degraded, and can be safely integrated into the official culture and the public discourse, where they can add new flavors to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle.
According to this theory, artists and intellectuals that accept such compromises are rewarded by the art dealers and praised by the dominant culture. The SI received many offers to sponsor “creations” that would just have a "situationist" label but a diluted political content, that would have brought things back to order and the SI back into the old fold of artistic praxis. The majority of SI continued to refuse such offers and any involvement on the conventional avant-garde artistic plane. This principle was affirmed since the founding of the SI in 1957, but the qualitative step of resolving all the contradictions of having situationists that make concessions to the cultural market, was made with the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR in 1962.
The SI noted how reactionary forces forbid subversive ideas from artists and intellectuals to reach the public discourse, and how they attack the artworks that express comprehensive critique of society, by saying that art should not involve itself into politics.

===The construction of situations===

The first edition of Internationale Situationniste defines the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events."
As the SI embraced dialectical Marxism, the situation came to refer less to a specific avant-garde practice than to the dialectical unification of art and life more generally. Beyond this theoretical definition, the situation as a practical manifestation thus slipped between a series of proposals. The SI thus were first led to distinguish the situation from the mere artistic practice of the happening, and later identified it in historical events such as the Paris Commune in which it exhibited itself as the revolutionary moment.

===Psychogeography===

The first edition of Internationale Situationniste defined psychogeography as "the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals." The term was first recognized in 1955 by Guy Debord while still with the Letterist International:

====Dérive====

By definition, psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies. Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").
In the SI's 6th issue, Raoul Vaneigem writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops—the geometry".Gray, Christopher, editor, Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International, London: Rebel P, 1998. p. 26. Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".McDonough, Tom, ed. Guy Debord and the Situationist International: Texts and Documents, Boston: October Press, 2004. pg 259. To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation. The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the situationist city.

===Work, leisure, and play===

The situationists observed that the worker of advanced capitalism still only functions with the goal of survival. In a world where technological efficiency has increased production exponentially, by tenfold, the workers of society still dedicate the whole of their lives to survival, by way of production. The purpose for which advanced capitalism is organized isn't luxury, happiness, or freedom, but production. The production of commodities is an end to itself; and production by way of survival.
The theorists of the Situationist International regarded the current paradigm of work in advanced capitalist society as increasingly absurd. As technology progresses, and work becomes exponentially efficient, the work itself becomes exponentially more trivial. The spectacle's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production. The "growth" generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was at its origin.

===Major works===

Twelve issues of the main French edition of journal Internationale Situationniste were published, each issue edited by a different individual or group, including: Guy Debord, Mohamed Dahoiu, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio, Maurice Wyckaert, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Asger Jorn, Helmut Sturm, Attila Kotanyi, Jørgen Nash, Uwe Lausen, Raoul Vaneigem, Michèle Bernstein, Jeppesen Victor Martin, Jan Stijbosch, Alexander Trocchi, Théo Frey, Mustapha Khayati, Donald Nicholson-Smith, René Riesel, and René Viénet.
Classic Situationist texts include: On the Poverty of Student Life, Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, and The Revolution of Everyday Life by Raoul Vaneigem.
The first English-language collection of SI writings, although poorly and freely translated, was Leaving The 20th century edited by Christopher Gray. The Situationist International Anthology edited and translated by Ken Knabb, collected numerous SI documents which had previously never been seen in English.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/index.htm|title=Situationist International Anthology[/tpl]

===Relationship with Marxism===

Rooted firmly in the Marxist tradition, the Situationist International criticized Trotskyists, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism from a position they believed to be further left and more properly Marxist. The situationists possessed a strong anti-authoritarian current, commonly deriding the centralized bureaucracies of China and the Soviet Union in the same breath as capitalism.
Debord's work The Society of the Spectacle (1967) established situationist analysis as Marxist critical theory.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] The Society of the Spectacle is widely recognized as the main and most influential Situationist essay.[ref]Giorgio Agamben (1990), "Glosse in margine ai Commentari sulla societa dello spettacolo" in [tpl]Harvnb|Debord|1990|pp=233–250[/tpl]:
  On book Society of Spectacle: ”l’analisi più lucida e severa delle miserie e della servitù di una società—quella dello spettacolo, in cui noi viviamo—che ha esteso oggi il suo dominio su tutto il pianeta” [/ref]
The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was anti-capitalist,Richard Gombin (1971), chap. 3, quotation:  The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International is that of total contestation of modern capitalism. Guy Debord (1961) Perspectives for Conscious Changes in Everyday Life. This work was originally presented by tape recording 17 May 1961 at a conference of the Group for Research on Everyday Life convened in Paris by Henri Lefebvre. Its first print appearance was in Internationale Situationniste #6 (Paris, August 1961).Editorial Notes, Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963. Marxist, Young Hegelian,Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Winter 1997), quotation:  In particular the key issue, of how and why the situationists came to have a preponderant role in May 1968—that is, how and why their brand of politics participated in, and to an extent fueled, a crisis of the late-capitalist State—is still wide open to interpretation.  A description of the portion of the Left at clash with the situationists is found in note #4:  The word "Left" ... much of the time is used descriptively, and therefore pessimistically, to indicate a set of interlocking ideological directorships stretching roughly from the statist and workerist fringes of social democracy and laborism to the para-academic journals and think tanks of latter-day Trotskyism, taking in the Stalinist and lightly post-Stalinist center along the way.  and from the very beginning in the 50s, remarkably differently from the established Left, anti-Stalinist and against all repressive regimes.[tpl]Harvnb|Bandini|1998|Preface to second edition[/tpl] Non a caso l'I.S. sorge ed e' coeva alla denuncia dello Stalinismo. 
Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, Das Kapital.Das Kapital, entry sentence, p. 125: "The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an 'immense collection of commodities'""The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles." Debord G.E. (1967), thesis 1st. In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx's work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the wealth is degraded to an immense accumulation of commodities, Debord argues that in advanced capitalism, life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where "all that once was directly lived has become mere representation".Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 17, 42Giorgio Agamben, 1989 The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies,Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 34 has its "most glaring superficial manifestation" in the advertising-mass media-marketing complex.Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 24
Elaborating on Marx's argument that under capitalism our lives and our environment are continually depleted, Debord adds that the Spectacle is the system by which capitalism tries to hide such depletion. Debord added that, further than the impoverishment in the quality of life,Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 37, 60, 68, 114, 134 our psychic functions are altered, we get a degradation of mind and also a degradation of knowledge.Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 25, 192 In the spectacular society, knowledge is not used anymore to question, analyze, or resolve contradictions, but to assuage reality. Such argument on the Spectacle as a mask"The real unity the spectacle proclaims masks the class division on which the real unity of the capitalist mode of production is based." Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 72. of a degrading reality has been elaborated by many Situationist artists, producing détournements of advertising where instead of a shiny life the crude reality was represented.

Situationist theorists advocated methods of operation that included democratic workers' councils and workers' self-management,[ref]Guy Debord letter to Italian section of the SI in Milan and to Mario Perniola in Rome,

Their anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marxist theory can be identified with the broader council communist and libertarian Marxist movements, themselves more broadly termed as left communism.
The last issue (1972) of the Situationist International journal, featured an editorial analyzing the events of May 1968. The editorial, written by Guy Debord, was titled The Beginning of an Era,[tpl]cite web|author=Situationist International |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm |title=The Beginning of an Era |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1966-12-09 |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] probably as a detournement reference of Nachalo (The Beginning), a Russian Marxist monthly magazine.
According to Greil Marcus, some found similarities between the Situationists and the Yippies.Greil Marcus The long walk of the Situationist International in McDonough (2004), Guy Debord and the Situationist International
Former situationists Clark and Nicholson-Smith (British section), argued that the portion of the moderate Left that is the "established Left", and its "Left opinion-makers", usually addressed contemptuously the SI as "hopelessly young-Hegelian".

===Relationship with anarchism===

The Situationist International was differentiated from both anarchists and Marxists. In spite of this, they have frequently been associated with anarchism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Debord did a critical assessment of the anarchists in his 1967 The Society of the Spectacle.Debord (1967) The Society of the Spectacle, chap. 4 The Proletariat as Subject and as Representation, theses 92-4 In the final, 12th issue of the journal, Debord & co. rejected spontaneism and the "mystics of nonorganization," labeling them as a form of "sub-anarchism":Riesel, René Preliminaries on Councils and Councilist Organization, International Situationniste #12 (September 1969)
According to situationist Ken Knabb, Debord pointed out the flaws and merits of both Marxism and anarchism.[tpl]cite web|author=Ken Knabb |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/joyrev2.htm#N_3_ |title=The Joy of Revolution (chap. 2) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1980-10-28 |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] He argued that "the split between Marxism and anarchism crippled both sides. The anarchists rightly criticized the authoritarian and narrowly economistic tendencies in Marxism, but they generally did so in an undialectical, moralistic, ahistorical manner... and leaving Marx and a few of the more radical Marxists with a virtual monopoly on coherent dialectical analysis—until the situationists finally brought the libertarian and dialectical aspects back together again."

===Relationship with the established left===

The SI poses a challenge to the model of political action of a portion of the left,Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Spring 1997), response to Peter Wollen. Quotation:  So far as Wollen is concerned, the anger was provoked by his essay on the history of the SI, and specifically his three-sentence treatment of the organization in its last decade. We think he should look again at these sentences (which conclude some thirty pages of discussion of the SI's place in modern art), and ask himself whether they are not lofty, contemptuous, and dismissive. That's how they read to us. They seem to epitomize—and, in view of their publication history, to enshrine—a certain effort to turn the SI safely into an art movement, and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties. Like Wollen, presumably, we think that those up-heavals are of much more than historical interest, and every day they are traduced and trivialized by the culture industry. Much is at stake, therefore. We wanted to denounce a loose conspirancy of silence and misrepresentation which has been the response of a portion of the Left to the challenge that the SI poses to their model of political action.  the "established Left" and "Left opinion-makers". The first challenging aspect is the fueling role that the SI had in the upheavals of the political and social movements of the 1960s, upheavals for which much is still at stake and which many foresee as recurring in the 21st century. The second challenging aspect, is the comparison between the Situationist Marxist theory of the Society of the Spectacle, which is still very topical 30 years later, and the current status of the theories supported by leftist establishments in the same period, like Althusserianism, Maoism, workerism, Freudo-Marxism and others.
The response to this challenge has been an attempt to silence and misinterpret, to "turn the SI safely into an art movement, and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties".
The core aspect of the revolutionary perspectives, and the political theory, of the Situationist International, has been neglected by some commentators,Ken Knabb (2006) SI Anthology, Bibliography – Books about the SI – In English, p. 498 which either limited themselves to an apolitical reading of the situationist avant-garde art works, or dismissed the Situationist political theory. Examples of this are Simon Sadler's The Situationist City, and the accounts on the SI published by the New Left Review.
The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was anti-capitalist, Marxist, Young Hegelian, and from the very beginning in the 1950s, remarkably differently from the established Left, anti-Stalinist and against all repressive regimes. The SI called in May 1968 for the formation of Workers councils, and someone has argued that they were aligned with council communism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
There was no separation between the artistic and the political perspectives. For instance, Asger Jorn never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.Mario Lippolis (2000) Notizie su Asger Jorn, situazionista iperpolitico in [tpl]Harvnb|Jorn|2000[/tpl]Mario Lippolis (2000) Un dialogo tra vandali civilizzatori nello sfacelo dell’impero della merce in [tpl]Harvnb|Jorn|2000[/tpl]

==Reception==

===Criticism===

Critics of the Situationists frequently assert that their ideas are not in fact complex and difficult to understand, but are at best simple ideas expressed in deliberately difficult language, and at worst actually nonsensical. For example, anarchist Chaz Bufe asserts in Listen Anarchist! that "obscure situationist jargon" is a major problem in the anarchist movement.[tpl]cite web | title=Listen Anarchist! | author=Chaz Bufe | url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html | publisher=See Sharp Press | accessdate=2008-06-23[/tpl]

===Influence===

Debord's analysis of the spectacle has been influential among people working on television, particularly in France and Italy;[ref]Derrida (2002) Q&A session at Film Forum pp. 116–7 quote: 
[/ref] in Italy, TV programs produced by situationist intellectuals, like Antonio Ricci's Striscia la notizia, or Carlo Freccero's programming schedule for Italia 1 in the early 1990s.Luther Blissett (2002) 1995 Guy Debord Is Really Dead, Sabotage Editions, ISBN 978-0-9514417-3-2 English edition of Guy Debord è morto davvero
In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives. Examples of these groups include: in Amsterdam, the Provos; in the UK, King Mob, the producers of Heatwave magazine (who later briefly joined the SI), and the Angry Brigade. In the US, groups like Black Mask (later Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers), The Weathermen, and the Rebel Worker group also explicitly employed their ideas.[tpl]cite journal | last=Lang | first=Daniel | title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade | journal=Cultural Recycling | volume=3 | issue=1 |date=May 2007 | publisher=Other Voices | url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php[/tpl]
Anarchist theorists such as Fredy Perlman, Bob Black, Hakim Bey, and John Zerzan, have developed the SI's ideas in various directions away from Marxism. These theorists were predominantly associated with the magazines Fifth Estate, Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, and Green Anarchy. During the early 1980s, English anarchist Larry Law produced the Spectacular Times pocket-books series, which aimed to make Situationist ideas more easily assimilated into the anarchist movement. Later anarchist theorists such as the CrimethInc. collective also claim Situationist influence.
Situationist urban theory, defined initially by the members of the Lettrist International as "Unitary Urbanism," was extensively developed through the behavioural and performance structures of The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture during the 1990s. The re-emergence of the London Psychogeographical Association also inspired many new psychogeographical groups including Manchester Area Psychogeographic. The LPA and the Neoist Alliance along with the Luther Blissett Project came together to form a New Lettrist International with a specifically Communist perspective. Around this time, Unpopular Books and the LPA released some key texts including new translations of Asger Jorn's work.
Around this time also, groups such as Reclaim the Streets and Adbusters have, respectively, seen themselves as "creating situations" or practicing detournement on advertisements.
In cultural terms, the SI's influence has arguably been greater, if more diffuse. The list of cultural practices which claim a debt to the SI is extensive, but there are some prominent examples:
