Despite some of them are turned into the touristic attractions, waterfalls in Serbia are generally not well known mostly because they are not particularly high. Actually, until late 1990s, the highest waterfalls in Serbia are believed to be 25 to 30 meters. Since then, several waterfalls were discovered in the previously geologically unexplored areas of the south-eastern Serbia (namely, the Visok region), including some of the highest ones, changing the geography of Serbia.
