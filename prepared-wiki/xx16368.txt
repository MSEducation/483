===Empty space===

A discovery by the infrared telescope Herschel in conjunction with other ground based telescopes, determined that black patches of space in certain areas encompassing a star formation were not dark nebulae but actually vast holes of empty space. Such is the case of the area NGC 1999 and its star V380 Orionis. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still being investigated, although it has been hypothesized that narrow jets of gas from some of the young stars in the region punctured the sheet of dust and gas, as well as powerful radiation from a nearby mature star may have helped to create the hole. This was a previously unknown and unexpected step in the star-forming process.Telescope discovers surprising hole in space, MSNBC, by Space.com, 11-05-2010

===Cloud collapse===

An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in hydrostatic equilibrium as long as the kinetic energy of the gas pressure is in balance with the potential energy of the internal gravitational force. Mathematically this is expressed using the virial theorem, which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy. If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo gravitational collapse. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the Jeans mass. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses. This coincides with the typical mass of an open cluster of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.[ref]

In triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby supernova explosion can be a trigger, sending shocked matter into the cloud at very high speeds. Alternatively, galactic collisions can trigger massive starbursts of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by tidal forces.[ref]
