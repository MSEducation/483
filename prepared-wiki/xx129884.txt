KEZR (106.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to San Jose, California and serving the San Francisco Bay Area. They program a Hot Adult Contemporary format as "Mix 106.5" and are owned by NextMedia Group.  Co-owned with KBAY-FM, its studios are located in the heart of downtown San Jose at Park Center Plaza, and the transmitter is based from a site in Santa Teresa County Park.
The station has programmed minor variations of adult contemporary music with the KEZR call letters since 1973.
This popular San Jose radio station has held many mixers and events with several famous artists including Sara Bareilles, Jason Mraz, and Augustana.
Before it was purchased by NextMedia, the station was briefly owned by CBS Radio, who moved the station from San Jose to San Francisco. Prior to that, it was owned for a long period by the Levitz family. During this period, particularly the 1990s, KEZR was a dominant force in Bay Area radio, regularly topping the Arbitron ratings.
