Crispix (or Crispix Krispies in Canada) is a brand of breakfast cereal, introduced by Kellogg's in 1983. It was created specifically to compete with Ralston Purina's Chex family of cereals, which had about $125 million in annual sales and no significant competition. By 1987, Crispix had sales of about $65 million.Steinbreder,H. John. HOW KING KELLOGG BEAT THE BLAHS Fortune (August 29, 1988). Retrieved on 7-18-09.
