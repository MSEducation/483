Northampton High School is an independent day school for girls in Hardingstone, Northampton, England.

==Location==

The school is about [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|1[/tpl] from Northampton town centre along the Newport Pagnell road (the B526, formerly part of the A50 road) which separates the school from Wootton.

==History==

The school was founded in 1878 by a committee of local church people. It later came under the control of the Diocese of Peterborough (Church of England), whose Board of Education used to appoint the majority of the Governors.  The school eventually became a direct grant grammar school. However, on the abolition of the direct grant system during the 1970s, the school became independent.
Before moving to its current location, the school was based in Derngate, Northampton town centre. The site was sold for a housing development with the school moving to new premises at its present location in 1992.
In 2006 the school joined the Girls' Day School Trust and no longer has a formal link to the church.

==Catchment==

Girls come from a large number of independent prep and junior schools as well as maintained primary and secondary schools within a wide area covering Northamptonshire and parts of neighboring counties such as Buckinghamshire and Warwickshire. The vast majority of girls in the Junior School stay on to the Senior School for their secondary education. Most girls stay on into the Sixth Form and each year girls from other schools join at Year 9 (post prep) and the Sixth Form. Almost all Year 13 leavers proceed to Higher Education, either directly or following a gap year.
