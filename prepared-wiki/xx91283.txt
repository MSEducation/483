==History==

Founded in the English city of York by St Paulinus of York in the year AD 627,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.st-peters.york.sch.uk/stpeters_info.asp?pid=1&sid=28|title=About the School|publisher=St Peter's School|accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl] the school was originally based at York Minster. An early headmaster Alcuin (Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus), went on to be Chancellor to the Emperor Charlemagne, and founded several of the earliest schools in mainland Europe. It is the third oldest school in the UK and the fourth oldest in the world.Mortimore, M.J.A. Bridlington School: A History, p. 13. Hutton Cranswick, East Yorkshire: Alan Twiddle Publishing, 1999. ISBN 1-902508-03-3. For most of its history, the school has been a boys' school and only admitted its first girls into the sixth form in 1976, following a trend set by many previously single-sex independent schools. In 1987 it became fully coeducational.About the school – Timeline

==Campus==

The school has a large campus near to the centre of the city of York, stretching to the banks of the River Ouse. The main front of the school faces along Bootham; this is the oldest part of the site and comprises the Memorial Hall, Alcuin Library and Chapel, as well as dining facilities. Temple House and School House, the Department of Politics, the Department of Business, the Department of Economics, and the Department of Latin and Classics are also based in these buildings, accessed from an area known to the school community as the 'monkey cage'. Behind here is the Scott Block (Maths), Old Science Building (Chemistry), New Science Building (Physics, IT, and DT), Shepherd Rooms (Languages), The Grove and Clifton House. The Music School, the Dame Judi Dench Drama Centre, Hope House, and Queen's Building (History, Religious Studies, and English) are also located along the top of the Campus.  [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Boarding Houses Wentworth and Rise border the main campus, while Linton, Dronfield and Manor are located across the road from the main school front accessible by footbridge. In the 2000s the school expanded its site under Headmaster Andrew Trotman to include the new lower campus, formally the site of Queen Anne's, a state school that had been recently closed. The move was not without its challenges, including the distance between the old and new sites and the dissection of a public footpath. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
In September 2001, St Olave's, the prep school, moved from the White House, Chilman Building and its half of the Queen's Building to the newly acquired Queen Anne site. The pre-prep, Clifton Prep moved from its original 19th-century building on The Avenue to occupy the buildings previously used by St Olave's. The Lower Campus now contains St Olave's prep school and the senior school Biology and Art Departments.
in 2006 St Peter's School closed a public footpath running through the school grounds using The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. This was hotly disputed by local people.footpath closure

==Headmasters==

==Houses==

The school has ten-day and boarding houses, and each house has its own colour. Dronfield (pink) and Rise (white) are girls' boarding houses; Linton (baby blue) and the Manor (gold) are boys' boarding houses. The rest are day houses: Clifton (yellow), The Grove (red), Queens (purple), Temple (green), School (mauve), and Hope (orange). The house system is a long standing tradition throughout the school's history. As the houses are physical, located in various buildings and parts of buildings throughout the school campus,see the school's website a sense of community is developed, bringing pupils of all ages together to compete in inter-house competitions, like rugby.  "House Colours" are an award that is given in the form of a tie (formerly a badge for female students as they did not wear ties when they were first admitted) to pupils for an outstanding contribution to house activities.
In 1982 there were only seven houses: the boarding houses were: School, Rise, Dronfield, and Manor; the day houses were: Queens, Grove, and Temple. Hope, Clifton, and Linton are of more recent origin. Houses were mixed and female boarders had their own quarters.

==York Minster==

York Minster has a long connection with St Peter's, as the school's founder was an Archbishop of York. This relationship is also evident in the school's name, which mirrors the formal title of the Minster, The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of St Peter. At its foundation, the school was probably housed next to the earliest cathedral building.St Peter's association with York Minster
At the end of each academic year a Commemoration and Prizegiving service is held in the Minster and a Carol Service is also held there at Christmas. The school choir often sings in the Minster and in the 2006/2007 year they participated in Verdi's Requiem, which brought together the wider York community.
