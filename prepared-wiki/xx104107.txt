The GE C40-8 is a 6-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1987 and 1992.  It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives, and its wheel arrangement is of a C-C type.
This locomotive model is often referred to as a Dash 8-40S or simply "Dash 8".  "Dash 8" in general refers to the electrical control series, "Dash" being a carryover from the older syntax of C40-8. The "40" refers to the baseline horsepower rating ([tpl]convert|4000|hp|kW|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) of the unit, although some units may be re-rated to [tpl]convert|4100|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] (see below).
Later units were supplied with a wide-nose cab and are designated Dash 8-40CW, the "W" indicating a wide-nose cab.

==C41-8==

Some railroads, in particular the Chicago and North Western, upgraded some of their units to ~[tpl]convert|4135|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and designated them as C42-8. This designation was modified by Union Pacific to C41-8 after its takeover of C&NW in 1995. Former C&NW units are usually identified by a grab-iron on the front nose just above the Union Pacific shield logo, and/or the "C41-8" designation on the cab side.  The final three C&NW C40-8s were built with [tpl]convert|4135|hp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], and the prior 32 units were similarly modified as well. Although none of these units were ever officially classed as C41-8 by GE,  a safety cab version was built as the Dash 8-41CW.

==Current & former owners==

The companies that still own C40-8 locomotives as of 2006 include: CSX Transportation with 146, Norfolk Southern Railway with 88 and Union Pacific Railroad with 298 (includes former C&NW C41-8 units).
Also, the GE C40-8W is a newer model of the C40-8. The W stands for "Wide-nose" or Safety Cab. Many railroads such as CSX, UP and BNSF own or use these models. The shape of the C40-8Ws no longer have the stub on the front. The nose has been stretched out. Many railroads like CSX have the two head lights on the nose, while Conrail (CSX and Norfolk Southern now own)  had C40-8Ws with the head light on the top of the cab. Many CSX and NS engines still sport the "Ex-Conrail" head light.
In 2010 CN bought 35 C40-8 locomotives (2100-2134) from UP and 67 C40-8W locomotives (2098-2099, 2135-2199) from BNSF. CN 2112 (C40-8) was painted for the 15th anniversary.
