Targa Tasmania is a tarmac-based rally event held on the island state of Tasmania, Australia, annually since 1992.  The event takes its name from the Targa Florio, a former motoring event held on the island of Sicily. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the Mille Miglia, the Coupe des Alpes and the Tour de Corse.

==Rally format==

The rally started as a five-day event, and was run as a six-day event for the tenth anniversary in 2001. From 2002 it reverted to its five-day course. 2006 was the 15th anniversary and was also a 6-day event. 2011 was the 20th anniversary.
In 2008 the course was substantially revised, a number of well liked stages from previous years are now used (Riana), and a number of all new stages were introduced (Mt Claude and Rossarden). Leg 3 was dropped by shortening the Leg 2 East Coast day ending back in Launceston (rather than Hobart). Leg 3 is another loop north out of Launceston (running through Devonport on this day). Leg 4 now runs from Launceston through the lunch stop at Burnie to the evening end at Strahan. It remains the longest tarmac rally in Australia with no repeated stages. Although a couple of stages will share the same piece of road in opposite directions on consecutive days.
The Targa is one of several Tarmac Rally events to be held in Australia. It also has had international connections with Targa New Zealand and Targa NewFoundland which have evolved since the inception of Targa Tasmania.
