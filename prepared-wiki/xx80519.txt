In baseball, middle relief pitchers (or "middle relievers") are relief pitchers who commonly pitch in the fifth, sixth, or seventh innings.[tpl]cite book|last=Dickson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Dickson | title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary |year=2009| publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=544| isbn=978-0-393-06681-4[/tpl]  In the National League, a middle reliever often comes in after the starting pitcher has been pulled for a pinch hitter. A middle reliever is usually replaced in the eighth or ninth innings  by a left-handed specialist, setup pitcher or closers; middle relief pitchers may work these innings as well, especially if the game is not close.
