The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a 501(c)(3) American organization, whose membership primarily consists of  conservative state legislators and private sector representatives.[tpl]cite news|title=Transportation Chief Attacks Congress on Safety|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/us/transportation-chief-attacks-congress-on-safety.html|work=The New York Times|date=1987-08-30|author=May, Clifford[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://kbia.org/post/right-work-bill-praised-and-blasted-house-committee-hearing|title='Right-to-work' bill praised and blasted in House committee hearing|publisher=KBIA|date=January 14, 2014|first=Marshall|last=Griffin[/tpl] According to its website, ALEC "works to advance the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism at the state level through a nonpartisan public-private partnership of America's state legislators, members of the private sector and the general public."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/|title=About ALEC|publisher=American Legislative Exchange Council[/tpl]

ALEC's membership base includes nearly one-third of all sitting state legislators and most of its resources are derived from corporations and trade associations. It offers regular conferences and training sessions but is perhaps best known for drafting model bills that can easily be adopted by an individual state and introduced into a legislature.[/tpl] Many ALEC legislators laud the organization for converting campaign rhetoric and nascent policy ideas into legislative language.
ALEC's political activities have received considerable scrutiny by both the media and liberal groups. The New York Times reported that special interests have "effectively turned ALEC's lawmaker members into stealth lobbyists, providing them with talking points, signaling how they should vote and collaborating on bills affecting hundreds of issues like school vouchers and tobacco taxes." Bloomberg Businessweek stated, "Part of ALEC's mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work."  The Guardian described ALEC as "a dating agency for Republican state legislators and big corporations, bringing them together to frame rightwing legislative agendas in the form of 'model bills'." Several liberal groups, including Common Cause, have challenged its tax-exempt status.

==History==

===Rise===

ALEC first came into being in 1973 in Chicago as the "Conservative Caucus of State Legislators", a project initiated Mark Rhoads, an Illinois state house staffer, to counter the Environmental Protection Agency and wage and price controls.[tpl]cite book |last=Bishop |first=Bill |title=The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded American Is Tearing Us Apart |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VAqNKMfgdk4C&pg=PT203 |year=2009 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0547525192 |page=203[/tpl] Conservative legislators felt the word "conservative" was unpopular with the public at the time, however, and the organization was renamed as the American Legislative Exchange Council. In 1975, with the support of the American Conservative Union, ALEC registered as a federal non-profit agency.[tpl]cite book |last=Schoenwald |first=Jonathan M. |title=A Time for Choosing: The Rise of Modern American Conservatism |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EdbqQsQlI3IC&pg=PA241 |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195157265 |page=241[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Lichtman |first=Allan J. |title=White Protestant Nation: The Rise of the American Conservative Movement |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3q92ePfQDloC&pg=PA318 |year=2009 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0802144209 |page=318[/tpl] Bill Moyers and Greenpeace have attributed the establishment of ALEC to the influential Powell Memorandum, which led to the rise of a new business activist movement in the 1970s.Charlie Cray (23 August 2011).

Conservative activist Paul Weyrich helped the new group find a meeting room. Henry Hyde, who later became a U.S. Congressman, and Lou Barnett, who later became National Political Director of Ronald Reagan's Political Action Committee, also helped to found ALEC.[tpl]cite web |title=History |url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/history/ |work=American Legislative Exchange Council |year=2012 |accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl]Barnett, Louis W.

Several members of Congress were also involved in the organization during its early years, including Sen. John Buckley and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Rep. Phil Crane of Illinois. 
In the 1980s, ALEC opposed U.S. disinvestment from South Africa, a movement to put pressure on the South African government to embark on negotiations with a goal of dismantling of apartheid.ALEC’s "Institutional Corruption," From Backing Apartheid to Assault on Clean Energy, Public Sector. Democracy Now! December 11, 2013. In 1985, ALEC also published a memo that opposed "the current homosexual movement," portrayed homosexuality as a result of a conscious choice, and said that pedophilia was "one of the more dominant practices within the homosexual world". Shadee Ashtari (5 December 2013). Right Wing Group's Extreme Anti-Gay History Revealed In New Document The Huffington Post. Retrieved 13 December 2013 After the memo was leaked in 2013, ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling said that ALEC does not draft model bills on social issues, and added, "I'm also sad that the critics would not acknowledge that organizations change over time."
Duane Parde served as the executive director from December 1996 to January 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ntu.org/about-ntu/staff/duane-parde.html |title=Duane Parde, president |year=2009 |work=About NTU: Staff |publisher=National Taxpayers Union |accessdate=May 14, 2012[/tpl] Lori Roman, who served in the same role from 2006 to 2008, had an imperious style that led to financial difficulties and the departure of two thirds of ALEC's staff.

By 2011, the number of ALEC legislative members had reached 2,000, more than 25 percent of all state legislators nationwide.  Approximately 1,000 bills based on ALEC language were being introduced in state legislatures every year, with about 20% of those bills being enacted.

===Backlash===

ALEC's influence also created a backlash among media outlets and political opponents who claimed it was secretly subverting democratic institutions to further the aims of its corporate benefactors. Acknowledging this problem, ALEC senior director of membership and development Chaz Cirame said, "The hook about some conspiracy or some secret organization is a lot better story than one about bringing state legislators together to talk about best practices around the country." Oregon state representative and ALEC member Gene Whisnant said, "We’re getting a lot of attention saying we’re trying to destroy the earth and everything on it."
In 2011, University of Wisconsin professor and historian William Cronon created a blog during protests over the state's 2011 budget bill with an entry about the history of conservative groups, including ALEC, and alleging a link between that budget bill and ALEC.[tpl]cite news | work= Wall Street Journal | title = William Cronon vs. Wisconsin Republicans | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/03/28/william-cronon-vs-wisconsin-republicans/ | first = Christopher | last = Shea | date = 28 March 2011[/tpl] Cronon said that ALEC's activities should be examined more closely and that the organization should conduct its business with greater transparency.[tpl]cite news | work = The New Yorker | first = Anthony | last = Grafton | authorlink = Anthony Grafton | date = 28 March 2011 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/03/wisconsin-the-cronon-affair.html | title = Wisconsin: The Cronon Affair[/tpl] The blog received more than 500,000 hits, and protest signs asking about ALEC appeared in Madison at the state capitol.[tpl]cite book |last1=Buhle |first1=Mari Jo |authorlink1=Mari Jo Buhle |last2=Buhle |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Buhle |title=It Started in Wisconsin: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the New Labor Protest |publisher=Verso Books |year=2012 |page=45 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OdqOFqdsRqIC&pg=PA45 |isbn=1844678903[/tpl] ALEC denied such a link being behind such efforts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/04/conservative_group_denies_it_m.html |title=Conservative group denies it masterminded drive to restrict public employee unions|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=April 3, 2011|first=Sabrina|last=Eaton[/tpl] The Wisconsin Republican Party on March 17 made a request under Wisconsin's Open Records laws to obtain e-mail messages sent to or from Cronon's university account, and that of other apparent union supporters who are state employees, containing keywords related to various political issues that were being debated in Wisconsin at the time.[tpl]cite news | work = The Chronicle of Higher Education | title = Wisconsin GOP Seeks E-Mails of a Madison Professor Who Criticized the Governor | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Wisconsin-GOP-Seeks-E-Mails-of/126911/ | date = 25 March 2011 | first = Peter | last = Schmidt[/tpl]  Paul Krugman and the American Historical Association defended Cronon against what they characterized as intimidation by Wisconsin Republicans.[tpl]cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=American Thought Police|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/opinion/28krugman.html?src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 27, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.historians.org/news/1293/aha-council-deplores-recent-intimidation-efforts-aimed-at-cronon |title=AHA Today: AHA Deplores Effort to Intimidate William Cronon |publisher=American Historical Association |date=March 27, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-07[/tpl]  Mari Jo and Paul Buhle characterized the e-mail search request as an "overreaction" by Wisconsin Republicans in an attempt to hide their political connections to ALEC. Mary Bottari, deputy director of the Center for Media and Democracy, wrote a year later that Cronon's connection between Wisconsin Republicans and ALEC had been "upheld" by a report from ALEC Exposed which showed that an influential bloc of 49 of Wisconsin's 132 legislators were connected to ALEC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prwatch.org/news/2012/05/11518/alec-wisconsin-hijacking-state |title=ALEC in Wisconsin: The Hijacking of a State |last=Bottari |first=Mary |work=PR Watch |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Center for Media and Democracy |accessdate=December 14, 2013[/tpl]

==Organization==

As of December 2013, ALEC had 1,810 legislative members, as well as more than 85 members of Congress and 14 sitting or former governors who are considered "alumni". The vast majority of ALEC's legislative members belong to the Republican Party. ALEC says it also has approximately 300 corporate, foundation, and other private-sector members.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl] The chairmanship of ALEC is a rotating position, with a new legislator appointed to the position each year. As of 2013, the chair was John Piscopo, a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives.
Day-to-day operations are run from ALEC's Arlington, Virginia, office by an executive director and a staff of approximately 30.[tpl]cite web |title=Meet Our Staff |url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/meet-our-staff/ |work=American Legislative Exchange Council |year=2012 |accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl] ALEC By-Laws specify that, "...full membership shall be open to persons dedicated to the preservation of individual liberty, basic American values and institutions, productive free enterprise, and limited representative government, who support the purposes of ALEC, and who serve, or formerly serve, as members of a state or territorial legislature, the United States Congress, or similar bodies outside the United States."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/51770890/ALEC-s-2009-IRS-Form-990 |title=ALEC's 2009 IRS Form 990 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]
In addition to the staff and members, ALEC has a "Board of Scholars" that advises and alerts the staff and members to upcoming issues. The board is composed of Arthur Laffer, an economist who served under Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board; Victor Schwartz, chair of Public Policy at Shook, Hardy & Bacon; Richard Vedder, economics professor emeritus at Ohio University and adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute; and Bob Williams, founder of the Freedom Foundation.[tpl]cite web |title=Board of Scholars |url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/board-of-scholars/ |work=American Legislative Exchange Council |year=2012 |accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl]
ALEC is composed of nine "task forces": 1) Civil Justice; 2) Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development; 3) Communications and Technology; 4) Education; 5) Energy, Environment, and Agriculture; 6) Health and Human Services; 7) International Relations; 8) Justice Performance Project; and 9) Tax and Fiscal Policy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/task-forces/|title=Task Forces|publisher=American Legislative Exchange Council[/tpl] Public- and private-sector members make up each of the task forces—the public-sector members are state legislators and the private-sector members are typically corporate lobbyists or think-tank representatives. These task forces generate model bills which members can then customize for communities and introduce for debate in their own state legislatures. Reporter Alan Greenblatt wrote that private sector members have veto power over model bills drafted by the task forces.
ALEC also has ties to the State Policy Network (SPN), a national association of think-tanks. The SPN regularly sponsors annual meetings for ALEC, and a number of SPN's active affiliates are members of both organizations. Some of the think tanks in the SPN write model legislation, which is then introduced at ALEC's private meetings.Blumenthal, Paul (14 November 2013).

==Notable policies and model bills==

ALEC's website states that its goal is to advance "the fundamental principles of free-market enterprise, limited government, and federalism". In 2003, Donald Ray Kennard, then a Louisiana state representative and ALEC national chairman, said, "We are a very, very conservative organization...We're just espousing what we really believe in." Although ALEC originally focused on social issues such as abortion, which it opposed, in more recent[tpl]specify|date=April 2014[/tpl] years the group has focused more on business and regulatory matters. According to The Nation 's John Nichols, ALEC's agenda "seems to be dictated at almost every turn by multinational corporations. It's to clear the way for lower taxes, less regulation, a lot of protection against lawsuits, and ALEC is very, very active in the opening up of areas via privatization for corporations to make more money, particularly in places you might not usually expect like public education."[tpl]cite web |title=Who's Really Writing States' Legislation? |work=Fresh Air, WHYY |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/07/21/138537515/how-alec-shapes-state-politics-behind-the-scenes |publisher=NPR |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl]

Prior to 2012, legislation based on ALEC models bills was introduced in many states to mandate or strengthen requirements that voters produce state-issued photo identification. The bills were passed and signed into law in six states.
ALEC's April 17, 2012 announcement that it was disbanding its Public Safety and Elections Task Force also ended its legislative efforts to expand voter ID requirements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://swampland.time.com/2012/04/17/alec-scraps-gun-law-voter-id-task-force/ |title=ALEC Scraps Gun Law, Voter-ID Task Force |first=Adam |last=Sorensen |date=April 17, 2012 |work=Time[/tpl] On April 18, the National Center for Public Policy Research announced the creation of a voter ID task force to replace the one discontinued by ALEC.[tpl]cite web |title=New Voter Identification Task Force Announced |url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/PR-VoterID_041812.html |work=National Center for Public Policy Research |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=April 21, 2012[/tpl]Ryan J.

===Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act===

One of ALEC's model bills is the "Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act", which classifies certain property destruction, acts of intimidation, and civil disobedience by environmental and animal rights activists as terrorism. This model bill appeared across the U.S. in various forms since it was drafted in 2003. The federal Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act has notable similarities, and at points almost verbatim language, to ALEC's model “Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act.” The Senate version of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act was sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, a long-time member of ALEC.Will Potter, "'Ag Gag' Bills and Supporters Have Close Ties to ALEC", Green is the New Red, April 26, 2012.
Many ag-gag bills are also similar to ALEC's model "Animal and Ecological Terrorism Act", which would make it against the law to film, videotape, or take photographs on livestock farms in order to "defame the facility or its owner." People found to be in violation would be put in a "terrorist registry."[tpl]cite news|author=Oppel Jr., Richard A.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/us/taping-of-farm-cruelty-is-becoming-the-crime.html|title=Taping of Farm Cruelty Is Becoming the Crime|date=April 6, 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 7, 2013[/tpl]Bill Moyers.

===Criminal sentencing and prison management===

According to Governing magazine, "ALEC has been a major force behind both privatizing state prison space and keeping prisons filled." ALEC has developed model bills advancing “tough on crime” initiatives, including “truth in sentencing” and “three strikes” laws. Critics argue that by funding and participating in ALEC's Criminal Justice Task Forces, private prison companies directly influence legislation for tougher, longer sentences. Corrections Corporation of America and The GEO Group, two of the largest for-profit prison companies in the US, have been contributors to the ALEC. Prison Privatization and the Use of Incarceration. The Sentencing Project, September 2004. ALEC has also worked to pass state laws to allow the creation of private-sector for-profit prisons.Elk, Mike and Sloan, Bob (2011).

===Energy and the environment===

ALEC pushed for deregulation of the electricity industry in the 1990s. Maneuvering between two private sector members, Enron, a former energy trader, and the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a utilities trade association, led EEI to withdraw its ALEC membership. Enron's position on the matter was adopted by ALEC and subsequently by many state legislatures.
An April 2012 article in the New York Times stated that while ALEC legislation having to do with public "right to know" laws regarding what fluids are used in hydraulic fracturing (also known as "fracking") has been promoted as a victory for consumers' right to know about potential drinking water contaminants, the bill contains "loopholes that would allow energy companies to withhold the names of certain fluid contents, for reasons including that they have been deemed trade secrets."
ALEC has promoted a model bill that calls plans by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions a “train wreck” that would harm the economy, and has supported efforts by various states to withdraw from regional climate change compacts. ALEC has also promoted a model bill that would call on the federal government to approve the proposed Keystone XL project, which would extend a synthetic crude oil pipeline from oil sands in Alberta, Canada to Nebraska.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/republican-legislative-council-pushes-for-keystone-approval/article15968657/|title=Republican legislative council pushes for Keystone approval|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=December 13, 2013|first=Sonia|last=Verma[/tpl]
In December 2013, The Guardian reported that ALEC seeks to push legislation that would weaken state clean energy regulations and penalize homeowners who install their own solar panels as "freeriders".Goldenberg, Suzanne and Pilkington, Ed (4 December 2013). ALEC calls for penalties on 'freerider' homeowners in assault on clean energy. The Guardian. Retrieved 17 February 2014.

===Telecommunications and information technology===

ALEC aims to deregulate America's telecom system, and has worked with AT&T and Verizon to draft legislation on prohibiting public broadband services and "sunsetting" the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).>[tpl]cite news|last=Kushnik|first=Bruce|title=ALEC, Tech and the Telecom Wars: Killing America's Telecom Utilities|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/alec-tech-and-the-telecom_b_1696830.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=24 July 2012[/tpl] Names of its 172-member task force, agenda of a 12/2010 meeting and minutes including a resolution regarding traffic pumping have been published.[tpl]cite web|title=TELECOMMUNICATIONS &INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE MEETING ALEC States & Nation Policy Summit – Washington, DC|url=http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/%7BFB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD4429893665%7D/telecom_35daymailing%20DC.pdf|publisher=Common cause|accessdate=22 April 2014|year=2010[/tpl] In February 2014, Senate Bill 304 in Kansas was introduced, "prohibiting cities and counties from building public broadband networks and providing internet service to businesses and citizens".[tpl]cite news|last=Lefler|first=Dion|title=Proposed bill to outlaw community broadband service in Kansas met with opposition|url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/02/01/3262071/proposed-bill-to-outlaw-community.html|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=Wichita Eagle|date=1 February 2014[/tpl] The bill contains an underserved area exemption for public wi-fi, but it is not met anywhere in Kansas. The city of Chanute, Kansas which has led broadband development since the 1980s, financed through its public electricity company, including free wi-fi in its college, hospital and public spaces, and a 4g mobile data network, feels under attack by the bill.

===Health care===

ALEC opposes the individual health insurance mandate enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as the "ACA" or "Obamacare"). ALEC filed an amicus brief in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, urging the Supreme Court to strike down the ACA's individual mandate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/initiatives/health-care-freedom-initiative/|title=ALEC's Health Care Freedom Initiative|publisher=American Legislative Exchange Council[/tpl] In 2011 it published the "State Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare," which has served as a roadmap for repeal efforts. ALEC has also drafted a variety of model bills designed to block the law's implementation. 
In August 2013, ALEC approved as a model bill the "Health Care Freedom Act", which would strip health insurers of their licenses to do business at the ACA's federal health care exchanges if they accepted any subsidies under the system. Sean Riley, the head of ALEC's Health and Human Services taskforce, said the aim of the proposed legislation was to protect businesses from the ACA's employer mandate. Slate journalist David Weigel has called the bill a "sneak attack" on the ACA.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/legal_case_against_obamacare_halbig_v_sebelius_and_state_legislatures.html|title=Obamacare Is Over (If You Want It)|publisher=Slate|date=December 17, 2013|first=David|last=Weigel[/tpl] Health insurance experts have predicted that if the bill were widely adopted by Republican-controlled states, it would seriously disrupt the exchange and threaten the ACA. Wendell Potter, former health insurance executive and CMD fellow, said, "You cannot build the healthcare system based on the free market unless you have subsidies. If they are taken away the whole thing collapses.” 
In 1989, ALEC published the draft “HIV Assault Act", which made it a crime for someone who is knowingly infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) to have sex with a person who is not infected, without disclosing the HIV infection. Having sex is a criminal offense, even if HIV is not transmitted.  Alan Smith, who worked on the draft, said that it was a response to worries that people with AIDS were deliberately infecting others, "to make sure more people got it so more research money could be devoted to curing it."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.propublica.org/article/hiv-criminal-transmission|title=Sex, Lies and HIV: When What You Don't Tell Your Partner Is a Crime|first=Sergio|last=Hernandez|publisher=ProPublica|date=December 1, 2013[/tpl]

===Education===

ALEC frequently promotes model bills that expand public-private partnerships in education.

===Outside the United States===

In July 2012, The Guardian ran an article reporting that ALEC had taken action to oppose plain cigarette packaging laws outside the United States. It is contacting governments that are planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding, including the UK and Australia.[tpl]cite news|first=Jamie|last=Doward |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jul/15/cigarettes-plain-packets-alec-koch-brothers|title=US free market group tries to halt sales of cigarettes in plain packets in UK|work=The Guardian|date=July 14, 2012[/tpl]
Karla Jones, a task force director for ALEC, told participants at a meeting that proposed laws in Canada, the UK and Australia would prohibit branding of tobacco products. She said that the brands were those corporations' "most valuable asset." ALEC wrote to the Australian government stating that US legislators opposed the requirements for plain packaging. ALEC has stated that generic cigarettes increase cigarette consumption, rather than reducing it.

==Secrecy==

ALEC does not disclose its membership list or the origins of its model bills, and its legislative members frequently deny being influenced by the organization or its model legislation. Arizona Assistant Minority Leader Steve Farley proposed an ALEC Accountability Act to force legislators to disclose their ALEC ties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-united-states-of-alec/|title=Full Show: United States of ALEC|publisher=Moyers & Company[/tpl]  The bill did not receive a committee hearing.http://azcommunitypress.org/2013/05/04/alec-are-corporations-and-legislators-working-against-citizens/
Legislative members generally propose ALEC model bills in their states without disclosing their authorship. One notable exception was in November 2011, when former Florida State Representative Rachel Burgin (R) introduced legislation to call on the federal government to reduce its corporate tax rate. She mistakenly included the boilerplate "WHEREAS, it is the mission of the American Legislative Exchange Council to advance Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty..."[tpl]cite web |first=Alex |last=Seitz-Wald |title=Oops: Florida Republican Forgets To Remove ALEC Mission Statement From Boilerplate Anti-Tax Bill |url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/02/02/417488/florida-gop-alec-forget/?mobile=nc |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012[/tpl] The bill was quickly withdrawn, the phrase removed, and the bill resubmitted. The American Prospect journalist Abby Rapoport wrote that the incident "seems to confirm what many have assumed was occurring in state legislatures—-and while Burgin's bill was hardly a major piece of legislation, ALEC's reach in important policy areas seems hard to overestimate."[tpl]cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/case-you-were-underestimating-alecs-role|title=In Case You Were Underestimating ALEC's Role|work=The American Prospect|date=February 3, 2012|first=Abby|last=Rapoport[/tpl]
Prior to 2013, access to ALEC's model bills was restricted, and its website required a password to access them. On July 13, 2011, the Center for Media and Democracy, in cooperation with The Nation, posted 850 model bills created over a 30-year period, and created a web project, ALEC Exposed, to host these model bills.[tpl]cite interview |last=Graves |first=Lisa |interviewer=Amy Goodman |title=ALEC Exposed: State Legislative Bills Drafted by Secretive Corporate-Lawmaker Coalition |callsign = |city=New York |date=July 15, 2011 |program=Democracy Now! |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/7/15/alec_exposed_state_legislative_bills_drafted[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Nichols |first=John |date=July 13, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/161978/alec-exposed/|title=ALEC Exposed[/tpl] The leak has been credited with triggering a wave of criticism against ALEC in both left-wing and mainstream media outlets.
On Oct. 1, 2012, Common Cause, a liberal not-for-profit advocacy organization, along with the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), filed a lawsuit under a Wisconsin open records law alleging five Republican lawmakers did not disclose whether they had searched personal email accounts for correspondence with ALEC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_21682498/wisconsin-groups-sue-over-lawmakers-emails-contact-conservative|title=Wisconsin: Groups sue over lawmakers' emails, contact with conservative organization ALEC|agency=Associated Press|date=October 2, 2012[/tpl] In one case, a Wisconsin legislative representative had requested of ALEC in June 2012 that all correspondence be sent to his personal account.Groups sue 5 GOP lawmakers over email records, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Patrick Marley, Oct. 1, 2012. According to CMD, the legislators settled the suit late in October, allowing their personal emails to be searched and paying $2,500 in court costs as part of the settlement.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.prwatch.org/news/2012/10/11828/cmd-and-common-cause-prevail-open-records-lawsuit-against-alec-legislators-wiscon|title=CMD and Common Cause Prevail in Open Records Lawsuit Against ALEC Legislators in Wisconsin|publisher=Center for Media and Democracy|date=October 30, 2012[/tpl]

==Allegations of improper lobbying==

In April 2012, Common Cause filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service objecting to ALEC's tax status as a non-profit organization and alleged that lobbying accounted for more than 60% of its expenditures. ALEC denied lobbying.[tpl]cite news|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/advocacy-group-files-irs-complaint-152625689.html|title=Advocacy group files IRS complaint against ALEC|publisher=Associated Press|date=April 23, 2012|first=Mike|last=Baker[/tpl] Reporting on the allegations, Bloomberg Businessweek compared ALEC's work to that of lobbyists, noting, "part of ALEC's mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work", and that being a non-profit rather than a lobby group allows deductibility of membership dues, and the freedom not to disclose the names of legislators who attend its educational seminars or the executives who give presentations to those legislators. ALEC responded by denying it engaged in lobbying, while saying that liberal groups were attacking ALEC because "they don't have a comparable group that is as effective as ALEC in enacting policies into law."[tpl]cite news | work = BusinessWeek | title = Republican Group Subject of IRS Complaint on Lobbying | url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-23/republican-group-subject-of-irs-complaint-on-lobbying | first = Jonathan | last = Salant | date = April 23, 2012 | accessdate = May 29, 2012[/tpl] According to Governing magazine, ALEC legislators often have their travel expenses paid as "scholarships" and are "wined and dined and golf-coursed" by private sector members. In July 2013 Common Cause submitted a supplemental brief to the IRS complaining about these practices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=8755339|title=Supplemental Submission IRS Whistleblower complaint on ALEC|date=July 29, 2013[/tpl] 
According to the New York Times, "special interests effectively turn ALEC's lawmaker members into stealth lobbyists, providing them with talking points, signaling how they should vote, and collaborating on bills affecting hundreds of issues like school vouchers and tobacco taxes." The Free Lance-Star has reported that ALEC had "matured into one of Big Business's most effective lobbying tools."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=20020610&id=PfEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pwgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6087,2665669|title=ALEC's friends bill taxpayers: Biggest industries come to control lobbying council|date=June 10, 2002|publisher=The Free Lance-Star|page=A1|first=Hank|last=Shaw[/tpl] Alan Rosenthal, a former Rutgers University political science professor and an influential expert on state legislatures and lobbying,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/alan_rosenthal_influential_new_jersey_academic_dies.html|title=Alan Rosenthal, politically influential New Jersey academic, dies|date=July 11, 2013|work=The Star-Ledger|first=Matt|last=Friedman[/tpl] said of ALEC, "You've had the interest groups having access and sitting on other task forces, but here you've really perfected it.... You've not only got them gaining access and interacting with legislators but you have them shaping policy together. It seems to me that's a pretty major advance." Edwin Bender, executive director of the nonpartisan[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/05/us-usa-politics-virginia-factbox-idUSBRE9A40FC20131105|title=Factbox: Candidates, money in Virginia governor's race|publisher=Reuters|date=November 5, 2013|first=Ian|last=Simpson[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-29/san-jose-pension-crush-spurs-bid-to-ease-california-pacts.html|title=San Jose Pension Crush Spurs Bid to Ease California Pacts|date=November 28, 2013|publisher=Bloomberg News|first=Alison|last=Vekshin[/tpl] National Institute on Money in State Politics, has said, "What makes ALEC different is its effectiveness in not just bringing the people together but selling a piece of legislation that was written by the industry and for the industry and selling it as a piece of mainstream legislation."
"ALEC is unique in the sense that it puts legislators and companies together and they create policy collectively," said Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state representative and ALEC task force chair. Vance Wilkins, a former Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates and ALEC member, said in 2002, "Just because business writes a bill doesn't make it bad. We get bills from all angles. And we still have to debate the issue." Harvey Morgan, another former Virginia delegate and ALEC member, said of ALEC conferences, "You know before you go that the big-business view will prevail, and that's not necessarily bad. I still would like them to be a little more objective."
Farley has said of ALEC's activities: [tpl]quote|I just want to emphasize it's fine for corporations to be involved in the process. Corporations have the right to present their arguments, but they don't have the right to do it secretly. They don't have the right to lobby people and not register as lobbyists. They don't have the right to take people away on trips, convince them of it, send them back here, and then nobody has seen what's gone on and how that legislator had gotten that idea and where is it coming from. All I'm asking... is to make sure that all of those expenses are reported as if they are lobbying expenses and all those gifts that legislators received are reported as if they're receiving gifts from lobbyists. So the public can find out and make up their own minds about who is influencing what."[/tpl]
ALEC has created a related 501(c)(4) organization called the "Jeffersonian Project" that, according to The Guardian, "would allow Alec to be far more overt in its lobbying activities than its current charitable status as a 501(c)(3)."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/alec-funding-crisis-big-donors-trayvon-martin |title=ALEC facing funding crisis from donor exodus in wake of Trayvon Martin row |first1=Ed |last1=Pilkington |first2=Suzanne |last2=Goldenberg |date=December 3, 2013 |work=The Guardian[/tpl]

==Funding==

According to ALECwatch and IRS documents, ALEC receives 95% of its funding from foundations, corporations, other nonprofits, meeting revenue and the sale of its publications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alecwatch.org/chapterfour.html|title=Corporate America's Trojan Horse in the States:The Untold Story Behind the American Legislative Exchange Council|publisher=ALECWatch[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/public-reporting/|title=Public Reporting|publisher=American Legislative Exchange Council[/tpl] Legislators pay $100 in annual membership dues, while corporations pay $10,000, or often much more. In 2010 NPR reported that tax records showed that corporations had collectively paid as much as $6 million a year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2010/10/29/130891396/shaping-state-laws-with-little-scrutiny|title=Shaping State Laws With Little Scrutiny|publisher=NPR|first=Laura|last=Sullivan|date=October 29, 1010[/tpl]
Koch Industries Inc. was one of 14 “Vice Chairman” level sponsors at ALEC's 2010 annual meeting, which requires a $25,000 donation. According to tax records, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation gave $75,858 to ALEC in 2009. Exxon Mobil's foundation donated $30,000 in both 2005 and 2006. Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company paid $39,000 in dues in 2010 and sponsored a reception at the annual meeting in San Diego for $25,000. In August 2011, Exxon spent $45,000 to sponsor a workshop on natural gas.[tpl]cite web|last=Fitzgerald |first=Alison |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-21/koch-exxon-mobil-among-corporations-helping-write-state-laws.html |title=Koch, Exxon Mobil Among Corporations Helping Write State Laws |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl] According to the Center For Public Integrity, ALEC received $150,000 from Charles and David Koch in 2011 to help finance its activities.[tpl]cite web|last=Abowd|first=Paul|title=Koch brothers pour more cash into think tanks, ALEC|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/01/31/12105/koch-brothers-pour-more-cash-think-tanks-alec|work=January 31, 2013|publisher=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl]
According to a December 2013 article appearing in The Guardian, ALEC is facing a funding shortfall after losing more than a third of its projected income. Some 400 state legislators have left its membership along with more than 60 corporate donors.Ed Pilkington and Suzanne Goldenberg (3 December 2013).
