The giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), also known as the brindlebass, brown spotted cod, or bumblebee grouper, and as the Queensland groper in Australia, is the largest bony fish found in coral reefs, and the aquatic emblem of Queensland, Australia. It is found from near the surface to depths of [tpl]convert|100|m|abbr=on[/tpl] at reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with the exception of the Persian Gulf. It also enters estuaries.[tpl]FishBase species | genus = Epinephelus | species = lanceolatus | month = May | year = 2012[/tpl] It reaches up to [tpl]convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and [tpl]convert|400|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in weight; there are unconfirmed reports of it growing much bigger, up to [tpl]convert|3.05|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|598|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Giant groupers feed on a variety of marine life, including small sharks and juvenile sea turtles. Due to overfishing, this species has declined drastically in many regions, and it is now considered Vulnerable by the IUCN.
The Queensland grouper has also been found to inhabit the fresh-water of the Brisbane River of Queensland, Australia.
This giant fish is similar to the Malabar grouper, and its colour changes with age.  The giant grouper has a large mouth and a rounded tail.  Juveniles have irregular black and yellow markings, while adults are green-grey to grey-brown with faint mottling, with numerous small black spots on the fins.
