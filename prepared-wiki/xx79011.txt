Viscount Bolingbroke is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It is held by Nick St John who lives in Sydney, Australia and grew up in New Zealand.  It was created in 1712 for the Hon. Henry St John. He was made Baron St John, of Lydiard Tregoze in the County of Wilts, at the same time, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Since 1751 the titles are merged with the titles of Viscount St John and Baron St John, in the County of Surrey, both also in the Peerage of Great Britain.
John St John (d. 1648) was the great-great-great-grandson of Oliver St John (d. 1497) (whose elder brother Sir John St John (d. c. 1488) was the ancestor of the Barons St John of Bletsoe and Earls of Bolingbroke), second son of Sir Oliver St John (d. 1437), the husband of Margaret, great-great-granddaughter of Roger de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Bletshoe (d. 1380). His uncle was Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison (a title now held by the Earl of Jersey). On 22 May 1611 he was created a Baronet, of Lydiard Tregoze in the County of Wilts, in the Baronetage of England.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage 1900  St John later represented Wiltshire in Parliament and was a strong supporter of King Charles I during the Civil War. His younger son, the third Baronet, represented both Wiltshire and Wootton Bassett in Parliament. His son, the fourth Baronet, also represented these constituencies in the House of Commons. In 1716 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron St John, in the County of Surrey, and Viscount St John, with remainder to his second and third sons, as his eldest son Henry St John had already been created Baron St John, of Lydiard Tregoze in the County of Wilts, and Viscount Bolingbroke in 1712 see below).
