He has been a Tehsil Nazim Municipal Administrator of Tehsil city or sub division Jaranwala. He became administrator for the first time by winning the elections in 2004 from Pakistan Muslim League Quied-e-Azam.  He was not just successful in his elections but also in his goals and agendas. He did a lot of construction work, made the sewerage system better and built new governmental official buildings. In the next election terms he did not get a seat from his party PML-Q. So he had to run in the election by himself, which was the major cause for him to lose the elections for next term for Tehsil Nazim.
In 2008 he was elected to the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab as a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party.[tpl]cite news |title=Construction of Lahore-Faisalabad Road : Make agreement public, demand PA members |author= |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C02%5C07%5Cstory_7-2-2009_pg13_1 |newspaper=Daily Times |date=February 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011[/tpl]
