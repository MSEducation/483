CATEGORIES: Proprietary database management systems

Nonstop SQL is a commercial relational database management system that is designed for fault tolerance and scalability, currently sold by Hewlett Packard. The latest version of the product is SQL/MX 3.2.1 which was released in February 2013. 
The product was originally developed by Tandem Computers. Tandem was acquired by Compaq in 1997. Compaq was later acquired by Hewlett Packard in 2001.  
The product primarily is used for online transaction processing and is tailored for organizations that need high availability and scalability for their database system. Typical users of the product are stock exchanges and bank ATM networks

==History==

NonStop SQL is designed to run effectively on parallel computers, adding functionality for distributed data, distributed execution, and distributed transactions.
First released in 1987, a second version in 1989 added the ability to run queries in parallel, and the product became fairly famous for being one of the few systems that scales almost linearly with the number of processors in the machine: adding a second CPU to an existing NonStop SQL server will almost exactly double its performance.
The second version added /MP to its name, for Massively Parallel. A third version, NonStop SQL/MX, was an attempt by Tandem Computers to create a product that was more SQL ANSI compliant than its predecessor. To enter competition with other vendors like Oracle, it was developed in the mid 1990s for the Microsoft Windows NT operating system, but the product never came out on NT and the focus was redirected to developing it on the NonStop platform. NonStop SQL/MX has shipped on the NonStop platform since 2002, and can access tables that have been created by NonStop SQL/MP, although only "Native SQL/MX tables" offer the ANSI compliance and many "Oracle-like" enhancements. HP Neoview business intelligence platform was built using Nonstop SQL as its origins. Nonstop SQL/MX still thrives today and is the only OLTP database product HP owns.
