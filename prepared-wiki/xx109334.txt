Legend of the Liquid Sword is the fourth solo studio album by American hip hop artist GZA, a member of the Wu-Tang Clan. It was released December 10, 2002. The album is named after the kung fu film Legend of the Liquid Sword. In the songs "Did Ya Say That", and "Knock Knock", GZA focuses on the politics of record labels, and expresses his issues in dealing with record companies over artistic goals in music. It would also be known as MCA Records' last two projects along with rapper Common's fifth album, Electric Circus, before the label was dissolved and absorbed by Geffen Records.

==Critical reception==

Many fans will argue whether or not this album was a sincere effort on GZA's part due to the time of the release and the less commercial appeal. The album has been praised for GZA's consistent fan appreciated lyrics, yet accused of having "bland" production, which is often argued.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.junkmedia.org/index2.php?i=481 |title=the appeal of this record eventually runs dry on production grounds. Perhaps the GZA's delivery lends itself to a specific type of beat, because the ten producers on Legend never push beyond a limited variety of sounds |publisher=Junkmedia.org |date=2003-01-28 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]The productions on Legend of the Liquid Sword are below average for a talent like his, but chances are good that's by design; since GZA is a rapper's rapper, his smooth flow and excellent imagination are all that's necessary to propel any of these tracks.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Posted by MVRemix |url=http://mvremix.com/urban_blogs/2008/03/30/gza-legend-of-the-liquid-sword-review/ |title="Legend" is a thicker LP than "Beneath The Surface" but it does not have that Rza production that the original "Liquid Swords" had |publisher=Mvremix.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine said: "The man simply is brilliant, and although these aren’t the lyrics that will appeal to most, they are certainly some of the best. It’s just like why simple books appeal to the masses – most people can’t comprehend this much depth."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/the-gza/legend-of-the-liquid-sword.htm |title=The GZA - Legend of the Liquid Sword - Review |publisher=Stylus Magazine |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
Jonah Weiner of Blender magazine stated: "This abstract skill put his 1995 masterpiece, Liquid Swords (name-checked here in the title and every other song), in the running for best Wu solo album, but dense, volatile production pushed it over the top — the prosaic soul loops here are solid enough, but fall short of the legend."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=155 |title=Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur |publisher=Blender |date=2001-09-15 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
The overall sound of the album conflicted much of the mainstream hip-hop at the time of its release. Samira Niazy of prefixmag.com rated the album 8.0 out of 10 and concluded: "One of the things you'll notice is that GZA's more unique sic and real style shines through because he focuses on lyricism rather than distracting the listener with loud instrumental background noise. It draws your attention to his best asset, his distinct style. Thankfully, Legend of the Liquid Sword sounds nothing like the hip-pop that's on heavy rotation on hip-hop stations right now."[tpl]cite web|author=Samira Niazy |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/cds/G/gzagenius/legend-of-the-liquid-sword/251 |title=GZA: Legend of the Liquid Sword |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
Though many opinions varied on whether the album was the classic "Wu-Tang sound", Ari Levenfeld of PopMatters feels: "If Legend of the Liquid Sword is any indication of the Wu-Tang Clan's efforts to come, it doesn't seem like the group is all that interested in expanding their fan base or growing musically. Maybe they've done what they set out to do. The franchise is working... GZA isn't trying to be something or someone he's not. He's all about the original recipe."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/g/gzagenius-legend.shtml |title=GZA/Genius: Legend of the Liquid Sword - PopMatters Music Review |publisher=Popmatters.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12[/tpl]
