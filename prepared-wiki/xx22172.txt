Measles, also known as morbilli, English measles, or rubeola (and not to be confused with rubella or roseola) is an infection of the respiratory system, immune system and skin caused by a virus, specifically a paramyxovirus of the genus Morbillivirus.[tpl]cite web|title=Measles|work=Merck Manual Professional|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.|date=September 2013|accessdate=23 March 2014|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/miscellaneous_viral_infections_in_infants_and_children/measles.html|editor=Caserta, MT[/tpl] Symptoms usually develop 7–14 days (average 10-12) after exposure to an infected person and the initial symptoms usually include a high fever (often > 40 °C 104 °F), Koplik's spots (spots in the mouth, these usually appear 1–2 days prior to the rash and last 3–5 days), malaise, loss of appetite, hacking cough (although this may be the last symptom to appear), runny nose and red eyes.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Longo | first1 = D | last2 =  | first2 =  | last3 =  | first3 =  | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | language =  | volume = | year = 2011 | url =  | isbn = 978-0-07174889-6 | author2 = Fauci, A; Kasper, D; Hauser, S; Jameson, J; Loscalzo, J | editor1-last =  | edition = 18 | editor1-first =  | oclc =  | editor2-link =  | location = New York | series =  | chapter =  | editor3-last =  | trans_title =  | quote =  | editor2-last =  | editor3-first =  | origyear =  | authorlink1 =  | authorlink2 =  | authorlink3 =  | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | editor3-link =  | work =  | editor2-first =  | editor1-link =  [/tpl] After this comes a spot-like rash that covers much of the body. The course of measles, provided there are no complications, such as bacterial infections, usually lasts about 7–10 days.[tpl]cite web|title=Measles|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=23 March 2014|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/966220-overview#showall|author=Chen, SSP; Fennelly, G; Burnett, M; Domachowske, J; Dyne, PL; Elston, DM; DeVore, HK; Krilov, LR; Krusinski, P; Patterson, JW; Sawtelle, S; Taylor, GA; Wells, MJ; Wilkes, G; Windle, ML; Young, GM|editor=Steele, RW[/tpl]
Measles is spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission), and is highly contagious—90% of people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person will catch it.[tpl]cite report|date=May 16, 2012|title=Risk of infection East and Southwest Asia|url=http://occucareinternational.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/East-and-southeast-asia.pdf|publisher=Occucare International|page=6[/tpl] An asymptomatic incubation period occurs nine to twelve days from initial exposure.[tpl]cite journal |author=C.

The rash usually appears between 2–3 days after the onset of illness.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40000391/ |title=Measles [/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

The classic signs and symptoms of measles include four-day fevers 4 D's  and the three Cs—cough, coryza (head cold), and conjunctivitis (red eyes)—along with fever and rashes. The fever may reach up to [tpl]convert|40|C[/tpl]. Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen, even in confirmed cases of measles, because they are transient and may disappear within a day of arising. Their recognition, before the affected person reaches maximum infectivity can be used to reduce spread of epidemics.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baxby|first=Derrick|title=Classic Paper: Henry Koplik.

The characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash that begins several days after the fever starts. It starts on the back of the ears and, after a few hours, spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing itching. The measles rash appears two to four days after the initial symptoms and lasts for up to eight days. The rash is said to "stain", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing.NHS UK: Symptoms of measles. Last reviewed: 26/01/2010.

===Complications===

Complications with measles are relatively common, ranging from mild and less serious complications such as diarrhea to more serious ones such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia),[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Yasunaga | first1 = H. | last2 = Shi | first2 = Y. | last3 = Takeuchi | first3 = M. | last4 = Horiguchi | first4 = H. | last5 = Hashimoto | first5 = H. | last6 = Matsuda | first6 = S. | last7 = Ohe | first7 = K. | title = Measles-related hospitalizations and complications in Japan, 2007-2008 | journal = Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan) | volume = 49 | issue = 18 | pages = 1965–1970 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20847499 | doi = 10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3843 [/tpl] otitis media,[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = W.

==Cause==

Measles is caused by the measles virus, a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus Morbillivirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus was first isolated in 1954 by Nobel Laureate John F. Enders and Thomas Peebles, who were careful to point out that the isolations were made from patients who had Koplik's spots.[tpl]cite journal | author = ENDERS JF, PEEBLES TC | title = Propagation in tissue culture of cytopathogenic agents from patients with measles | journal = Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–86 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13177653 [/tpl]   Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no other animal reservoirs are known to exist. This highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.

Risk factors for severe measles and its complications include the following:

==Diagnosis==

Clinical diagnosis of measles requires a history of fever of at least three days, with at least one of the three C's (cough, coryza, conjunctivitis). Observation of Koplik's spots is also diagnostic of measles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bannerhealth.com/Locations/Arizona/Banner+Gateway+Medical+Center/For+Physicians/News+for+Physicians/_Bug+of+the+Month+-+Measles.htm|title=Bug of the Month—Measles|date=April 2012|work=Banner Gateway Medical Center|accessdate=May 3, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Actual Confirmed Measles Cases in UK|author=Total Health|url=http://www.totalhealth.co.uk/blog/actual-confirmed-measles-cases-uk|newspaper=totalhealth|date=May 5, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2013[/tpl]
Alternatively, laboratory diagnosis of measles can be done with confirmation of positive measles IgM antibodies[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Helfand | first1 = R. F. | last2 = Heath | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = L. J. | last4 = Maes | first4 = E. F. | last5 = Guris | first5 = D. | last6 = Bellini | first6 = W.

The contact with any infected person in any way, including semen through sex, saliva, or mucus, can cause infection.

==Prevention==

In developed countries,  children are immunized against measles by the age of 18 months, generally as part of a three-part MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). The vaccination is generally not given earlier than this because sufficient antimeasles immunoglobulins (antibodies) are acquired via the placenta from the mother during pregnancy may persist to prevent the vaccine viruses from being effective.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] A second dose is usually given to children between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Vaccination rates have been high enough to make measles relatively uncommon. Adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, with fever and pain at the injection site being the most common. Life threatening adverse reactions occur in less than one per million vaccinations (In developing countries where measles is highly endemic, WHO doctors recommend two doses of vaccine be given at six and nine months of age. The vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not.[tpl]cite journal|author=Helfand RF|title=Evaluation of the immune response to a 2-dose measles vaccination schedule administered at 6 and 9 months of age to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children in Malawi|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2008|volume=198|issue=10|pmid=18828743|pages=1457–65|doi=10.1086/592756|author-separator=,|author2=Witte D|author3=Fowlkes A|display-authors=3|last4=Garcia|first4=Philip|last5=Yang|first5=Chunfu|last6=Fudzulani|first6=Richard|last7=Walls|first7=Laura|last8=Bae|first8=Sun|last9=Strebel|first9=Peter|first10=Robin|first11=William J.[/tpl] The vaccine is less effective in HIV-infected infants than in the general population, but early treatment with antiretroviral drugs can increase its effectiveness.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Ołdakowska | first1 = A. | last2 = Marczyńska | first2 = M. | title = Measles vaccination in HIV infected children | journal = Medycyna wieku rozwojowego | volume = 12 | issue = 2 Pt 2 | pages = 675–680 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19418943 [/tpl] Measles vaccination programs are often used to deliver other child health interventions, as well, such as bed nets to protect against malaria, antiparasite medicine and vitamin A supplements, and so contribute to the reduction of child deaths from other causes.UNICEF Joint Press Release
Unvaccinated populations are at risk for the disease. Traditionally low vaccination rates in northern Nigeria dropped further in the early 2000s when radical preachers promoted a rumor that polio vaccines were a Western plot to sterilize Muslims and infect them with HIV. The number of cases of measles rose significantly, and hundreds of children died.[tpl]cite news |title= Measles kills more than 500 children so far in 2005 |publisher=IRIN |date=2005-03-21 |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=53506 |accessdate=2007-08-13[/tpl] This could also have had to do with the aforementioned other health-promoting measures often given with the vaccine.

==Treatment==

There is no specific treatment for measles. Most patients with uncomplicated measles will recover with rest and supportive treatment. It is, however, important to seek medical advice if the patient becomes more unwell, as they may be developing complications.
Some patients will develop pneumonia as a sequel to the measles. Other complications include ear infections, bronchitis, and encephalitis.[tpl]cite web|title=Complications of Measles|url=http://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/complications.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevnetion (CDC)[/tpl] Acute measles encephalitis has a mortality rate of 15%. While there is no specific treatment for measles encephalitis, antibiotics are required for bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis that can follow measles.
All other treatment addresses symptoms, with ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting bronchodilator for cough. As for aspirin, some research has suggested a correlation between children who take aspirin and the development of Reye syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Starko KM, Ray CG, Dominguez LB, Stromberg WL, Woodall DF | title = Reye's Syndrome and Salicylate Use | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 859–64 | date = 6 Dec 1980 | pmid = 7454476 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/6/859 | quote = It is postulated that salicylate by school-age children, operating in a dose-dependent manner, possibly potentiated by fever, represents a primary causative agent of Reye's syndrome. | accessdate = 2011-03-17 [/tpl] Some research has shown aspirin may not be the only medication associated with Reye, and even antiemetics have been implicated,[tpl]cite journal | author = Casteels-Van Daele M, Van Geet C, Wouters C, Eggermont E | title = Reye syndrome revisited: a descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 641–8 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 11014461 | doi = 10.1007/PL00008399 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/kb0pe634bymrn2ur/ | quote = Reye syndrome is a non-specific descriptive term covering a group of heterogeneous disorders.

The use of vitamin A in treatment has been investigated.  A systematic review of trials into its use found no significant reduction in overall mortality, but it did reduce mortality in children aged under two years.[tpl]cite journal |author=Huiming Y, Chaomin W, Meng M |title=Vitamin A for treating measles in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD001479 |year=2005 |pmid=16235283 |editor1-last=Yang |editor1-first=Huiming | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001479.pub3[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=D'Souza RM, D'Souza R |title=Vitamin A for treating measles in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD001479 |year=2002 |pmid=11869601 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001479 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=D'Souza RM, D'Souza R |title=Vitamin A for preventing secondary infections in children with measles—a systematic review |journal=J.

==Prognosis==

The majority of patients survive measles, though in some cases, complications may occur, which may include bronchitis, and—in about 1 in 100,000 caseshttp://radiopaedia.org/articles/sub-acute-sclerosing-panencephalitis “Sub acute sclerosing panencephalitis”—panencephalitis, which is usually fatal.http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/subacute_panencephalitis/subacute_panencephalitis.htm “NINDS Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis Information Page” The patient may spread the disease to an immunocompromised patient, for whom the risk of death is much higher, due to complications such as giant cell pneumonia. Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. It typically occurs two days to one week after the breakout of the measles exanthem and begins with very high fever, severe headache, convulsions and altered mentation. A patient may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.[tpl]MerckManual|14|193|b||[/tpl]
