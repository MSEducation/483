Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan OBE FRSL (15 May 1934 – 2 August 2012) was a British military historian, lecturer, writer and journalist. He was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle.

==Life and career==

Keegan was born in Clapham, London, on 15 May 1934, to a family of Irish Catholic extraction. His father saw active service in the First World War.
At the age of 13 Keegan contracted orthopaedic tuberculosis, which subsequently affected his gait. The long-term effects of his tuberculosis rendered him unfit for military service, and the timing of his birth made him too young for service in the Second World War, as mentioned in his works as an ironic observation on his profession and interest.Interview (transcripted May 1994) The illness also interrupted his education during his teenage years; however, his education included a period at King's College, Taunton, and two years at Wimbledon College, which led to entry to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1953. Following graduation he worked at the American Embassy in London for three years.Daniel Snowman: John Keegan History Today, volume 50, issue 5.2000
In 1960 he was appointed to a lectureship in Military History at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the training establishment for officers of the British Army.  Holding the post for 26 years, he became senior lecturer in military history during his tenure.  During this period he also held a visiting professorship at Princeton University and was Delmas Distinguished Professor of History at Vassar College.Back cover of The First World War.

==Opinions on contemporary conflicts==

===Vietnam===

When asked about the Vietnam War, Keegan repled: "I will never oppose the Vietnam War. Americans were right to do it. I think they fought it in the wrong way. I don't think it's a war like fighting Hitler, but I think it was a right war, a correct war."[tpl]cite web |last= Binder |first= David |date= 2 August 2012 |title= John Keegan, Historian Who Put a Face on War, Dies at 78 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/books/sir-john-keegan-historian-who-put-a-face-on-war-dies-at-78.html |publisher= NYTimes.com |accessdate= 10 August 2012 [/tpl]

===Kosovo===

Keegan believed that NATO's bombing of Serbia and Serbian targets in Kosovo in 1999 showed that air power alone could win wars.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Byman |first1= Daniel L. |last2= Waxman |first2= Matthew C. |author2-link= Matthew Waxman |year=2000 |title= Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate |url= http://www18.georgetown.edu/data/people/dlb32/publication-31936.pdf |journal= International Security |volume= 24 |issue= 4 |pages= 5–38 |quote= I didn't want to change my beliefs, but there was too much evidence accumulating to stick to the article of faith. It now does look as if airpower has prevailed in the Balkans, and that the time has come to redefine how victory in war may be won. |doi=10.1162/016228800560291[/tpl]

===Iraq War===

An article in the  Christian Science Monitor called  Keegan a "staunch supporter" of the Iraq War. The article quotes Keegan:  "Uncomfortable as the 'spectacle of raw military force' is, he concludes, that the Iraq war represents 'a better guide to what needs to be done to secure the safety of our world than any amount of law-making or treaty-writing can offer.[tpl]' "[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last= Scott Tyson |first= Ann |date= 8 June 2004 |title= America's bewildering battle in Iraq follows new rules |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0608/p15s01-bogn.html |publisher= CSMonitor.com |accessdate= 10 August 2012 [/tpl]  He frequently justified the war by making comparisons between it and other, more popular wars, such as both World Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.[tpl]Citation needed|date= August 2012[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Keegan was also criticized by peers, including Sir Michael HowardMichael Howard, "To the Ruthless Belong the Spoils," The New York Times Book Review, 14 November 1993. and Christopher Bassford War in History, November 1994, pp.319-336, Christopher Bassford available at "Clausewitz.com for his critical position on Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian officer and author of Vom Kriege (On War), one of the basic texts on warfare and military strategy. Keegan was described as "profoundly mistaken" and Bassford stated that "Nothing anywhere in Keegan's work – despite his many diatribes about Clausewitz and 'the Clausewitzians' – reflects any reading whatsoever of Clausewitz's own writings."  The political scientist Richard Betts also criticized Keegan's understanding of the political dimensions of war, writing that Keegan was "a naïf about politics."[tpl]cite journal|title = Is Strategy and Illusion? | journal = International Security | volume = 25 | issue = 2 |date=Fall 2000 | first = Richard | last = Betts| page = 25[/tpl]

==Honours==

On 29 June 1991, as a war correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, Keegan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) "in recognition of service within the operations in the Gulf".[tpl]London Gazette |issue=52588 |date=28 June 1991 |startpage=23 |endpage=28 |supp=yes |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl] In the Millennium New Year Honours, he was knighted "for services to Military History".[tpl]London Gazette |issue=55710 |date=31 December 1999 |startpage=1 |endpage=2 |supp=yes |accessdate=2012-08-07[/tpl]

==Published work==

Keegan's books include a traditional battle-by-battle coverage of conflict, experience of the individual, historical causes of military events, technological change in warfare, military strategy, and challenges of leadership. He wrote mainly for the educated non-specialist reader.[tpl]Citation needed|date= August 2012[/tpl] His histories of war include those of the First and Second World Wars. His work examined warfare throughout history, including human prehistory and the classical era; however the majority of his work concentrated on the 14th Century onwards to modern conflict of the 20th and 21st Centuries. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
In A History of Warfare, Keegan outlined the development and limitations of warfare from prehistory to the modern era. It looked at various topics, including the use of horses, logistics, and "fire". One key concept put forward was that war is inherently cultural.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/books/sir-john-keegan-historian-who-put-a-face-on-war-dies-at-78.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=John Keegan, Historian of War and Warriors, Dies at 78|last=Binder|first=David|date=3 August 2012|work=The New York Times|page=10|accessdate=29 January 2013[/tpl] In the introduction, he rigorously denounced the idiom "war is a continuation of policy by other means", rejecting on its face "Clausewitzian" ideas. Keegan's discussion of Clausewitz was, however, heavily criticized as uninformed and inaccurate, by writers like Peter Paret, Christopher Bassford, and Richard M. Swain.Christopher Bassford, "John Keegan and the Grand Tradition of Trashing Clausewitz," War in History, November 1994, pp. 319-36 In another controversial position, Keegan claimed that cultural forces, not technology, produced the enhanced mayhem of the World Wars. Specifically, Keegan stated that mandatory public education created a homogenized populace that was more willing to accept conscription and other governmental demands.[tpl]Citation needed|date= August 2012[/tpl]
He also contributed to work on historiography in modern conflict. With Richard Holmes he wrote the BBC documentary Soldiers, a history of men in battle. Frank C. Mahncke wrote that Keegan is seen as being "among the most prominent and widely read military historians of the late twentieth century".Naval War College - Frank C. Mahncke, Naval War College In a book-cover blurb extracted from a more complex article, Sir Michael Howard wrote, "at once the most readable and the most original of living historians".The New York Times Book Review - Sir Michael Howard
Keegan's Fields of Battle: The Wars for North America, which gave accounts of many of the wars fought on the soil of North America, also contained opening and closing essays on his own personal relationship to America. He continued his interest in American military history with the publication of his book The American Civil War (2009, Hutchinson).
