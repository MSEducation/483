The Church of St. Frances de Chantal is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at Harding Avenue at Throggs Neck Blvd., Bronx, New York City. The parish was established in 1927.
The present Brutalist-style church structure was built 1971 to designs by Paul Reilly. The identity of the architect is somewhat in question with Paul W. Reilly of 393 Seventh Avenue, New York City, New York 10001, claiming the church as his own in the American Architects Directory, whereas the AIA Guide to NYC (2nd to 5th editions) attributes the design to Paul J. Reilly. Colorful chunks of stained glass are set directly into the concrete in the style of the then-contemporary European post-war stained-glass work.
The Church is part of a parish that also includes a school located directly across the street, know as St. Frances de Chantal School.
