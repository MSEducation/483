CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Cosmophasis is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Some species occur in Africa, while most are found in Southeast Asia, down to Australia. Although most species more or less mimic ants, there are also colorful speciesJerzy Proszynski: Cosmophasis that follow a different strategy.
C. bitaeniata uses chemical mimicry to be accepted by the aggressive weaver ant species Oecophylla smaragdina.Nelson et al. 2006
One species, said to be not a particularly good ant mimic, was observed living near and preying on ants. According to (Murphy & Murphy, 2000), "to watch the spider stalking and killing its prey is an arachnological spectacular".Murphy & Murphy 2000: 304
