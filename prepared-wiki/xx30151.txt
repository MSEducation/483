The fourth wall is the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled box set in a proscenium theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play.[tpl]cite book |last=Bell |first=Elizabeth S. |title=Theories of Performance |year=2008 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4129-2637-9 |page=203 [/tpl].[tpl]cite book |last=Wallis |first=Mick |last2=Shepherd |first2=Simon |title=Studying plays |year=1998 |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-73156-7 |page=214[/tpl]. The idea of the fourth wall was made explicit by philosopher and critic Denis Diderot and spread in 19th-century theatre with the advent of theatrical realism,"The Fourth Wall and the Third Space" by John Stevenson, creator or Playback Theatre. which extended the idea to the imaginary boundary between any fictional work and its audience.
Speaking directly to or otherwise acknowledging the audience through a camera in a film or television program, or through this imaginary wall in a play, is referred to as "breaking the fourth wall" and is considered a technique of metafiction, as it penetrates the boundaries normally set up by works of fiction.[tpl]Cite book |last=Abelman |first=Robert |title=Reaching a critical mass: a critical analysis of television entertainment |year=1998 |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-8058-2199-6 |pages=8–11[/tpl]. This can also occur in literature and video games when a character acknowledges the reader or player.
The fourth wall should not be confused with the aside or the soliloquy, dramatic devices often used by playwrights where the character on stage is delivering an inner monologue, giving the audience insight into their thoughts.

==Convention of modern theatre==

The presence of the fourth wall is an established convention of modern realistic theatre, which has led some artists to draw direct attention to it for dramatic or comedic effect when a boundary is "broken", for example by an actor onstage speaking to the audience directly. It is common in children's theatre where, for example, a character might ask the children for help. One play that uses the fourth wall extensively is   The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged), which uses it for comedic effect. 
The acceptance of the transparency of the fourth wall is part of the suspension of disbelief between a fictional work and an audience, allowing them to enjoy the fiction as if they were observing real events.  Although the critic Vincent Canby described it in 1987 as "that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage".[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/movies/film-view-sex-can-spoil-the-scene.html |title=Film view: sex can spoil the scene |last=Canby |first=Vincent |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 28, 1987 |page=A.17 |accessdate=July 3, 2007 [/tpl].

==Outside theatre==

The metaphor of the fourth wall has been used by the actor Sir Ian McKellen with regard to the work of the painter L. S. Lowry:
[tpl]quote|Lowry ... stood across the road from his subjects and observed. Often enough there are a number of individuals in a crowd peering back at him. They invite us momentarily into their world, like characters on a stage sometimes do, breaking the fourth-wall illusion.[tpl]cite news|work=The Telegraph|date=21 April 2011|title=Sir Ian McKellen: My lifelong passion for LS Lowry |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8467565/Sir-Ian-McKellen-My-lifelong-passion-for-LS-Lowry.html[/tpl][/tpl]
McKellen justifies this application of the theatre term to Lowry's art by explaining that "Lowry’s mid-air viewpoint is like a view from the dress circle", looking down as if to a stage. And, McKellen argues, Lowry "often marks the limits of the street scene with curbstones or a pavement that feel like the edge of the stage where the footlights illuminate the action."
The metaphor of the fourth wall has been applied by literary critic David Barnett to The Harvard Lampoon's parody of The Lord of the Rings when a character breaks the conventions of storytelling by referring to the text itself. The character Frodo observes "it was going to be a long epic", which in Barnett's view "breaks the 'fourth wall[tpl]'"[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |last=Barnett |first=David |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/feb/08/tolkien-bored-of-the-rings?intcmp=239 |title=After Tolkien, get Bored of the Rings |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2012[/tpl]
Woody Allen broke the fourth wall several times in his movie Annie Hall, as he explained, "because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them."[tpl]cite book|last=Björkman|first=Stig |authorlink=Stig Björkman|title=Woody Allen on Woody Allen  |year=1995 |origyear=1993|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London |isbn=0-571-17335-7 |page=77[/tpl]
On television, breaking the fourth wall is rare, though it has been done throughout the history of the medium. George Burns did it numerous times on the 1950s sitcom he starred in with his real-life wife Gracie Allen.http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-george-burns-and-gracie-allen-show/cast/200294 A regular proponent of it is the main character of the Irish sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys. Mrs Brown, regularly breaks the fourth wall, talking to the audience, and will run from set to set (for instance to retrieve a prop needed from a scene, left in another set). Mrs Brown will also drop character to comment on a situation,[tpl]cite news|last=Dessau|first=Bruce|title=Mrs Brown's Boys: mainstream comedy for the middle-aged|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/mar/01/mrs-browns-boys|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 March 2011[/tpl] or wish a happy holiday to the viewing audience.  Another television character who regularly breaks the fourth wall is Francis Urquhart in the British TV drama series House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut. Urquhart addresses the audience several times during each episode, giving the viewer comments on his own actions on the show.[tpl]cite book|last=Cartmell|first=Deborah|title=The Cambridge Companion to Literature on Screen|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521614864|pages=244[/tpl] The same technique is also used in the American adaptation of House of Cards.[tpl]cite web |last=Macaulay |first=Scott |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/69368-breaking-the-fourth-wall-supercut/ |title=Breaking the Fourth Wall Supercut |publisher=Filmmaker |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=5 July 2013[/tpl]

==Fifth wall==

The term "fifth wall" is often used by analogy with the "fourth wall" for a metaphorical barrier in engagement with a medium. It has been used as an extension of the fourth wall concept to refer to the "invisible wall between critics or readers and theatre practitioners."[tpl]Citation |last=Hunte |first=Lynette |last2=Lichtenfels |first2=Peter |title=Shakespeare, Language, and the Stage |location=London |publisher=Arden Shakespeare |year=2005 |page=1 | isbn = 1-904271-49-9 [/tpl].
