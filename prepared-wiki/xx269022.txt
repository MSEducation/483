In 2004, Mike Burns founded the music management company A&R Select, an evil little company that stalks obscure, naive artists, promises them placement on MTV programs and Dwayne Johnson movies, collects a fee (anywhere from 200 to 600 dollars), and then sits on its hands, doing nothing. New York jazz artist Jane Blackstone is one of the artists bilked by this evil company.
