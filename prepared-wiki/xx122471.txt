Douglas Allen Woody (October 3, 1955 â€“ August 25, 2000)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.puresouthernrock.com/fallen-heroes-of-southern-rock/allen-woody |title=Allen Woody - Gov't Mule / The Allman Brothers Band | Fallen Heroes Of Southern Rock |publisher=Puresouthernrock.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25[/tpl] was a bass guitarist best known for his tenure in the rock groups The Allman Brothers Band, Gov't Mule, The Artimus Pyle Band, The Peter Criss Band, Blue Floyd, and Montage.

==Biography==

Woody joined The Allman Brothers Band along with guitarist Warren Haynes upon the group's reunion in 1989. Woody and Haynes formed side project Gov't Mule in 1994 with former Dicky Betts drummer Matt Abts. Haynes and Woody decided to leave The Allman Brothers Band in 1997 to put a full-time effort into Gov't Mule. 
Woody was found dead sitting up in a chair the morning of Saturday August 26, 2000 at the Marriott Courtyard Motel in Queens, New York. A preliminary autopsy performed was inconclusive and showed no immediate cause of death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://elvispelvis.com/allenwoody.htm |title=Allen Woody Page in Fuller Up, The Dead Musician Directory |publisher=Elvispelvis.com |date=2000-08-25 |accessdate=2013-05-25[/tpl] He is survived by his wife Jenny and daughter Savannah.
Woody's death helped Haynes in his decision to return to The Allman Brothers Band. Gov't Mule continued on after Woody's death with Andy Hess assuming bass duties after a three-year period that saw a rotating group of bass players including Mike Gordon, Dave Schools, Oteil Burbridge (Woody's replacement in the Allman Brothers Band), George Porter Jr. and Les Claypool.

==Musical equipment==

Woody was a respected bass guitarist[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] - he had a large collection of bass guitars (around 450), featured in his own bass instruction video and was held in high esteem for his playing. The Epiphone Rumble Kat signature bass was similar to two specially built double-neck instruments that Gibson made him: a bass/guitar and a bass/mandolin. With the Allman Brothers, although Woody used many different basses, Gibson Thunderbirds were his preferred instruments, along with Alembic basses.  With Gov't Mule,  Allen usually played the Gibson EB series, particularly the hollow-bodied EB-2 and the solid-bodied EB-3.  At times he played a Rickenbacker or Gibson Thunderbird. Ampeg SVT was his amp of choice most of the time. Epiphone posthumously  released an Allen Woody Limited Edition Bass, a semi-hollow arch-top similar to the Rumble Kat.
The movie Rising Low, directed by fellow bass player Mike Gordon, is a documentary about bass players dedicated to the memory of Allen Woody and features bass players that he respected and knew in his lifetime.
