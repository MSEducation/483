Los Angeles International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|LAX|KLAX|LAX[/tpl] is the primary airport serving the Greater Los Angeles Area, the second-most populated metropolitan area in the United States. It is most often referred to by its IATA airport code LAX, with the letters pronounced individually. LAX is located in southwestern Los Angeles along the Pacific coast in the neighborhood of Westchester, [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] from Downtown Los Angeles. It is owned and operated by Los Angeles World Airports, an agency of the Los Angeles city government formerly known as the Department of Airports.
In 2012, LAX was the sixth busiest airport in the world by passenger volume with 63,688,121 passengers, an increase of 3% from 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=798|title=LAX Traffic|accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl] The airport holds the claim for "the world's busiest origin and destination (O & D) airport" in 2011, meaning it had the most non-connecting passengers,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=40 |title=LAX Airport Information: General Information |publisher=Los Angeles World Airports |accessdate=2010-11-18[/tpl][tpl]failed verification|date=June 2013[/tpl] and the third busiest in the world by aircraft movements. It is also the only airport to rank among the top five U.S. airports for both passenger and cargo traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aci-na.org/content/airport-traffic-reports |title=Airport Traffic Reports |publisher=Airports Council International – North America |accessdate=2012-08-19[/tpl]
LAX is the busiest airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area; however, other airports including Bob Hope Airport, John Wayne Airport, Long Beach Airport, and LA/Ontario International Airport also serve the region.  It is also notable for being one of few U.S. airports with four parallel runways (arranged in two pairs), bested only by Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport's five parallel strips.

==History==

In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council selected [tpl]convert|640|acre|sqmi ha[/tpl] in the southern part of Westchester for a new airport for the city. The fields of wheat, barley and lima beans were converted into dirt landing strips without any terminal buildings. It was named Mines Field for William W. Mines, the real estate agent who arranged the deal.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=1108 | title=LAX Early History | work=Los Angeles World Airports | accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] The first structure, Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929 and is in the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_LAX.aspx?id=44 |title=LAX – Airport Information – General Description – Just the Facts |publisher=Lawa.org |accessdate=2010-12-06[/tpl]
Mines Field opened as the airport of Los Angeles in 1930 and the city purchased it to be a municipal airfield in 1937. The name became Los Angeles Airport in 1941 and Los Angeles International Airport in 1949.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lawa.org/lax/LAXSearchHistory.cfm | title=Search history | work=Los Angeles World Airports | accessdate=2008-03-21[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In the 1930s the main airline airports were Burbank Airport (then known as Union Air Terminal, and later Lockheed) in Burbank and the Grand Central Airport in Glendale. (In 1940 the airlines were all at Burbank except for Mexicana's three departures a week from Glendale; in late 1946 most airline flights moved to LAX, but Burbank always retained a few.)Official Guide of the Airways 7/40 and American Aviation Air Traffic Guide 1/46, 12/46 and 6/47
Mines Field did not extend west of Sepulveda Boulevard;[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/assetserver/controller/view/CHS-31004 |title=backwards 1939 aerial view |publisher=Digitallibrary.usc.edu |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] Sepulveda was rerouted circa 1950 to loop around the west ends of the extended east–west runways (now runways 25L and 25R), which by November 1950 were [tpl]convert|6000|ft|m[/tpl] long.Aerial view looking south A tunnel was completed in 1953 allowing Sepulveda Boulevard to revert to straight and pass beneath the two runways; it was the first tunnel of its kind. For the next few years the two runways were [tpl]convert|8500|ft|m[/tpl] long.Airport diagrams for 1956 and 1965
On July 10, 1956, Boeing's 707 prototype (the 367–80) visited LAX. The Los Angeles Times said it was its first appearance at a "commercial airport" outside the Seattle area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jpg1.lapl.org/pics25/00032301.jpg |title=Planes |publisher=Index of / |accessdate=2013-11-01[/tpl]
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed 66 weekday departures on United Airlines, 32 American Airlines, 32 Western Airlines, 27 TWA, nine Southwest, five Bonanza Air Lines and three Mexicana Airlines; also 22 flights a week on Pan American World Airways and five a week on Scandinavian Airlines (the only direct flights from California to Europe).
American Airlines' 707-123s flew the first jet passengers out of LAX to New York in January 1959; the first wide-body jets were TWA's Boeing 747s to New York in early 1970.
In 1958, the architecture firm Pereira & Luckman was contracted to plan the re-design of the airport for the "jet age". The plan, developed with architects Welton Becket and Paul Williams, called for a series of terminals and parking structures in the central portion of the property, with these buildings connected at the center by a huge steel-and-glass dome. The plan was never realized, and the Theme Building was built on the site intended for the dome.
In the new terminal area west of Sepulveda Blvd that started opening in 1961, each terminal had a satellite building out in the middle of the tarmac, reached by underground tunnels from the ticketing area.[tpl]Cite news| url= | title=Charles D.

Since the 1920s, a neighborhood called Surfridge had been on the coastline west of the airport, part of the larger community of Palisades del Rey along with the neighborhood to the north now known as Playa del Rey.  When the airlines switched to jet airliners during the 1960s and 1970s and Surfridge's residents complained about noise pollution, the city used its eminent domain powers to condemn and evacuate Surfridge. The government bulldozed the homes but did not bulldoze the streets, and the fenced-off "ghost" streets west of LAX are still there.
In 1981, the airport began a $700 million expansion in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics. The U-shaped roadway past the terminal entrances got a second level, with arriving passengers on the lower level and departing on the upper. Connector buildings between the ticketing areas and the satellite buildings were added, changing the layout to a "pier" design. Two new terminals (Terminal 1 and the International Terminal) were built and Terminal 2, then two decades old, was rebuilt. Multi-story parking structures were also built in the center of the airport.
On July 8, 1982, groundbreaking for the two new terminals were conducted by Mayor Tom Bradley and World War II aviator General James Doolittle. The $123 million [tpl]convert|963000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] International Terminal opened on June 11, 1984, and was named for Bradley.
On April 29, 1992, the airport closed for violence and cleanup after the 1992 Los Angeles Riots over the Rodney King beating.
The airport closed again on January 17, 1994 after the Northridge earthquake.
In 1996 a $29 million, [tpl]convert|277|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] air traffic control tower was built near the Theme Building.
In 2000, before Los Angeles hosted the Democratic National Convention, fifteen glass pylons up to ten stories high were placed in a circle around the intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and Century Boulevard, with more pylons of decreasing height following Century Boulevard eastward, evoking a sense of departure and arrival. Conceived by the designers at Selbert Perkins Design, the towers and [tpl]convert|30|ft|adj=on[/tpl] "LAX" letters are a gateway to the airport and offer a welcoming landmark for visitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.segd.org/design-awards/2001-design-awards/lax-gateway.html|title=SEGD – LAX Gateway|accessdate=2011-10-25[/tpl] Illuminated from the inside, the pylons slowly cycle through a rainbow of colors that represents the multicultural makeup of Los Angeles and can be customized to celebrate events, holidays or a season. This was part of an overall face-lift that included new signage and various other cosmetic enhancements that was led by Ted Tokio Tanaka Architects. The LAX pylons underwent improvements in 2006, as stage lighting inside the cylinders was replaced with LED lights to conserve energy, make maintenance easier and enable on-demand cycling through various color effects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.seetheglobe.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1037|title=Story About the Kinetic Light Installation at the Los Angeles International Airport|date=October 20, 2007|accessdate=2009-07-31|publisher=SeeTheGlobe.com[/tpl]
LAX has been a hub for TWA, Air California, Braniff International, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Pacific Southwest Airlines, US Airways, Western Airlines, and the Flying Tiger Line.
Starting in the mid-1990s, under Mayors Richard Riordan and James Hahn, modernization and expansion plans for LAX were prepared, only to be stymied by a coalition of residents who live near the airport. They cited increased noise, pollution and traffic impacts of the project. In late 2005, newly elected Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was able to reach a compromise, allowing some modernization to go forward while encouraging future growth among other facilities in the region.
It is illegal[tpl]dubious|date=October 2011[/tpl] to limit the number of passengers that use an airport, but in December 2005 the city agreed to limit the passenger gates to 163. Once passenger usage hits 75 million, a maximum of two gates a year for up to five years will be closed, intending to limit growth to 79 million passengers a year. In exchange civil lawsuits were abandoned, to allow the city to complete badly needed improvements to the airport.[ref]

On March 25, 2007, Runway 7R/25L reopened after being shifted [tpl]convert|55|ft|m[/tpl] south to prevent runway incursions and prepare the runway for the Airbus A380. Additional storm drains and enhanced runway lighting were added. Runway 25L is now [tpl]convert|800|ft[/tpl] south of the parallel runway centerline to centerline, allowing a parallel taxiway between the runways; the taxiway was completed in 2008.
On September 18, 2006, Los Angeles World Airports started a $503 million facelift of the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Improvements included new paging, air conditioning and electrical systems, along with new elevators, escalators, baggage carousels, and a digital sign that automatically update flight information. With federal funding, explosives-detection technology was incorporated into the terminal's underground baggage system.
According to the Los Angeles Times, in February 2007, many Pacific Rim carriers began reducing flights to LAX in favor of more modern airports, such as San Francisco International Airport, due to the aging Tom Bradley International Terminal.[tpl]Cite news| title= LAX watches world go by; Cramped facilities push Pacific Rim carriers to newer airports | author=Oldham, Jennifer | date=February 23, 2007 | page=A1 | work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]
On August 15, 2007, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $1.2 billion project to construct a new 10-gate terminal to handle international flights using the Airbus A380.Steve Hymon, Council OKs 10 new gates at LAX, Los Angeles Times, August 16, 2007 Adding the first new gates built since the early 1980s, the new structure was to be built directly west of the Tom Bradley International Terminal on a site that was occupied mostly by aircraft hangars.
On March 19, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its debut at LAX, landing on runway 24L. Though LAX was originally to be the first US city to see the A380, Airbus later decided to forgo LAX in favor of John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. After city officials fought for the super-jumbo jet to land at LAX, the A380 landed simultaneously in New York and LAX.[tpl]cite web|author=   |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=local&id=5132965 |title=abc7.com: World's Largest Airliner Lands at LAX 3/19/07 |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=2010-12-06[/tpl]
On March 31, 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that foreign carriers were once again flocking to LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal. The weaker dollar caused a surge in demand for US travel, resulting in airlines either adding new destinations or increasing frequencies to existing routes. New airlines that introduced flights to LAX included Virgin Australia and Emirates Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and Iberia Airlines. Korean Airlines, Qantas, Air China, and Air France have all augmented their services to Los Angeles by adding new flights to existing routes. The influx of new flights comes amidst the renovation of the airport and consolidates LAX's status as the premiere international gateway to the Western United States.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trw-lax31mar31,0,1064477.story | title=Foreign airlines flock to LAX | author=Pae, Peter | work=Los Angeles Times | date=March 31, 2008 | accessdate=2010-09-26 [/tpl]
Qantas launched service with the Airbus A380 on October 20, 2008, using the west side remote gates. Though initially deployed between LAX-SYD, Qantas' A380 service was extended to the popular LAX-Melbourne route.]-Los Angeles routing, followed shortly by Korean Airlines, which initiated nonstop Seoul-Los Angeles service with the Airbus A380 in October 2011. Air France has launched A380 flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and Los Angeles in May 2012. In Addition, China Southern launched A380 service to Guangzhou in October 2012, representing an increase in capacity of 78% on the route. With the addition of these services, LAX boasts six daily flights on the Airbus A380. British Airways has announced that Los Angeles will be its first A380 route, starting October 15.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.routesonline.com/news/29/breaking-news/186658/british-airways-red-carpet-scheduled-debut-for-the-a380/|title=British Airways' Red Carpet Scheduled Debut for the A380|date=March 5, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2013[/tpl]

Today,[tpl]Clarify timeframe|date=February 2014[/tpl] LAX is in the midst of a $4.11 billion renovation and improvement program to expand and rehabilitate the Tom Bradley International Terminal to accommodate the next generation of larger aircraft, as well as handle the growing number of flights to and from the Southern California region, and to develop the Central Terminal Area (CTA) of the airport to include streamlined passenger processing, public transportation and updated central utility plants. As of 2013, Los Angeles International Airport is the biggest airport in California. The multi-year projects are expected to be completed by 2014 and is the largest public works project in Los Angeles history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.laedc.org/reports/LAX.pdf|title=Economic Impact Analysis|date=January 1, 2011|accessdate=2012-08-06|work=Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/uploadedFiles/LAXDev/News_for_LAXDev/NewTBIT-1-22.pdf|title=The New Tom Bradley International Terminal Project Fact Sheet|accessdate=2013-03-23[/tpl]

==Aircraft spotting==

The "Imperial Hill" area (also known as Clutter's Park) in El Segundo is a prime location for aircraft spotting. Another popular spotting location sits under the final approach for runways 24 L&R on a lawn next to the Westchester In-N-Out Burger on Sepulveda Boulevard. This is one of the few remaining locations in Southern California from which spotters may watch such a wide variety of low-flying commercial airliners from directly underneath a flight path.

===Space Shuttle Endeavour===

At 12:51 pm on Friday, September 21, 2012, a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at LAX on runway 25L.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/status_reports/SCA_Endeavour_status_09_12.html | title=Space Shuttle Endeavour Comes Home to Los Angeles | date=September 21, 2012 | accessdate=October 15, 2012 | publisher=Dryden Flight Research Center[/tpl] It is heard[tpl]By whom|date=October 2012[/tpl] that over 10,000 people saw the shuttle land in person. Interstate 105 was backed up for miles at a standstill. Imperial Highway was shut down for spectators. Along the way the shuttle passed many landmarks in the Los Angeles area including the Santa Monica Pier, Getty Center, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Griffith Observatory, Malibu coastline, the Hollywood Sign, Universal Studios Hollywood, the Disneyland Resort, and Los Angeles City Hall. It was quickly taken off the Boeing 747 and was moved to a United Airlines hangar. The shuttle spent about a month in the hangar while it was prepared for transport to the California Science Center.
On Friday, October 12, Endeavour left the hangar at 2:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time and moved eastward on Manchester Boulevard on its way to the California Science Center. The shuttle transport vehicle (STV) was constructed of over 60 individual wheels and weighed over [tpl]convert|12000|lb|kg[/tpl]. It was designed to move the shuttle at a speed of [tpl]convert|2|mph|km/h[/tpl]. This was both for safety concerns for the shuttle and so people could take many photos. As the entire planned route was only 12 miles, it should have only taken 6 hours to complete. Instead, the shuttle arrived in one piece on the morning of Sunday, October 14, 2012.

==Theme Building==

The distinctive white googie "Theme Building", designed by Pereira & Luckman architect Paul Williams and constructed in 1961 by Robert E. McKee Construction Co., resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. A restaurant with a sweeping view of the airport is suspended beneath two arches that form the legs. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1992. A $4 million renovation, with retro-futuristic interior and electric lighting designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, was completed before the "Encounter Restaurant" opened there in 1997.[tpl]cite interview | url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID503190-503190.asp | title=Encounter at the Theme Building | program=LaughingPlace.com | accessdate=2008-02-25 | interviewer=Marc Borrelli | subject=Eddie Sotto | date=August 6, 2001 [/tpl] Visitors are able to take the elevator up to the roof of the "Theme Building", which closed after the September 11 attacks for security reasons and reopened to the public on weekends beginning on July 10, 2010.[tpl]Cite news| title=Iconic LAX Theme Building ready for its close-up | url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/07/02/iconic-lax-theme-building-ready-its-close-/ | work=KPCC | date=July 2, 1010 | accessdate=July 2, 1010[/tpl] Additionally, a memorial to the victims of September 11, 2001 is also located on the grounds of the Theme Building, as three of the four hijacked planes were originally destined for LAX that day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=1612 |title=Art Program – LAX 9/11 Memorial |publisher=Lawa.org |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl]

==Terminals==

LAX has nine passenger terminals arranged in the shape of the letter U or a horseshoe. The terminals are served by a shuttle bus. Terminals 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all connected airside via an underground tunnel between Terminals 5 and 6 and above-ground walkways between Terminals 6, 7, and 8. There are no physical airside connections between any of the other terminals, although an airside shuttle bus operates among Terminals 4, 6, and the American Eagle remote terminal.
In addition to these terminals, there are [tpl]convert|2000000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of cargo facilities at LAX, and a heliport operated by Bravo Aviation. Qantas[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mayor+Villaraigosa+Announces+New+Qantas+Maintenance+Facility+at+LAX;...-a0141547227 | work=Business Wire | title= Mayor Villaraigosa Announces New Qantas Maintenance Facility at LAX | accessdate=2008-04-03 | date=February 1, 2006 [/tpl] has a maintenance facility at LAX, even though it is not a hub.
Most inter-terminal connections require passengers to exit security, then walk or use a shuttle-bus to get to the other terminal, then re-clear security. A few LAX terminals provide airside connections, which allow connecting passengers to access other terminals without having to re-clear through security. The following airside connections are possible:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=1318#q115 | title=LAX Frequently Asked Questions: What do I need to know about connecting to a flight at the airport? | work=Los Angeles World Airports | accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl]

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 has 15 gates: Gates 1–3, 4A–4B, and 5–14, and houses AirTran Airways and Southwest Airlines. Terminal 1 was built in 1984 and is the largest of all of the terminals in terms of number of gates. It was announced that Southwest and Los Angeles World Airports would fund about $400 million in Terminal 1 improvements under a plan approved Monday, January 14, 2013, by the Board of Airport Commissioners. Though the improvements have already begun, the plan must be approved by the City of Los Angeles. As part of the deal, US Airways agreed to move its operations to Terminal 3, giving Southwest its own terminal. US Airways moved to Terminal 3 on February 12, 2014, leaving Southwest and subsidiary AirTran as sole operators at Terminal 1.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lawa.org/newsContent.aspx?ID=1828|title=US AIRWAYS RELOCATES OPERATIONS FROM TERMINAL 1 TO TERMINAL 3 AT LAX EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 12, 2014|work=Los Angeles World Airports|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=11 February 2014[/tpl]

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 has 11 gates: Gates 21–21B, 22–22B, 23, 24–24B, and 25–28. It hosts most foreign airlines not using the TBIT along with a couple of domestic airlines: Aeroméxico, Air Canada, Air China, Avianca, Air New Zealand, Alitalia, Hawaiian Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Volaris, and WestJet. Former tenants of the terminal include Northwest Airlines, Pan American World Airways, and Taca International Airlines.
Terminal 2 was built in 1962, and was the original international terminal. It was completely torn down and rebuilt in stages between 1984 and 1988 at a cost of $94 million.[tpl]cite news |title='Final Major Link' in LAX Expansion Opens|first=Eric|last=Malnic|url=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 1, 1988|accessdate=June 14, 2012[/tpl] The rebuilt terminal was designed by Leo A Daly.[tpl]cite news |title=LAX Terminal 2 to Be Revamped : Carriers Expect $94-Million Project to Start Next Month|url=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 17, 1986|accessdate=June 14, 2012[/tpl] Terminal 2 has CBP (Customs and Border Protection) facilities to process arriving international passengers.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 has 12 gates: Gates 30, 31A–31B, 32, 33A–33B, 34–36, 37A–37B, and 38 (gate 39 was removed to make room for Virgin Australia Boeing 777 operations at gate 38). Terminal 3 opened in 1961 and was Trans World Airlines' terminal. It formerly housed some American Airlines flights after that airline acquired Reno Air and TWA in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Eventually, all American flights were moved to Terminal 4. As of April 2012, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, Virgin Australia, and Virgin America use Terminal 3.
On May 1, 2013, Allegiant Air relocated to Terminal 3.[tpl]cite news | title=Allegiant Air Terminal Relocation | url=http://www2.allegiantair.com/lax-terminal-change | accessdate=May 1, 2013[/tpl] A week later on May 8, Frontier Airlines relocated to Terminal 3.[tpl]cite news | title=Los Angeles (LAX) Airport Information | url=http://www.flyfrontier.com/flight-info/at-the-airport/airports/los-angeles | accessdate=May 8, 2013[/tpl] US Airways moved to Terminal 3 on February 12, 2014.
Note: Virgin America uses Terminal 2 for arrivals from Cancun, and Virgin Australia uses the TBIT for arrivals from Australia.

===Terminal 4===

Terminal 4 has 14 gates: Gates 40–41, 42A–42B, 43–45 (Gate 44 is for the bus to the American Eagle remote terminal (Gates 44A-44L)), 46A–46B, 47A–47B, 48A–48B, and 49A. Terminal 4 was built in 1961 and was renovated in 2001 at a cost of $400 million in order to improve the appearance and functionality of the facility. The renovation was designed by Rivers & Christian.[tpl]cite news |title=Remodeled Terminal at LAX Debuts|first=Jennifer|last=Oldham|url=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2002|accessdate=June 14, 2012[/tpl] It is home for American Airlines, which operates its West Coast hub at the airport, and for its subsidiary commuter carrier, Envoy Air. American is the only tenant at T4. An international arrivals facility serving American Airlines flights was also added in the renovation in 2001.
Note: American Eagle flights operate from the "American Eagle Terminal", which is located just east of Terminal 8. Gate 44 serves as the shuttle bus stop at Terminal 4. The remote terminal is also connected by shuttle buses to Terminals 6 and TBIT because of Eagle's codesharing with Alaska Airlines and Qantas.

===Terminal 5===

Terminal 5 has 15 gates: Gates 50A–50B, 51A–51B, 52A–52B, 53A–53B, 54A–54B, 55A, 56–57, 58, and 59. Western Airlines occupied this terminal at its opening in 1962, and continued to do so until Western was merged with Delta Air Lines on April 1, 1987. Terminal 5 was redesigned by Gensler,[tpl]cite news |title=Architectural Firm Practices One-Stop Design : Gensler & Associates Specializes in Planning Project's Inside as Well as Outside|first=Leon|last=Whiteson|url=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 21, 1988|accessdate=June 2, 2012[/tpl] expanded to include a connector building between the original satellite and the ticketing facilities and remodeled from 1986 through early 1988. It was unofficially named 'Delta's Oasis at LAX' with the slogan 'Take Five at LAX' when construction was completed in the summer of 1988. Northwest Airlines moved all operations to Terminal 5 and Terminal 6 alongside Delta Air Lines on June 30, 2009, as part of its merger with the airline.

===Terminal 6===

Terminal 6 has 14 gates: Gates 60–63, 64A–64B, 65A-65B, 66, 67, 68A–68B, and 69A–69B. Parts of this terminal have changed little from its opening in 1961; in 1979, new gates were expanded from the main building, as is obvious from the rotunda at the end. Four of these gates have two jetways, which can accommodate large aircraft.
Terminal 6 hosts airline tenants with a variety of relationships with the airport. Continental Airlines originally built the Connector Building (which links the Ticketing and rotunda buildings). United Airlines uses the connector gates, supplementing its base at Terminal 7. Delta Air Lines leases space from the Airport in Terminal 6, in addition to its base at Terminal 5. Most of the rotunda gates can feed arriving passengers into a sterile corridor that shunts them to Terminal 7's customs and immigration facility. Also, one foreign-flag airline, Copa Airlines, departs from Terminal 6, as a result of its long relationship with Continental and now United.
In April 2011, Alaska Airlines agreed to a deal with Los Angeles World Airports to renovate Terminal 6. The airline moved its flights to Terminal 6 on March 20, 2012, and Spirit Airlines was relocated to Terminal 3.[tpl]cite news | title=The All-New Alaska Airlines Terminal 6 at LAX | url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/at-the-airport/lax-terminal.aspx | accessdate=March 20, 2012[/tpl]
Both United and Alaska operate lounges in Terminal 6.
Former tenants of the terminal include Continental Airlines until its merger with United Airlines in 2011 and Eastern Air Lines, which went bankrupt in 1991. The terminal also originally housed Pacific Southwest Airlines.

===Terminal 7===

Terminal 7 has 11 gates: Gates 70A-70B, 71A-71B, 72, 73, 74, 75A-75B, 76, and 77. This terminal opened in 1962. Four of these gates have two jetways, which accommodate large aircraft. Terminal 7 is the home to United Airlines. The interior of the terminal was renovated between January 1998 and June 1999 at a cost of $250 million, was designed by HNTB, and was constructed by Hensel Phelps Construction. Added were new gate podiums, increased size of gate areas, relocated concessions, expanded restrooms, new flooring, and new signage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/united-begins-200m-terminal-expansion-at-lax-228375/ |title=Aviation and Aerospace News |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] Also, the roof of the terminal was raised, and new, brighter light fixtures were added in order to provide more overall lighting.[tpl]Wayback|date=20010512114707|url=http://aviation.hntb.com/4d8.htm|title=HNTB Aviation – Spotlight Projects – Los Angeles International Airport[/tpl] As of 2012, Terminal 7 is undergoing another facelift, with significant changes to concessions. The terminal also contains a United Club and International First Class Lounge.

===Terminal 8===

Terminal 8 has nine gates: Gates 80–88. This terminal was added for smaller jets and turboprops in 1988 and formerly served Shuttle by United flights. In 2002, United moved all non-Express flights to Terminals 6 and 7. However, Terminal 8 is now used once again for mainline United flights.

===Tom Bradley International Terminal===

(Not to be confused with Bradley International Airport which serves Hartford, Connecticut)
The Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT) has 12 gates, including six on the north concourse and six on the south concourse. In addition, there are nine satellite gates for international flights located on the west side of LAX. Passengers are ferried to the west side gates by bus. The terminal hosts most of the major international airlines, with the exception of those housed in Terminal 2.
This terminal opened for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games and is named for Tom Bradley, the first African-American and longest-serving (20 years) mayor of Los Angeles, and champion of LAX. The terminal is located at the west end of the passenger terminal area between Terminals 3 and 4. Tom Bradley International Terminal hosts 27 airlines and handles 10 million passengers per year.
In 2010, modernization efforts resulted in additional space for inline baggage screening, three large alliance-aligned lounges plus one unaffiliated lounge (to replace the multiple airline specific lounges) and cosmetic upgrades in the departures and arrivals areas.
On November 17, 2008, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa unveiled design concepts for LAX's Bradley West and Midfield Concourse projects. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), along with city officials, selected Fentress Architects in association with HNTB to develop a design concept for the modernization of LAX. The emphasis of the modernization is to improve the passenger experience and to keep Los Angeles competitive with other global cities.
On February 22, 2010, construction began on the $1.5 billion Bradley West project, part of the multi-year $4.11 billion LAX improvement and redevelopment projects. The project added over [tpl]convert|1250000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of shops, restaurants, and passenger lounges, as well as new security screening, customs, immigration, and baggage claim facilities. The terminal's existing two concourses will be demolished and replaced with a larger pair with 18 gates, nine of which will be able to accommodate the Airbus A380. The terminal opened in phases beginning on September 2012, and was completed in 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=LAX Development Program|url=http://www.lawa.org/laxdev/laxdev.aspx|publisher=Los Angeles World Airports|accessdate=January 12, 2012[/tpl]
On September 18, 2013, the new Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX officially opened. Airlines started to use the new, smarter gates that can handle big aircraft, including the Airbus A380. Inside, Southern California scenes and quirky videos are played on seven huge multimedia screens. It is the largest immersive system in an airport and the most advanced multimedia environment in a North American airport.[tpl]cite web|author=from Moment Factory Plus 4 months ago not yet rated |url=http://vimeo.com/68789136 |title=Moment Factory making-of: LAX new terminal, the largest immersive system in an airport on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-29[/tpl] Passengers can relax at the lounge-like seating in the Great Hall or shop in the 25,000-square-foot duty-free shopping area. Many restaurants and high-end shops are located there, such as Chloé, Burberry, Fred Seagal, and Porsche amongst others.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Freeways and roads===

LAX's terminals are immediately west of the interchange between Century Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard (State Route 1). The 405 Freeway can be reached to the east via Century Boulevard, and the 105 Freeway can be reached to the south via Sepulveda Boulevard.

===Bus===

The closest bus stops to the terminals are the pair of opposites on Sepulveda and Century, served by Torrance 8, Metro 117, Metro 232, Commuter Express 574 and Metro 40 (owl service only).
In addition, out of a number of bus systems, many routes (local, rapid and express) of the LACMTA Metro 232 to Long Beach, Line 8 of Torrance Transit, Line 109 of Beach Cities Transit, the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus system's Line 3 and Rapid 3 via Lincoln Blvd to Santa Monica and the Culver CityBus's Line 6 and Rapid 6 via Sepulveda Blvd to Culver City and UCLA all make stops at the LAX Transit Center in Parking Lot C. on 96th St., where shuttle bus "C" offers free connections to and from every LAX terminal, and at the Green Line Station, where shuttle bus "G" connects to and from the terminals.

====FlyAway Bus====

The FlyAway Bus is a motorcoach shuttle service run by the LAWA, which currently travels between one of three off-airport areas: San Fernando Valley (Van Nuys), downtown Los Angeles (Union Station), and the Westside (Westwood). The Irvine FlyAway was discontinued on August 31, 2012.  The shuttle service stops at every LAX terminal. The service hours vary based on the line. All lines use the regional system of High Occupancy Vehicle lanes to expedite their trips.

====Los Angeles Metro Rail====

Shuttle bus "G" offers a free connection to and from the Aviation/LAX station on the Los Angeles Metro Rail Green Line. The line was originally intended to connect directly to the airport, but budgetary restraints and opposition from local parking lot owners impeded its progress. Part of the long term master plan for LAX and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority calls for a direct Metro Rail stop on either the Green Line or the proposed Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor, with a people-mover system connecting the terminals to the station without the need for a shuttle bus.[tpl]cite web|last=Weikel|first=Dan|title=Light rail plan for Los Angeles International Airport advances|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-light-rail-20121218,0,7377861.story|work=LA Times|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=December 18, 2012[/tpl]  Currently, shuttle bus "G" runs every 10–15 minutes (synched with the train schedule) from 5 am – 1:30 am.
LAWA Contract Manager

====Taxis and private shuttles====

Taxicab services are operated by nine city-authorized taxi companies and regulated by Authorized Taxicab Supervision Inc. (ATS). ATS maintains a taxicab holding lot under the 96th Street Bridge where, at peak periods, hundreds of cabs queue up to wait their turn to pull into the central terminal area to pick up riders. A number of private shuttle companies also offer limousine and bus services to LAX airport.

==Coast Guard Air Station Los Angeles==

The airport also functions as a joint civil-military facility, providing a base for the United States Coast Guard and its Coast Guard Air Station Los Angeles facility, operating four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters, which covers Coast Guard operations in various Southern California locations, including Catalina Island.
Missions include search and rescue (SAR), law enforcement, aids to navigation support (such as operating lighthouses) and various military operations. In addition, Coast Guard helicopters assigned to the air station deploy to Coast Guard cutters.

==Flight Path Learning Center==

The Flight Path Learning Center is a museum located at 6661 Imperial Highway and was formerly known as the "West Imperial Terminal". This building used to house some charter flights (Condor Airlines) and regular scheduled flights by MGM Grand Air. It sat empty for 10 years until it was re-opened as a learning center for LAX.
The center contains information on the history of aviation, several pictures of the airport, as well as aircraft scale models, flight attendant uniforms, and general airline memorabilia such as playing cards, china, magazines, signs, even a TWA gate information sign.
The museum claims to be "the only aviation museum and research center situated at a major airport and the only facility with a primary emphasis on contributions of civil aviation to the history and development of Southern California".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.flightpath.us/#Visiting | title=Flight Path Learning Center (official site) | accessdate=2008-02-25[/tpl] However, there are other museums at major airports including the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum adjacent to Washington Dulles Airport, the Royal Thai Air Force Museum at Don Muang Airport, the Suomen ilmailumuseo (Finnish Aviation Museum) at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, the Frontier of Flight Museum at Dallas Love Field, the Tulsa Air and Space Museum & Planetarium at Tulsa International Airport and others.

==Planned modernization==

LAWA currently has several plans to modernize LAX.  These include terminal and runway improvements, which will enhance the passenger experience, reduce overcrowding, and provide airport access to the latest class of very large passenger aircraft.
These improvements[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/uploadedfiles/LAX/pdf/Contractors%20roll%20out%2011-19-08.pdf |title=LAX Specific Plan Amendment |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-06[/tpl] include:
LAWA is also planning to build and operate an LAX Automated People Mover.  This small train will connect passengers between the central terminal area and the Metro Green Line, the future Metro Crenshaw Line, and regional and local bus lines.

==In popular culture==

Numerous films and television shows have been set or filmed partially at LAX, at least partly due to the airport's proximity to Hollywood studios. Film shoots at the Los Angeles airports, including LAX, produced $590 million for the Los Angeles region from 2002 to 2005.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/22/local/me-film22 |title=L.A. airports fly high with film shoots | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=January 22, 2007 | author=Tony Barboza[/tpl]
