Her identification with feminism and her focus on bioethics both occurred “by accident”(p. 27) during the writing of her first book, The Sceptical Feminist: A Philosophical Enquiry (Routledge, 1980; Penguin, 1982) – bioethics being central to the abortion debate.http://www.philosophers.co.uk/wpt.htm The book proved to be controversial within and outside feminism, e.g. in regard to standards of rationality,Christine Battersby, Recent work in feminist philosophy, Philosophical Books 1991, 32:4, p. 200 fashion and style, and her liberal stance.Imelda Whelehan, Modern feminist thought: from the second wave to "post-feminism", 1995, Edinburgh University Press, pp. 39–40
Her second book, Human Nature After Darwin: A Philosophical Introduction (Routledge, 2001) explores the so-call Darwin Wars, including what implications Darwinism raises for philosophy and the application of critical thinking to various arguments put forward in the debate. It was originally written as an introduction to philosophical techniques for open university students using the controversies relating to Darwinian thinking and human nature.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
