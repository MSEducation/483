The Time in Between is a novel by Canadian author David Bergen. It deals with a man named Charles Boatman, who mysteriously returns to Vietnam, where he had been a soldier earlier in his life, and his children, Ada and Jon, who also go to Vietnam to search for him.
Although generally called a war novel, the author states that he "doesn't see The Time in Between as a war novel".http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780771011788
