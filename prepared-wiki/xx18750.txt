Leptis Magna ([tpl]lang-ar|لَبْدَة[/tpl] Labdah)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=6485615&fid=3783&c=libya |title=لَبْدَة Libya |work= |accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl]. also known as Lectis Magna (or Lepcis Magna as it is sometimes spelled), also called Lpqy, Neapolis, Lebida or Lebda to modern-day residents of Libya, was a prominent city of the Roman Empire. Its ruins are located in Khoms, Libya, [tpl]convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Tripoli, on the coast where the Wadi Lebda meets the sea.  The site is one of the most spectacular and unspoiled Roman ruins in the Mediterranean.

==History as a city==

The city appears to have been founded by a group of local Berbers and Phoenicians sometime around 1000 BC, who gave it the Lybico-Berber name Lpqy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/183 |title=Archaeological Site of Leptis Magna |work=World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=March 14, 2013[/tpl]Birley, Anthony Richard (1971) Septimius Severus Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, page 2, ISBN 0-413-26900-0 The town did not achieve prominence until Carthage became a major power in the Mediterranean Sea in the 4th century BC. It nominally remained part of Carthage's dominions until the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BC and then became part of the Roman Republic, although from about 111 BC onward, it was for all intents and purposes an independent city.
Leptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post.
Leptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in 193, when a Berber native son, Lucius Septimius Severus, became emperor. He favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In 205, he and the imperial family visited the city and received great honors.
Among the changes that Severus introduced were to create a magnificent new forum and to rebuild the docks.  The natural harbour had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were hardly used.
Leptis over-extended itself at this period.  During the Crisis of the Third Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the fourth century, large parts of the city had been abandoned. Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus during a major tribal raid who demanded bribes to protect the city.  The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian. Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished "for bringing false accusations". It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I.
In 439, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in 523 when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city.
Belisarius recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of Rome ten years later, and in 534, he destroyed the kingdom of the Vandals. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (see Byzantine Empire) but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. It was the site of a massacre of Berber chiefs of the Leuathae tribal confederation by the Roman authorities in 543.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Leptis Magna[/tpl]  By the time of the Arab conquest of Tripolitania in the 650s, the city was abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

==History as a historical site==

Today, the site of Leptis Magna is the site of some of the most impressive ruins of the Roman period.
Part of an ancient temple was brought from Leptis Magna to the British Museum in 1816 and installed at the Fort Belvedere royal residence in England in 1826. It now lies in part of Windsor Great Park. The ruins are located between the south shore of Virginia Water and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.

===2005 discoveries===

In June 2005, it was revealed that archaeologists from the University of Hamburg had been working along the coast of Libya when they uncovered a 30 ft length of five colourful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century. The mosaics show with exceptional clarity depictions of a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue and staring at his slain opponent.  The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa at Wadi Lebda in Leptis Magna. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of representational mosaic art ever seen—a "masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii."  The mosaics were originally discovered in the year 2000 but were kept secret in order to avoid looting. They are currently on display in the Leptis Magna Museum.Alberge, Dalya, (June 13, 2005), "Roman Mosaic 'Worthy of Botticelli'", The Times Online, Accessed Sep 9 2006

===In the 2011 Revolution===

There were reports that Leptis Magna was used as a cover for tanks and military vehicles by pro-Gaddafi forces during the 2011 Libyan civil war.[tpl]cite web|title=Misrata update and comments for June 7th and 8th|url=http://archive.libyafeb17.com/2011/06/misrata-update-and-comments-for-june-7th-and-8th/|publisher=Libya 17th February|accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl] When asked about the possibility of conducting an air-strike on the historic site, NATO refused to rule out the possibility of such an action saying that it had not been able to confirm the rebels' report that weapons were being hidden at the location.[tpl]cite news|title=CNN Wire Staff|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/06/14/libya.war/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|work=Web Article|accessdate=2011-06-14|date=14 June 2011[/tpl]
