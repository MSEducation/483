==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Ashburton has a large brick station building at the centre of the platform, which houses an enclosed waiting area, toilets and a ticket office. A Myki card vending machine is located inside the waiting area.
The Alamein line reduces from two tracks to one just before Ashburton station, and so the station only has a single bi-directional platform. Just north of the station is a railway siding for stabling trains, which has been largely unused in recent years.

===History===

The first station on the Ashburton site opened on 30 May 1890, as part of the short-lived Outer Circle line.VICSIG Infrastructure - Ashburton When opened, the station was called Norwood, named after Norwood Road, the old name for Toorak Road. After only a few months, on 12 December 1890, the station was renamed Ashburton after Ashburton Terrace, in Cork, Ireland.
Ashburton was part of the first section of the Outer Circle line to be opened. However, by 1893, the northern half of the Outer Circle had closed, and on 9 December 1895, the stretch beyond Ashburton, connecting with Oakleigh closed as well. For a short period, this left the line from Camberwell station to Ashburton as the last remaining stretch.
On 1 May 1897, Ashburton station closed, along with the line from Camberwell. After an outcry from the local community, that section of the line reopened on 4 July 1898, becoming the Ashburton line once again. Electrified on 30 October 1924, it continued as the Ashburton line until 28 June 1948, when the track was extended 600 metres to Alamein, and became the Alamein line.
Timetabled use of the stabling siding ended in July 1989, due to vandalism of trains stabled there.[ref]

On 15 October 2009, a six-month-old baby in a stroller rolled off the platform at Ashburton onto the track as a northbound Comeng train entered the station.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/15/2715474.htm|title=Baby survives collision with train|work=ABC News|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009[/tpl] The platform slopes slightly towards the rail line to facilitate drainage. A woman had let go of the stroller for a moment, and it began to roll away from her as the train entered the station. By the time she realised the danger it was too late to stop the stroller and child falling on to the track. Despite the horrific nature of the incident, the baby boy was taken to hospital, suffering only minor injuries. The incident was caught on CCTV, and the footage was released by Connex Melbourne (now Metro Trains) the next day. The incident became world-wide news, and emphasised the point of safety near railway lines.
