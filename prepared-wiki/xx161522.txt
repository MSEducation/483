Charlie Chin (born Qin Xianglin, also spelled Chin Hsiang Lin, on May 19, 1948, in Nanjing, China) is a Chinese actor.
He first had his break, when he moved to Hong Kong with his family at an early age. At only 12 years of age Charlie moved to Taiwan to join Fu Xing Ju Xiao, a Peking opera school. At the age of 20 he moved back to Hong Kong to join Guo Tai Movie Inc.
His movie debut came in the film Xia Ri Chu Lian, literally translating to "The First Love In Summer". With Brigitte Lin, Joan Lin and Chin Han, the 4 eventually became known as the "Two Lins, Two Chins" which became iconic of 1970s romance films in China. The names became a guarantee of box office success, and so Charlie was constantly paired with one of the '2 Lins'. Charlie won 2 Golden Horse Awards and in 2000 he also presented one in Taiwan. Charlie is currently retired from the acting business and is now working in real estate. He lives in California with his wife and 2 sons, Gary Ching and Kevin Ching.
