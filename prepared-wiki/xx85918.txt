Gilmar was the starting goalkeeper for Pele's world-famous Santos and Brazilian national teams of the 60s. Therefore, he's famous around the world as "Pele's goalkeeper."

==Club career==

Gilmar, born in Santos, São Paulo, started his career playing for club Jabaquara from Santos, but transferred to Corinthians in 1951. With this club he was State Champion in 1951, 1952 and 1954.
In 1961, he signed to play for Santos, where he was part of one of the best football teams in the history of the sport, and probably the best football team of the era. In that team he played along with sport legends like Pelé, Pepe, Zito, Mengálvio, Lima and Coutinho, among others. With Gilmar between the posts, Santos conquered almost every championship they competed in: they won five São Paulo State Championships (1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968), five National Championships (1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965), two Libertadores Cups (1962 and 1963) and two Intercontinental Cups (1962 against Eusébio's Benfica and 1963 against Milan).

==National team==

With the Brazilian national team, Gilmar played 104 times, allowing only 95 goals. He was selected to the national squad for three straight World Cups, between 1958 and 1966. He was part of the starting team in the first two World Cups Brazil won, in 1958 and 1962, and is the only goalkeeper to win two consecutive World Cups in the starting position. Gilmar died just three days after his 83rd birthday.
