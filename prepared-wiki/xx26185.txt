AstroTurf is a brand of artificial turf. The original AstroTurf product was a short-pile synthetic turf.[tpl]cite patent|US|3332828[/tpl] The prime reason to incorporate AstroTurf on game fields was to avoid the cost of laying natural turf, especially indoors.

==History==

The original AstroTurf brand product was co-invented in 1965 by Donald L. Elbert, James M. Faria and Robert T. Wright. It was patented in 1965 and originally sold under the name "ChemGrass." It was re-branded as AstroTurf by company employee John A. Wortmann after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome stadium in 1966.
In 1987, Monsanto consolidated its AstroTurf management, marketing, and technical activities in Dalton, Georgia, as AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1988, Balsam AG purchased all the capital stock of AstroTurf Industries, Inc. In 1994, Southwest Recreational Industries, Inc. (SWRI) acquired the AstroTurf brand. In 1996, SWRI was acquired by American Sports Products Group Inc. (ASPG). In 2001, SWRI launched a turf system called NexTurf.[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FIH/is_4_72/ai_n18614445/pg_2 | work=Coach and Athletic Director | title=Breaking the surface: uncovering your sports surfacing needs | year=2002[/tpl]
While AstroTurf was the industry leader throughout the late 20th century, other companies like FieldTurf became prominent in the early 2000s; as a result, the original AstroTurf brand product is now almost obsolete.[tpl]cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1017343/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Field Of Greens | date=1999-10-18 | accessdate=2010-05-02[/tpl] However, AstroTurf has since created products based on modern turf technologies, although they are not as ubiquitous as their predecessors; the current products incorporate modern features such as antimicrobial protection, rubber infill, backing systems and nylon yarn fibers and plastic. In 2003, SWRI changed its name to SRI Sports and one year later filed for bankruptcy and the parent company, ASPG, retained the AstroTurf products and intellectual property. In 2005, Textile Management Associates, Inc. (TMA) acquired the AstroTurf assets from ASPG and began marketing the AstroTurf brand under the company AstroTurf, LLC. In 2006, GeneralSports Venue (GSV) became TMAâ€™s marketing partner for the AstroTurf brand for the American market. AstroTurf, LLC handles the marketing of AstroTurf in the rest of the world.
