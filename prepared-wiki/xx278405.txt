==History==

===The Original Cottage Inn===

The first Cottage Inn restaurant, opened in 1948, still stands in its original location at 512 East William, Ann Arbor. Although it started as a coffee shop, pizza was introduced in 1959.http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/marketplace/michigan_made/cottage-inn-pizza It has the distinction of being the first restaurant in Ann Arbor to serve pizza.[tpl]cite web|title=Original Cottage Inn|url=http://www.annarbor.com/restaurants/the-original-cottage-inn/|work=AnnArbor.com|publisher=AnnArbor.com|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl] The current owner acquired the building in 1961.
The restaurant went through renovations in 1975, 1980, and 1987. In 1993, the restaurant expanded again to include a second floor and banquet room facilities. Due to its proximity to the University of Michigan campus, the Original Cottage Inn is often frequented by students and visitors.[tpl]cite web|title=Game day in Ann Arbor: Score a winning meal at these up-and-coming restaurants|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121018/ENT08/310180117/Game-day-in-Ann-Arbor-Score-a-winning-meal-at-these-up-and-coming-restaurants|work=Detroit Free Press|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Disbrow|first=Rebecca|title=Cottage Inn: "Food is Our Common Ground: A Universal Experience" - James Beard|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/settingsandrituals/student_settings_and_rituals&mode=single&recordID=000000000000000000000000000000000000000002162324&nextMode=list|work=umich.edu|publisher=umich.edu|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Freed|first=Ben|title=The Original Cottage Inn adapting to a changing neighborhood with increased opportunity and competition|url=http://209.81.87.86/business-review/with-changes-all-around-downtown-cottage-inn-remains-ann-arbor-original/|work=AnnArbor.com|publisher=AnnArbor.com|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]   The restaurant also has an established relationship with the Ann Arbor community, participating in community service events such as feeding the homeless on Thanksgiving.[tpl]cite web|last=Reed|first=Tina|title=Volunteers pack Cottage Inn to help with free Thanksgiving meal|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2008/11/volunteers_pack_cottage_inn_to.html|work=MLive|publisher=MLive|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]

===Cottage Inn Carryout===

By 1978, Cottage Inn's continued growth required the formation of a second company to devote to delivery services. As a result, Cottage Inn Carryout & Delivery, Inc. was established. The first Cottage Inn store under this new company was founded at Packard and Hill streets in Ann Arbor. In June 1986, the first franchise opened in Ypsilanti. In 2003, the new corporate headquarters and distribution center opened in Ann Arbor.[tpl]cite web|title=About|url=http://www.cottageinn.com/about/|work=Cottage Inn|publisher=www.cottageinn.com[/tpl]

==Menu==

Cottage Inn offers a variety of pizza, perhaps most well known for their specialty gourmet pizzas, along with various crust styles and toppings. Additional menu items include Italian-American entrees, salads, sandwiches, breadsticks, beverages, and desserts.[tpl]cite web|title=Menu|url=http://www.cottageinn.com/menu/|work=Cottage Inn|publisher=www.cottageinn.com[/tpl]

===Gluten free menu===

In 2009, Cottage Inn expanded its menu to include gluten free pizzas and cheese bread due to a growing demand for pizza from customers who suffer from celiac disease. The Brighton location was the first to introduce gluten free pizza, which has since spread to the rest of the Cottage Inn locations.[tpl]cite web|last=Acosta|first=Roberto|title=Get your pizza - gluten free|url=http://grandblancview.mihomepaper.com/news/2010-03-25/Business/Get_your_pizza__gluten_free.html|work=Grand Blanc View|publisher=mihomepaper.com|accessdate=19 August 2013[/tpl] In May 2013, Cottage Inn launched gluten free sandwiches.[tpl]cite web|title=Cottage Inn Pizza Launches Gluten-Free Sandwiches|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/5/prweb10754600.htm|work=PRWeb|publisher=PRWeb|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]
