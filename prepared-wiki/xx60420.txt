[[William M. Jennings Trophy]]

CATEGORIES: National Hockey League trophies and awards

The William M. Jennings Trophy is an annual National Hockey League award given to "the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it. Winners are selected based on regular-season play." From 1946 until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. Since its beginnings in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 32 seasons to 53 different players; mostly in tandems of 2 goalkeepers. The most recent winner is Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings allowed 174 team goals-against in the 2013–14 NHL season.[tpl]cite web|title=2013-2014 League Standings - Goals Against - NHL.com|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/standings.htm?season=20132014&sort=standingsGoalsAgainst&type=LEA|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl] 

==History==

From 1946 until the 1980–81 season, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the regular season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=NHL.com[/tpl] However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence the change was made to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is awarded to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals against.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashvezina.htm|title=Vezina Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=LegendsofHockey.net[/tpl]
The Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL's board of governors and first presented at the conclusion of the 1981–82 season. It is named in honor of the late William M. Jennings, who was a longtime governor and president of the New York Rangers and a builder of ice hockey in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/vezina.html|title=William M. Jennings Trophy history|accessdate=2007-09-17|publisher=NHL.com[/tpl] Normally the minimum number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened 1994–95 season, the required minimum was fourteen games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/history/news/story?page=nhljennings|title=William H.
