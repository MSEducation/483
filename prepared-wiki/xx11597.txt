Video editing software is application software which handles the post-production video editing of digital video sequences on a computer non-linear editing system (NLE).  It has replaced traditional flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analogue video tape-to-tape online editing[tpl]cite web|title=Web video|url=http://www.videodirektor.de/webvideo-individuell-erstellen-lassen/|publisher=Video Director|accessdate=7 June 2013[/tpl] machines.
NLE software is typically based on a timeline interface paradigm where sections of moving image video recordings, known as clips, are laid out in sequence and played back. The NLE offers a range of tools for trimming, splicing, cutting and arranging clips across the timeline. As digital NLE systems have advanced their toolset, their role has expanded and most consumer and professional NLE systems alike now include a host of features for colour manipulation, titling and visual effects, as well as tools for editing and mixing audio synchronized with the video image sequence.
Once a project is complete, the NLE system can then be used to export to movie in a variety of formats in context which may range from broadcast tape formats to compressed formats for the Internet, DVD and mobile devices.
