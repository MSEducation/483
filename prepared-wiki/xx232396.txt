==Reception==

A Publishers Weekly review says, "It's easy to imagine these precocious quips becoming part of a vocabulary ("That's a lack of pies!" a baker tells Pinocchio), and aficionados of this quiz would do well to read Shel Silverstein's Runny Babbit, another boonerific spook."Publishers Weekly; 3/13/2006, Vol. 253 Issue 11, p66–66, 1/3p A Kirkus Reviews review says, "His humor in these 28 examples is sometimes crude (see title, which answers, "What did the cowboy say to the rocket scientist?"), and, as in Shel Silverstein's Runny Babbit (2005), the joke definitely wears thin--but readers of the target mentality may be tempted to rake the tall and bun with it."Kirkus Reviews; 3/1/2006, Vol. 74 Issue 5, p225–225, 1/5p Kitty Flynn, of The Horn Book Magazine, reviewed the book saying, "It makes you wonder: the next time someone calls you a “smart feller,” is that really what’s meant?"Horn Book Magazine; May/Jun2006, Vol. 82 Issue 3, p287–288, 2p
