Gift to the World is the debut full-length album by Boston, Massachusetts indie rock band Loveless.  It was released on Q Division Records in 2003.
The album was critically applauded by a number of publications, including Rolling Stone and The Boston Globe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lvlss.com/press/|title=Loveless Press|publisher=lvls.com|accessdate=2008-02-19[/tpl]  However, due to lack of promotion or touring around the album, its sales were mediocre, at best, for an independent album.  The album's life cycle was cut short in the summer of 2004, when it was announced Trynin was leaving the band.
