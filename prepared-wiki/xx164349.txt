Ream National Park ([tpl]lang-km|ឧទ្យានជាតិព្រះសីហនុរាម[/tpl]), is a national park of Cambodia located 18 km from Sihanoukville in south-east Cambodia. Established in 1993, when the Cambodian government began to take action to protect many of its threatened areas,  encompasses 210 km² including 150 km² of terrestrial and 60 km² of marine habitats. The national park contains beaches, mangrove forests, tropical jungles and over 150 species of bird and is well noted for its monkey population.
Uninhabited Koh Sess island is located at the southeastern end of the park.
In February 2012, construction work and road building was going on at the south-eastern tip of the park in order to create a small tourist resort. All this seems to be funded by Chinese capital. Was not clear how all this fits into the idea of protecting threatened areas. Park rangers stated that many animals had fled from the area since 2011. Local (fishermen) population may not benefit from these developments, either.
