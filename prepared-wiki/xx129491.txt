North Carolina Highway 136 (NC 136) is a [tpl]convert|2.22|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] North Carolina state highway that runs entirely within Currituck County. It is a short spur of US 158, connecting the U.S. Highway to the small unincorporated community of Poplar Branch. The route's eastern terminus is at a boat launch on the Currituck Sound. Prior to 2002, NC 136's current alignment was NC 3. The two routes swapped designations in 2002 to put NC 3 near the home of Dale Earnhardt, a deceased NASCAR driver from Kannapolis that drove the #3 car.

NC 136 runs through more woodland with some homes before coming to a dead end at a boat launch on the Currituck Sound.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=N+Carolina+136+E%2FMacedonia+Church+Rd&daddr=N+Carolina+136+E%2FPoplar+Branch+Rd&hl=en&ll=36.280261,-75.89776&spn=0.017505,0.042272&sll=36.284689,-75.886817&sspn=0.017504,0.042272&geocode=FRB-KQId6q95-w%3BFdmxKQIdwBh6-w&t=h&mra=ls&z=15|title=overview of North Carolina Highway 136|accessdate=April 1, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The current NC 136 was originally NC 3. In 2002, NC 3 swapped designations with the original NC 136, which ran between Kannapolis and Mooresville. This was done in order for that road to honor Dale Earnhardt, a NASCAR driver from Kannapolis that drove the #3 car who was killed in the 2001 Daytona 500.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/SessionLaws/PDF/2001-2002/SL2002-170.pdf|publisher=General Assembly of North Carolina|title=SESSION LAW 2002-170 HOUSE BILL 1516|accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl]
