Taylforth was graded to St. George in 1961 and played in three consecutive winning reserve-grade grand finals from 1962 to 1964 but he was unable to break into the first-grade side. In 1965, Taylforth moved to Canterbury and he was team captain in 1966. 
St. George's run of eleven straight premierships came to an end in 1967 when Canterbury defeated them by 12–11 in the preliminary final. Taylforth contributed three goals to the Canterbury score. In the 1967 Grand Final, Canterbury lost to South Sydney 12–10, with Taylforth scoring eight of the ten points from four goals. In the 1967 season, Taylforth scored 204 points and became the first Canterbury player to score more than 200 points in one season.
Taylforth signed with Cronulla-Sutherland in 1970 and spent three seasons with the club. In his first season with the club, Taylforth once again scored more than 200 points - 202 - a record that stood for thirty years until Mat Rogers scored 212 points in the 2000 season.
