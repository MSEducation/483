==Playing career==

===Negro leagues===

Campanella's father John was the son of Sicilian immigrants. His mother Ida was African American. Therefore, he was barred from Major League Baseball before [tpl]mlby|1947[/tpl], the season that black players were admitted to the major leagues for the first time since the 19th century. Campanella began playing Negro league baseball for the Washington Elite Giants in 1937, after dropping out of school on his sixteenth birthday. The Elite Giants would move to Baltimore the following year,Baltimore Elite Giants - Negro League Baseball Players Association website and Campanella would go on to become a star player with the team.

===Mexican league===

In 1942 and 1943, Campanella played in the Mexican League with the Monterrey Sultans. Lazaro Salazar, the team's manager, told Campanella that one day he would play at the Major League level. In 1971, Campanella was elected to the Mexican League Hall Of Fame.Campanella's biography page on the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame website (Spanish)

===Minor league===

In [tpl]mlby|1946[/tpl], Campanella moved into the Brooklyn Dodgers' minor league system, as the Dodger organization began preparations to break the Major Leagues' color barrier with Jackie Robinson.  For the 1946 season, Robinson was assigned to the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' affiliate in the Class AAA International League.  Meanwhile, the team looked to assign Campanella to a Class B league.  After the general manager of the Danville Dodgers of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League reported that he did not feel that league ready for racial integration, the organization sent Campanella, along with pitcher Don Newcombe, to the Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England League, where the Dodgers felt the climate would be more tolerant.  The Nashua team thus became the first professional baseball team in the 20th century to field a racially integrated lineup in the United States.
Campanella's 1946 season proceeded largely without racist incidents, and in one game Campanella took over the managerial duties after manager Walter Alston was ejected.  This made Campanella the first African-American to manage white players on an organized professional baseball team.  Nashua was three runs down at the time Campanella took over. They came back to win, in part due to Campanella's decision to use Newcombe as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning; Newcombe hit a game-tying two-run home run.

===Major League===

Jackie Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues came in 1947, and Campanella began his Major League career with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following season, playing his first game on April 20, 1948.  He went on to play for the Dodgers from [tpl]mlby|1948[/tpl] through [tpl]mlby|1957[/tpl] as their regular catcher. In 1948, he had three different uniform numbers (33, 39, and 56) before settling on 39 for the rest of his career.
Campanella played in the All-Star Game every year from [tpl]mlby|1949[/tpl] through [tpl]mlby|1956[/tpl]. His 1949 All-Star selection made him one of the first four African-Americans so honored. (Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe and Larry Doby were also All-Stars in 1949.)1949 All-Star Game. - Baseball-Almanac.  Campanella received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in the National League three times: in [tpl]mlby|1951[/tpl], [tpl]mlby|1953[/tpl], and [tpl]mlby|1955[/tpl]. In each of his MVP seasons, he batted over .300, hit over 30 home runs and had over 100 runs batted in. His 142 RBIs in 1953 broke the franchise record of 130, which had been held by Jack Fournier ([tpl]mlby|1925[/tpl]) and Babe Herman ([tpl]mlby|1930[/tpl]). Today it is the second most in franchise history, Tommy Davis breaking it with 153 RBIs in [tpl]mlby|1962[/tpl]. That same year, Campanella hit 40 home runs in games in which he appeared as a catcher, a record that lasted until [tpl]mlby|1996[/tpl], when it was broken by Todd Hundley. Over his career, he threw out 57% of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, the highest by any catcher in major league history.100 Best Catcher CS% Totals at The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers
In 1955, Campanella's final MVP season helped propel Brooklyn to its first-ever World Series championship. After the Dodgers dropped the first two games of that year's World Series to the Yankees, Campanella began Brooklyn's comeback by hitting a two-out, two-run home run in the first inning of Game 3. The Dodgers won that game, got another home run from Campanella in a Game 4 victory that tied the series, and then went on to claim the series in seven games.

After the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, California, and became the Los Angeles Dodgers, but Campanella's playing career came to an end before he ever played a game for Los Angeles.

==Automobile accident==

Campanella lived in Glen Cove, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island, while operating a liquor store in Harlem between regular-season games and during the off-season.  On January 28, 1958, after closing the store for the night, he began his drive to his home in Glen Cove.  En route, traveling at about [tpl]convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], his car, a rented 1957 Chevrolet sedan, hit a patch of ice at an S-curve on Dosoris Lane near Apple Tree Lane, skidded into a telephone pole and overturned, breaking Campanella's neck. He fractured the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae and compressed the spinal cord."Man Behind the Plate". - TIME. - February 10, 1958. - Retrieved: 2008-05-30"Seat Belts & Safety". - TIME. - August 24, 1962. - Retrieved: 2008-05-29 The accident left Campanella paralyzed from the shoulders down.

==Post-playing career==

After his playing career, Campanella remained involved with the Dodgers. In January 1959 the Dodgers named him assistant supervisor of scouting for the eastern part of the United States and special coach at the team's annual spring training camp in Vero Beach, Florida, serving each year as a mentor and coach to young catchers in the Dodger organization.People: News Roundup. - TIME. - January 12, 1959. - Retrieved: 2008-05-30  In 1978, he moved to California and took a job as assistant to the Dodgers' director of community relations, Campanella's former teammate and longtime friend Don Newcombe.

==Honors and tribute==

On May 7, [tpl]mlby|1959[/tpl], the Dodgers, then playing their second season in Los Angeles, honored Campanella with Roy Campanella Night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The New York Yankees agreed to make a special trip to Los Angeles to play an exhibition game against the Dodgers for the occasion. The Yankees won the game, 6–2. The attendance at the game was 93,103, setting a record at that time for the largest crowd to attend a Major League Baseball game. The proceeds from the game went to defray Campanella's medical bills.  In [tpl]mlby|1969[/tpl], Campanella was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the second player of African American heritage so honored, after Jackie Robinson. The same year, he received the Bronze Medallion from the City of New York.
On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Campanella's uniform number 39 alongside Robinson's (42) and Sandy Koufax's (32).

==Personal life==

Campanella was married three times.  His first marriage, to Bernice Ray on January 3, 1939, ended in divorce. They had two daughters together.  On April 30, 1945, he married Ruthe Willis and had three children with her (including a son, television director Roy Campanella II).  Their marriage deteriorated after his accident and was never the same; they separated in 1960 and Ruthe died in January 1963.

Campanella himself authored the inspirational book It’s Good to Be Alive, published in 1959, which details his journey back from the near-fatal car accident that left him paralyzed. The book mentions the years of tireless efforts by physical therapist Sam Brockington which allowed Campanella to regain some use of his arms, eventually overcome his initial bitterness about his fate, and finally adopt an optimistic outlook on life. Michael Landon made his TV-movie directorial debut in the 1974 movie It’s Good to Be Alive, in which Campanella was portrayed by Paul Winfield.
