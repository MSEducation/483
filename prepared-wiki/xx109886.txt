[[Fire-stick farming]]

CATEGORIES: Australian Aboriginal bushcraft, Agriculture in Australia, Bushfood, Wildfire ecology

Fire-stick farming, a term coined by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969, describes the practice of Indigenous Australians who regularly used fire to burn vegetation to facilitate hunting and to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area.
Fire-stick farming had the long-term effect of turning dry rainforest into savanna, increasing the population of nonspecific grass-eating species like the kangaroo. One theory of the extinction of Australian megafauna implicates the ecological disturbance caused by fire-stick farming.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr/11/c011p051.pdf|title=Desertification and climate changeâ€”the Australian perspective|author=G. Pickup[/tpl]
In the resultant sclerophyll forests, fire-stick farming maintained an open canopy and allowed germination of understory plants necessary for increasing the carrying capacity of the local environment for browsing and grazing marsupials.
It may be argued[tpl]Who|date=July 2013[/tpl] that Aborigines were able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas. It is also thought[tpl]Who|date=July 2013[/tpl] that there may[tpl]clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of Jungle.[tpl]cite web|url= http://austhrutime.com/fire-stick_farmers.htm|title=  Fire-Stick Farmers[/tpl]
This type of farming also directly increased the food supply for the aborigines, by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schools.nt.edu.au/tlcland/publications/Fire%20Book.pdf|title = The Fire Book | year = 2005| publisher = Tangentyre Landcare |accessdate =  24 March 2014[/tpl]

==Human influence on fire regime challenged==

A 2011 research paper has questioned whether Indigenous Australians carried out widespread burning of the Australian landscape. A study of charcoal records from more than 220 sites in Australasia dating back 70,000 years has found that the arrival of the first inhabitants about 50,000 years ago did not result in significantly greater fire activity across the continent. The arrival of European colonists after 1788, however, resulted in a substantial increase in fire activity.

The study shows higher bushfire activity from about 70,000 to 28,000 years ago. It decreased until about 18,000 years ago, around the time of the last glacial maximum, and then increased again, a pattern consistent with shifts between warm and cool climatic conditions. This suggests that fire in Australasia predominantly reflects climate, with colder periods characterized by less and warmer intervals by more biomass burning.
