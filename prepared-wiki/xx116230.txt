Through the film the audience sees the clash of egos that soon developed among the members of the group and their assistants, as each member attempts to mold the meeting to fit their own personal expectations[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]. Ultimately they discover they can't hope to change the world until they undergo a personal transformation. Assisted by the often light-hearted musings of the Dalai Lama, each member comes away uniquely changed by their experience[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl].
The film includes original music by Tibetan musicians.
