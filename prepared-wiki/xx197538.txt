==Managing career==

===1. FSV Mainz 05===

Upon his retirement playing for 1. FSV Mainz 05, Klopp was appointed as the club's manager. He remained as manager for seven years, during which time he led the team to its first appearance in the Bundesliga, and qualification for the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Mainz 05 were relegated, but Klopp chose to remain with the club. However, due to the fact that they were not able to achieve promotion, he resigned at the end of the 2007–08 season.

===Borussia Dortmund===

In May 2008, Klopp was approached to become the new manager of Borussia Dortmund, eventually signing a two-year contract at the club, which had finished in a disappointing 13th place under previous manager Thomas Doll. In his first season in charge, Klopp guided Borussia Dortmund to win the DFB-Supercup, defeating German champions Bayern Munich.[tpl]cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=557105&sec=europe&cc=5739 | title = Dortmund beat Bayern to retain Super Cup | publisher = ESPN Soccernet | date = 23 July 2008 | accessdate = 19 May 2012[/tpl] Klopp took the club to a sixth place finish in his first season in charge, and a fifth place finish in the season after that, before leading the club to successive Bundesliga titles in the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons.[tpl]cite web | url = http://au.eurosport.com/football/bundesliga/2010-2011/borussia-dortmund_sto2771532/story.shtml | title = Borussia Dortmund win title | publisher =  eurosport.com | date = 1 May 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-11/ronaldo-s-hat-trick-restores-real-s-lead-dortmund-beats-bayern | title = Ronaldo's Hat Trick Restores Real's Lead; Dortmund Beats Bayern | publisher = Businessweek.com | date =11 April 2012 | accessdate = 16 May 2012[/tpl]
During the 2011–12 Bundesliga season, the 81 points accrued by Borussia Dortmund was the greatest points tally ever amassed in Bundesliga history and the 47 points earned in the second half of the season also set a new record. Borussia Dortmund's 25 league wins equalled Bayern Munich's 1972–73 milestone, while their 28-league match unbeaten sequence was the best ever recorded in a single German top-flight season.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ger/news/newsid=1797758.html#season+review+germany| title = Season review: Germany | publisher = www.uefa.com | date = 23 May 2012 | accessdate = 23 May 2012[/tpl] The record number of points (for the whole season and the second half of the season) and the record number of league wins set or equalled by Borussia Dortmund in the 2011–2012 season were broken by FC Bayern Munich in the 2012–2013 season. On 12 May 2012, Klopp made Borussia Dortmund history by sealing the club's first ever domestic double, by defeating Bayern Munich 5–2 to win the DFB-Pokal. Klopp described the double as being "better than (he) could have imagined".[tpl]cite web | url = http://zeenews.india.com/sports/football/dortmund-win-domestic-double-beating-bayern_742209.html | title = Borussia Dortmund win domestic double beating Bayern Munich | publisher = zeenews.com | accessdate = 19 May 2012 | date = 13 May 201[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1069150/borussia-dortmund-rout-bayern-munich-to-claim-historic-double?cc=5739 | title = Dortmund rout Bayern to claim double | publisher = ESPN.com | accessdate = 12 May 2012 | date = 12 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/bundesliga-champ-borussia-dortmund-beats-bayern-munich-5-2-to-win-german-cup-final/2012/05/12/gIQAB4ntKU_story.html | title = Bundesliga champ Borussia Dortmund beats Bayern Munich 5–2 to win German Cup final | publisher = WP Sports | accessdate = 12 May 2012 | date = 12 May 2012[/tpl]
Borussia Dortmund's league form during the 2012–13 season was not as impressive as in the previous campaign, with Klopp insisting that his team would focus on the Champions League to make up for their disappointing run in that competition in the previous season. Klopp's team were drawn against Manchester City, Real Madrid and Ajax in the coined 'Group of Death'. However, they did not lose a game, topping the group with some impressive performances, especially against José Mourinho's Madrid side. Borussia Dortmund progressed all the way to the final, meeting Real Madrid again in the semi final stages of the competition. After an excellent result against them at home in the first leg, a 4–1 victory, a 2–0 loss meant Dortmund only narrowly progressed to the final.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/may/01/jurgen-klopp-champions-league-borussia-dortmund|title= Jürgen Klopp targets Champions League final glory for Dortmund|date=30 April 2013|work=Guardian|accessdate=1 May 2013 [/tpl] Dortmund lost the final 1–2 to Bayern Munich, with an 89th minute goal from Arjen Robben.[tpl]cite news|title=Robben setzt Bayern Europas Krone auf|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/chleague/spielrunde/champions-league/2012-13/10/1886185/spielanalyse_borussia-dortmund-17_bayern-muenchen-14.html|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=kicker|date=25 May 2013|language=German[/tpl]
In the beginning of the 2013–14 season, Klopp extended his contract until June 2018.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2013/10/30/4370493/klopp-signs-dortmund-extension-until-2018?ICID=HP_BN_4|title=Klopp signs Dortmund extension until 2018|date=30 October 2013|work=Guardian|accessdate=30 October 2013 [/tpl] Klopp received a fine of €10,000 on 17 March 2014 after getting ejected from a Bundesliga match against Borussia Mönchengladbach.[tpl]cite news|title=Klopp muss 10.000 Euro Strafe zahlen|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/fussball-bundesliga-klopp-droht-nachspiel-1.1915122|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=17 March 2014|language=German[/tpl] The ejection was a result of "verbal attack" on the referee.[tpl]cite news|last=Kops|first=Calle|title=Dortmund's 'repeat offender' Klopp hit with fine|url=http://www.dw.de/dortmunds-repeat-offender-klopp-hit-with-fine/a-17502635|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=17 March 2014[/tpl] Deniz Aytekin, who was the referee, stated that Klopp's "behavior was rude on more than one occasion." Borussia Dortmund vorstand chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke stated that "I have to support Jürgen Klopp 100 percent in this case" because he saw no reason for a fine and denied that Klopp insulted the fourth official.

==Media career==

From 2005, Klopp appeared as a regular expert commentator on the German television network ZDF, giving his views on games of the German national football team. On 20 October 2006, he received the Deutscher Fernsehpreis in the category of best sports show. His term ended after UEFA Euro 2008. He was succeeded by Oliver Kahn. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he worked with RTL alongside Günther Jauch.

==Advertisement activities==

Klopp's popularity is used in advertisements by, among others, the footwear-, athlete clothing- and sporty fashion-company Puma, the carmaker Opel and the German cooperative banking group Volksbanken-Raiffeisenbanken. According to Horizont, trade magazine for the German advertising industry, and the business weekly Wirtschaftswoche, Klopp's role as "brand ambassador" for Opel successfully helped the struggling carmaker to increase sales.
