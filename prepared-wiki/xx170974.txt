Lazurnaya Bay ([tpl]lang-ru|Бухта Лазурная[/tpl]) - part of the Ussuri Bay of the Sea of Japan. Shamora ([tpl]lang-ru|Шамора[/tpl]) is a Chinese and traditional Russian name. The Chinese name translates as "sandy desert", referring to the sandy beaches that attract scores of holiday-makers from Vladivostok and other towns of the Russian Far East. Several rest homes and sanatioriums are scattered along the coastline.  The hinterland is hilly and woody.
From the 1880s until 1973, it was also called Feldhausen Bay (in honor of Alexander Feldhausen, the first Military Governor of the Vladivostok).
Shamora is also the name of a collection of old songs by the Vladivostok band Mumiy Troll.
