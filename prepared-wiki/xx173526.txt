===Critical response===

When the film was released, Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review.  The staff wrote, "Ben Hecht, to say the least, has done the expected by coming up with the unusual. Specter of the Rose was obviously a conscious attempt by Hecht to prove on how small a budget he could produce an acceptable picture. Reports are that it cost in the neighborhood of $160,000. The serious defect production wise is a general lack of polish that is at times disturbing ... Hecht’s direction and dialog give the acting a stylized artificiality that grows on the spectator as the picture progresses. Satire of the characterizations makes many of the film’s people virtually caricatures."Variety. Staff film review, 1946. Accessed: July 26, 2013.
More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz praised the production.  He wrote, "Writer Ben Hecht (Angels Over Broadway/Soak The Rich/The Scoundrel) tries his hand at directing, in this cynical serio-comic ballet melodrama that distinguishes itself by its brilliant dialogue and ability to blend together kitsch art with a wild-eyed film noir tale. It offers memorable acerbic lines such as 'the masses would never get married if the poets didn't tell them how beautiful it is,' 'art itself is a miracle,' and 'love is a seasonal thing among artists.' ... Hecht amazingly brings art to the Republic studio, known for making artless actions pics that please the masses. It has a very funny blend of culture and soap opera story telling, that's richly flavored by the world of ballet and the artsy-fartsy crowd that reside in that world. It's a one-of-kind film that I enjoy seeing again and again over the years, without ever tiring of its pretenses."Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, January 20, 2011.
