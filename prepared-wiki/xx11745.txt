Madero in 1910 and the first one in 71 years to defeat, with 42 percent of the vote, the then-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/815359.stm|title=End of era for all-powerful party|last=Milner|first=Kate|date=2000-07-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-11-28[/tpl]

==Early years==

Vicente Fox was born in Guanajuato on July 2, 1942, the second of nine children. His father was José Luis Fox Pont, a Mexican citizen,[tpl]cite news|last=Martinez|first=Fabiola|title=Indagará PGR origen de un acta de nacimiento del padre de Fox|newspaper=El periódico de México|date=2006-09-01|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/09/01/017n2pol.php|accessdate=2007-06-04[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and his mother Mercedes Quesada Etxaide, was Basque from San Sebastian, Gipuzkoa, Spain. Fox's paternal grandfather was born Joseph Louis Fuchs in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of German Catholic immigrants, Louis Fuchs and Catherina Elisabetha Flach, of Strasbourg, now in France. The "Fox" surname was changed from the German "Fuchs" during the 1870s.Ancestry.com. Cincinnati, Ohio Directory, 1890-91 on-line. Provo, UT, USA: MyFamily.com, Inc., 2000. Original data: Cincinnati, OH, USA: Williams & Co., 1890.
Fox spent his childhood and adolescence at the family ranch in San Francisco del Rincón in Guanajuato. He moved to Mexico City to attend the Universidad Iberoamericana and received a Bachelor's degree in business administration in 1964. He earned his diploma in top management skills from the Harvard Business School in the United States in 1974.[tpl]cite web|title=Vicente Fox|url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/miembro/vicente_fox|accessdate=2010-06-27[/tpl]
In 1964, Fox went to work for the Coca-Cola Company where he started as a route supervisor, and he drove a delivery truck. He quickly rose in the company to become the supervisor of Coca-Cola's operations in Mexico, and later in all of Latin America. As the President of Coca Cola Mexico, Fox presided over Coca-Cola when it became Mexico's top-selling soft drink, increasing Coca-Cola's sales by almost 50%.[tpl]cite news|last=Milner|first=Kate|title=Profile: Vicente Fox|publisher=BBC|date=2000-07-03|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/813206.stm|accessdate=2007-06-04[/tpl]
Vicente Fox married a receptionist at Coca-Cola, Lilian de la Concha. They adopted four children, Ana Cristina, Vicente, Paulina, and Rodrigo.[tpl]cite news|last=BeleJack|first=Barbara|title=Live, from Guanjuato: It's President VICENTE FOX!|publisher=Texas Observer|date=2001-02-16|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=20|accessdate=2007-06-04 [/tpl] In 1990, after 20 years of marriage, Lilian filed for and was granted a divorce.
Vicente Fox married for the second time while in office as President. He married Marta María Sahagún Jiménez (until then his spokesperson) on July 2, 2001, the first anniversary of his presidential election and his 59th birthday. For both, this was their second marriage.
After retiring from Coca-Cola, Vicente Fox began to participate in various public activities in Guanajuato, where he created the "Patronato de la Casa Cuna Amigo Daniel", an orphanage. He was the president of the Patronato Loyola, a sponsor of the León campus of the Universidad Iberoamericana and of the Lux Institute.Biography of Vicente Fox[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Early political career==

With the support of Manuel Clouthier, Vicente Fox joined the Partido Acción Nacional on March 1, 1988. That same year he ran for and was elected to the federal Chamber of Deputies representing the Third Federal District in León, Guanajuato.

===Governor of Guanajuato===

After serving in the Chamber of Deputies, Fox sought the governorship in Guanajuato in 1991, but lost to Ramón Aguirre Velázquez of the PRI. Following the election, local discontent was so great that the state Congress appointed Carlos Medina Plascencia of the PAN as interim governor.[tpl]cite web|title=Vicente Fox: President Elect of Mexico|year=2000|url=http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/kids/history/html/bio_foxkids.html|accessdate=2007-06-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070307090729/http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/kids/history/html/bio_foxkids.html |archivedate=2007-03-07[/tpl] Four years later, Fox ran again, winning by a vote of 2 to 1.
As governor, Fox promoted government efficiency and transparency. He was one of the first state governors of Mexico to give a clear, public and timely account of the finances of his state.Biography of Vicente Fox, United Nations. (accessed January 20, 2010)
Fox pushed for the consolidation of small firms, promoted the sale overseas of goods manufactured in Guanajuato and created a unique system in which micro-credits with no overdue portfolio were granted. Under Fox, the state became the fifth most important Mexican state economy.

===Campaign for President===

On July 7, 1997 (three years before the presidential election of 2000), Vicente Fox decided to run for President of Mexico. In spite of opposition within his party, Fox secured his candidacy representing the Alliance for Change, a political coalition formed by the National Action Party and the Green Ecological Party of Mexico on November 14, 1999. 
During the course of his campaign a presidential debate was organized. There was a disagreement between the three main contenders, Fox, Francisco Labastida of the PRI and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the PRD, and some of the arguments were broadcast on national television, notably the one on whether the debate should be held that same day or the following Friday.Encyclopedia.com[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] For minutes, Fox kept repeating the word "Hoy" meaning "today," originating the famous phrase "hoy, hoy, hoy!" The other candidates decided to postpone the debate, but Fox used that day's airtime anyway. At first the action brought criticism to Fox, but it soon backfired against his opponents when Fox started using his new phrase to gain new supporters as he campaigned for a better future "today." 
During the presidential debate his main opponent, Francisco Labastida, claimed in a nationally televised debate that Vicente Fox had repeatedly called him a "sissy" and a "cross-dresser".http://us-mex.irc-online.org/borderlines/updater/2000/june30Elect.html[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] Fox's campaign slogans were "¡Ya!" ("Right now!"), "Ya ganamos" ("We've already won") and "Vota Alianza por el Cambio" meaning "Vote for Alliance for Change."

====Amigos de Fox====

Amigos de Fox ("Friends of Fox") was a non-profit fund-raising group established by Denise Montaño that was instrumental in getting Vicente Fox elected President of Mexico. The phrase was also used as a campaign slogan referring to the millions of people supporting Fox in the 2000 presidential elections.LaRaza.com[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In 2003, money-laundering charges were lodged against the fund-raising group, but were dropped shortly before the July 2003 mid-term elections.AlertNet.org

====Election results====

On July 2, 2000, (Fox's 58th birthday) he won the presidential election with 43% (15,989,636 votes) of the popular vote, followed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate Francisco Labastida with 36% (13,579,718 votes), and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) with 17% (6,256,780 votes). Vicente Fox declared victory that same night, a victory which was ratified by President Zedillo. After the final results were announced, President-elect Vicente Fox met with thousands of supporters at the Angel of Independence monument in Mexico City, to address his supporters and celebrate his victory. His opponents conceded the election later that night.
President-elect Vicente Fox received an enormous amount of media coverage, as well as many congratulating messages and phone calls from world leaders including then President of the United States, Bill Clinton.
Fox took office as president on December 1, 2000, marking the first time in Mexico's history that an incumbent government peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.

===Public image===

During his campaign for president, Vicente Fox became well known for his unique cowboy style and popular charisma. As speaker, Fox usually gathered big crowds in early years of his presidency.Salon.com News | Fox is it

====Controversial comments====

==Post-presidential life==

===Public speaking and advocacy===

After leaving office in December 2006, Fox has maintained himself in the public eye by speaking in countries such as Nigeria, Canada and the United States about topics such as the controversial 2006 election and the Iraq War. In Mexico, Fox's busy post-presidency has caused much criticism because traditionally former Presidents in Mexico are expected to stay out of the public/political spotlight. Nevertheless, Fox stated: [tpl]cquote|There is no reason to hold to the anti-democratic rules of those who still live in the authoritarian past…now that Mexico is a democracy, every citizen has the right to express himself, even a former president.Wall, Allan. "Fox Redefines the Role of Past Mexican Presidents." (accessed January 20, 2010)[/tpl]
In addition, President Fox has expressed interest in campaigning for PAN candidates in future Mexican elections, an action that would make him the first former president in many decades to do so. Given that President Fox is still well-liked and left office with approval ratings of 70%, many in Mexico are wondering if his support could result in candidates being elected.Gonzalez, Enrique Andrade, "The Final Days of Mexican President Vicente Fox" Mexidate.Info
Vicente Fox is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that offers, discreetly and confidentially, a range of experienced advisors to political leaders facing difficult situations.
In 2013, Fox discussed why the West has pursued a moral crusade against drugs at HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay-on-Wye.[tpl]cite web|last=Fox|first=Vicente|title=Drugs, Money and Morality|url=http://iai.tv/video/drugs-money-and-morality|publisher=IAI|accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] with Chris Bryant and John Ralston Saul. The three debated whether it is hypocritical to ban certain drugs while continuing to export others such as alcohol and tobacco. Should we follow the lead of Washington and Colorado states in the U.S. and allow the free trading of drugs?
Vicente Fox gave a video interview in July 2013 to High Times magazine, in which he discussed the failure of drug prohibition, and cited Portugal's decriminalization policies as "working splendid(ly)". He said he supports drug legalization despite not being a user himself, just as he said he also "fully respects" same-sex marriage although he does not personally agree with it.[tpl]cite web|last=Hampton|first=Justin|title=President Vicente Fox: The HIGH TIMES Interview|url=http://www.hightimes.com/watch/high-times-interview-president-vicente-fox/|publisher=High Times|accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl]
In February 2014, Fox wrote an opinion piece that was published in the Globe And Mail newspaper of Toronto in which he stated: [tpl]cquote|Legalization of not just marijuana, but all drugs, is the right thing to do.Fox, Vicente. "For Mexico, legalization is freedom." (accessed February 18, 2014)[/tpl]
He also said that "we must be given the very freedom to decide our own behaviour and to act responsibly, as long as we do not detrimentally affect the rights of others."

===Autobiography===

Fox's autobiography, entitled Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith and Dreams of a Mexican President, was released in September 2007.Clock ticking for Allyn on Fox book | Dallas Morning News | News for Dallas, Texas | Arts & Entertainment[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] To promote its release, Fox toured many U.S. cities to do book-signings and interviews with U.S. media. During his tour, however, he faced protests from Mexican immigrants who accused him of actions that forced them to emigrate and find jobs in the United States.Fox reaparece en Los Ángeles; entre protestas, defiende logros - El Universal - México He faced the subject several times during interviews, such as one held with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, who questioned him about the massive illegal immigration problem of Mexicans into the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300817,00.html|work=Fox News|title=Former Mexican President Vicente Fox Debates Immigration Issue With Bill|date=October 10, 2007[/tpl] Finally, during an interview with Telemundo's Rubén Luengas, the interviewer asked Fox about allegations concerning some properties of Vicente Fox's wife, Martha Sahagún. After Fox explained the situation he asked the interviewer not to make false accusations and to prove what he was saying. Luengas said, "I'm telling you in your face, I'm not a liar." After this, Fox walked out of the studio, calling the interviewer a "liar," "vulgar" and "stupid."Entrevista con Vicente Fox causa polémica - Noticias - KVEA Los Angeles[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Upon the book's release, many were surprised to read several excerpts in which Fox was highly critical of U.S. President George W. Bush, considered by many to be a close friend of Fox's. For example, Fox wrote that Bush was "the cockiest guy I have ever met in my life," and claimed that he was surprised that Bush had ever made it to the White House. Later, in an interview with Larry King, Fox explained that this was a misunderstanding; what he meant by calling George W. Bush 'cocky' was to say he was "confident."Polémica por gira de Fox[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Fox also referred to Bush in his autobiography as a "windshield cowboy," due to Bush's apparent fear of a horse Fox offered him to ride.Vicente Fox: Bush a "windshield cowboy" who's scared of horses | Corrente

===Centrist Democratic International===

On September 20, 2007, Fox was elected Co-President of the Centrist Democratic International (along with the re-elected Pier Ferdinando Casini) at its leaders' meeting in Rome. The CDI is the international organization of political parties that counts Fox's party, the National Action Party, as a member.Portail d'informations Ce site est en vente![tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Statue controversy===

In October 2007, an announcement was made in the municipality of Boca del Río, Veracruz, that a 3-meter (10 ft) statue of Vicente Fox was to be erected to honor the former president. This aroused much criticism from the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution and Mexican media "towards Boca del Río's mayor", "who is affiliated with the National Action Party, of which Fox is also a member."
The statue was put in place amidst protests on the dawn of October 13, 2007. The inauguration was to have been held on October 14, 2007. Some hours after the installation, a crowd of about 100 people brought the statue down with a rope, damaging it. The statue was put back in place for the inauguration, then taken away for repairs.La Prensa Latina » Blog Archive » Derriban estatua de Vicente Fox[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
PAN members accused Veracruz's governor, Fidel Herrera Beltrán, of "ordering the attack on the statue", while Fox called him intolerant. Some sources in the media considered that the installation of the statue was inappropriate, since former President Fox was facing allegations relating to an illicit enrichment scandal.
Many of the protesters were members of the center-left Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] which governed Mexico for much of the 20th century, until Fox (of the National Action Party PAN) won the 2000 presidential election, ousting the PRI from power.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/14/world/main3365380.shtml|work=CBS News|title=Protestors Tear Down Vicente Fox Statue|date=October 14, 2007[/tpl]
