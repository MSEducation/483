[[Scar]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases involving the fasciae

Scars are areas of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that replace normal skin after injury. A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g., after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this is animals with complete regeneration, which regrow tissue without scars formation.
Scar tissue is composed of the same protein (collagen) as the tissue that it replaces,[ref]
