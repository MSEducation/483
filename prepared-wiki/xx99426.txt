Bhubaneswar [tpl]IPAc-en|,|b|uu|v|@|'|n|ay|sh|w|@r[/tpl],  also spelt Bhubaneshwar ([tpl]lang-or|ଭୁବନେଶ୍ୱର[/tpl] Bhubanēswara; [tpl]audio|Bhubaneshwar.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]), is the capital of the Indian state of Odisha, formerly known as Orissa. The city has a history of over 3,000 years starting with the Mahamegha-bahana Chedi dynasty (around the 2nd century BCE) which had its capital at Sisupalgarh, nearby. Bhubaneswar, derived its name from Tribhubaneswar, which literally means the Lord (Eeswar) of the Three World (Tribhuban), which refers to Shiva.[tpl]cite book|last=Kalia|first=Ravi|title=Bhubaneswar: From a Temple Town to a Capital City|year=1994|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=9780809318766|pages=3[/tpl] Bhubaneswar has been known by names such as Toshali, Kalinga Nagari, Nagar Kalinga, Ekamra Kanan, Ekamra Kshetra and Mandira Malini Nagari ([tpl]lang-en|"City of Temples"[/tpl]).  It is the largest city in Odisha and is a centre of economic and religious importance in Eastern India.
With many Hindu temples, which span the entire spectrum of Kalinga architecture, Bhubaneswar is often referred to as a Temple City of India and together with Puri and Konark it forms the Swarna Tribhuja ("Golden Triangle"), one of eastern India's most visited destinations.Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra, Archaeology in Orissa, Vol I, Page 47, B. R. Publishing Corporation, Delhi, 1986, ISBN 81-7018-346-4
Bhubaneswar replaced Cuttack as the capital in 1948, the year after India gained its independence from Britain. The modern city was designed by the German architect Otto Königsberger in 1946. Along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh, it was one of modern India's first planned cities. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are often referred to as the twin-cities of Odisha. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.4 million in 2011.Preface of the Comprehensive Development Plan for the Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Urban Complex Bhubaneswar is categorized as a Tier-2 city. An emerging Information Technology (IT) and education hub, Bhubaneswar is one of the country's fastest developing cities.

==History==

The history of Bhubaneswar may be viewed in terms of ancient and modern eras. The ancient city has a history of more than 2,000 years, while the modern city emerged in 1948.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orissatourism.org/travel-to-orissa/bhubaneshwar/history-of-bhubaneshwar.html|title=History of Bhubaneshwar|author=Orissa Tourism[/tpl]
Bhubaneswar's first mention was during the Kalinga War, which took place near Dhauli (now in the south of the city) in the 3rd century BCE. Later Emperor Kharavela established his capital at Sisupalgarh, on the outskirts of the modern city. The Hathigumpha inscriptions at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves by Kharavela give a good account of that period, which is estimated as 1st–2nd century BCE. Temples built throughout the ancient and medieval periods chronicle the city's history.
Jain and Buddhist shrines portray the settlements around Bhubaneswar in the first two centuries BCE. One of the most complete edicts of the Mauryan emperor, Ashoka, dating from between 272-236 BCE, remains carved in rock [tpl]convert|8|km|mi[/tpl] to the southwest of the modern city.History, Religion and Culture of India.P.180. S. Gajrani
The city was the ancient capital of the Kalinga Empire and the architectural legacy of the period is manifest. Historical sites in the city testify to the importance of the region during the 7th to 11th centuries CE, when the Kalinga kings ruled Odisha and beyond. The Ananta Vasudeva Temple and Bindusagar Tank is the only temple of Vishnu in the city. The temples in Bhubaneswar are regarded as having been built from the 8th to 12th centuries under Shaiva influence.Bengal District Gazetteer:Puri.P.242.L.S.S. O'Malley
On 1 April 1936, Odisha, then known as Orissa, became a separate province in British India with Cuttack as its capital. This date is celebrated as  Utkal Divas. Cuttack had been Odisha's capital since the 12th century. With independence in 1947, Odisha became a state. Because of Cuttack's vulnerability to floods and space constraints, the capital was moved to Bhubaneswar, which was formally inaugurated on 13 April 1948.  The new capital was built as a modern city, designed by German architect Otto Königsberger with wide roads, gardens and parks. Though part of the city followed the plan, it has grown rapidly over the last few decades, outstripping the planning process.

==Geography==

Bhubaneswar is located in Khordha district of Odisha. It is situated in the eastern coastal plains, along the axis of the Eastern Ghats mountains.

===Urban structure===

The Bhubaneswar urban development area consists of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation area, 173 revenue villages and two other municipalities spread over [tpl]convert|393.57|sqkm|sqmi[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=BDA Snapshot|url=http://bdabbsr.in/bdasnapshot.pdf|publisher=Bhubaneswar Development Authority|accessdate=26 December 2012[/tpl] The area under the jurisdiction of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation covers [tpl]convert|135|sqkm[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=About Bhubaneswar|url=http://bmc.gov.in/BMCProfile.asp?lnk=1&PL=4|publisher=Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation|accessdate=26 December 2012[/tpl] The city is somewhat dumbbell-shaped with most of the growth taking place to the north, northeast and southwest.[tpl]cite web|title=City Structure|url=http://www.odisha.gov.in/forest&environment/pdf/Chap_3.pdf|work=Environmental Management Plan for Bhubaneswar|publisher=Forest and Environment Department, Government of Odisha|accessdate=26 December 2012[/tpl] The north–south axis of the city is widest, at roughly [tpl]convert|22.5|km|mi[/tpl]. Growth in the east is restricted due to the presence of Kuakhai River and by the wildlife sanctuary in the northwestern part. The city can be broadly divided into the old town, planned city (or state capital), added areas and outer peripheral areas. The city is subdivided into Units and Colonies.
The old town or "Temple Town", the oldest part of the city, is characterised by many temples, including the Lingaraj, Rajarani, and Muktesvara temples, standing alongside residential areas. This area is congested, with narrow roads and poor infrastructure.  Among neighbourhoods in the old town are Rajarani Colony, Pandav Nagar, Brahmeswar Bagh, Lingaraj Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Bhimatanki and Kapileswar.
The planned city was designed in 1948 to house the capital. It is subdivided into units, each with a high school, shopping centers, dispensaries and play areas. While most of the units house government employees, Unit V houses the administrative buildings, including the State Secretariat, State Assembly, and the Raj Bhavan. Private residential areas were later built in other areas of the planned city, including Saheed Nagar and Satya Nagar. Unit I, popularly known as the Market Building, was formed to cater to the shopping needs of the new capital's residents. Later, markets and commercial establishments developed along the Janpath and Cuttack-Puri Road at Saheed Nagar, Satya Nagar, Bapuji Nagar and Ashok Nagar.  A dedicated institutional area houses educational and research institutes, including Utkal University, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology and Sainik School.  Indira Gandhi Park, Gandhi Park and the Biju Patnaik Park are located in the unit.
The added areas are mostly areas lying north of National Highway 5, including Nayapalli, Jayadev Vihar, Chandrasekharpur and Sailashree Vihar, which were developed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority to house the growing population.
The peripheral areas are outside the municipal boundary, or that have subsequently been included within the extended boundary, including Tomando, Patia and Raghunathpur. Most of these areas were developed in a haphazard manner, without proper planning.[tpl]cite news|last=Praharaj|first=Maharani|title=Urban sprawl: Its impact on peri-urban areas of Bhubaneswar|url=http://dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/98402-urban-sprawl-its-impact-on-peri-urban-areas-of-bhubaneswar.html|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Pioneer|date=30 September 2012[/tpl]

==Economy==

Bhubaneswar is primarily an administrative city and a tourism city. Bhubaneswar has emerged as a fast-growing, important trading and commercial hub in the state and eastern India. Tourism is a major industry, attracting about 1.5 million tourists in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Statistical Bulletin 2011-12|url=http://www.orissatourism.gov.in/new/pdf/Statistical%20Bulletin%202011-12.pdf|publisher=Department of Tourism, Government of Odisha|accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] Bhubaneswar was designed to be a largely residential city with outlying industrial areas. The economy had few major players until the 1990s and was dominated by retail and small-scale manufacturing. With the economic liberalisation policy adopted by the Government of India in the 1990s, Bhubaneswar received investment in telecommunications, information technology (IT) and higher education.
As of 2001, around 2.15% of the city's workforce was employed in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.); 2.18% worked in the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing); and 95.67% worked in the tertiary sector (service industries).
