==Reception==

Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Verdict, said that the film "is a certifiable classic, a perfectly executed premise of such outrageous originality that it's amazing no one had thought of doing it before".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/killernerd.php |title=Killer Nerd / Bride Of Killer Nerd |last=Gibron |first=Bill |date=June 8, 2004 |website=DVD Verdict |accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] Ian Jane, of DVD Talk, said that this film and its sequel are "typical bad horror-comedy hybrids" which are "quite dull", but went on to say that "while the movies are pretty much bottom of the barrel entertainment, they do have their own special kind of retarded charm".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/10999/killer-nerd-bride-of-killer-nerd/ |title=Killer Nerd/Bride of Killer Nerd |last=Jane |first=Ian |date=June 4, 2004 |website=DVD Talk |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]
