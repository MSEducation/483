The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's fact sheet on the "Relationship of Walking to Mortality Among U.S. Adults with Diabetes" states that those with diabetes who walked for 2 or more hours a week lowered their mortality rate from all causes by 39 per cent. "Walking lengthened the life of people with diabetes regardless of age, sex, race, body mass index, length of time since diagnosis, and presence of complications or functional limitations."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/factsheets/walking.htm |title=Relationship of walking to mortality among U.S. adults |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=16 October 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130129041207/http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/factsheets/walking.htm |archivedate=29 January 2013[/tpl]
Governments now recognize the benefits of walking for mental and physical health and are actively encouraging it. This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less now than previously. In the UK; a Department of Transport report[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/factsheets/walkingfactsheet.pdf |title=Statistics - Department for Transport |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] found that between 1995/97 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design. 
One programme to encourage walking is "The Walking the Way to Health Initiative", organized by the British walkers association The Ramblers, which is the largest volunteer led walking scheme in the United Kingdom. Volunteers are trained to lead free Health Walks from community venues such as libraries and doctors' surgeries. The scheme has trained over 35,000 volunteers and have over 500 schemes operating across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week.http://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk Walking for Health. A new organization called "Walk England" launched a web site in June 2008 to provide these professionals with evidence, advice and examples of success stories of how to encourage communities to walk more. The site has a social networking aspect to allow professionals and the public to ask questions, post news and events and communicate with others in their area about walking, as well as a "walk now" option to find out what walks are available in each region. Similar organizations exist in other countries and recently a "Walking Summit" was held in the USA. This "assembled thought-leaders and influencers from business, urban planning and real estate, with physicians and public health officials," and others, to discuss how to make American cities and communities places where "people can and want to walk".http://everybodywalk.org/read/1260-2013-walking-summit.html Walk Unlimited

==The origins of walking==

It is theorized that "walking" among tetrapods originated underwater with air-breathing fish that could "walk" underwater, giving rise to the plethora of land-dwelling life that walk on four or two limbs.[tpl]cite web|last=Choi |first=Charles |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45645209/ns/technology_and_science-science/ |title=Hopping fish suggests walking originated underwater; Discovery might redraw the evolutionary route scientists think life took from water to land |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] While terrestrial tetrapods are theorised to have a single origin, arthropods and their relatives are thought to have independently evolved walking several times, specifically in insects, myriapods, chelicerates, tardigrades, onychophorans, and crustaceans.Evolution of the Insects - David Grimaldi, Michael S. Engel - Google Books
Judging from footprints discovered on a former shore in Kenya, it is thought possible that ancestors of modern humans were walking in ways very similar to the present activity as many as 1.5 million years ago.

==Variants of walking==

==Biomechanics==

Human walking is accomplished with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg that leaves the ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes the ground with the heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.
Walking differs from a running gait in a number of ways. The most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging. In running there is typically a ballistic phase where the runner is airborne with both feet in the air (for bipedals).
Another difference concerns the movement of the centre of mass of the body. In walking the body "vaults" over the leg on the ground, raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical, and dropping it to the lowest as the legs are spread apart. Essentially kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in potential energy. This is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its lowest as the leg is vertical. This is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in muscles and tendons. In running there is a conversion between kinetic, potential, and elastic energy.
There is an absolute limit on an individual's speed of walking (without special techniques such as those employed in speed walking) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride - if it's greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground. Typically however, animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies.

==A leisure activity==

Many people enjoy walk as a recreation in the mainly urban modern world, and it is one of the best forms of exercise.[tpl]cite web|author=Ramblers |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/advice-for-walkers/walking-and-your-health.aspx |title=Walking benefits |publisher=Ramblers.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] For some walking is a way to enjoy nature and the outdoors and for others the physical, sporting and endurance aspect is more important.
There are a variety of different kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking, and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count the number of their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the USA and South Africa for long vigorous walks, similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walk in snow, though a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.
In terms of tourism the possibilities range from guided walking tours in cities, to organized trekking holidays in the Himalayas. In the UK the term walking tour also refers to a multi-day walk or hike undertaken by a group or individual. A system of well organized trails exist in many other European counties, as well Canada, USA, New Zealand, and Nepal. A system of lengthy waymarked walking trails now stretch across Europe from Norway to Turkey, Portugal to Cyprus.See European long-distance paths Many also walk the traditional pilgrim routes, of which the most famous is El Camino de Santiago, The Way of St. James.
Numerous walking festivals and other walking events take place each year all over the world. The world's largest walking event is the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen in the Netherland. The "Vierdaagse" (Dutch for "Four day Event") is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909, being based at Nijmegen since 1916. Depending on age group and category, walkers have to walk 30, 40 or 50 kilometers each day for four days. Originally a military event with a few civilians, it now is a mainly civilian event. Numbers have risen in recent years, with over 40,000 now taking part, including about 5,000 military personnel. It is now the world's largest walking event. Due to crowds on the route, since 2004 the organizers have limited the number of participants. In the USA there is the annual Labor Day walk on Mackinac Bridge, Michigan, which draws over sixty thousand participants, while the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Walk in Maryland annually draws over fifty thousand participants. There are also various walks are that are organised as charity events with walkers sponsored for a specific cause. Thes walks range in length from two mile (3Â km) or five km to fifty miles (eighty km). The MS Challenge Walk is a 80 km or fifty mile walk which raises money to fight multiple sclerosis, while walkers in the Oxfam Trailwalker cover one hundred km event or 60 miles. 
In Britain, The Ramblers, a registered charity, is the largest organisation that looks after the interests of walkers, with some 139,000 members. Its "Get Walking Keep Walking" project provides free routes guides, led walks, as well information for people new to walking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.getwalking.org |title=Get Walking Keep Walking website |publisher=Getwalking.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] The Long Distance Walkers Association is walking organisation in the UK for the more energetic walker, and organizes lengthy challenge hikes of 20 or even fifty or more miles (30 to 80km) in a day. The LDWA's annual "Hundred" event, entailing walking 100 miles or 160km in 48 hours, takes place each British Spring Bank Holiday weekend.http://www.ldwa.org.uk/history.php Long Distance Walkers Association: History.

===Walkability===

There has been a recent focus among urban planners in some communities to create pedestrian-friendly areas and roads, allowing commuting, shopping and recreation to be done on foot.  The concept of walkability has arisen as a measure of the degree to which an area is friendly to walking.  Some communities are at least partially car-free, making them particularly supportive of walking and other modes of transportation. In the United States, the active living network is an example of a concerted effort to develop communities more friendly to walking and other physical activities.
Walking is also considered to be a clear example of a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and/or relatively shorter distances. Non-motorised transport modes such as walking, but also cycling, small-wheeled transport (skates, skateboards, push scooters and hand carts) or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eu-portal.net/material/material2.phtml?sprache=en&kt=kt11 |title=Non Motorised Transport, Teaching and Learning Material |publisher=Eu-portal.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22[/tpl] A large variety of case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate walking as a means of transportation in cities can be found at Eltis, Europe's portal for local transport.European Local Transport Information Service (ELTIS) provides case studies concerning walking as a local transport concept
The development of specific rights of way with appropriate infrastructure can promote increased participation and enjoyment of walking. Examples of types of investment include pedestrian malls, and foreshoreways such as oceanways and also riverwalks.

==In robotics==

The first successful attempts at walking robots tended to have six legs. The number of legs was reduced as microprocessor technology advanced, and there are now a number of robots that can walk on two legs.  One, for example, is ASIMO.  Although robots have taken great strides in advancement, they still don't walk nearly as well as human beings as they often need to keep their knees bent permanently in order to improve stability.
In 2009, Japanese roboticist Tomotaka Takahashi developed a robot that can jump three inches off the ground. The robot, named Ropid, is capable of getting up, walking, running, and jumping.[tpl]cite web| url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10387001-1.html|title= Ropid the robot can walk, run, and hop|publisher=CBS Interactive  |accessdate=2012-06-19[/tpl]

===Horses===

The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about [tpl]convert|4|mph|km/h[/tpl]. When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised and the other three feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being transferred from one foot to another. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 ISBN 0-87605-955-8 pp. 32â€“33
Ideally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.
The fastest "walks" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits.  If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking, but is beginning to either trot or pace.

===Elephants===

Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running.Shoshani, J.; Walter, R. C.; Abraha, M.; Berhe, S.; Tassy, P.; Sanders, W. J.; Marchant, G. H.; Libsekal, Y.; Ghirmai, T.; Zinner, D. (2006). "A proboscidean from the late Oligocene of Eritrea, a "missing link" between early Elephantiformes and Elephantimorpha, and biogeographic implications". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103 (46): 17296â€“301. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.[tpl]cite journal |author = Hutchinson, J.

===Walking fish===

Walking fish, sometimes called |ambulatory fish, is a general term that refers to fish that are able to travel over land for extended periods of time. The term may also be used for some other cases of nonstandard fish locomotion, e.g., when describing fish "walking" along the sea floor, as the handfish or frogfish.
