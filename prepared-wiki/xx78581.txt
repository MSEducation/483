[tpl]nihongo|Takachiho|高千穂町|Takachiho-chō[/tpl] is a town located in Nishiusuki District, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.

==Geography==

Takachiho is located in the northernmost part of Miyazaki Prefecture, bordering Kumamoto Prefecture on its north and northwest sides and Oita Prefecture on its north and northeast sides. The Gokase River flows from the west to the southeast part of town. The heart of the town is at its center, around the now defunct Takachiho Station and the business office of Takachiho Kotsu, the town public transportation company. Takachiho Gorge, located in the southern part of town, is fairly famous as a tourist attraction.
Takachiho is about 120 km northwest of the prefectural capital of Miyazaki and about 80 km southeast of the city of Kumamoto. Because there are no public transportation facilities, nor are there any national highways to the capital of Miyazaki, it takes about three hours to get there. And because it takes about half that time to get to the city of Kumamoto, ties between Takachiho and Kumamoto are getting deeper year by year. Ties to Kumamoto are not a recent development, as transportation facilities to the base of Mt. Aso have existed since long ago.
