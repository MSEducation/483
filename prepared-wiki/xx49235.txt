The home counties are the counties of South East England and the East of England that surround London, not including the capital city itself. No exact definition of the term exists, and the composition of the home counties is often a matter of debate.

==Origin and definition==

The first use of the term "Home Counties" cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1695. Charles Davenant, in An essay upon ways and means of supplying the war, wrote, "The Eleven Home Counties, which are thought in Land Taxes to pay more than their proportion, viz. Surry sic with Southwark, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgshire, Kent, Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, Berks, Bucks, and Oxfordshire."Quoted in Oxford English Dictionary.
The term is sometimes understood to mean those counties which, on their borders closest to London, have partly been subsumed into London. Indeed, the former county of Middlesex has been almost wholly within London, since 1965, as have parts in Hertfordshire and Surrey,Brewers Dictionary of Phrase & Fable. 16th edition. London: Cassell, 1999, p. 769. ISBN 0304350966 although the name still exists in various incarnations. The third edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (2010) defines the term as "the English counties surrounding London, into which London has extended. They comprise chiefly Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Hertfordshire.""Home Counties" in Oxford Dictionary of English, Oxford University Press, 2010. www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 4 December 2013. Parts of all of those counties are now effectively within London, though no part of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire or Sussex is. The counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Sussex are also wholly outside the M25 motorway, the route of which is often treated as an unofficial perimeter of Greater London,[tpl]citation required|date=December 2013[/tpl] and some definitions of the home counties mention that those counties are not always included amongst the home counties,The Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 180. ISBN 0192129708 or that the term has been extended to include them.Brewerâ€™s, p. 583.
Other theories sometimes mentioned for the origin of the term include the idea that the counties were where the wealthy of London had second homes, the counties that Members of Parliament returned to after the end of business, or the counties in which regular commuters into London lived.

==Character==

The home counties are often characterised as middle class, prosperous and a little boring. One 1987 reference book described their public image as being "inhabited on the whole by "nice", comfortable, and conformist middle-class people".Urdang, Laurence. (1987) Names & nicknames of places and things. London: Grafton, p. 146. ISBN 0246132469 The county of Surrey has been described as possessing quintessential home counties characteristics of "a comfortable plasticized commuterland with respectable villas and neatly mown lawns interspersed with patches of mild scenery".Urdang, 1987, p. 278. In fiction, Margot and Jerry Leadbetter of the television sitcom The Good Life, set in Surbiton, represent a typical home counties suburban couple.
The home counties as a whole are significantly more prosperous than other regions in the United Kingdom. However, the area is so large that it also includes a number of areas of deprivation.[tpl]examples|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==In official use==

Although there is no one official definition of the term, it has frequently been used in legislation and by official bodies. In the twentieth century, for instance as follows: (the table includes all the areas mentioned above, plus Dorset, Hampshire, and Middlesex):
