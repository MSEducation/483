[[Hot spring]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrothermal vents, Hot springs, Bathing

A hot spring is a spring that is produced by the emergence of geothermally heated groundwater from the Earth's crust. There are geothermal hot springs in many locations all over the crust of the earth.

==Definitions==

There is no universally accepted definition of a hot spring. For example, one can find the phrase hot spring defined as
The related term "warm spring" is defined as a spring with water temperature less than a hot spring by many sources, although Pentecost et al. (2003) suggest that the phrase "warm spring" is not useful and should be avoided. The US NOAA Geophysical Data Center defines a "warm spring" as a spring with water between [tpl]convert|20|and|50|°C|°F[/tpl].

==Sources of heat==

The water issuing from a hot spring is heated by geothermal heat, i.e., heat from the Earth's mantle. In general, the temperature of rocks within the earth increases with depth. The rate of temperature increase with depth is known as the geothermal gradient. If water percolates deeply enough into the crust, it will be heated as it comes into contact with hot rocks. The water from hot springs in non-volcanic areas is heated in this manner.
In active volcanic zones such as Yellowstone National Park, water may be heated by coming into contact with magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water to be heated enough that it boils or becomes superheated. If the water becomes so hot that it builds steam pressure and erupts in a jet above the surface of the Earth, it is called a geyser. If the water only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.
Note that hot springs in volcanic areas are often at or near the boiling point. People have been seriously burned and even killed by accidentally or intentionally entering these springs.
Warm springs are sometimes the result of hot and cold springs mixing but may also occur outside of volcanic areas, such as Warm Springs, Georgia (frequented for its therapeutic effects by paraplegic U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who built the Little White House there).

==Flow rates==

Hot springs range in flow rate from the tiniest "seeps" to veritable rivers of hot water. Sometimes there is enough pressure that the water shoots upward in a geyser, or fountain.

===High flow hot springs===

There are many claims in the literature about the flow rates of hot springs. It should be noted that there are many more very high flow non-thermal springs than geothermal springs. For example, there are 33 recognized "magnitude one springs" (having a flow in excess of 2,800 liters/second) in Florida alone. Silver Springs, Florida has a flow of more than 21,000 liters/second. Springs with high flow rates include:

==Therapeutic uses==

Because heated water can hold more dissolved solids, warm and especially hot springs also often have a very high mineral content, containing everything from simple calcium to lithium, and even radium. Because of both the folklore and the claimed medical value some of these springs have, they are often popular tourist destinations, and locations for rehabilitation clinics for those with disabilities.The web site of the Roosevelt rehabilitation clinic in Warm Springs, GeorgiaWeb site of rehabilitation clinics in Central Texas created because of a geothermal springhttp://takhinihotsprings.com/water.html Analytical results for Takhini Hot Springs geothermal water:

==Biota in hot springs==

A thermophile is an organism — a type of extremophile — that thrives at relatively high temperatures, between [tpl]convert|45|and|80|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | year=2006| author=Madigan MT, Martino JM | edition=11th |pages=136 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=0-13-196893-9[/tpl] Thermophiles are found in hot springs, as well as deep sea hydrothermal vents and decaying plant matter such as peat bogs and compost.
Some hot springs biota are infectious to humans. For example:

==Notable hot springs==

There are hot springs on all continents and in many countries around the world. Countries that are renowned for their hot springs include China, Costa Rica, Iceland, Iran, New Zealand, Peru, United States, Taiwan, and Japan, but there are hot springs in many other places as well:
