[[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]

The 1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship was played from May to September, 1982. Kerry were  looking to achieve a "Five In A Row" of All-Ireland titles for the first time in GAA history with a victory over their opponents Offaly in the final. Unlike the 1981 final encounter between the two teams, in which Kerry won by 7 points, this final was a close and exciting thriller. In the dying minutes of the game, Offaly launched one final attack on the Kerry goal. A high ball towards the box was caught by Seamus Darby, who turned and struck a shot over the goalkeeper to snatch victory for Offaly. Kerry were denied "Five In A Row" in the last play of the game in one of the most famous moments in Gaelic Football history
