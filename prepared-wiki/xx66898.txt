The Midland Metro is a light-rail/tram line in the West Midlands of England between  Birmingham and Wolverhampton via West Bromwich and Wednesbury. It is owned and promoted by Centro, and operated by West Midlands Travel Limited,[tpl]cite web |url= http://nxbus.co.uk/the-metro/about/ |title=About the Metro |publisher=National Express Group |accessdate=19 October 2010[/tpl] a subsidiary of the National Express Group (NEG), under the brand name National Express Midland Metro.
It opened in 1999, mostly using a disused railway trackbed. In Birmingham, it terminates at Snow Hill station. An extension into Birmingham city centre, was approved in 2012, and is expected to be operational by 2015. Various other extensions, including entirely new lines, have been proposed but not yet approved. These include a line from Wednesbury to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, again making use of a disused railway trackbed, on a line shared with heavy rail.

==History==

Birmingham once had an extensive tram network run by Birmingham Corporation Tramways, however, as in most British cities, the network was abandoned, with the last tram running in 1953.[tpl]cite web|title=Birmingham Corporation Transport  The Tramways 1872-1953|url=http://www.petergould.co.uk/local_transport_history/fleetlists/birmingham1.htm|publisher=petergould.co.uk|accessdate=18 March 2013[/tpl]

===1984 Proposals===

There had been proposals for a light rail or Metro system in Birmingham and the Black Country put forward as early as the 1950s and 1960s, ironically at a time when some of the region's lines and services were beginning to be cut back.[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=72[/tpl] However, serious inquiry into the possibility started in 1981 when the West Midlands County Council and the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (now known as 'Centro') formed a joint planning committee to look at light rail as a means of solving the conurbation's congestion problems. In the summer of 1984 they produced a report entitled "Rapid Transit for the West Midlands" which set out ambitious proposals for a £500 million network of ten light rail routes which would be predominantly street running, but would include some underground sections in Birmingham city centre. One of the proposed routes would have used part of the existing line as far as West Bromwich.[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=73[/tpl]
The scheme suffered from several drawbacks, one being that three of the proposed routes, from Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield, Shirley, and Dorridge would take over existing railways, and would have included the conversion into a tramway of the Cross-City Line, between Aston and Blake Street, ending direct rail services to Lichfield. The northern section of the North Warwickshire Line was also to be converted as far as Shirley station, leaving a question mark over existing train services to Stratford-upon-Avon. Tram tracks would also run alongside the existing line to Solihull and Dorridge, with local train services ended.[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=73[/tpl]
The most serious drawback however, which proved fatal to the scheme, was that the first proposed route of the network, between Five Ways and Castle Bromwich via the city centre would have involved the demolition of 238 properties. This invoked strong opposition from local residents. The scheme was spearheaded by Wednesfield Labour councillor Phil Bateman,[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=73[/tpl] but was eventually abandoned in late 1985 in the face of public opposition, and the Transport Executive was unable to find a Member of Parliament willing to sponsor an enabling Bill.[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=74[/tpl]

===1988 Proposals===

Following the abolition of the West Midlands County Council and establishment of a new Passenger Transport Authority in 1986, a new light-rail scheme under the present name "Midland Metro" was revived with a different set of lines. The first of up to 15 lines was intended be operating by the end of 1993, and a network of 200 kilometres was planned to be in use by 2000.[tpl]cite book |title=Annual Report 1988-1989 |publisher=West Midlands PTE[/tpl]
In February 1988 it was announced that the first route, Line 1 would be between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, using much of the disused trackbed of the former Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton Low Level Line, a route not included in the 1984 recommended network, partly as at that stage the section between Wednesbury and Bilston was still in use, not closing until 1992. The Wednesbury to Birmingham section had closed back in 1972, and the section between Bilston and Wolverhampton was last used in 1983.
A Bill to give Centro powers to build the line was deposited in Parliament in November 1988, and became an Act of Parliament a year later, with completion expected by the mid 1990s.[tpl]cite web |title= Midland Metro, The Metro Project |url= http://www.lrta.org/mmhist.html |accessdate=25 March 2012 |publisher=LRTA[/tpl]
A three line network was initially planned, and powers were also obtained to build two further routes. Firstly an extension of Line 1 through the city-centre to Five Ways, then a second line, Midland Metro Line 2, running to Chelmsley Wood. and then Birmingham Airport.[tpl]cite map |title= Midland Metro Line 2 map |publisher=WMPTE[/tpl] A third line, Line 3 was also proposed, running from Line 1 at Wolverhampton to Walsall, using much of the disused trackbed of the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, and then, using the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill trackbed of the South Staffordshire Line (which would close in 1993) running southwards to Dudley intersecting with Line 1 along the route. This would provide a direct link with the new Merry Hill Shopping Centre, which was built between 1984 and 1989.
Some 25 years later, Line 2 and Line 3 have not been built. In 1997 Centro accepted that they were unable to get funding for the proposed lines, and therefore adopted a strategy of expanding the system in "bite-sized chunks", with the city-centre extension of Line 1 as the first priority. The intention was that the first decade of the 21st century would see the completion of the first of these projects.[tpl]cite web|title=Midland Metro – City Centre Extension & Fleet Replacement Strategic Case, October 2009|url=http://www.centro.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=2531&sID=4972|publisher=www.centro.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2013[/tpl]
Work on the Birmingham Metro tram extension began in June 2012 (during the second decade of the 21st century), launched by transport minister Norman Baker. The dig was begun as the junction of Corporation Street and Bull Street, with work to move water pipes and power cables.

===Construction===

A contract for the construction and operation of Line 1 was awarded to the Altram consortium in August 1995, and construction began three months later.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo951120/debtext/51120-27.htm |title=House of Commons Debates (pt 27) |date= 20 November 1995 |publisher=UK Parliament[/tpl] The targeted completion date of August 1998 was missed by ten months, leading to compensation being paid by Altram.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nce.co.uk/big-bill-for-late-midland-metro/832833.article |title=Big bill for late Midland metro |date=11 March 1999 |work=New Civil Engineer |location =London[/tpl]
The estimated construction cost in 1995 was £145 million (approximately £236 million in 2012 prices).Bank of England inflation calculator Of this, loans and grants from central government accounted for £80m, the European Regional Development Fund contributed £31m, while the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority provided £17.1m and Altram contributed £11.4m.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/midland/ |title=Midland Metro Light Rail Network, United Kingdom |publisher=Railway Technology |year=2011[/tpl]

==Line One==

Line 1, the [tpl]convert|12.5|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] Birmingham to Wolverhampton route, was opened on 31 May 1999, and runs mostly along the trackbed of the former Great Western Railway line between the two cities which was closed in 1972. Of the 23 tram stops, 11 roughly or directly match former railway stations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.railaroundbirmingham.co.uk/midland_metro.php |publisher=Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands |title=Midland Metro[/tpl]
At the southern end the terminus is Birmingham Snow Hill station, which allows interchange with the National Rail network. Platform 4 was taken out of use to make space for the tram. From Snow Hill, the line runs north-west, and for the first few miles it runs alongside the Birmingham to Worcester railway line, before the two diverge. Two stations on this stretch (Jewellery Quarter and The Hawthorns) are also tram/railway interchange stations.[tpl]cite web|title=Midland Metro : Tram Stops|url=http://thetrams.co.uk/midlandmetro/stops/|publisher=thetrams.co.uk|accessdate=16 March 2013[/tpl]
At the northern end trams leave the railway trackbed at Priestfield to run along Bilston Road to St Georges terminus in Bilston Street, Wolverhampton city centre. St Georges has no direct interchange with other public transport, but the bus and railway stations can be reached on foot in a few minutes.
The original proposal was to run into the former Wolverhampton Low Level station, but this was abandoned, giving the terminus a link to the very centre of Wolverhampton.

===Service Pattern===

Mondays to Saturdays, services run at eight minute intervals during the day, and at fifteen minute intervals during the evenings and on Sundays.[tpl]cite web|title=Metro|url=http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/metro/tram.aspx|publisher=Network West Midlands|accessdate=14 November 2013[/tpl] Trams take 35 minutes to complete the route.[tpl]cite web |url= http://decisionmaking.wolverhampton.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/Binary.ashx?Document=123721 |author=West Midlands Planning And Transportation Subcommittee |title=Public Transport Update |date=31 July 2009[/tpl]

===Fares===

Cash fares are distance-related. The scale was originally intended to be broadly comparable with buses, but this proved to be unfinanceable.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2736605.stm |title=Huge losses hit Metro |work=BBC News |date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] In January 2013 the adult single fare from Birmingham to Wolverhampton was £2 by bus and £3.60 by tram, although the tram journey is much quicker even when the bus routes are congestion-free. In November 2013 Birmingham City Council indicated plans to introduce a smart-card system (similar to London's Oyster Card) to improve access, alongside a range of measures including a new Tube-style map and electric bus networks.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/regeneration/historic-plan-change-transport-birmingham-6279176 |title=Historic Plans to Change Transport in Birmingham |work=Birmingham Post |date=11 November 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]

===Usage===

Usage averages about five million passengers annually, and this number appears to have reached a plateau.

===Infrastructure===

====Track, Signalling, and Depot====

Line 1 is a 1435mm double-track tramway, apart from a short section of single track at the approach to Snow Hill. Trams are driven manually under a mix of line-of-sight and signals. Turnback crossovers along the line, including in the street section, have point indicators.
On the trackbed section Birmingham to Priestfield, signals are at the Snow Hill single line extremities, Black Lake level crossing, and Wednesbury Parkway and Metro Centre. The street section has signals at every set of traffic lights, tied into the road signals to allow tram priority.
The Metro Centre control room, stabling point and depot is near Wednesbury, Great Western Street tram stop, and occupies land once used as railway sidings.

====Power====

The line is electrified at 750 V DC using overhead lines. The system was renewed in 2010/2011, requiring short-term closures.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/07/11/midland-metro-to-shut-for-two-weeks/ |work=Express and Star |location =Wolverhampton |title=Midland Metro to shut for two weeks |date=11 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/News/Metro_upgrade.aspx |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728213822/http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/News/Metro_upgrade.aspx |archivedate=28 July 2010 |title=Metro upgrage work taking place later this year |publisher=Centro |year=2010[/tpl]

====Stops====

The tram stops are unstaffed raised platforms with two open-fronted cantilever shelters equipped with seats, a 'live' digital display of services, closed circuit television, and an intercom linked to Metro Centre.

===Extensions===

An extension of Line One into Birmingham city centre has been approved, with an extension through Wolverhampton city centre proposed.

====Phase One Expansion====

=====Line One (Birmingham City Centre) Extension=====

The fact that the existing line does not run into Birmingham city centre has been identified as one of the reasons why it has failed to attract the predicted patronage. The Birmingham City Centre Extension (BCCE) will extend Line 1 into the streets of central Birmingham. Originally it was planned to terminate the extension at Stephenson Street, adjacent to New Street railway station.[tpl]cite web|title=Birmingham City Centre Extension and Fleet Replacement|url=http://www.centro.org.uk/metro/CityCentreExtension.aspx|publisher=http://www.centro.org.uk|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] In September 2013, Centro started consultation on proposals to extend the city-centre extension from New Street station to Centenary Square. This would be another stage towards extending the line to Five Ways the original planned destination.[tpl]cite web|title=Centro unveils plans to extend the Metro to Centenary Square|url=http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/news/512501-centro-unveils-plans-to-extend-the-metro-to-centenary-square.html#|publisher=The Business Desk|accessdate=15 October 2013[/tpl] The plan was approved by Birmingham City Council in October, allowing the line to add an additional stop at Birmingham Town Hall.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/major-step-forward-midland-metro-6184070 |title= Major step forward for Midland Metro plans |author= Brown, Graeme |date=15 October 2013 |work= Birmingham Post[/tpl]
The extension will diverge from the existing line between Snow Hill and St Paul's stops. A viaduct has been constructed to carry the line into the streets.[tpl]cite  web |url= http://www.centro.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=2531&sID=4972 |title= Strategic Case |publisher=Centro[/tpl]  The existing terminus at Snow Hill will be closed, which will allow the fourth platform at Snow Hill to be reinstated for railway use.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/StrategicBusinessPlan/RoutePlans/2009/Route%2017%20-%20West%20Midlands.pdf |title=Connecting Local Communities |publisher=Network Rail |year=2009[/tpl] It will be replaced by a new stop further west near Snow Hill station's second entrance on Livery Street, which will allow continued interchange with National Rail services.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.rail.co/2011/03/31/new-rail-station-entrance-boosts-access-to-birmingham/ |title= New rail station entrance boosts access to Birmingham |last1=Samuel |first1=A. |date=31 March 2011 |work= Rail.co |accessdate=31 March 2011[/tpl]
From Snow Hill the tramway will run along Colmore Circus, Upper Bull Street, Corporation Street and Stephenson Street, with three stops. The second phase of the extension to Centenary Square will then run from Stephenson Street along Pinfold Street, turning into Victoria Square where a new stop will be located alongside the Town Hall. It will then run along Paradise Street to Paradise Circus then turn onto Broad Street, where it will continue to its terminus on Centenary Square.[tpl]cite web|title=Midland Metro, Birmingham Centenary Square Extension|url=http://www.centro.org.uk/metro/CentenaryExtension/CentenarySquareExtension-Details.aspx|publisher=Centro|accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl]
An order authorising the BCCE was made in July 2005.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20051794.htm |title=The Midland Metro (Birmingham City Centre  Extension, etc.) Order 2005 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |year=2005[/tpl] Government approval was given on 16 February 2012 for the extension, a new fleet of trams and a new depot at Wednesbury; the sanctioned sum is £128m, of which £75.4m will be provided by the Department for Transport. The first new tram is scheduled to come into service on the existing line in February 2014, while the enlarged depot will be available in August 2013. The extension as far as New Street station and the full new tram fleet are scheduled to be in service from March 2015, with the further extension to Centenary Square in operation from 2017.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2012/02/16/128m-birmingham-midland-metro-extension-from-snow-hill-station-to-new-street-station-set-to-create-1-300-jobs-gets-go-ahead-97319-30343973/  |title=£128m Birmingham Midland Metro extension from Snow Hill Station to New Street Station set to create 1,300 jobs gets go-ahead |first=Jonathan |last=Walker |work=Birmingham Mail |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=16 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=Construction of Midland Metro extension to begin  |publisher=Department for Transport |date=16 February 2012 |url= http://nds.coi.gov.uk/content/detail.aspx?NewsAreaId=2&ReleaseID=423315&SubjectId=2 |accessdate=16 February 2012 [/tpl]
On 14 June 2012 works on the extension officially began. Initial works include the relocation of underground services on Bull Street and Corporation Street.[tpl]cite news |title= Transport minister launches scheme to extend Midland Metro to Birmingham New Street |url= http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-transport-news/2012/06/14/transport-minister-launches-scheme-to-extend-the-midland-metro-to-birmingham-new-street-65233-31178982/|date=14 June 2012 |work=Birmingham Post |accessdate=14 June 2012 |first=Matt |last=Lloyd[/tpl]

The council commissioned Jacobs Engineering[tpl]cite news |url= http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/2004/11/02/company-to-study-plan-for-city-tube-50002-14825005/ |title=Company to study plan for city tube |work=Birmingham Post |date=2 November 2004[/tpl] and Deloitte to look into the feasibility of underground trams, but in June 2005 the Birmingham Post reported that tunnelling would be unaffordable and not meet government funding criteria. Mr Whitby stated that he would challenge the way the studies had been carried out, but the eventual outcome was acceptance of a street tramway. By September 2008, the council's interest had shifted from the full BCCE to a shortened version between New Street and Snow Hill stations, which do not have connecting trains.

=====Line One Wolverhampton City Centre Loop=====

An extension from the existing terminus in Wolverhampton running through Market Street and Lichfield Street and then serving Wolverhampton bus station and Wolverhampton railway station, part of the Phase Two Extensions, was made a separate project following stagnation of the project to build a line to Walsall. It was to take the form of a mainly single-track loop-and-spur extension to Line 1, with an estimated cost of £30 million.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=5711|title=Tram bid prioritises New St and Wolverhampton links |work=Transport  Briefing |date=17 March 2009[/tpl] By July 2009, the loop had gained funding preference over the Brierley Hill route, and a leaflet gave basic details of the proposal.[tpl]cite book|title=Wolverhampton Loop – Extending Metro through the City Centre|publisher=Centro[/tpl]
Centro hoped to complete the scheme by 2014,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.centro.org.uk/metro/wolvLoopSurvey.aspx |title=Wolverhamptop Loop Consultation |publisher=Centro[/tpl] but in May 2010 Wolverhampton councillor Paddy Bradley stated it was "on the back burner". Although the 2009 leaflet included a route plan and stops, Centro's spokesman Steve Swingler said "We expect to announce the preferred route later in the summer".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/05/26/30m-midland-metro-plan-put-on-hold/ |title=£30m Midland Metro plan put on hold |work=Express and Star |location =Wolverhampton |date=26 May 2010[/tpl]
The plan entailed southbound trams from Wolverhampton first going around the city centre to the railway station. In July 2010, Centro Director General Geoff Inskip hinted that the scheme would be reworked by taking it to "places people need to go, such as the University", and not taking passengers to the railway station and back "if they don't actually need to go there". The reworked scheme, costing £50 million instead of £30 million, might be routed over part of the ring road.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/07/03/midland-metro-extension-to-cost-50m/ |work=Express and Star |location =Wolverhampton |date=3 July 2010 |author= Wainwright, Daniel |title=Midland Metro extension to cost £50m[/tpl] In 2012 Centro announced that they would be pressing ahead with a cut down version of the original scheme, which they hoped would take place before 2015. The cut down version would create a branch running from the existing terminus at St. George's, connecting the bus and rail stations, with the creation of a loop through Market Street and Lichfield Street happening at a later date.[tpl]cite news |title=£30m Midland Metro extension plan revived |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/05/02/30m-midland-metro-extension-plan-revived/ |work =Express & Star |location= Wolverhampton |date= 2 May 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2013[/tpl]
In March 2014, it was announced that the Wolverhampton Extension would go ahead as part of a £2bn connectivity package. The new line would see two new stops built at Piper's Row and Wolverhampton Railway Station, which will see trams terminate alternately at the Rail station and at the existing St George's stop. The new stops will be constructed between 2015 and 2019.http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/commercial-property/mipim-2014-2bn-greater-birmingham-6803522

=====Line Two Eastside Extension=====

In November 2013, Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore announced that a task group was considering the construction of a second metro line from Birmingham City Centre, along Fazeley Street to Birmingham Airport and terminating at Coventry. Simultaneously, Centro released a proposed map of the route, taking in a loop between the interchange at the airport, Small Heath and Lea Hall.[tpl]cite news |title=Tram line could link Coventry and Birmingham |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-24899547 |work=BBC News |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013[/tpl] The line would spread the benefits of integrated transport beyond the centre of Birmingham and was part of a wider initiative to better connect both cities to the proposed High Speed 2 interchange at Curzon Street.[tpl]cite news |title= Birmingham to Coventry Metro Line Being Considered |url= http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/birmingham-coventry-metro-line-being-6287104 |work=Birmingham Post |author=Elkes, Neil |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=11 November 2013[/tpl]
In February 2014, it was announced that funding had been secured for the first phase of Midland Metro's Line Two extension to Eastside, including three new stops at either Moor Street or Albert Street, and Curzon Street, before a terminus at Adderley Street.http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/business-news/50m-invested-take-midland-metro-6750287 Centro are currently undertaking public consultation of two proposed routes, with both proposals aiming to join the existing Line One at a junction between Bull St and Corporation St.http://www.centro.org.uk/metro/other-metro-extensions/birmingham-eastside/the-details/ The main aim of the consultation is to establish whether commuters would prefer a shorter, and therefore quicker, route through to Curzon Street from New Street, or if a slightly longer route with a tram stop directly outside Moor Street would be more agreeable. If the latter option were favoured, it would mark the achievement of what has long been regarded as a major aim for the Metro, namely to connect all three (four when Curzon St opens) city-centre stations by rapid transit. Any extension would have to be completed before the projected commencement of HS2 services in 2026.

=====Present Confirmed Expansion Plans=====

The extension projects with confirmed funding will produce a network as follows:

==Rolling stock==

Metro operates 16 Ansaldobreda T69 articulated two-section trams, built in Caserta,Boynton (2001), p.80. Italy. The 38 tonne trams rest on three bogies, and have a top speed of [tpl]convert|70|km/h[/tpl]. There is a full width driver's compartment at each end. Each tram has three 1.25-metre wide entrances on each side, with twin plug doors. At 24.36 metres long, the T69s are the shortest modern tramcars in Britain. Each tram has 56 seats, with space for another 100 standing.[tpl]sfn|Boynton|2001|pp=80[/tpl]
The centre portion of the tram, 0.35 metres above track level, is wheelchair accessible: the extremities, 0.85 metres above track level, are reached by a steps. An on-board loudspeaker is used to deliver messages from the driver and Metro Centre, and a recorded announcement of every stop.
All of the trams originally had a livery of a blue body, red fronts, grey skirt and yellow doors, but several have been refurbished and repainted in Network West Midlands silver and magenta livery.[tpl]cite web|title=Midland Metro : Trams|url=http://www.thetrams.co.uk/midlandmetro/trams/|publisher=The Trams.co.uk|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
Each tram includes a dead man's handle and three braking systems. Using the hazard brake, 15 metres is required to stop from a speed of 30 kilometres per hour.[tpl]cite report |url=http://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources/070607_R182007_Swan%20Lane.pdf |title=Collision between a tram and road vehicle at New Swan Lane Level Crossing on Midland Metro |series=Rail Accident Report |author=Rail Accident Investigation Branch |month=June |year= 2007 |number=18/2007 |publisher=Department for Transport |location=Derby[/tpl] In the Rail Accident Investigation Branch report into an accident at New Swan Lane Level Crossing, it emerged that tram drivers were reluctant to use a rapid deceleration brake because of the potential for injury to passengers.

Centro announced that it was planning a £44.2-million replacement of the entire fleet.[tpl]cite web |date=October 2009 |url= http://www.centro.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=2533&sID=4972 |title=Midland Metro – City Centre Extension & Fleet Replacement: Delivery, Commercial & Financial Case |publisher=Centro |format=PDF[/tpl] In February 2012 CAF was named preferred bidder for 19 to 25 Urbos 3 trams.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/caf-named-preferred-bidder-to-supply-new-midland-metro-trams.html |title=CAF named preferred bidder to supply new Midland Metro trams | date=2 February 2012 |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London[/tpl] A £40 million order for 20 was signed, with options for five more.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/work-begins-on-pound128m-midland-metro-expansion-project.html |title=Work begins on £128m Midland Metro expansion project | date=22 March 2012 |work=Railway Gazette International |location =London[/tpl] The new rolling stock has now been delivered and is undergoing extensive testing before being introduced onto Line One early in 2014. The new fleet will provide an increased service of 10 trams per hour in each direction, with an increased capacity of 210 passengers per tram, compared with the 156 passengers on the existing T69 trams. The Urbos 3 trams are 33 metres long; 9 metres longer than the existing T69 stock, and have a maximum operating speed of 70 km/h (43 mph).[tpl]cite news |title=CAF trams for Midland Metro Expansion Project |url= http://www.therailengineer.com/2013/05/03/caf-trams-for-midland-metro-expansion-project/ |work=The Rail Engineer |location= Coalville |date= 3 May 2013 |author= Rackley, Stuart |accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]

==Extension Proposals==

===Wednesbury – Merry Hill Extension===

From Line 1 in Wednesbury, the Brierley Hill Extension (WBHE) would follow the disused South Staffordshire Line, through Tipton to the vicinity of the former Dudley Town station (which closed in 1964 and was later the site of a freightliner terminal), then on-street into Dudley town centre. It would leave Dudley alongside the Southern Bypass to access the railway corridor, leaving it at the approach to the Waterfront/Merry Hill area and Brierley Hill.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://centro.journalistpresslounge.com/centro/uploads/imagelibrary/WtoBHill%20watercolourMap.jpg |publisher=Centro|title=The Route[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Centro has stated that the WBHE would provide 10 trams per hour, alternately serving Wolverhampton and Birmingham. Journey time from Brierley Hill to West Bromwich was stated as 31 minutes.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.centro.org.uk/metro/WednesburyBrierleyHill.aspx |title=Wednesbury to Brierley Hill Extension Information |publisher=Centro |accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl]
However, these plans have been complicated by the desire of Network Rail to reopen the South Staffordshire Line for the use of freight trains, which last used the route in 1993. Various proposals have been put forward as to how trams and freight trains could coexist on the same corridor, early proposals involved trams and freight trains using different tracks. But since 2008 Centro has favoured the use of tram-trains, which can share the tracks with freight trains.[tpl]cite press release |title=Midland Metro track-share proposals gather pace |url= http://www.centro.org.uk/newsroom/PressReleases/PressRelease18096.aspx |publisher= Centro |accessdate=7 March 2013 |date=22 August 2008[/tpl]
In October 2010, the 'Black Country Joint Core Strategy'[tpl]cite web |url= http://blackcountrycorestrategy.dudley.gov.uk/ |publisher=Dudley Council|title=Black Country Joint Core Strategy[/tpl] cast doubt on implementation of the WBHE, claiming it may not be delivered by 2026.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/11/07/midland-metro-expansion-is-unrealistic/ |title=Midland Metro expansion is 'unrealistic' |work=Express and Star |location =Wolverhampton |date=7 November 2010[/tpl]
In March 2011, the business plan for the reopening of the South Staffordshire Line between Walsall and Stourbridge for the Midland Metro was submitted to Network Rail.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/03/21/tram-train-line-work-could-launch-in-2014/ |work=Express & Star |location =Wolverhampton |date=21 March 2011 |title= Tram-train line work could launch in 2014[/tpl] Trams would share the line with freight trains, and a decision from Network Rail on the scheme between Stourbridge and Walsall was due in the summer. In December 2012, Centro stated that they intended to build the line in phases to make the scheme more affordable, with the first stretch running from Wednesbury to Dudley. No time scale has been put on the latest plans.[tpl]cite news |title= Second line of Midland Metro to be built in phases |url= http://www.expressandstar.com/news/2012/12/24/second-line-of-midland-metro-to-be-built-in-phases/ |date=24 December 2012 |work= Express & Star |location= Wolverhampton |accessdate=7 March 2013[/tpl]

==Historic Planned Extensions==

In 2004, the proposed Phase Two expansion included five routes:[tpl]cite web |title= Local Transport Plan, Light Rail Strategy |url= http://www.westmidlandsltp.gov.uk/2006/appendices/chapter_30.html |publisher=Centro[/tpl]

===Birmingham City Centre to Great Barr===

A [tpl]convert|10|km|mi[/tpl], 17-stop route from the city centre through Lancaster Circus and along the A34 corridor to the Birmingham/Walsall boundary, terminating  near the M6 motorway junction 7.

===Birmingham City Centre to Quinton===

A [tpl]convert|7.5|km|mi[/tpl] route from the BCCE terminus at Five Ways along the Hagley Road to Quinton.

===Wolverhampton City Centre to Wednesfield, Willenhall, Walsall and Wednesbury===

This [tpl]convert|20.4|km|mi[/tpl] "5Ws" route would connect Wolverhampton city centre to Wednesfield, Willenhall, Walsall and Wednesbury, and provide direct access to New Cross and Manor Hospitals, partially using the trackbed of the former Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway.

===Birmingham City Centre to Birmingham Airport===

==Accidents and Service Disruptions==

There have been several instances of trams colliding with road vehicles at crossings, including one collision in February 2003 in Wolverhampton where the car driver was killed.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2740415.stm |work=BBC News |title=Man killed as car and tram collide |date=9 February 2003[/tpl] There has been at least one collision between trams, including one in December 2006 near Benson Road station, in which 16 people sustained minor injuries.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/6193803.stm |work=BBC News |title=Tram collision causes minor injuries |date=19 December 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.raib.gov.uk/latest_news/news_archive/news_archives_2007/070607_pn_benson_road.cfm |title= Report released into a tram collision at Soho Benson Road on Midland Metro |publisher=Rail Accident Investigation Branch |date=7 June 2007[/tpl]
Technical and maintenance failures, severe weather and vandalism have led to some service disruptions. In summer 2001 the Wolverhampton section was temporarily closed because of a risk of electrocution posed by drooping power cables.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1422358.stm |title=Electrocution risk closes tram line |work=BBC News |date=4 July 2001[/tpl]

==Evaluations of Success==

Since its opening in 1999, Midland Metro's existing line has not been as successful hoped, attracting far fewer passengers than initially predicted.[tpl]cite web |last=Leigh |first=Stephen |title=Midland Metro, A Personal Farewell |url= http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/midlandfarewell.html |publisher= British Trams Online |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] At the planning stage it was projected that the line would carry 14 to 20 million passengers per year, but it has actually carried around five million.
Numerous reasons have been suggested for the relative under performance of the line, including that the line has lacked visibility, being confined to Snow Hill station at the edge of Birmingham city centre, and is therefore relatively unknown. Other grounds for the line's underwhelming performance include the fact that there are quicker trains running between Birmingham and Wolverhampton and that the line does not serve New Street station, or any of Birmingham's major visitor attractions except for the Jewellery Quarter, which is already well-served by suburban trains.[tpl]cite news |title= Call for Metro to reach to city centre |url= http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/call-metro-reach-city-centre-3999570 |work=Birmingham Post |date=24 May 2005 |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] Nonetheless, overcrowding has sometimes occurred on trams at peak hours.[tpl]cite news |title= Midland Metro line from Birmingham to Wolverhampton to close at Easter for £128m revamp |url= http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/midland-metro-line-close-easter-1319298 |work=Birmingham Mail |date=14 February 2013 |author= Bentley, David |accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] It is hoped that the extension of Line One to New Street, due for completion in 2015, will greatly increase the number of passengers using the tram service to other destinations between Birmingham and Wolverhampton.

===Economics===

At Line 1's opening, it was operated by a for-profit company Altram owned by John Laing, Ansaldo, and National Express. Soon after opening it became evident to all three partners that operating revenue would not cover costs. In February 2003, The Times reported that the Metro's auditors had refused to sign off its accounts as a going concern.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/article2109542.ece |title=Auditors at Midland Metro refuse to sign off accounts |work=The Times |date=12 February 2003 |location=London |first=Mark |last=Court |accessdate=12 May 2010[/tpl] [tpl]subscription required[/tpl]
Ansaldo and Laing decided to withdraw from involvement in the Midland Metro, which they felt would not be profitable, and had ceased practical involvement as early as 2003, but their official exit took place in 2006. Day-to-day operation has since been in the hands of National Express Midland Metro, with losses largely covered by cross-subsidies from other parts of National Express's business.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/mergers_ea02/2006/westmidlands.pdf |title=Anticipated acquisition by West Midlands Travel Limited of the joint venture shares of Laing Infrastructure Holdings Limited and Ansaldo Transporti Sistema Ferroviari SpA in Altram LRT Limited |publisher=Office of Fair Trading |date=2 March 2006[/tpl]
The Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) gave an overall cost estimate for British systems of £3.79 per light-rail vehicle-kilometre in 2003–2004, compared with £0.94 per bus kilometre in 2002–2003, according to Rapid Transit Monitor 2004. CfIT estimated that the fare required for Midland Metro to break even was twice that of Manchester Metrolink, London Tramlink and the Tyne and Wear Metro.[tpl]cite web |url= http://cfit.independent.gov.uk/pubs/2005/amt/02.htm#fn |publisher=Commission for Integrated Transport |year=2005 |title=Affordable mass transit – guidance[/tpl]
