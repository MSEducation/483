==Plot==

Six years ago, Kurosaki's family was destroyed when a "shirosagi" (a "white swindler", who focus on defrauding others) swindled Kurosaki's father of their family's life savings.  As a result, his father killed Kurosaki's mother and sister before committing suicide.  Since then, Kurosaki has devoted himself to becoming a "kurosagi" ("black swindler"), who swindles other swindlers, as a means of revenge.
As a "kurosagi," Kurosaki's acts have helped innocent victims of swindling schemes get their money back.  However, he is frequently met with opposition by a stubborn grad student, who seeks to become a prosecutor.
