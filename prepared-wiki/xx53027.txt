==History==

===Early history (1923–1962)===

Originally named Chicago Air Park,[tpl]cite news | url =http://destinations.usatoday.com/chicago/transportation/| title = Chicago Transportation: Chicago Midway Airport |work=USA Today  | date = May 12, 2007 | deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Midway Airport was built on a [tpl]convert|320|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] plot in 1923 with one cinder runway mainly for airmail flights. In 1926 the city leased the airport and named it Chicago Municipal Airport on December 12, 1927.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/828.html | title = Midway Airport | publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago [/tpl] By 1928, the airport had twelve hangars and four runways, lit for night operations.
In 1931 a new passenger terminal opened at 62nd St; the following year the airport claimed to be the "World's Busiest" with over 100,846 passengers on 60,947 flights.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080414001228/http://www.flychicago.com/news/pdf/MDWVisitorsGuide2005Revised.pdf | archivedate =April 14, 2008| title = Midway Airport Visitors Guide (History Section) | publisher=FlyChicago.com | date = May 12, 2007[/tpl] (The July 1932 Official Aviation Guide shows 206 scheduled airline departures a week.)
The March 1939 OAG shows 47 weekday departures: 13 on United, 13 American, 9 TWA, 4 Northwest, and two each on Eastern, Braniff, Pennsylvania Central, and C&S.[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |year=1939 |title=Official Aviation Guide |publisher= Official Aviation Guide Company |publication-place=Chicago IL |page= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl] New York's airport (Newark, then LaGuardia by the end of 1939) was then the busiest airline airport in the United States, but Midway passed LaGuardia in 1948 and kept the title until 1960.
More construction was funded in part by $1 million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square mile in 1938–41 after a court ordered the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the northern edge of the older field.
In July 1949 the airport was renamed after the Battle of Midway. That year Midway saw 3.2 million passengers; passengers peaked at 10 million in 1959.This video of Chicago Midway Airport in 1954 shows the increase in traffic that Midway Airport experienced during the 1950s.[tpl]cite web | url =http://youtube.com/watch?v=Cm66qtg65DY| title = Chicago Midway Airport – 1954 | publisher=YouTube | date = December 2, 2007[/tpl] The diagram on the January 1951 C&GS approach chart shows four parallel pairs of runways, all 4240 ft or less except for 5730-ft runway 13R and 5230-ft runway 4R. Airport diagram for 1959
The April 1957 OAG shows 414 weekday fixed-wing departures from Midway: 83 American, 83 United, 56 TWA, 40 Capital, 35 North Central, 28 Delta, 27 Eastern, 22 Northwest, 19 Ozark, 11 Braniff, 5 Trans-Canada, and 5 Lake Central. Air France, Lufthansa, and REAL (of Brazil) had a few flights per week.[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |year=1957 |title=Official Airline Guide |publisher= American Aviation Publications |publication-place=Washington DC |page= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl] Midway was running out of room and in any case could not handle the 707 and DC-8 jets that appeared in 1959; every Chicago jet flight had to use O'Hare, which had opened to the airlines in 1955. Electras and Viscounts could have continued to fly out of Midway, but O'Hare's capacious new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until the 727 appeared in July 1964, Midway's only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966, a total of four fixed-wing arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s.

===Post-O'Hare reconstruction (1963–1993)===

By 1967 reconstruction began at the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket counters, and in 1968 the city invested $10 million in renovation funds. The funds partly supported construction of the Stevenson Expressway, and Midway saw the return of major airlines that year, with 1,663,074 passengers on jets such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 that could use Midway's runways, which the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 could not.
In 1979 Midway Airlines began operations, the first to do so after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978; it ended operations in 1991. Midway Airlines helped to revitalize the airport and lead the way for other discount carriers, who benefited from Midway's lower costs and proximity to Chicago's Loop. Southwest Airlines, which began operations at Midway in 1985, was one such beneficiary. Three years earlier in 1982, the city of Chicago purchased Midway Airport from the Chicago Board of Education for $16 million.
The Chicago Transit Authority displaced the Carlton Midway Inn to open a new CTA terminal at the airport on October 31, 1993, for the new Chicago 'L' Orange Line that connected Midway to Chicago's Loop. Midway Airport is the end of the line, which crosses the southwest part of the city before ending at the Loop. The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00 am to 1:00 am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.

===Years of ATA (1994–2008)===

In 1996, after failing to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having received harsh criticism for the idea of turning the airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced the Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the following year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thetracon.com/MidwayHistory.htm|title=Early History/Post O'hare history|publisher=The Tracon|date=April 6, 2007[/tpl] The Midway Airport parking garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas.
Continuing with the expansion project, a pedestrian bridge over Cicero Avenue was built in 2000, connecting the new terminal to the new concourses. In 2001 the new [tpl]convert|900000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] Midway Airport terminal building opened, with larger ticket counters, spacious baggage claim areas, traveler information, and a short walking distance gates. A [tpl]convert|50000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] food court opened with Chicago-style food and retail options.
In 2002 Midway welcomed the return of international service after a 40-year absence with the opening of the new Federal Inspection Service facility in Concourse A.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/midway/|title=New Midway Terminal|publisher=Airport-Technology.com|date=April 6, 2007[/tpl]
In June 2004, Mayor Daley and airline officials celebrated the completion of the Terminal Development Program. The project, designed by HNTBHNTB – Chicago Midway Airport resulted in the addition of 14 gates (from 29 to 43), with the airport now having 43 gates on 3 concourses. A new 6,300-space economy parking garage, including a new bridge and roadway for buses shuttling passengers to and from the terminal, opened in December 2005.
Simultaneous to Midway's expansion, ATA Airlines began rapid expansion at Midway in the early 2000s (decade), and was the airport's dominant carrier prior to 2004, using 14 of the 17 gates in Concourse A.[tpl]cite web | url =http://ata.com/about_ata/company_information/facts.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080328103513/http://www.ata.com/about_ata/company_information/facts.html | archivedate =March 28, 2008| title = ATA Facts| publisher=ATA Airlines | date = December 1, 2007[/tpl] However, after the airline declared bankruptcy in October 2004, scheduled service from Midway significantly decreased.
For over 16 years, Midway had been the main hub for Indianapolis-based ATA, but the airline shut down on June 7, 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?ak=40086752.blog&type=blog|title=ATA to end service to DCA, LGA|work=USA Today | first=Ben|last=Mutzabaugh[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Earlier, the airline filed for bankruptcy in April 2008; on April 3, 2008, ATA Airlines discontinued all operations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/03-06-2008/0004769303&EDATE=|title=ATA Airlines to Discontinue Scheduled Service at Chicago's Midway Airport|publisher=PR Newswire|work=ATA Airlines[/tpl]
In November 2008, Porter Airlines, which flies between Midway and Toronto, Canada, was the only international route served from Chicago–Midway after ATA Airlines, which had flights to Mexico, ceased operations in April that year. On December 13, 2010, a second carrier, Volaris, began flights between Guadalajara and Midway.

===Years after ATA (2009–)===

Starting in early 2009, a construction project added a new walkway and food court to Concourse A. The project also connected gates A4A and A4B to the main A concourse. Expansions were completed in the spring of 2010.
Today, Southwest Airlines is the largest airline serving Midway with 253 daily flights. Midway is also Southwest's largest focus city. Southwest pilots expressed concern about the control tower closure between the hours of 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. due to 2013 Federal budget sequester as it will affect red-eye flights to the west coast and diversion to other airports.Southwest Airline pilots concerned about Midway control tower closure - Chicago Business Journal.

====Privatization proposals====

Chicago has considered privatizing the airport, but the deals fell through in 2009 and 2013.

=====2009=====

On April 20, 2009, a $2.5 billion deal to privatize the airport via a 99-year lease fell through when the consortium could not put together financing. The City is to keep $125 million in the down payment. The consortium operating under the name of Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of Vancouver Airport Services, Citi Infrastructure Investors, and Boston's John Hancock Life Insurance. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49–0 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges. However, Chicago would have continued to provide fire and police services. Chicago privatized the Chicago Skyway in 2007.Midway Airport deal falls apart: Consortium can't borrow cash needed to finance deal – Chicago Tribune – April 21, 2009

=====2013=====

In September 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel terminated negotiations to privatize the airport, noting that the process was no longer competitive after one of the two finalists had backed out. The one remaining was Great Lakes Airport Alliance — a partnership of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and Ferrovial. Macquarie was one of the investors in the Chicago Skyway. The group that had backed out was a group that included the Australia-based Industry Funds Management and Manchester Airports Group. The Great Lakes proposal had been valued at $2 billion and would have involved a 40-year lease.Chicago Halts Airport Lease - WSJ.com. Online.wsj.com (2013-09-05).

Southwest, along with its subsidiary AirTran Airways, is the dominant carrier at Midway, controlling 34 of the airport's 43 gates. Currently, the airlines offer a combined 250 daily departures to 60 nonstop destinations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/press/factsheet.html#Fleet|title=Southwest's Daily Departures from MDW|publisher=Southwest Airlines[/tpl]

==Airfield==

All terminals and hangars were on the square periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.
Chicago Midway International Airport covers one square mile (640 acre, 2.59 km2) and currently has five runways:
Because Midway is surrounded by buildings and other development, the landing thresholds of the runways are displaced to provide a proper obstacle clearance. Both the FAA and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of [tpl]convert|6059|ft|m[/tpl] in the southeast direction, and [tpl]convert|5826|ft|m[/tpl] operating to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the Boeing 757. Normally, the commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R, 22L, 31C, and 13C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft. Out of the four large runways, all are used about evenly, with the exception of 13C. 13C is only used occasionally in certain weather conditions.

==Terminals, airlines and destinations==

The carrier transporting the most passengers from Chicago Midway Airport is Southwest Airlines. In 2008, a total of 17,340,497 passengers were carried through MDW, a 10.52% decrease from the previous year. Also in 2008, 253,901 aircraft passed through Midway Airport, a 16.66% decrease from 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flychicago.com/Statistics/stats/1208SUMMARY.pdf|title=Monthly Operations, Passengers, Cargo Summary By Class For December 2008|publisher=Chicago Department of Aviation|date=January 21, 2009[/tpl]

===Previous airline service===

During the 1950s, before the rise of O'Hare, Midway was the world's busiest airport and a hub of the U.S. airline system. United Airlines was headquartered at Midway and American Airlines was based at Midway until it moved its headquarters to New York City in the mid-1930s.
The terminal was extensively renovated in 1958 and again in 1967, after which several legacy carriers resumed service. (For a few months during the 1967 renovation Midway had no scheduled airline flights.) In May 1968 there were 22 scheduled departures: six United 727s to MSP, DCA and LGA, 12 Northwest 727s to MSP and CLE, one Delta DC-9 to STL and three Ozark FH227s.
The December 1970 OAG shows 86 weekday arrivals (77 jet) on 13 fixed-wing airlines from 31 airports,UA had 25 flights from DEN, DSM, MLI, LGA, OMA, PIT, and DCA; AA had 13 from DTW, EWR, ROC and STL; NW had 10 from MSP and CLE. but the August 1974 shows 14 arrivals (all jet) on four airlines, and in 1976–79 Midway had only the two or three Delta DC-9s from St Louis. Midway Airlines arrived on October 31, 1979 with DC-9 nonstops to Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland Lakefront; they expanded greatly in the 1980s. Midway was a focus city for Vanguard Airlines from 1997 to 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2775.html|title=Midway Airlines|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=April 27, 2007[/tpl]
Among the other airlines that used to frequent Midway were Access Air, Kiwi International Airlines, Northeast Airlines, US Airways, MetroJet, Ozark Air Lines (2000–2001), and Pan American Airways (1998–2004).

Big Sky Airlines started nonstop service on December 3, 2006, between Springfield, Illinois, and Midway and added daily nonstop flights to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, beginning on March 17. However, citing poor demand, both the Springfield and Eau Claire flights were discontinued on June 9, 2007.[tpl]cite web |title=Big Sky Airlines Service|url=http://www.bigskyair.com/|publisher=Big Sky Airlines|accessdate=April 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070406181021/http://www.bigskyair.com/|archivedate=April 6, 2007[/tpl]

Chicago Midway International Airport was once the largest hub of ATA Airlines and its wholly owned regional airline partner Chicago Express Airlines, which operated as ATA Connection . ATA had operated a hub at Midway since 1992. As recently as 2004, ATA operated over 100 daily flights to over 30 destinations. The airline cut back service from Chicago after declaring bankruptcy in late 2004. On April 3, 2008, the airline again declared bankruptcy and ended all scheduled operations, including service to the four cities it still served at Chicago–Midway.
Continental Airlines provided daily service from Chicago–Midway to Cleveland and Newark until May 2008. The airline discontinued Chicago–Midway service on May 31, 2008, citing high fuel prices.
VivaAerobus served Chicago–Midway to Monterrey, Mexico until April 14, 2012.
Pet Airways served Chicago-Midway with seasonal flights to Denver-Rocky Mountain before ceasing all flights in early 2013.

==Controversies==

===Significant incidents===

On June 30, 1956, United Airlines Flight 718, a Douglas DC-7, was headed for Midway Airport. Over the Grand Canyon it collided with a TWA Super Constellation, killing all 128 people on both planes. This became the impetus for the modern air traffic control system.

===December 8 incidents===

On December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, crashed into a residential area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground.
Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, slid off the runway while attempting to land at the airport in a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4512360.stm|title=Boy dies as jet skids off runway|date=December 9, 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=February 17, 2010[/tpl]

Note: The runway now designated 13C/31C was designated 13R/31L until 1989, when a new Runway 13R/31L was built. Runways 27L and 36L have been closed since the 1970s.

==Transit==

Midway Airport is served by the Chicago Transit Authority's "L" trains. Passengers can board Orange Line trains at a station in the airport terminal, which runs to downtown Chicago and the Loop (transit time about 25 minutes). This same station doubles as a stop for many CTA-run buses that serve the surrounding areas. Midway is one of the few[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] airports in the United States that has rapid transit train to terminal service.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/maps/ctatrainmap.png| title = Map of "L" Train | publisher=Chicago Transit Authority | date = August 2007[/tpl]
