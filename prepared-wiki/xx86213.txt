==Daytime television credits== 
Wyndham first made a name for herself when she played Charlotte Waring Fletcher Bauer (Tracy Delmar) on the soap opera Guiding Light from 1967 to 1970. When she left The Guiding Light, she became a hot commodity in casting circles, with many soaps offering contracts to her. She admitted in a TIME magazine interview that she almost did not follow through with a career in soap operas. Wyndham said, "When I first went into soaps, I didn't tell my serious acting friends. I thought they'd laugh. But now I'm proud of my work; some of the best acting, best moments are in this medium." http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913850-7,00.html
She was subsequently cast on the soap opera Another World in the role for which she is best known, the character of Rachel Cory. Wyndham succeeded actress Robin Strasser in the role, and portrayed Rachel from 1972 to 1999.
When Wyndham took over the role from Strasser, the character was a bad girl. The head writer at the time, Harding Lemay, was impressed by Wyndham's range and decided to take the character in different directions. Wyndham's character was reformed after being paired with a much-older book publisher, Mackenzie Cory (Douglass Watson). 
It made Wyndham very popular with fans, and proved to be very lucrative as well. Although highly regarded, Wyndham did have one peculiar run-in with a fan: author Annie Gilbert, in the book All My Afternoons, noted that Wyndham was mildly assaulted when an enraged fan, fed up with Rachel's scheming ways and thinking Wyndham was her character, attempted to punch her at a Lord & Taylor store in New York City, all the while screaming "I hate you! I hate you!"
In the later years of the program, Wyndham took on the double role of Justine Duvalier, Rachel's new husband Carl's ex-lover. She played the dual role for two years (1995 and 1996) before Justine was killed off. Wyndham was honored with a special episode showcasing her noteworthy performances on Another World in July 1997, and stayed with the show until it was canceled in June 1999.  At the time of the show's cancellation, Wyndham was the longest-running performer on the series.

==Current work==

Wyndham appeared in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit on January 2, 2007, as "Rita Colino," a former wife of the dead partner of Brian Dennehy's character.
