Clayton"2012’s worst candidate? With Mark Clayton, Tennessee Democrats hit bottom." by David A. Fahrenthold, Washington Post, October 22, 2012, Retrieved 2012-10-23, "“If there are people who don’t believe that there’s a campaign here, then guess what? They can come to Tennessee, if they’re a voter, and they can see Mark E. Clayton, and next to Mark E. Clayton there’s going to be a ‘D,’ ” he said on the phone. “Like it or not, Mark Clayton is the Democratic nominee in Tennessee.”" as well as several third-party candidates and several independents.
Clayton won the Democratic nomination with 30% of the vote, despite raising no money and having a website that was four years out of date.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/mark-clayton-tennessee-democrats-senate|title=Dems Nominate Anti-Gay Conspiracy Theorist for Senate|last=Murphy|first=Tim|date=August 3, 2012|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] The next day Tennessee's Democratic Party disavowed the candidate over his active role in the Public Advocate of the United States, which they described as a "known hate group". They blamed his victory among a slate of little-known candidates on the fact that his name appeared first on the ballot, and said they would do nothing to help his campaign, urging Democrats to vote for "the write-in candidate of their choice" in November.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.tennessean.com/article/20120803/NEWS02/308030124/Senate-nominee-M?nclick_check=1|title=Tennessee Democratic Party disavows Senate nominee|date=August 3, 2012|accessdate=August 4, 2012|work=The Tennessean|first=Michael|last=Cass[/tpl] One of the losing Democratic candidates, Larry Crim, filed suit to have the primary result overturned, but a judge rejected his challenge.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20120817/NEWS02/308170061/Mark-Clayton-victory-Democratic-primary-upheld-by-Nashville-judge|title=Mark Clayton victory in Democratic primary upheld by Nashville judge|last=Sisk|first=Chas|date=August 17, 2012|work=The Tennessean|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl]
