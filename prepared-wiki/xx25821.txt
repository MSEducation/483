[[Angular acceleration]]

CATEGORIES: Physical quantities, Acceleration

Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s[tpl]sup|2[/tpl]), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (Î±). http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/circ/node3.html 

==Mathematical definition==

The angular acceleration can be defined as either:

==Equations of motion==

===Constant acceleration===

===Non-constant acceleration===

For any non-constant torque, the angular acceleration of an object will change with time. The equation becomes a differential equation instead of a constant value. This differential equation is known as the equation of motion of the system and can completely describe the motion of the object. It is also the best way to calculate the angular velocity.
