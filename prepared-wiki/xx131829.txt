Built in 1958 the stadium seats around 12,127 on wood-backed bleacher seats. It was home to the North American Soccer League's Los Angeles Aztecs for two years (1975–1976) as well as several United States men's national soccer team FIFA World Cup qualification matches.  Today, it hosts El Camino College's American football team.  The stadium was originally named after the founding president of the college, Forrest G. Murdock.
The stadium was also used as the main stadium in the 2005 remake of the 1974 film, The Longest Yard.  The 2005 film starred Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, James Cromwell and Burt Reynolds, who actually played the lead role in the original film.
