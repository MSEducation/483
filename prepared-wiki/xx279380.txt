Blackburner is a Los Angeles based electronic music group. It consists of Skyla Talon. Founded in 2011.  Influenced by the Skyla's background as a metal guitarist and vocalist, Blackburner combines the aggressive bass beats of the Dubstep and Glitch arena with the melodic hooks, and Electronica to create its own hybrid sound. Blackburner made its name by remixing tracks and releasing original compositions through Cleopatra Records, pitting Blackburner alongside Dubstep artists such as Rusko (musician), Nero (band), and Dubba Jonny.http://www.metroseeker.com/los-angeles/creatives/blackburner
