Corio was first incorporated as a road district on 3 April 1861, and became a shire on 21 June 1864. Part of the Lara Riding was lost to the Shire of Bacchus Marsh on 15 March 1911, but the same riding gained part of the Shire of Bannockburn on 31 May 1916. The Moorpanyal Riding was transferred to the City of Geelong West on 9 December 1926, becoming its West Ward.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=636â€“637[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
