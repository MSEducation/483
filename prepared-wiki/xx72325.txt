The Alliance for Audited Media (AAM) is a non-profit organization located in Arlington Heights, Illinois, that connects North American media companies, advertisers and ad agencies. Founded in 1914 as the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), the AAM is a leading source of cross-media verification and information services, providing standards, audit services and data for the advertising and publishing industries. It is one of more than three dozen such organizations operating worldwide, affiliated with the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations (IFABC).
AAM independently verifies print and digital circulation, mobile apps, website analytics, social media, technology platforms and audience information for newspapers, magazines and digital media companies in the U.S. and Canada.

==History==

At the turn of the 20th century, the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) observed a market need for verifiable, authenticated circulation figures from print publishers. As a result, in 1914, advertisers, ad agencies and publishers in the U.S. and Canada united to form the first Audit Bureau of Circulations to bring trust and accountability to the print media market.
Nearly a century later, the need for trust and accountability remains unchanged, although the format in which media is delivered has evolved significantly. With the expansion of digital media platforms, media buyers seek a solution to a chaotic marketplace and increasingly desire credible cross-channel metrics. On November 15, 2012, ABC in North America rebranded its organization as the Alliance for Audited Media to reflect the new media environment and its members' evolving business models.[tpl]cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.auditedmedia.com/about.aspx|publisher=Alliance for Audited Media|accessdate=20 January 2014[/tpl]
At about the same time, AAM joined forces with the Certified Audit of Circulations, a nonprofit newspaper auditor based in Wayne, New Jersey.[tpl]cite web|title=Audit Bureau of Circulations, Certified Audit of Circulations Agree to New Relationship|url=http://auditedmedia.com/news/news-releases/2012/abc,-cac-agree-to-new-relationship.aspx|publisher=Alliance for Audited Media|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=5 September 2012[/tpl]

==Governance==

AAM is governed by a tripartite board of directors composed of leaders in publishing and advertising - 18 publishers and 20 advertisers and advertising agencies from the U.S. and Canada. The board meets three times per year (March, July and November) to review and amend rules, consider member requests and oversee operations of the organization. Together with an extensive network of committees, the AAM board sets the standards by which print and digital media are measured and reported. The AAM's staff upholds the standards of the board by conducting rigorous audits of publishers and impartially delivering the results of those audits to advertisers and advertising agencies through AAM's online database.
The organization is headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, with additional offices in New York City and Toronto.

==Membership==

Membership is open to all publishers, digital media companies, advertisers and advertising agencies. Additionally, any individual, firm or corporation that requires access to media data may apply for an associate membership. AAM serves as an industry forum, connecting advertisers, ad agencies and publishers to discuss issues and trends and set standards.
