[[Tonic water]]

CATEGORIES: Carbonated water, Drink mixers, Quinine, Soft drinks

Tonic water (or Indian tonic water) is a carbonated soft drink, in which quinine is dissolved. Originally used as a prophylactic against malaria, tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content and is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavour. It is often used in mixed drinks, particularly in gin and tonic.

==History==

The drink gained its name from the medicinal effects of its bitter flavoring. The quinine was added to the drink as a prophylactic against malaria, since it was originally intended for consumption in tropical areas of South Asia and Africa, where the disease is endemic. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858.[tpl]cite web|last=Raustiala|first=Kal|title=The Imperial Cocktail|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/foreigners/2013/08/gin_and_tonic_kept_the_british_empire_healthy_the_drink_s_quinine_powder.single.html|work=Slate (magazine)|publisher=The Slate Group|accessdate=30 August 2013[/tpl]   The mixed drink gin and tonic originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin to improve its bitter flavour.
More recently, premium tonic water brands such as Fever Tree and Q Tonic have entered the US marketplace. These brands place emphasis on using real quinine and natural sweeteners, as opposed to quinine flavouring and high-fructose corn syrup.Premium cocktail mixers stirring interest.

Since 2010, at least four tonic syrups have been released in the US. Consumers add carbonated water to the syrup to make tonic water; this allows drinkers to vary the intensity of the flavour.Building a Better G&T "WSJ Online" 15 August 2012 retrieved from:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904007304576498850877686860.html

==Quinine content==

Medicinal tonic water originally contained only carbonated water and a large amount of quinine. However, most tonic water today contains a less significant amount of quinine, and is thus used mostly for its flavour. As a consequence, it is less bitter, and is also usually sweetened, often with high fructose corn syrup or sugar. Some manufacturers also produce diet (or slimline) tonic water, which may contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. Traditional-style tonic water with little more than quinine and carbonated water is less common, but may be preferred by those who desire the bitter flavour.
In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limits the quinine content in tonic water to 83 ppm[tpl]cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/21cfr172.575.pdf |title=21 CFR §172.575 Quinine. |accessdate=15 December 2008[/tpl] (83 mg per liter if calculated by mass), while the daily therapeutic dose of quinine is in the range of 500–1000 mg,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rain-tree.com/quinine.htm|title=Quinine|work=Tropical Plat Database|publisher=Raintree Nutrition|accessdate=10 July 2011|location=Section "Current practical uses"[/tpl] and 10 mg/kg every eight hours for effective malaria prevention (2100 mg daily for a 70 kg adult).[tpl]cite journal | journal=Malaria Journal | volume=10 | pages=1–12 | year=2011 | issue=144 | title=Quinine, an old anti-malarial drug in a modern world: role in the treatment of malaria  | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-10-144 | last1=Achan | first1=J | pmid=21609473 | pmc=3121651[/tpl] Still, it is often recommended as a relief for leg cramps, but medical research suggests some care is needed in monitoring doses.Should people with nocturnal leg cramps drink tonic water and bitter lemon?

==Uses==

Tonic water is often used as a drink mixer for cocktails, especially those made with gin or vodka (for example, a gin and tonic). Tonic water with lemon or lime flavour added is known as bitter lemon or bitter lime, respectively. Such soft drinks are more popular in Europe than in the United States.

==Fluorescence==

Tonic water will fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light, owing to the presence of quinine. In fact, the sensitivity of quinine to UV is such that it will appear visibly fluorescent in direct sunlight.
