Tuck Everlasting is a 1981 American film based on Natalie Babbitt's 1975 children's book of the same title.

==Plot==

The story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters' little forest and became immortal (hence the name "Tuck Everlasting").
In the novel, set in the late 19th century, the protagonist is ten-year-old Winifred Foster. She comes from a well-bred, strait-laced family and becomes lost in the woods one day during an attempt to escape her smothered lifestyle. In the woods, she encounters Jesse Tuck, a boy who is immortal due to a spring from which he and his family drank water years ago.
