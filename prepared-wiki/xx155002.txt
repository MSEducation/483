Bay City Radio was a radio station in Hawke's Bay New Zealand. Bay City Radio commenced broadcasting on 1 October 1957 using the call-sign 2ZC and broadcasting on 1280Â kHz AM, with the slogan Twin-City Radio, serving both Napier and Hastings. When Apple Radio commenced as a stand-alone station from the previously shared Hastings studio, the station was re-branded as Bay City Radio 2ZC. These stations were operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation which later became known as Radio New Zealand in 1975. In December 1981 a fire
started in one of the studios causing considerable damage. The whole top floor of the Dalgety building (Broadcasting House) was then completely refurbished and modernized with state-of-the-art equipment.  
In 1993 Bay City Radio joined the Classic Hits network and became known as Classic Hits Bay City Radio. In 1994, the station moved to 89.5FM and became Classic Hits 89FM Bay City Radio. Later the AM frequency would be used to broadcast Newstalk ZB into the Hawke's Bay region. Out of the times of 6-10am Monday to Saturday, the station is networked from Auckland.
The station is now on air as Classic Hits 89-5 and is still the most listened to local radio station. Local breakfast Monday to Friday is hosted by Martin Good and Sarah Van Der Kley. Annette Lunn reads local news. Neil Dunn hosts the Saturday breakfast show.
