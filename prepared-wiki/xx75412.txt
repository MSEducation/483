Bassam Tibi ([tpl]lang-ar|بسام طيبي[/tpl]), born 1944 in Damascus, lives in Germany since 1962 and, since 1976, he is a German citizen. He is a political scientist and Professor of International Relations. In academia, he is known for his analysis of international relations and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization. Tibi is perhaps best known for introducing the controversial concept of European Leitkultur as well as the concept of Euroislam for the integration of Muslim immigrants in Europe.As Paul Berman in his book "The Flight of the Intellectuals" (Melville House 2010, p. 150) notes, "Bassam Tibi, the liberal, means by Euro-Islam a Westernized Islam. In contrast, Tariq Ramadan means a Salafi reformism, and not a Westernized Islam".  He is also the founder of Islamology as a social-scientific study of Islam and conflict in post-bipolar politics. Tibi has done research in Asian and African countries. He publishes in English, German and Arabic.

He studied in Frankfurt am Main under Max Horkheimer, obtained his Ph.D. there in 1971 and habilitated in Hamburg, Germany.

White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. Tibi had eighteen visiting professorships in all continents including fellowships in Princeton University, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and most recently (2010) at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, Washington D.C.

===On Europe===

Tibi argues that racism is a European invention, and that Europeans must overcome what he calls "Euro-arrogance" and xenophobia to integrate immigrants.
He criticizes European imperialism, arguing that it disrupted and deformed other cultures. Acknowledging that Muslim conquerors also did some wrong, Tibi argues that at least Muslim conquests were not driven by any kind of racism, unlike the European conquests.[tpl]cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Islam between culture and politics|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =2001|page=92[/tpl]

===On Israel===

Bassam Tibi has criticized the Likud party of Israel as blocking the peace process. He states that in the 1990s, the Likud adopted the "Three Nos" policy:
 "No to the Palestinian State, no to dividing Jerusalem, no to returning Golan Heights to Syria. 
According to Tibi, the Likud government of 1996 engaged in provoking Arabs by constructing Har Homa in Arab Jerusalem, and digging a tunnel under the Temple Mount, and thereby exposing Israel to terrorism.[tpl]cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Conflict and war in the Middle East: from interstate war to new security|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =1998|page=195[/tpl]
