Street fighting is hand-to-hand combat in public places, between individuals or groups of people.[tpl]cite news|title= Reality Fighting, Street Fighting & Self Defense|work= Kung Fu Magazine |date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=552|accessdate=2010-02-07[/tpl] 
Unlike sport fighting, a street fight might involve weapons, multiple opponents or revenge and has no rules. The venue is usually a public place (e.g. a street) and the fight often results in a serious injury or even death.
The main difference between street fighting and a self-defense situation is that a street fight is avoidable, whereas a self-defense situation is not. The other characteristic being that the fight is consensual between both parties. A typical situation might involve two men arguing in a bar, then one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. Thus, it is often possible to avoid the fight by backing off, while in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the situation, using force if necessary to assure his or her own safety.
In some martial arts communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.[tpl]cite webpage|title=Street fight â€“ practical self-defence (czech language)|url=http://skbu.cz/co-umime/street-fight/|accessdate=2010-09-15[/tpl]
