Acetonitrile is the chemical compound with the formula [tpl]chem|CH|3|CN[/tpl]. This colourless liquid is the simplest organic nitrile (hydrogen cyanide is a simpler nitrile, but the cyanide anion is not classed as organic). It is produced mainly as a byproduct of acrylonitrile manufacture. It is used as a polar aprotic solvent in organic synthesis and in the purification of butadiene.http://www.industrialchemistry.info/100pagesAddict3.pdf, Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, page 76.
In the laboratory, it is used as a medium-polarity solvent that is miscible with water and range of organic solvents, but not saturated hydrocarbons.  It has a convenient liquid range and a high dielectric constant of 38.8. With a dipole moment of 3.92 D,Steiner, P. A., and Gordy, W., 1966, J. molec. Spectrosc., 21, 291. acetonitrile dissolves a wide range of ionic and nonpolar compounds and is useful as a mobile phase in HPLC and LC-MS.  The N-C-C skeleton is linear with a short C-N distance of 1.16 Å.Karakida, Ken-ichi, Tsutomu Fukuyama, and Kozo Kuchitsu.

Acetonitrile was first prepared in 1847 by the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas.Dumas (1847) "Action de l'acide phosphorique anhydre sur les sels ammoniacaux" (Action of anhydrous phosphoric acid on ammonium salts), Comptes rendus, 25:  383-384.

==Applications==

Acetonitrile is used mainly as a solvent in the purification of butadiene in refineries.
It is widely used in battery applications because of its relatively high dielectric constant and ability to dissolve electrolytes.  For similar reasons it is a popular solvent in cyclic voltammetry.
Its low viscosity and low chemical reactivity make it a popular choice for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Acetonitrile plays a significant role as the dominant solvent used in the manufacture of DNA oligonucleotides from monomers.
Industrially, it is used as a solvent for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and photographic film.

===Organic synthesis===

Acetonitrile is a common two-carbon building block in organic synthesis[tpl]OrgSynth | author = DiBiase, S. A.; Beadle, J. R.; Gokel, G. W. | title = Synthesis of α,β-Unsaturated Nitriles from Acetonitrile: Cyclohexylideneacetonitrile and Cinnamonitrile | collvol = 7 | collvolpages = 108 | prep = cv7p0108[/tpl] of many useful chemicals, including acetamidine hydrochloride, thiamine, and α-napthaleneacetic acid.[tpl]Citation|title=Encyclopedia of Toxicology|editor=Philip Wexler|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|edition=2nd|volume=Vol. 1|isbn=0-12-745354-7|pages=28–30[/tpl] Its reaction with cyanogen chloride affords malononitrile.

===Ligand in coordination chemistry===

In inorganic chemistry, acetonitrile is employed as a solvent and often an easily displaceable ligand. For example, [tpl]chem|PdCl|2|(CH|3|CN)|2[/tpl] is prepared by heating a suspension of (polymeric) palladium chloride in acetonitrile:[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
A related complex is Cu(MeCN)4+.  The [tpl]chem|CH|3|CN[/tpl] groups in these complexes are rapidly displaced by many other ligands.

==Production==

Acetonitrile is a by-product from the manufacture of acrylonitrile.  Most is combusted to support the intended process but an estimated several thousand tons are retained for the above mentioned applications.[tpl]Citation | last1 = Pollak | first1 = Peter | last2 = Romeder | first2 = Gérard | last3 = Hagedorn | first3 = Ferdinand | last4 = Gelbke | first4 = Heinz-Peter | title = Nitriles | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a17_363 | postscript = . [/tpl] Production trends for acetonitrile thus generally follow those of acrylonitrile. Acetonitrile can also be produced by many other methods, but these are of no commercial importance as of 2002. Illustrative routes are by dehydration of acetamide or by hydrogenation of mixtures of carbon monoxide and ammonia. The main distributors of acetonitrile in the world are: INEOS, Purification Technologies Inc, BioSolve BV, Carlo Erba Reagents, Panreac, J.T. Baker Chemical, VWR, Sigma Aldrich, and Petrolchem Trading Ltd. In [tpl]as of|1992|alt=1992[/tpl], 32.3 million pounds (14,700 t) of acetonitrile were produced in the US.

===Acetonitrile shortage in 2008–2009===

Starting in October 2008, the worldwide supply of acetonitrile was low because Chinese production was shut down for the Olympics.  Furthermore, a U.S. factory was damaged in Texas during Hurricane Ike.[tpl]Citation | first = Derek | last = Lowe | title = The Great Acetonitrile Shortage | year = 2009 | publisher = Corante | url = http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/01/22/the_great_acetonitrile_shortage.php[/tpl]  Owing to the  global economic slowdown, the production of acrylonitrile that is used in acrylic fibers and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resins decreased.  Because acetonitrile is a byproduct in the production of acrylonitrile, its production has also decreased.[tpl]cite journal | author = A. Tullo | title = A Solvent Dries Up | journal = Chemical & Engineering News | volume = 86 | pages = 27 | doi = 10.1021/cen-v086n047.p027[/tpl] The global shortage of acetonitrile continued through early 2009.

===Toxicity===

Acetonitrile has only a modest toxicity in small doses.[tpl]Citation | last = Institut national de recherche et de sécurité (INRS) | author-link = Institut national de recherche et de sécurité | title = Fiche toxicologique nº 104 : Acétonitrile | year = 2004 | place = Paris | publisher = INRS | url = http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/IntranetObject-accesParReference/FT%20104/$File/ft104.pdf | isbn = 2-7389-1278-8[/tpl] It can be metabolised to produce hydrogen cyanide, which is the source of the observed toxic effects.[tpl]Citation | last = Spanish Ministry of Health | author-link = Ministry of Health (Spain) | title = Acetonitrile. Summary Risk Assessment Report  | year = 2002 | place = Ispra (VA), Italy | publisher = European Chemicals Bureau | url = http://ecb.jrc.it/DOCUMENTS/Existing-Chemicals/RISK_ASSESSMENT/SUMMARY/acetonitrilesum006.pdf | id = Special Publication I.01.65[/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = International Programme on Chemical Safety | author-link = International Programme on Chemical Safety | title = Environmental Health Criteria 154. Acetonitrile | year = 1993 | place = Geneva | publisher = World Health Organization | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc154.htm[/tpl][tpl]Citation | first = Mark | last = Greenberg | title = Toxicological Review of Acetonitrile | year = 1999 | place = Washington, D.C. | publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url = http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0205tr.pdf | format = [/tpl] Generally the onset of toxic effects is delayed, due to the time required for the body to metabolize acetonitrile to cyanide (generally about 2–12 hours).
Cases of acetonitrile poisoning in humans (or, to be more specific, of cyanide poisoning after exposure to acetonitrile) are rare but not unknown, by inhalation, ingestion and (possibly) by skin absorption. The symptoms, which do not usually appear for several hours after the exposure, include breathing difficulties, slow pulse rate, nausea, and vomiting: Convulsions and coma can occur in serious cases, followed by death from respiratory failure. The treatment is as for cyanide poisoning, with oxygen, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate among the most commonly used remedies.
It has been used in formulations for nail polish remover, despite its low but significant toxicity.At least two cases have been reported of accidental poisoning of young children by acetonitrile-based nail polish remover, one of which was fatal: [tpl]Citation | last = Caravati | first = EM |author2= Litovitz, T | title = Pediatric cyanide intoxication and death from an acetonitrile-containing cosmetic | year = 1988 | journal = J.

====Metabolism and excretion====

In common with other nitriles, acetonitrile can be metabolised in microsomes, especially in the liver, to produce hydrogen cyanide, as was first shown by Pozzani et al. in 1959.[tpl]Citation | last = Pozzani | first = UC |author2= Carpenter, CP|author3= Palm, PE|author4= Weil, CS|author5= Nair, JH | title = An investigation of the mammalian toxicity of acetonitrile | journal = J. Occup. Med. | year = 1959 | volume = 1 | pages = 634–642 | doi = 10.1097/00043764-195912000-00003 | pmid = 14434606 | issue = 12[/tpl] The first step in this pathway is the oxidation of acetonitrile to glycolonitrile by an NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The glycolonitrile then undergoes a spontaneous decomposition to give hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde, a toxin and a carcinogen on its own, is further oxidized to formic acid, which is another source of toxicity.
The metabolism of acetonitrile is much slower than that of other nitriles, which accounts for its relatively low toxicity. Hence, one hour after administration of a potentially lethal dose, the concentration of cyanide in the rat brain was one-twentieth that for a propionitrile dose 60 times lower (see table).
The relatively slow metabolism of acetonitrile to hydrogen cyanide allows more of the cyanide produced to be detoxified within the body to thiocyanate (the rhodanese pathway). It also allows more of the acetonitrile to be excreted unchanged before it is metabolised. The main pathways of excretion are by exhalation and in the urine.
