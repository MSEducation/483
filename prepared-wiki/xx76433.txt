Eponymous constants (and other eponyms) and their influence on scientific citations have been discussed in the literature."Non-indexed eponymal citedness (NIEC): first fact-finding examination of a phenomenon of scientific literature." Endre Száva-Kováts. Journal of Information Science, 1994 20:55 [tpl]doi|10.1177/016555159402000107[/tpl][tpl]efn|The article addresses the major premise in the argument against the Ortega hypothesis: that citation counts fairly reflect the importance of scientific contributions. It presents the results of a study of eponyms in scientific literature. The result is that usually when a journal paper refers to a unit, constant, technique, device, etc. that is named after a scientist (an "eponym"), that paper will not cite the person who is the namesake of the unit, constant, technique, etc. Early papers cite it more; later papers cite it less.[/tpl]
