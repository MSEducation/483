Cameron Park is a historic neighborhood just west of downtown Raleigh, NC. It is one of three suburbs platted in the early 20th century. Development began along Hillsborough Street and moved north; a streetcar line along Hillsborough made the location especially appealing and convenient. Cameron Park's developers used restrictive deed covenants that set minimum house prices, created setbacks from the street, and excluded African Americans from living in the neighborhood (except as live-in domestic employees). Advertisements for Cameron Park openly recruited socially ambitious upper-middle class residents to the neighborhood, and land and house values were significantly higher than those of other early suburbs. 
The neighborhood is architecturally varied, featuring Queen Anne and Colonial Revivals, large bungalows, and more eclectic styles like Georgian Revival, Tudor Revival, and Mission Revival. Despite the stylistic variety, houses were uniformly large and upscale for the era. Cameron Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
