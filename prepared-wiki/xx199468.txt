The Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano by György Ligeti was completed in 1982. It is marked as an Homage to Johannes Brahms who wrote one of the few other examples of this genre.

==History==

The Trio was a turning point in Ligeti’s career. It is considered to be the watershed moment that opened up his "third way," a style that Ligeti claimed to be neither modern nor postmodern.Mike Searby, "Ligeti's 'Third Way': Non-Atonal Elements in the Horn Trio", Tempo new series, no. 216 (2001): 17-22. Though the piece is marked as an homage to Brahms, Ligeti said, “the only thing reminiscent of Brahms is perhaps a certain smilingly conservative comportment – with a distinctly ironic distance.”[tpl]cite this quote|date=September 2011[/tpl]

==Analysis==

The Trio is in four movements:
A performance of the piece lasts about 21 minutes.
The composition explores the use of major and minor harmonies without the syntax of common practice tonality. In addition, it explores the out of tune upper partials available on the horn, asymmetric Bulgarian rhythms in the second movement,Stephen Satory, "Colloquy: An Interview with György Ligeti in Hamburg", Canadian University Music Review//Revue de Musique des Universités Canadiennes 10 (1990): 101–17. Citation on 109. and the Ligeti lamento motif in the fourth movement.Stephen Andrew Taylor, “The Lamento Motif: Metamorphosis in Ligeti’s Late Style”, D.M.A. diss., Part Two (Ithaca: Cornell University, 1994): 22–49. The first three movements are each in a ternary form – a notable look back towards traditional forms. The final movement is an example of a passacaglia using as its ground bass a similar theme as that of the opening movement. It has been pointed out that the opening theme of the first movement is reminiscent of the opening theme of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 26, "Les Adieux".Richard Steinitz, György Ligeti: Music of the Imagination (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2003): 255–56.
