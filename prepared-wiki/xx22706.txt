===Ratifications 1972-1977===

The initial pace of state legislative ratifications was rapid, 30 states had done so by the end of 1973. The rate of ratification then slowed considerably. Only 5 more states ratified the ERA over the course of the ensuing 4 years, with none coming after 1977. There were no ratifications after 1977, which left the amendment 3 states shy of the number needed in order for it to be certified as an operative part of the Constitution as the March 22, 1979 ratification deadline approached. As of that original deadline the ERA had been ratified by the following states:Leslie W. Gladstone, CRS Report 85-154 GOV, The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment, p.33.

===Ratifications rescinded 1973-1979===

Legislators in the following states voted to rescind their earlier ratification of the ERA:Information derived from "The Equal Rights Amendment: myths and realities" authored by Orrin G. Hatch, published 1983.
The Constitution is silent on the subject of whether or not the governor of a state has any authority regarding whether that state ratifies an amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution is also silent on the subject of whether or not a state's action to rescind its ratification of a constitutional amendment under consideration by the states is a valid one impacting that amendment's progress toward obtaining the requisite number of ratifications for it to be enacted and included in the Constitution.

===Incomplete ratifications===

At various times, in 9 of the 15 non-ratifying states, at least 1 chamber of the legislature approved the ERA, those 9 states being:
Over the past twenty years, ratification resolutions have also been introduced, but failed to win full approval in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, and Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web|author=Will, George F.|url=http://www.nrlc.org/archive/Federal/ERA/GeorgeWillERALivingDead.pdf|format=PDF|title=Night of the Living Dead Amendment|publisher=Washington Post via National Right to Life Committee|date=February 13, 1994|accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Francis, Roberta W.|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl]

==Congressional extension of ratification deadline==

In 1978—as the 1979 deadline approached—the 95th Congress adopted House Joint Resolution No. 638 (H. J. Res. 638), by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of New York, which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.Volume 92, United States Statutes At Large, page 3799 H. J. Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a simple majority, not a supermajority) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H. J. Res. 638 be transmitted to then President Jimmy Carter for signature as a safety precaution. Carter signed the joint resolution, though he questioned—on procedural grounds—the propriety of his doing so.Equal Rights Amendment - Extension of ratification deadline During this disputed extension, no additional states ratified or rescinded.
No additional states ratified the ERA during that extra period of slightly more than three years. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102-71 in favor, but Illinois required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters went on a hunger strike and seventeen chained themselves to the door of the Illinois senate chamber; none of this resulted in any state ratifications.From suffrage to the Senate: an ... - Google Books The closest the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979 and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the Florida House of Representatives on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the deadline, that ratifying resolution was defeated in the Florida Senate by a vote of 16 yeas and 22 nays. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have been two states short of the required 38 (seven states short if the rescissions were valid).

==In the courts==

On December 23, 1981, in Idaho v. Freeman, the United States District Court for the District of Idaho ruled that the rescissions — all of which occurred before the original 1979 ratification deadline — were valid and that the ERA's deadline extension was unconstitutional.Idaho v. Freeman, U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Civ. No. 79-1097, 529 F. Supp. 1107, December 23, 1981 According to research by Professor Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 explicitly referred to the 1979 deadline.Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978 The court also ruled that the extension of the ratification deadline was unconstitutional. The National Organization for Women appealed both rulings. The Administrator of General Services noted that the required number of states (38) had not ratified the amendment so that even if the deadline extension was valid and the rescissions were invalid[tpl]quote|"the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here."Memorandum of Gearld P. Carmen, Administrator of General Services, July 1982.[/tpl] On October 4, 1982, in NOW v. Idaho, 459 U.S. 809 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court declared the entire matter moot on the grounds that the ERA was dead for the reason given by the Administrator of General Services.Text of NOW v. Idaho

==Shift in political attitudes==

Political momentum changed during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.  Playing on the anti-war fervor that resulted from the Vietnam War, opponents of the ERA sought to ensure its defeat by pointing out that the amendment would eliminate the men-only draft requirement and guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to conscription and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed.http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp "The Equal Rights Amendment," U.S. History, a website authored by the Independence Hall Association, Philadelphia. Defending traditional gender roles, Stop ERA advocates baked apple pies for the Illinois state legislature while they debated the amendment and hung "don't draft me" signs on infant girls. They also pointed out that the amendment would repeal protective laws like sexual assault and alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases. It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated if the amendment were passed as well.  The strategy proved to be a success.
At the 1980 Republican National Convention, the Republican Party platform was amended to end its support for the ERA.[tpl]cite web|last=Perlez|first=Jane|title=Plan to omit rights amendment from platform brings objections|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/us/plan-to-omit-rights-amendment-from-platform-brings-objections.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=May 17, 1984[/tpl] The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative Republican lawyer.  Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often heckle feminists by opening her speeches with quips like "I'd like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight." When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Critchlow and Stachecki argue that public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.
Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on special interest forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting they funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority.Critchlow and Stachecki, "The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered," (2008), pp. 157-8 They argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women and (until 1973) the AFL–CIO. Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry.The History Behind the Equal Rights Amendment Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong support among Southern whites, Evangelical Christians, Mormons, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, including both men and women.Critchlow and Stachecki, "The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered," (2008), p. 160
A black critic of the ERA was the Texas State Representative Clay Smothers of Dallas, who criticized the national convention held in Houston in 1977 to promote feminist causes. "I have had enough civil rights to choke a hungry goat. I ask for victory over the perverts in this country. I want the right to segregate my family from these misfits and perverts," Smothers told a social conservative rally held at the Astrodome in opposition to the feminist convention.Dominic Sandbroook, Mad as Hell: The Crisis of the 1970s and the Rise of the Populist Right (New York City: Alfred A. Knopf, 2011), p. 261; ISBN 9781400042623

==Three-state strategy==

Beginning in the mid 1990s, proponents of the ERA launched a three-state strategy to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it in 1972–1982.  This campaign was developed through the efforts of the ERA Summit, a volunteer coalition organized in Washington, DC in 1991, and based upon the assertion that 
[tpl]quote|Congress has the power to adjust or repeal the previous time limit on the ERA, determine whether state ratifications subsequent to 1982 are valid, and accept the ERA as part of the Constitution after three more states ratify. The 35 existing ratifications should stand because precedent regarding state rescissions shows that such actions have not been accepted as valid.[tpl]cite web|title=The Three-State Strategy|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute in collaboration with the ERA Task Force of the National Council of Women's Organizations|accessdate=April 25, 2014|author=Roberta W. Francis[/tpl][/tpl] 
The three-state strategy was publicly unveiled at a press conference held in Washington, D.C., in December 1993."New strategy adopted to revive ERA," by Kim I. Mills, Associated Press, as it appeared in the Sacramento (Ca.) Bee, December 12, 1993  Early the following year, Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat from New Jersey, introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to require that "when the legislatures of an additional three states ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, the House of Representatives shall take any legislative action necessary to verify the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as a part of the Constitution."Text of H. Res. 432, 103rd Congress, 2nd Session, May 23, 1994. No action was taken on the resolution.  Since then, proponents of the three-state strategy have promoted ratification resolutions in the legislatures of most of the 15 states that never ratified the ERA approved by Congress in 1972. Ratification resolutions have been introduced in several state legislatures, but none have given it their full approval.
In 1996, the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Service issued a report that said, "There is no precedent for Congress promulgating an amendment based on state ratifications adopted after a ratification deadline has expired. However, proponents of this course cite as possible precedent the ratification activity of the states regarding the 27th Amendment... proponents of the ERA might wish to adopt a strategy of urging its ratification by state legislatures because their actions might prompt this or a future Congress to proclaim the amendment had been ratified." CRS stressed that it "takes no position on any of the issues.""Memorandum: Equal Rights Amendment: Ratification Issues", by David C. Huckabee. Specialist in American National Government, Government Division, The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service. March 18, 1996
Opponents of the three-state strategy point out that the 1789 resolution proposing what is now the Twenty-seventh Amendment did not contain a deadline for ratification. This amendment was ratified in 1992, more than 202 years after Congress submitted it to the states for ratification.[tpl]cite web|title=ERA: History|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm|publisher=National Council of Women's Organizations|accessdate=2014-01-04[/tpl]
On June 21, 2009, the National Organization for Women resolved to support both the three-state strategy and any strategy to submit a new ERA to the states for ratification.[tpl]cite web|title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl]
On July 7, 2009, at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to announce the reintroduction of the ERA in Congress, activists supporting the three-state strategy distributed a flyer opposing reintroduction, saying "this is not the time to start over and ignore the work ERA advocates have already done."[tpl]cite web|title=3 State Flyer Against Maloney|url=http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/ERA/3StateFlyerAgainstMaloneyERA0709.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 2009|publisher=National Right to Life Committee|accessdate=2009-08-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Subsequent congressional action==

The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) championed it in the Senate during the 99th Congress through the 110th Congress. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) introduced the amendment symbolically at the end of the 111th Congress and has supported it in the 112th Congress. In the House of Representatives, Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) has sponsored it since the 105th Congress,[tpl]cite web|title=Facts About the ERA|url=http://maloney.house.gov/documents/women/era/AUGUST%2012%20Facts%20About%20the%20ERA%20in%20the%20111th%20Congress.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States House of Representatives|accessdate=2009-08-20[/tpl] most recently in May 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/23/rep-carolyn-maloney-continues-push-for-equal-rights-amendment/|title=Rep.
