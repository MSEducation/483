D187 ''Rommel'' was a guided missile destroyer of the Bundesmarine (West German Navy) and later the Deutsche Marine (Navy of reunited Germany). It was the third and last ship of the [tpl]sclass-|Lütjens|destroyer|4[/tpl], a modification of the [tpl]sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|4[/tpl].
The Rommel was laid down August 22, 1967, by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine with the hull number DDG-30. She was launched on February 1, 1969, and christened the Rommel by Lucie Maria Rommel, widow of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel. The vessel was commissioned on May 2, 1970, and was added to the 1. Zerstörergeschwader (first destroyer squadron), based in Kiel.  She operated for 28 years.
On September 30, 1998, she was decommissioned.  The operating licence for the boilers had expired and it was not considered efficient to refit her. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven to be cannibalised for spare parts to support her two sister ships, the [tpl]ship|German destroyer|Lütjens|D185|2[/tpl] and the [tpl]ship|German destroyer|Mölders|D186|2[/tpl].  These two vessels continued to serve for five more years. In 2004 the hull of the Rommel was scrapped for metal in Turkey.
