[[Tennessee State Route 102]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Tennessee

State Route 102 is a state highway that exists entirely within Rutherford County, Tennessee. Its northern terminus is in Smyrna and its southern terminus is in Almaville, an unincorporated community in western Rutherford County, at State Route 96.

==Route description==

The southern half of State Route 102 is called Almaville Road and has an interchange with State Route 840. The two-lane road travels north through rural, undeveloped land until reaching the rapidly growing residential and warehouse areas just outside Smyrna and expanding to four lanes. (The city has rapidly been annexing this land in recent years.) After an interchange with Interstate 24, State Route 102 becomes Lee Victory Parkway, named after a prominent local politician. After an interchange with U.S. Route 41 / U.S. Route 70S, State Route 102 becomes Nissan Drive, named for the massive Nissan automobile manufacturing facility that faces the east side of the highway. The highway's terminus is at Jefferson Pike; northbound traffic on State Route 102 continues westbound on Sam Ridley Parkway/State Route 266 on its way back towards Interstate 24. Thus the combination of State Routes 102 and 266 forms a partial beltway around Smyrna.
