West Dean is a civil parish, situated in the Forest of Dean district of Gloucestershire, England.

==History==

The Forest of Dean was an extra-parochial area in the St Briavels Hundred of Gloucestershire. It was without the usual parish structure until the West Dean and East Dean townships were formed in 1844.[tpl]cite book | first=Frederic |last=Youngs | title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England | volume=I: Southern England | year=1979 | publisher=Royal Historical Society | location=London | isbn=0-901050-67-9[/tpl] For poor relief, West Dean was grouped into the Monmouth Poor Law Union and was included in the Monmouth rural sanitary district. Following the Local Government Act 1894, West Dean became a civil parish in the West Dean Rural District. In 1974 the rural district was abolished and West Dean became one of 41 civil parishes in the Forest of Dean district.List of Forest of Dean Parish Councils
