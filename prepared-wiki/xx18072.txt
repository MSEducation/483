[[Cardiomyopathy]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiomyopathy

Cardiomyopathy (literally "heart muscle disease") is the measurable deterioration of the function of the myocardium (the heart muscle) for any reason, usually leading to heart failure; common symptoms are dyspnea (breathlessness) and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs). People with cardiomyopathy are often at risk of dangerous forms of irregular heart beat and sudden cardiac death.[tpl]cite book | last = Kasper | first = Denis Lh. et al. | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th edn | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-07-139140-1[/tpl] The most common form of cardiomyopathy is dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardiopulmonary Pharmacology for Respiratory Care, Jahangir Moini, Ch.2; page 24http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm/types.html

==Classification==

Although in theory the term "cardiomyopathy" could apply to almost any disease affecting the heart, in practice it is usually reserved for "severe myocardial disease leading to heart failure".[tpl]cite book|author=Gabriel A.

It is also possible to classify cardiomyopathies functionally, as involving dilation, hypertrophy, or restriction.[tpl]cite book|author1=Valentin Fuster|author2=John Willis Hurst|title=Hurst's the heart|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eWQAJDrVV7gC&pg=PA1884|accessdate=11 November 2010|year=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-143225-2|pages=1884–[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms and signs may mimic those of almost any form of heart disease. Chest pain is common. Mild myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is frequently asymptomatic; severe cases are associated with heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic embolization. Manifestations of the underlying disease (e.g., Chagas' disease) may be prominent. Most patients with biopsy-proven myocarditis report a recent viral prodrome preceding cardiovascular symptoms.
ECG abnormalities are often present, although the changes are frequently nonspecific. A pattern characteristic of left ventricular hypertrophy may be present. Flat or inverted T waves are most common, often with low-voltage QRS complexes. Intraventricular conduction defects and bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, are also common. An echocardiogram is useful to detect wall motion abnormalities or a pericardial effusion. Chest radiographs can be normal or can show evidence of congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and condition of disease, but may include medication (conservative treatment) or iatrogenic/implanted pacemakers for slow heart rates, defibrillators for those prone to fatal heart rhythms, ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for severe heart failure, or ablation for recurring dysrhythmias that cannot be eliminated by medication or cardioversion. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a heart transplant. Treatment of cardiomyopathy (and other heart diseases) using alternative methods such as stem cell therapy is commercially available but is not supported by convincing evidence.
