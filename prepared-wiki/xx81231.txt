St Edmundsbury is a local government district and borough in Suffolk, England. It is named after its main town, Bury St Edmunds. The second town in the district is Haverhill.
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 (with the abolition of West Suffolk) by the merger of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds, Haverhill Urban District, Clare Rural District and Thingoe Rural District.
Until March 2009 its main offices were in Bury St Edmunds (Angel Hill and Western Way). Thereafter a purpose built complex, West Suffolk House housed both St Edmundsbury and Suffolk County Council staff.St Edmundsbury website
In 2008 the Council submitted a proposal to the Boundary Commission which would see it as central to a new West Suffolk unitary council.St Edmundsbury website Despite the considerable energies used to promote this conceptThey work for you.com the proposal was rejected and no unitary scheme for Suffolk was adopted.
