HMS ''Ashanti'' (F117) was a Tribal-class frigate of the Royal Navy. She was named after the Ashanti people, an ethnic group located in Ghana. The frigate was sunk as a target in 1988.
Ashanti was built by Yarrow, of Scotstoun, at a cost of £5,315,000 and was the first commissioned Royal Navy warship to be equipped with combined steam and gas (COSAG) engines."Second £7M. Assault Ship For The Navy". The Times (55326): Col A, p. 5. 27 February 1962. She was launched on 9 March 1959 and commissioned on 23 November 1961.Gardiner, Robert & Chesneau, Roger (1995), p. 518.

==Operational Service==

1962: Malicious damaged reported aboard Ashantihttp://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Ops-Events1961-70.htm
Ashanti deployed to the Caribbean for trials in 1962. There, in early October, the ship suffered a failure in her COSAG engines, forcing the frigate's return to Britain."£5M. Frigate Breaks Down On Trials". The Times (55513): Col E, p. 4. 4 October 1962. Subsequent tests discovered that the COSAG's machinery was defective, which caused blade fracturing in the gas turbine."Warship's Dual Propulsion Units Faulty". The Times (55598): Col F, p. 4. 14 January 1963. Hull strengthening also found to be required http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Ops-Events1961-70.htm
Ashanti was also used to trial the Westland Wasp helicopter, prior to its introduction to active service in 1964.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]The frigate conducted operations in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea for 10 months in 1963."News in Brief". The Times (55884): Col E, p. 5. 14 December 1963.  In May 1965, Ashanti suffered minor damage in a collision with the Russian cargo shop Farab in the port of Mombassa, Kenya."News in Brief". The Times (56318): Col A, p 12. 11 May 1965. 
In 1966/67 Ashanti was deployed on Beira Patrol. During that time she also spent a month in Aden having a gas turbine refit whilst some of the crew were seconded to the army as Britain withdrew from Aden. Given the Six Day war, the Suez being blocked, indecisiveness about whether to clear mines form the Gulf of Aqaba she headed home via The Cape of Good Hope, stopping off at Simon's Town.http://www.shipsnostalgia.com/showthread.php?t=548&page=4
In 1969 Ashanti embarked RM Commando detachment at Bermuda during a Black Power Conference.http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Ops-Events1961-70.htm
In 1970, Ashanti deployed on Beira Patrol, which was designed to prevent oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the Portuguese colony of Mozambique.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The following year Ashanti was present at the Royal Navy's withdrawal from Malta. In 1974, while returning to Britain from the Caribbean, Ashanti suffered two fatalities when a large wave struck the frigate.The ship was just four hours out of Bermuda on her way back to the UK, We were hit by a "freak wave" and were only a few degrees away from capsizing. The youngest member of the ships crew was swept overboard and although our helicopter was readied for a recovery, the sea swell was too great for the helicopter crew and winch man's safety. He was lost at sea. The other fatality was the oldest ships member on his last trip before retiring. He was injured severely by a dan buoy that broke loose in the event and died a short while later in the med bay. The ship returned to Bermuda to disembark the body, and for repairs to the upper deck structure. Premature reports by Bermudian radio stations sent invalid signals to UK and it was reported on national TV news channels that Ashanti had been sunk and lost at sea which was upsetting for many crew family members in the UK.     
Three sailors died in 1977 from carbon monoxide poisoning after a fire broke out in a boiler room."Unscrewing of nut led to fatal fire in warship". The Times (59960): Col C, p. 5. 24 March 1977. 
Ashanti was returned to service in 1978 following a repair and refit, and finally placed in reserve and became a Harbour Training Ship. She was sunk as a target in 1988 by the submarines Sceptre and Spartan.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
