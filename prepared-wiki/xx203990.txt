KnujOn, "no junk" spelled backwards and pronounced "new john", is a project involved in Internet security. KnujOn targets spam at its root, attacking the illicit activities that spammers derive their revenue from.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.knujon.com/KnujonWP.pdf | format=PDF | title=Project KnujOn Revised Whitepaper | author=Garth Bruen, Dr. Robert Bruen |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] To that end, KnujOn runs an automated spam reporting tool.

==History==

KnujOn was founded in 2005 by Garth Bruen and his father Dr. Robert Bruen. A multi-purpose software tool called KnujOn was presented at The Northeast Chapter of the High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA) in November 2005. That software, designed to filter junk mail and produce complaints that may result in shutdowns of scam websites, tracks Internet-based scams, and builds profiles of persons or organizations engaged in suspicious Internet activity by gathering and sorting large amounts of data.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ne-htcia.org/HTCIA_Regional/HTCIA_NERC_Program.pdf | format=PDF | title=Conference Overview |date=2005-11-03 | author=Laurie A.

Since then, KnujOn.com has been collecting spam samples from the public, not to build better filters or blacklists, but rather to use them for illicit site termination, to test the Internet's policy infrastructure, and gather important statistics. Their general goal is to target advertised illicit transaction sites and hopefully take the financial incentive out of the spam cycle.
