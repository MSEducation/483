[[Orbital angular momentum of light]]

CATEGORIES: Articles created via the Article Wizard, Light

The orbital angular momentum of light (OAM) is the component of angular momentum of a light beam that is dependent on the field spatial distribution, and not on the polarization. It can be further split into an internal and an external OAM. The internal OAM is an origin-independent angular momentum of a light beam that can be associated with a helical or twisted wavefront. The external OAM is the origin-dependent angular momentum that can be obtained as cross product of the light beam position (center of the beam) and its total linear momentum.

==Introduction==

In the figure to the right, the first column shows the beam wavefront shape. The second column is the optical phase distribution in a beam cross-section, shown in false colors. The third column is the light intensity distribution in a beam cross-section (with a dark vortex core at the center).
An example of optical modes having a helical wavefront is provided by the set of Laguerre-Gaussian modes.[tpl]cite book|last=Siegmam|first=Anthony E.|title=Lasers|year=1986|publisher=University Science Books|isbn=0-935702-11-3|pages=1283[/tpl]

==Mathematical expressions for the orbital angular momentum of light==

The classical expression of the orbital angular momentum in the paraxial limit is the following:[tpl]cite journal|last=Belintante|first=F. J.|title=On the current and the density of the electric charge, the energy, the linear momentum and the angular momentum of arbitrary fields|journal=Physica|year=1940|volume=7|pages=449|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90091-X|issue=5|bibcode = 1940Phy.....7..449B [/tpl]
For a monochromatic wave this expression can be transformed into the following one:[tpl]cite journal|last=Humblet|first=J.|title=Sur le moment d'impulsion d'une onde electromagnetique|journal=Physica (Utrecht)|year=1943|volume=10|pages=585|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(43)90626-3|issue=7|bibcode = 1943Phy....10..585H [/tpl]
This expression is generally nonvanishing when the wave is not cylindrically symmetric. In particular, in a quantum theory, individual photons may have the following values of the OAM:
The corresponding wave functions (eigenfunctions of OAM operator) have the following general expression:

==Potential use in telecommunications==

Research into OAM has suggested that light waves could carry hitherto unprecedented quantities of data through optical fibres. According to preliminary tests, data streams travelling along a beam of light split into 8 different circular polarities have demonstrated the capacity to transfer up to 2.5 terabits of data (equivalent to 66 DVDs or 320 Gigabytes) per second.[tpl]cite news |title='Twisted light' carries 2.5 terabits of data per second |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18551284 |newspaper=BBC |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012[/tpl]
