==History==

What became the Shire of Talbot and Clunes had its origins in several different local authorities during the 1850s gold rush:
After the passage of the Local Government Amendment Act 1914, it was found that Talbot did not meet the criteria of a borough as its rateable income was below £300 per annum, so it was amalgamated on 1 October 1915 with the shire.
On 31 May 1965, an Order in Council united the Borough of Clunes with the Shire of Talbot to create the new Shire.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=850–851[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
On 20 January 1995, the Shire was abolished and split between the Shire of Central Goldfields (Talbot) and the Shire of Hepburn (Clunes).[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=5,7|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2008-01-05[/tpl]
