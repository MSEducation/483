She was discovered at the age of 16 by a newspaper photographer who noticed her at work during her summer job of detasseling corn and took a picture of her. The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management's Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.
Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984, as valedictorian.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |title=13 Famous Valedictorians| encyclopedia = MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/college/?article=FamousValedictorians |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwR2Tlj8 |archivedate=October 31, 2009[/tpl]  She won an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one quarter. She dropped out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to Manhattan in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.

==Career==

During the 1980s and 1990s, Cindy Crawford was among the most popular supermodels, and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns.  She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including: Vogue, W, People, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure.  A partial count in 1998 totalled over 400 appearances."Television; `Sex With Cindy'; TV special explores the sexual state of the union", by Harvey Solomon, Boston Herald, Sep 22, 1998, p.56  Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Gianni Versace, Escada, Revlon, and Ink. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, and Chilean Retail Stores Ripley (partner of Macys).
In 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success.  Three years later she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael's hit "Freedom '90" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the video for his 1994 version of "Please Come Home For Christmas" and "John Taylor" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran's "Girl Panic" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon).
The red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[tpl]cite web|url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/novembre/06/epoca_nel_segno_Versace_co_0_9211067246.shtml|title= Un' epoca nel segno di Versace|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=June 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Chace|first=Reeve|title=The Complete Book of Oscar Fashion: Variety's 75 Years of Glamour on the Red Carpet|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7PfxAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=June 5, 2011|date=October 2003|publisher=Reed Press|isbn=978-1-59429-001-5[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3167702/Liz-Hurley-safety-pin-dress-voted-the-greatest-dress.html|author=Urmee Khan|title=Liz Hurley 'safety pin' dress voted the greatest dress |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=October 9, 2008|accessdate=May 24, 2011[/tpl] In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Craw Daddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some for being unsafe, it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000 (the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Cindy gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape). In 2001, Cindy also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Cindy (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.
The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, The American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years."ASME's Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years", American Society of Magazine Editors, October 17, 2005
Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches tall, with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34"-25.5"-36".Profile Storm Models web site Crawford's trademark is a mole (or "beauty mark") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an advertising campaign for chocolates featuring commercials wherein she "licked off" her own mole. During the beginning of her career, the mole was removed from her earlier modeling pictures, including her first Vogue cover. Her resemblance early in her career to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as "Baby Gia".[tpl]cite web|title=Voguepedia: Gia Carangi|publisher=Vogue.com|accessdate=February 16, 2014|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Gia_Carangi[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gross|first=Michael|date=October 30, 1989|title=The Face|journal=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC|volume=22|issue=43|page=39|issn=0028-7369|accessdate=February 16, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QOgCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=cindy+crawford+baby+gia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9U0bUfqQEoijyAHO_ICYAQ&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=cindy%20crawford%20baby%20gia&f=false[/tpl]
Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host of MTV's House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pepsi.com/faqs.php?section=highlights |title=Ads and History – Highlights |publisher=Pepsi.com |date=March 31, 1999 |accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20340963,00.html |title=11 Best Super Bowl Ads Ever  |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented "In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.""Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide", by Leonard Maltin, p. 433 The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office.  In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford's acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself.  For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Bodyguards – Guardie del corpo.
In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts."Cindy Crawford", Playboy. Retrieved March 28, 2009.
