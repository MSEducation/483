==Accidents and incidents==

On 23 December 2003 at 19:29 local time,  an Aeromist Antonov An-140 (registered UR-14003) crashed into a mountain near Isfahan, Iran, whilst approaching Isfahan International Airport in poor visibility conditions. The aircraft had been operating Flight 2137, a chartered service from Kharkiv to Isfahan with a refueling stop at Trabzon Airport, carrying 38 passengers (all of which were Antonov employees heading for a test flight of the HESA IrAn-140) and 6 crew members, none of which survived. It was later determined that the most probable reason for the crash was the flawed usage of the onboard GPS by the pilots. The accident marked the first, and to date the worst accident involving an aircraft of that type.Flight 2137 at the Aviation Safety Network
