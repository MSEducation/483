[tpl]nihongo|Mewtwo|ミュウツー|Myūtsū|[/tpl] is a fictional creature from Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon media franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, it first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and their sequels, and later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, as well as animation adaptations of the franchise. Masachika Ichimura voiced Mewtwo in Japanese, and the creature's younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo's Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation. In English, Phillip Bartlett voices Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back, with Dan Green providing the voice in Mewtwo Returns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/pokemon/mewtwo.htm |title=Mewtwo Voice Actors |publisher=Absolute Anime |accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Rauzi, Robin |date=2000-04-06 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/cl-movie000406-143,0,6593417.story |title=Pokemon: The First Movie |work=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl] Actress Reiko Takashima voices a separate Mewtwo character in the prequel special Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening and the film ExtremeSpeed Genesect: Mewtwo Awakens.
In the video games, the player can fight and capture Mewtwo to pit it against other Pokémon. The player first learns of Mewtwo late in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island. The documents reveal that a solitary scientist spent years genetically engineering a descendant of the Pokémon Mew. Mewtwo eventually escaped after proving too strong to contain.
Regarded as one of the series' strongest Pokémon, it changed the way players approached the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart Mew. Reactions to the character's anime portrayal have been divided, as reviewers such as Daily Record cited him as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.

==Design and characteristics==

Japanese video game designer Ken Sugimori designed Mewtwo for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games, Red and Green, known outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Its name, which means the "second of Mew",Mewtwo: "Mewtwo...Mewtwo?" / Dr. Fuji: "That's you.

Until the first Pokémon movie was released in the United States, Mewtwo was rarely referred to as a "clone" in  Japanese sources. Kubo Masakazu, executive producer of Mewtwo Strikes Back, explained that they "intentionally avoid using the term 'kuron' clone… because the word has a frightening feel".Masakazu, Kubo (April 2000).

In Pokémon Red and Blue, the player learns of Mewtwo's existence by reading research notes left in the ruined "Pokémon Mansion" on Cinnabar Island.

===In anime and related media===

Mewtwo is featured in the 1998 animated film Pokémon: The First Movie as the main antagonist, in which it is shown to be the creation of the criminal organization Team Rocket. After Mewtwo destroys the laboratory where it was born, Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni, convinces it he can help it control its powers. He instead uses Mewtwo as a weapon. After escaping Giovanni, Mewtwo questions its reason for existence and declares revenge on its creators. To this end, it lures several Pokémon trainers, among them movie protagonist Ash Ketchum, to its island in order to clone their Pokémon. Once it does so, Mewtwo forces the originals to battle the clones in an effort to determine which set is superior, while Mewtwo faces its own original, Mew. Ash sacrifices himself to stop the fighting, though he is later revived. Mewtwo, Mew, and the clones then leave to find a sanctuary, striking memory of the events from those gathered.[tpl]cite video |date=December 1999 |title = ポケットモンスター「ミュウツーの逆襲 完全版」 |format= VHS|medium = Motion picture|language = Japanese |publisher = メディアファクトリー |location  = Japan |id=ASIN B00005HBUW[/tpl] In localizing the film for English-language audiences, Mewtwo's personality became more arrogant and megalomaniacal; localization director Norman Grossfield ruled the changes necessary, as he believed American audiences needed a "clearly evil" rather than ambiguous villain.[tpl]cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=39|isbn=0-8223-3287-6[/tpl] In the film, Mewtwo is voiced by Phillip Bartlett in English, and by Ichimura in Japanese. In this film, Mewtwo displayed unique abilities and powers unseen in other Pokémon, such as blocking all Pokémon moves in his arena when the clones face off against the originals.
In September 1999, Nintendo published Sound Picture Box Mewtwo, which included The Birth of Mewtwo: Pokémon Radio Drama, a CD drama that expands upon Mewtwo's origins. Created by scientist Dr. Fuji, Mewtwo is one of several cloning attempts, amongst which includes a clone of Fuji's deceased daughter. Voiced by Fujiko Takimoto, the child Mewtwo befriends her, communicating telepathically; however the cloning process proves unstable, and she dies. To save the traumatized Mewtwo, Fuji erases its memories and puts it under sedation until its body finishes developing, leading to the events of the film. The CD drama was later adapted into a short anime, and was included with Japanese home releases and broadcasts of Mewtwo Strikes Back and later in North America in December 2001 as part of Mewtwo Returns. Dan Green and Masachika Ichimura provide the English and Japanese voices for the adult Mewtwo. The child version is voiced in Japanese by Fujiko Takimoto for the CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo for the anime, while in the English localization the voice actor is uncredited.[tpl]cite video |people=Yuyama, Kunihiko (Directors) |date=December 2001 |title=Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns |format=DVD |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Warner Home Video |location=North America |id=ASIN B00005OW0I[/tpl]Nintendo (1999-09-13).

In December 2000, the film was followed by a sequel, Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns, which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region. However, Giovanni, whose memories were left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory of itself from his and his soldiers' minds, while leaving the others unaffected. As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own.
Mewtwo also appears in the musical Pokémon Live!, a live action adaptation of the anime set after Pokémon: The First Movie, and is portrayed by Marton Fulop. In it, Mewtwo faces a robotic replica of itself, MechaMew2, created by Giovanni and able to learn any attacks used against it. However, after learning compassion from Mewtwo, the machine rebels and self-destructs.Nintendo. (2006) Pokémon Live!. Act 2, Scene 5.

In 1998, Toshihiro Ono was asked to write a story detailing Mewtwo's origin to coincide with the release of Mewtwo Strikes Back.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000510020712/http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |title=Animerica Interview Toshihiro Ono |url=http://www.vizkids.com/pokemon/news_interview.shtml |archivedate=2000-05-10 |publisher=VIZ Media |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] The 52-page comic, presented in the form of a flashback, was replaced midway by the "The Birth of Mewtwo" animated short, resulting in little connection between Ono's work and the film. Regardless, it saw print as a side story for Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu in the July 1998 issue of CoroCoro Comic. In it, Mewtwo's creator Dr. Fuji takes on the role of a coach for the fully developed Pokémon, while his employer, Team Rocket, tests its abilities. Learning of a plan to mass-produce it as a weapon, Fuji approaches Mewtwo and tells it to destroy the lab and Fuji himself. Mewtwo refuses, stating it cannot harm the doctor, who it regards as its father. Once captured by Team Rocket, Fuji tells Mewtwo that he is honored by the statement, and is then killed. Angered by his death, Mewtwo destroys the lab and escapes. In the present, Mewtwo cries in its sleep as it dreams of the events.[tpl]cite journal |journal=CoroCoro Comic |month=July 1998 |language=Japanese |title=Dengeki Pikachuu: Myutsuu no Gyakushuu! |last=Ono |first=Toshihiro |pages=150–202 |authorlink=Toshihiro Ono |issue=7 |volume=15[/tpl]
