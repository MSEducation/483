[[Y (game)]]

Y is an abstract strategy board game, first described by Claude Shannon in the early 1950s.Martin Gardner. 1963. The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions. Simon and Schuster.  The game was independently invented in 1953 by Craige Schensted (now Ea Ea) and Charles Titus. It is a member of the connection game family inhabited by Hex, Havannah, TwixT, and others; it is also an early member in a long line of games Ea Ea has developed, each game more complex but also more generalized.

==Gameplay==

Y is typically played on a triangular board with hexagonal spaces; the "official" Y board has three points with five-connectivity instead of six-connectivity, but it is just as playable on a regular triangle. Schensted and Titus' book Mudcrack Y & Poly-Y has a large number of boards for play of Y, all hand-drawn; most of them seem irregular but turn out to be topologically identical to a regular Y board.
As in most games of this type, one player takes the part of Black and one takes the part of White; they place stones on the board one at a time, neither removing nor moving any previously-placed stones, and the pie rule can be used to mitigate any first-move advantage.

==Rules==

The rules are as follows:
As in most connection games, the size of the board changes the nature of the game; small boards tend towards pure tactical play, whereas larger boards tend to make the game more strategic.
