==The Melbourne Low Power FM Services==

Melbourne (like most Australian major cities) is home to many broadcasters forming a diverse network of services heard on the frequencies between 87.6 & 87.9 FM. This said, there is no such thing as the "Melbourne FM Narrowcast Network". 
These services vary according to area, and include:

==Licencing and Regulation==

The services operating on the Low Power Open Narrowcasting system are permitted a maximum of 1 Watt transmitter power (1W pY), AND are limited to a signal strength of -43dB at 2Â km from the nominated site of the transmitter. Additionally the services are required to transmit an omni-directional pattern. (ref: Australian Communications & Media Authority website).
The services are further restricted in that they are required to be "limited" in some way, most commonly limited audience appeal. This is achieved through provision of services in languages other than English, Horse Racing, Local Tourist Information services, or time limited services. The limitation provides these services to be acceptable under the requirements of the Narrowcasting class licence regime, as regulated by the Australian Communications & Media Authority.

==Broadcasting Services Act (Commonwealth of Australia)==
