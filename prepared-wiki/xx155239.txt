Gerson ben Solomon of Arles (flourished in the second half of the 13th century) was a Provençal Jewish philosopher; he is said to be the father of Gersonides. 
He was the author of "Sha'ar ha-Shamayim" (Venice, 1547; Rödelsheim, 1801), a sort of encyclopedia divided into three parts, treating: (1) of natural phenomena, metals, plants, animals, and man; (2) of astronomy, principally extracted from Alfergani and the Almagest; and (3) of metaphysics, taken from the Moreh Nebukim of Maimonides.
