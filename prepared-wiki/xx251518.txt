Evan Oberg (born February 16, 1988) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman. He is currently playing with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League (AHL). Oberg played two seasons of college hockey for the University of Minnesota-Duluth, after spending his junior career with the Camrose Kodiaks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). Unselected in the NHL Entry Draft, Oberg was signed by the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL as a free agent in April 2009. He played two seasons with the Canucks AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, with a total of four games for the Canucks over that time. Oberg was then traded to the Florida Panthers in February, 2011, and spent the remainder of the season with their AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans.

Florida then traded Oberg to the Tampa Bay Lightning in December, 2011 and he then joined the Admirals.

Oberg played two seasons with the Camrose Kodiaks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) before joining the University of Minnesota-Duluth.

Oberg finished the season with one goal, a game-winner, and two assists in twenty-four games. Oberg's second season with Minnesota-Duluth saw improvements, as he had seven goals and twenty assists in forty-three games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=453630|title=The right time|last=Jory|first=Derek|date=2009-04-27|accessdate=2010-01-11|publisher=Canucks.com[/tpl]
