Riverdale Presbyterian Church is a historic Presbyterian church located at 4761-4765 Henry Hudson Parkway in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City.  It was designed in 1863 by noted architect James Renwick, Jr.. The church is a fieldstone building in an English-inspired Late Gothic Revival style.  It was substantially enlarged in 1936.
The complex also includes a stone manse, the Duff House, also designed by Renwick, and a Stick Style cottage, called the Duff or Gardener's Cottage, built in 1875.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=721|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Riverdale Presbyterian Church Complex|date=April 1980|accessdate=2011-01-12 |author=Andrew W.
