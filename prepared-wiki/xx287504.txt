[[Naresuan-class frigate]]

CATEGORIES: Ships of the Royal Thai Navy

The ''Naresuan'' class Frigate, (Thai: นเรศวร)  is a modified version of the Chinese-made Type 053 frigate, cooperatively designed by the Royal Thai Navy and China but built by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation in Shanghai. The ships came at 2 billion baht each, much less than the 8 billion baht price tag for Western-built frigates. 
When Thailand ordered four new 053 frigates in 1990, China built them to the (then) latest 053H2 (Jianghu III) standard. Two were modified with helicopter decks in the back. Although the price was excellent (2 billion baht each, compared to 8 billion baht for western ships), the Thai Navy complained of quality issues. The interior wiring was exposed and had to be re-wired. The ship's battle damage control system was very limited, with poor fire-suppression system and water-tight locks. It's said that if the ship's hull was breached, rapid flooding would lead to loss of ship. The Thai Navy had to spent considerable time and effort to correct some of these issues.[tpl]cite web|title=NARESUAN (TYPE 25T) (FFG) |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/naresuan.htm|work=GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl]
The harsh criticisms lead to many improvements in China's shipbuilding industry. By the mid-1990s, the Thai Navy was confident enough to order two enlarged 053 hulls (F25T), later named HTMS Naresuan and HTMS Taksin, to be fitted with western engines and weapon systems.
