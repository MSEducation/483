CATEGORIES: Documents, Conspiracy theories, Non-fiction books about the John F. Kennedy assassination

The Gemstone File is a conspiracy theory document attributed to Bruce Porter Roberts. In 1975, "A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File" appeared and is generally attributed to Stephanie Caruana. The "Key" is purportedly a synopsis of Roberts' documents that presents a chronicle of interlocking conspiracies, including claims that world events since the 1950s were shaped by suppressed information, the names of supposed shooters of President John F. Kennedy, and suggested connections between a number of political assassinations which occurred within a relatively short time frame. Authors James McConnachie and Robin Tudge called it "the original mega-conspiracy theory."

==History==

Originally distributed in 1975 by hand and mail in photocopy form, the Gemstone File has appeared in slightly revised form in Hustler magazine and on the Internet. Roberts, known only to Stephanie Caruana and conspiracy theorist Mae Brussell, purportedly began gathering "information" in the file when Howard Hughes stole his invention for processing synthetic rubies, hence the title "Gemstone". According to Gerald Carroll, Roberts was born in New York State on October 27, 1919 and died of lung cancer in San Francisco on July 16, 1976.[tpl]cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Gerald A. |authorlink1= |title=Project Seek: Onassis, Kennedy, and the Gemstone Thesis |url= |accessdate=May 23, 2012 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1994 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Bridger House |location= |language= |isbn=9780964010406 |page=3[/tpl]
Factsheet Five publisher Mike Gunderloy collected and distributed several versions of the Gemstone File. Gunderloy wrote that the original Gemstone File was simply a list of contributors to Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP), while the subsequent versions gradually linked various figures of the Watergate and Kennedy eras.[tpl]Citation |date=August 1991 |periodical=Factsheet Five |issue=44 |pages=86|id=ISSN 0890-6823[/tpl]

==Outline==

The Gemstone File proposes that Aristotle Onassis, Joseph P. Kennedy, and other prominent figures were involved in various schemes to forward a vast global conspiracy, involving the Mafia and corrupt politicians, brutal oil and drug cartels, rogue military operations, and more. It also posits that early in 1957, Aristotle Onassis had Howard Hughes kidnapped from his Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow; that Hughes suffered a massive brain injury during the forcible kidnapping, and that Hughes was subsequently a virtual prisoner of Onassis on Skorpios and injected regularly with morphine, while Onassis took over the operation of Hughes's considerable financial affairs, including airlines and U.S. defense contracting.[tpl]cite book|author1=James McConnachie|author2=Robin Tudge|title=The Rough Guide To Conspiracy Theories|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=shRNWHQxLasC&pg=PA131&dq=The+Rough+Guide+To+Conspiracy+Theories+gemstone&hl=en&sa=X&ei=B8HAT5SmKMnD6AGdvsC3Cg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8385-1|pages=131â€“[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Mark Fenster|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SR-mmN746KQC&pg=PA117&dq=history+through+a+gemstone:+bruce+roberts&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YMDAT9H5Dc2d6AHpnajGCw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=history%20through%20a%20gemstone%3A%20bruce%20roberts&f=false|accessdate=23 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3242-8[/tpl]
The Gemstone File portrays Onassis as the main force behind the election of John F. Kennedy as President, and subsequently, Kennedy's assassination in 1963. According to the documents, Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination plan and was linked to the Central Intelligence Agency, and to Mafia connections in New Orleans, with Jimmy Fratianno, Johnny Roselli, and Eugene Brading as the real shooters. The Gemstone papers claim that John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph P. Kennedy were involved with the Mafia and Onassis, and when the Kennedy brothers attempted to break away, they were murdered.

Six books have since been written based on the Skeleton Key, between 1976-2006:

In the television series La Femme Nikita, the Gemstone File documents the plans for world domination of Operations (a.k.a. Paul Wolfe), the leading operative of Section 1, which involve the support of Saddam Hussein, a pawn in Operations' schemes. The former head of Section 1, Adrian, plans of revealing the Gemstone File first to George, head of Oversight, and then to the public in order to shatter Operations's bid for power, though Nikita ends up siding with Operations, as simulations predict world chaos and destruction should Hussein be removed from power.
