"Georgia on My Mind" is a song by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell, closely associated with the cover version by Ray Charles, a native of Georgia, who recorded it for his 1960 album The Genius Hits the Road. It became the official state song of the State of Georgia in 1979.[tpl]cite news|title=State Song|year=1979|publisher=Georgia Secretary of State|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/archives/state_symbols/state_song.html [/tpl]

Written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Carmichael's sister, Georgia Carmichael.The Hoagy Carmichael Collection Retrieved June 30, 2012. However, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia".  Carmichael's 1965 autobiography, Sometimes I Wonder, records the origin: a friend, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia'? Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state.
The song was first recorded on September 15, 1930, in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. It featured Eddie Lang on guitar. The recording was part of Beiderbecke's last recording session.[tpl]cite web|last=Cad|first=Saint|title=10 More Famous Songs With Unknown Originals|url=http://listverse.com/2012/10/14/10-more-famous-songs-with-unknown-originals/|work=listverse.com|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl] The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".

Kapp Records LP KL-1027-The Hi-Lo's & The Jerry Fielding orchestra.
Frankie Trumbauer had the first major hit recording in 1931, when his recording made the top ten on the charts. Trumbauer had suggested that Carmichael compose the song. Another 1931 hit version was Mildred Bailey's vocal made with members of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra (Victor 22880).
The song was a standard at performances by Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where it was sung by pianist Richard Manuel. When The Hawks split off on their own and became The Band, they kept the song as part of their repertoire. They recorded a studio version of the song for Jimmy Carter's presidential bid in 1976, which was released as a single that year as well as on their 1977 album Islands.[tpl]Citation |last=Morris|first=Chris|title=Liner Notes to Islands CD release[/tpl]
Cold Chisel's version of the song appeared on the album Barking Spiders Live: 1983 and has become a staple of their live shows. Guitarist Ian Moss still performs the song and a live version is included in his Let's All Get Together album.
The song is also associated with the Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps. "Georgia" was originally featured in their 1979 show and the corps continues to perform it today. Currently the piece is performed as a warmup or in a formal setting by Spirit's members and alumni.

===Ray Charles===

It was not until Ray Charles' 1960 recording on The Genius Hits the Road, that the song became a major hit, reaching the number one spot for one week in November 1960 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. On March 7, 1979, in a mutual symbol of reconciliation after conflict over civil rights issues, he performed it before the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature).  After this performance, the connection to the state was firmly made, and the Assembly adopted it as the state song on April 24.
Although there is no actual evidence to that effect, according to the 2004 film Ray, Charles was lifted from a supposed lifetime ban implemented since 1962.[tpl]cite web|work=AtlantaMagazine.com|url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/flashback/Story.aspx?id=1372656|title=32 Years Ago This Month: Ray Charles Serenades the Legislature|accessdate=January 18, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|work=about.com|work=About.com|title=How did racism affect Ray Charles?|author=Robert Fontenot, About.com Guide|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/rbandblues/f/rayracism.htm|accessdate=June 9, 2012[/tpl]
This version of the song was played with a video montage each time that Georgia Public Television went off the air nightly.  With the advent of 24-hour broadcasting, it is rarely used now, the last time being in 2009 for the permanent sign-off of GPB's analog TV stations on February 17.
The song was used as the theme song to the CBS sitcom Designing Women (set in Atlanta), initially as an instrumental (performed by Doc Severinsen), and later in a recording by Ray Charles. Charles' version was also sampled for rap group Field Mob's 2005 single, "Georgia", featuring Jamie Foxx and Ludacris. Lil Wayne also uses the song in his satirical song about George W. Bush called "Georgia Bush".
Sometime after 2000, Charles invited the Italian singer Giorgia Todrani to sing the song with him after learning she was named in honor of the song.
Jamie Foxx and Alicia Keys, backed by Quincy Jones and his Orchestra, performed a new arrangement in honor of Ray Charles at the 2005 Grammy Awards.
