Urkun (in English: "Exodus") is the Kyrgyz name for a 1916 revolt against Russian Tsarist forces and a mass flight to escape to China.  The events occurred at the Bedel Pass border post near the Kyrgyz-Chinese border on July 30, 1916.
Accounts of the Kyrgyz death toll vary.  Some claim that nearly half the Kyrgyz from the northern part of the country died during Urkun. Bruce Pannier put the death toll at more than 100,000 people. Russian sources admit that the revolt claimed the lives of up to 3,000 people.Krugosvet Encyclopaedia. Article on Sturmer.
History professor Tynchtykbek Tchoroev, author of a book on Urkun, believes the cause of the revolt to have been the call for conscription issued by Boris St√ºrmer:
In the eastern part of Russian Turkestan, tens of thousands of surviving Kyrgyz and Kazakhs fled toward China. In the Tien-Shan Mountains they died by the thousands in mountain passes over 3000 meters high.

==Historical examination==

Urkun was not covered by Soviet textbooks, and monographs on the subject were removed from Soviet printing houses.  As the Soviet Union was disintegrating in 1991, interest in Urkun grew.  Some survivors have begun to label the events a "massacre" or "genocide."
Some Kyrgyz historians do not believe the issue is cause for anti-Russian sentiment, because Russian liberals like Aleksandr Kerensky and some Russian historians were the first to bring attention to these events.
