==The Band That Plays The Blues and the First Herd 1936-1946==

Woody Herman's first band became known for its orchestrations of the blues and was sometimes billed as "The Band That Plays The Blues".  This band recorded for the Decca label, at first serving as a cover band, doing songs by other Decca artists.Visser 14 The first song recorded was "Wintertime Blues" on November 6, 1936. In January 1937, George T. Simon closed a review of the band with the words: "This Herman outfit bears watching; not only because it's fun listening to in its present stages, but also because its bound to reach even greater stages."[tpl]cite book |title=Simon Says: The Sights and Sounds of the Swing Era|last=Simon |first=George T.|authorlink=George T.

"It was really a sleeper. But Decca kept re-releasing it, and over a period of three or four years it became a hit. Eventually it sold more than five million copies—the biggest hit I ever had."[ref]

Other hits for the band include "The Golden Wedding" and "Blue Prelude".Visser 17  Musicians and arrangers that stand out include Cappy Lewis on trumpet and Dean Kincaide, a noted big band arranger.
In jazz, swing was gradually being replaced by  bebop.  Dizzy Gillespie, a trumpeter and one of the originators of bop, wrote three arrangements for Woody Herman, "Woody'n You", "Swing Shift" and "Down Under".  These were arranged in 1942.Visser 19  "Woody'n You" was not used at the time.  "Down Under" was recorded November 8, 1943.  The fact that Herman commissioned Dizzy Gillespie to write arrangements for the band and that Herman hired Ralph Burns as a staff arranger, heralded a change in the style of music the band was playing.Visser 19-21
In February 1945, the band started a contract with Columbia Records.Visser 25 Herman liked what drew many artists to Columbia, Liederkranz Hall, at the time the best recording venue in New York City. The first side Herman recorded was "Laura", the theme song of the 1944 movie of the same name.[ref]
