Cantlop is a small village in the English county of Shropshire. It is part of the civil parish of Berrington. Various meanings have been suggested for the name, such as an enclosed or cut-off valleyBowcock, E. Shropshire place names, Wilding & Son, 1923, p.61 or an enclosure in a waste or common.Gelling and Foxall, The place-names of Shropshire, Volume 1, English Place-Name Society, 1990, p.69
Nearby villages include Condover to the west of Cantlop, with the village of Berrington to the north-west. 
To the north of the village there is a cast iron single span bridge (Cantlop Bridge), now generally accepted to have been designed by Thomas Telford, who once worked as the County Surveyor of Shropshire.Cragg, R.

A small layby nearby allows access by the public.
