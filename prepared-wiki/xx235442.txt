Perezia is a genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. It is distributed in South America, especially in the central and southern Andes.Simpson, B. B., et al. (2009). Phylogeny and evolution of Perezia (Asteraceae: Mutisieae: Nassauviinae). Journal of Systematics and Evolution 47(5), 431-43.
Though some species occur at sea level, most Perezia grow in high-elevation mountain habitat. Species are found in most high Andean ecosystems, except for the p√°ramo.
Some species are used in traditional medicine in South America. P. multiflora is used to treat postpartum hemorrhage, P. pinnatifida is used as a sedative, and P. purpurata is used as an anti-inflammatory.Gallardo, A. B., et al. (2011).
