Aker University Hospital was founded in 1895 in Oslo, Norway. From January 1, 2009, the hospital is part of the Oslo University Hospital.
Since January 2002 the hospital is organized as a health trust that is fully owned by Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and which also is responsible for the hospital budget. An exception from this is the hospital's academic activities, which are financed by the University of Oslo, individuals, private sector companies and the Government of Norway.
The hospital is responsible for providing health care to 170,000 people residing in the northern part of Oslo as well as the municipalities of Ski, Oppegård, Nesodden, Frogn, Ås and Vestby. It also serves as a regional hospital for Norway's Health Region East, which includes Oslo, Hedmark, Oppland, Akershus and Østfold counties with a total population of 1,6 million.
