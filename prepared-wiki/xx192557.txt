The Red Wattle, also called the Red Wattle Hog, is a breed of domestic pig originating in the United States. Named for its red color and distinctive wattles, it is on the critically endangered list of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy (ALBC). 

==Characteristics==

Red Wattle hogs typically weigh 400-800 pounds but can reach 1500 pounds. They typically measure four feet in height by eight feet length. Boars are larger than sows. They normally have eight to ten piglets per litter but can have up to 16. They are well known for their rapid growth rate, foraging ability, disease resistance, and hardiness. They also have wattles alongside their jowl on each side.

==History==

The history of the Red Wattle hog is not clear. They were found again in the late 1960s and early 1970s by H. C. Wengler in East Texas. He is credited with starting the Wengler Red Waddle Hog line. (Note the spelling difference: "dd" in waddle instead of wattle.) He wanted to make sure his were unique. About 20 years later, Robert Prentice located another herd of Red Wattle Hogs in East Texas as well. These became the Timberline line of Red Wattles. He also combined his Timberlines with Mr. Wengler's breed to make the Endow Farm Wattle Hogs. 
During the boom in the hog market in the early 1980s there were three different registries for the Red Wattle Hog. Many people had them but there was never a central breed association. In 1999, when the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy looked again, there were only 42 breeding animals belonging to six breeders. The ALBC now maintains the pedigree book for the breed. Recently, there was a Red Wattle Hog Association started for the betterment of the breed.
