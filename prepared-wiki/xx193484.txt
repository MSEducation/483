Miscellanea Historica Hibernica, also known as MS G1, is a manuscript miscellany, a miniature vellum commonplace book. 
Compiled by Pilip Ballach Ó Duibhgeannáin during the years 1579 - 1584, it is described on the front endpaper as Miscellanea Historica Hibernica in a later hand. Ó Duibhgeannáin was a resident of Cloonybrien, County Roscommon. 
The Miscellanea contains an Irish rendering of an extract from a Latin tract found in Roger Bacon's 13th century version of Secretum Secretorum on physiognomy.
Paul Walsh suggested that Ó Duibhgeannáin was a son of Fer Caogad mac Ferghal Ó Duibhgeannáin, who died at Cloonybried in 1581.
