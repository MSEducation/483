[/ref] The first informal mystic society, or krewe, was formed in Mobile in 1711, the Boeuf Gras Society. By 1720, Biloxi had been made capital of Louisiana. The French Mardi Gras customs had accompanied the colonists who settled there.
In 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718.  Mobile's Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade in 1830.  The idea of mystic societies was exported to New Orleans in 1856 when six businessmen, three of whom were formerly of Mobile, gathered at a club room in New Orlean's French Quarter to organize a secret society, inspired by the Cowbellion de Rakin Society, that would observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade.  They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.Arthur B. LaCour, New Orleans Masquerade:  Chronicles of Carnival (Pelican Publishing 1952)  The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the point that it became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans beyond those of French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan, Laissez les bons temps rouler, (Let the good times roll).[tpl]fv|date=February 2014[/tpl]  Other cities along the Gulf Coast with early French colonial heritage, from Pensacola, Florida; Galveston, Texas; to Lafayette, Louisiana, have active Mardi Gras celebrations in balls. In the rural Acadiana area, many Cajuns celebrate with the Courir de Mardi Gras, a tradition that dates to medieval celebrations in France.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/mardmain.htm|title=Mardi Gras in Rural Acadiana|accessdate=February 18, 2010[/tpl]
