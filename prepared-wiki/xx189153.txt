The Outcomes Research Consortium is an international clinical research group that focuses on the perioperative period (during and after surgery), along with critical care and pain management.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2923-red-heads-suffer-more-pain.html | title = Red heads suffer more pain | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | last = Knight | first = Will | date = 2002-10-15 | work = New Scientist | publisher = Reed Business Information Ltd. | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080509034636/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2923-red-heads-suffer-more-pain.html | archivedate = 2008-05-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/30/redhead.pain.dentist/ | title = Study: Redheads' extra pain may cause fear of dentists | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | last = Park | first = Madison | date = 2009-07-31 | work = CNN Health | publisher = Cable News Network[/tpl] The Consortium’s aim is to improve the quality of care for surgical, critical care, and chronic pain patients and to “Provide the evidence for evidence-based practice.” [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.or.org/about.htm | title = Outcomes Research Consortium: About | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | publisher = Outcomes Research Consortium | quote = By linking the care people get to the outcomes they experience, outcomes research has become the key to developing better ways to monitor and improve the quality of care.[/tpl] Members of the Consortium are especially interested in testing simple, low-risk, and inexpensive treatments that have the potential to markedly improve patients’ surgical experiences.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The Outcomes Research Group was formed in 1990 at the University of California San Francisco. The Consortium now includes more than 100 university-based investigators at more than 20 hospitals in 10 countries. Its administrative center is the Department of Outcomes Research in the Anesthesiology Institute at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.

==Research highlights==

The Consortium coordinates more than 100 clinical trials, including large multi-center outcome studies. The results of these studies are disseminated in peer-reviewed medical journals and, with time, may be incorporated into medical practice. Since 2009 Consortium members published more than 125 full research papers, mostly related to anesthetic management.Outcomes Research Articles

==Temperature Regulation During Surgery==

A long-standing interest of the Consortium is temperature regulation during and after surgery. Body temperature is normally tightly regulated to about 37 °C (98.6 °F), with women being slightly warmer than men.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000542-199404000-00009 |author=Lopez M, Sessler DI, Walter K, Emerick T, Ozaki M. |title=Rate and gender dependence of the sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering thresholds in humans. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=780–8 |date=April 1994 |pmid= 8024131 |url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Abstract/1994/04000/Rate_and_Gender_Dependence_of_the_Sweating,.9.aspx[/tpl] But anesthetic drugs profoundly impair normal control.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e31817f6d76 |author=Sessler DI |title= Temperature monitoring and perioperative thermoregulation. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=318–38 |date=August 2008 |pmid= 18648241 |url= http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2008/08000/Temperature_Monitoring_and_Perioperative.21.aspx |pmc=2614355 [/tpl] Impaired temperature control, combined with a cold operating room environment, makes most unwarmed surgical patients hypothermic by 1-3 °C.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00000542-200002000-00042 |author= Sessler DI. |last2= Todd |first2= Michael M.|title= Perioperative Heat Balance. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=92 |issue=2 |page=578 |date=February 2000 |pmid= 10691247 |url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Abstract/1994/04000/Rate_and_Gender_Dependence_of_the_Sweating,.9.aspx[/tpl]

==Red Hair and Anesthesia==

150 years after their discovery, how anesthetic gases work remains unknown. They work well in all mammals, rodents, insects, worms, fish, bacteria, and even plants.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The dose required in various species doesn’t differ much from the dose in humans.  In non-human species, there are distinct genetic characteristics that clearly influence anesthetic sensitivity. But until recently, no genetic factors were known to influence anesthetic requirement in humans. In a series of studies, Consortium members have shown that the effective dose of anesthetic gases is about 20% greater in natural redheads than in people with other hair colors.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00000542-200408000-00006 |author= Liem EB, Lin CM, Suleman MI, Doufas AG, Gregg RG, Veauthier JM, Loyd G, Sessler DI. |title= Anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=101 | issue= 2 |pages=279–83 |date=August 2004 |pmid= 15277908 |url= http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2004/08000/Anesthetic_Requirement_Is_Increased_in_Redheads.6.aspx |pmc= 1362956[/tpl]  Red hair results from a mutation of the melanocortin-1 receptor. The Consortium’s results thus indicate that something about this receptor influences anesthetic action. Red hair was the first phenotype (physically apparent characteristics linked to a genetic mutation) linked to anesthetic requirement in humans, and remains the only one. Consortium research on red hair and anesthetic requirement has been covered by the San Francisco Examiner,http://www.or.org/news/sfe_10_2002.htm The Globe and Mail,http://www.or.org/news/gam_10_2002.htm and Readers Digest.http://www.or.org/news/rd_1_2003.htm
In further research, members of the Consortium found that redheads are resistant to local anesthetics.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00000542-200503000-00006 |author= Liem EB, Joiner TV, Tsueda K, Sessler DI. |title= Increased sensitivity to thermal pain and reduced subcutaneous lidocaine efficacy in redheads. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=102 | issue= 3 |pages=509–14 |date=March 2005 |pmid= 15731586 |url= http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2005/03000/Increased_Sensitivity_to_Thermal_Pain_and_Reduced.6.aspx |pmc= 1692342[/tpl] Consequently, they are more likely to suffer pain during dental procedures — and are therefore reluctant to receive needed dental care.[tpl]cite journal |author= Binkley CJ, Beacham A, Neace W, Gregg RG, Liem EB, Sessler DI. |title= Genetic variations associated with red hair color and fear of dental pain, anxiety regarding dental care and avoidance of dental care. |journal= J Am Dent Assoc |volume=140 | issue= 7 |pages=896–905 |date=July 2009 |pmid= 19571053 |url= http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/140/7/896 |pmc= 2740987[/tpl]  Consortium research on red hair and dental avoidance has been covered by Macleans, the Boston Herald, and The New York Times.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

==Blood Transfusion==

A study published by Consortium members in 2008 identified a strong association between the age of transfused blood and complications after cardiac surgery. Transfusion of red blood cells stored for more than two weeks also increased the risk of death after cardiac surgery by 30% — an increase that was still apparent more than two years after surgery.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa070403 |author= Koch CG, Li L, Sessler DI, Figueroa P, Hoeltge GA, Mihaljevic T, Blackstone EH. |title= Duration of red-cell storage and complications after cardiac surgery. |journal= N Engl J Med |volume=358 | issue= 12 |pages=1229–39 |date=March 2008 |pmid= 18354101|url= http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa070403[/tpl] These results call into question current blood banking practices, and underscore the need to prevent deterioration of stored blood and improve blood donation and transfusion strategies. The group is currently conducting several studies of transfusion practices.Red Cell Storage Duration and Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.govTransfusion Strategies in Cardiac Surgery - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov Consortium transfusion research has been covered by the Boston Globe Stephen (2008-03-20).

==Other Research Interests==

Major ongoing initiatives for the consortium include acute and chronic pain management, fluid management, control of the surgical stress response, and cardiovascular outcomes. A particular interest of the group is long-term outcomes of anesthetic management. While the effects of anesthesia have traditionally been considered to dissipate within hours of surgery, there is increasing evidence that anesthetic management may alter patient outcomes weeks, months, or even years after surgery.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181a913e1 |author= Sessler DI. |title= Long-term consequences of anesthetic management (editorial). |journal= Anesthesiology |volume=111 | issue= 1 |pages=1–4 |date=July 2009 |pmid= 19512884|url= http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/Fulltext/2009/07000/Long_term_Consequences_of_Anesthetic_Management.2.aspx[/tpl]
