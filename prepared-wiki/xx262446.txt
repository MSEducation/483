==Design and development==

The RW8 was designed for the US experimental homebuilt aircraft category for single seat flying or as a US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles two-seat ultralight trainer and first flown in 1993.
The airframe is constructed entirely from wood and covered with aircraft fabric. The landing gear is of conventional configuration with bungee suspension with tricycle gear optional. The aircraft's installed power range is [tpl]convert|52|to|75|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the standard engine is the [tpl]convert|52|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 503, although the [tpl]convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] 2si 540 has also been used.
The PT2S is only offered as plans and the designer estimates it will take 500 hours to complete the aircraft.
