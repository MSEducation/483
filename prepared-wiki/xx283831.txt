Jean Taffin (1529 â€“ 1602), was a Dutch Walloon minister and theologian.

==Biography==

He was born in Tournai to a noble family and travelled to Italy before returning north. He also studied in Geneva under Calvin and Beza. From 1554-1557 he was librarian to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. He became a French-speaking pastor at Metz, Antwerp, and Heidelberg,  where he stayed to avoid the beeldenstorm and was superintendent of the Reformed church. From 1573 he returned to the Netherlands where he became court chaplain of the stadholder William the Silent, and presided over his marriage on 15 July 1575 to Charlotte de Bourbon, in the Grote Kerk, Den Briel. After William was assassinated in 1584, Taffin became pastor of the Walloon Reformed church at Amsterdam, where he died.
Today, he is best known for his book The Marks of God's Children (1585).
