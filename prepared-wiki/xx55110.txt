Squidward Tentacles is a fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. He is voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass, and first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg.
Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus who lives in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star's houses. Portrayed as being ill-tempered, pretentious, cynical, and grouchy, he strongly despises his neighbors for their constant boisterous, noisy behavior; however, the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy, for them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab. His species is an octopus according to the show creator, despite his name containing the word squid. Hillenburg made Squidward with six tentacles, believing that "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight."
Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in other media, such as trading cards, video games, plush toys and comic books. He also appears in the 2004 full-length feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and in its sequel that is scheduled for release on February 13, 2015.

==Role in SpongeBob SquarePants==

Squidward is depicted as being an ill-tempered, pretentious, cynical, and grouchy turquoise octopus. He resides in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated in between SpongeBob SquarePants's pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock.[tpl]cite episode|title=Opposite Day|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=64b|channel=Nickelodeon|airdate=September 11, 1999|credits=Writers: Chuck Klein, Jay Lender, Mr. Lawrence[/tpl] Squidward intensely despises his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and constant boisterous, noisy behavior and play, though the pair are oblivious to Squidward's animosity for them and see him as a friend.[tpl]cite episode|title=Good Neighbors|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=4|number=64b|channel=Nickelodeon|airdate=May 20, 2005|credits=Writers: Mike Bell[/tpl] Squidward lives in a never-ending state of self-pity and misery, aggravated and unhappy with the humdrum lifestyle he leads, and yearns for celebrity status, wealth, and a far more glamorous and distinguished career as a celebrated musician or painter, with a passion for art and playing the clarinet.[tpl]cite episode|title=Enchanted Tiki Dreams|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=7|number=145b|channel=Nickelodeon|airdate=June 19, 2010|credits=Writers: Aaron Springer, Sean Charmatz, Richard Pursel[/tpl] However, he is left to endure through the lowly status as a fast-food cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a position which he deeply resents, irritated both by his cheap and greedy employer Mr. Krabs and by having SpongeBob as a co-worker.[tpl]cite episode|title=Greasy Buffoons|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=7|number=130a|channel=Nickelodeon|airdate=November 27, 2009|credits=Writers: Aaron Springer, Derek Iversen[/tpl]
Squidward longs for peace and quiet, but his wishes remain unsatisfied. Squidward believes he is talented and is deserving of a higher social status. In reality, the Bikini Bottom populace does not perceive Squidward as talented in the arts at all, frequently booing him and walking out on his various performances. However, it has been shown on many occasions that Squidward may subconsciously house fondness for SpongeBob and Patrick, most notably in situations where their lives were believed to have been jeopardized, or when he has snatched an opportunity to move away, only to be agitated upon their recovery or his return.[tpl]cite episode|title=SB-129|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=14a|channel=Nickelodeon|airdate=December 31, 1999|credits=Writers: Aaron Springer, Erik Wiese, Mr. Lawrence[/tpl]

==Character==

===Creation and design===

Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art.  He planned to return to college eventually to pursue a master's degree in art.  After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ocean-institute.org/|title=Welcome to the Ocean Institute|work=ocean-institute.org|accessdate=December 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite video |people = Wilson, Thomas F.(Interviewer); Hillenburg, Stephen (Interviewee) |date = May 29, 2012 |title = Big Pop Fun #28: Stephen Hillenburg, Artist and Animator–Interview |url=http://ec.libsyn.com/p/d/9/8/d98c6fd6cc81f188/BPF28_Stephen_Hillenburg_artist_and_animator.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01c08031d1c85f7cb2&c_id=4560686 |format = mp3 |medium = Podcast|publisher = Nerdist Industries |accessdate = December 21, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6M1QBJ1BZ|archivedate=December 21, 2013[/tpl] there, he initially had the idea that would lead to the creation of SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation,[tpl]cite video | people=Hillenburg, Stephen|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Banks|2004|page=9[/tpl] and began envisioning the idea for a project that would involve a cast of anthropomorphic sea life.  Although he drew several rough sketches of the concept, it would be close to a decade before his idea would become a reality.
A few years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival, and was offered a job as a director of the series.[tpl]cite video | people=Murray, Joe|date=2003|title=The Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Neuwirth|2003|page=50[/tpl]"Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life," The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ While working on Rocko's Modern Life, Hillenburg met writer Martin Olson, who saw The Intertidal Zone comic. Olson liked the idea and suggested that Hillenburg create a TV series focused on marine animals.  Hillenburg said, "a show ... I hadn't even thought about making a show ... and it wasn't my show". It prompted him to create SpongeBob SquarePants and he said, "It was the inspiration for the show". Shortly after Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996,[tpl]cite web|url=http://joemurraystudio.com/television/rockos-modern-life/|title=Rocko's Modern Life|publisher=JoeMurrayStudio.com|accessdate=May 21, 2013[/tpl] Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.
Hillenburg took some character designs from his comic book. He designed "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" as an octopus to emphasize the large, bulbous head of the animal, as well as that of Squidward's rather large ego. He said, "octopuses have such a bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head."Hillenburg, Stephen. (March 1, 2003). The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (The Case of the Sponge "Bob") (DVD). Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon. Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles, saying that "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight." Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said that "Squidward is hard to draw—he has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get a whole lot of big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?'"[tpl]cite news | author = Waller, Vincent | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl] Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink, but retired it because "it always looks like he's pooping his pants."
Although the character is named Squidward, there is dispute over whether he is an octopus or a squid due to conflicting statements between the show creator and Nickelodeon's official website.SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season — Disc 1 (Introduction) (DVD). November 28, 2003. Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon. Hillenburg named him as such since the name Octoward, in the words of Squidward's voice actor Rodger Bumpass, "just didn't work".Hillenburg, Stephen. (March 1, 2003). The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie) (DVD). Paramount Home Entertainment/Nickelodeon. The sound of Squidward's footsteps is produced by rubbing hot water bottles. The footstep, along with the rest of the main characters', is recorded by the show's foley crew. Sound designer Jeff Hutchins said that footstep sounds "help tell which character it is and what surface they're stepping on."[tpl]cite news | author = Hutchins, Jeff | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl] The idea to have Squidward ride a recumbent bicycle was inspired by Bumpass, who personally has this type of bicycle which he rides around Burbank, California. Bumpass described it his "little inside joke".

===Voice===

Squidward's voice is provided by actor Rodger Bumpass, who voices several other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants, including the character's mother. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters.[tpl]cite news | author = Drymon, Derek | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl] Mr. Lawrence, who had worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, was Hillenburg's original choice for the role, despite the fact that he had invited him to audition for all the characters.[tpl]cite video |people = Wilson, Thomas F. (Interviewer); Lawrence, Doug (Interviewee) |date = April 2012 |title = Big Pop Fun #22: Mr. Lawrence |url=http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/8/0/b/80ba5601f7d09e93/BPF22_Mr._Lawrence.mp3?c_id=4442198&expiration=1396087344&hwt=77616525493ac25efba1ba04f5cd6efc |format = mp3 |medium = Podcast|publisher = Nerdist Industries |accessdate = December 21, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OQnV9e4n|archivedate=March 29, 2014[/tpl] Hillenburg decided instead to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton.
Squidward was "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy", said Bumpass. He said that the character "became a very interesting character to do" because of "his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became a wide spectrum of emotions".[tpl]cite web|last=Reardon|first=Samantha|title=Rodger Bumpass is Squidward Tentacles|url=http://georgiastatesignal.com/rodger-bumpass-is-squidward-tentacles/|work=The Signal (college newspaper)[tpl]![/tpl]The Signal|accessdate=March 28, 2014|date=September 8, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140328111302/http://georgiastatesignal.com/rodger-bumpass-is-squidward-tentacles/|archivedate=March 28, 2014[/tpl] Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, describes Bumpass as he records his lines in the show's recording studio, saying "I love watching Rodger ... He's right next to me". When Bumpass "goes apoplectic" as Squidward while recording, his head turns red, which Kenny suggests, "and you're afraid he's going to have an embolism."[tpl]cite news | author = Kenny, Tom | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl]
Several on the show's crew praise Bumpass for his performance and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass "brilliant" and said, "he is sort of like Squidward." Staff writer Kent Osborne said, "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it."[tpl]cite news | author = Osborne, Kent | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl] However, Bumpass said, "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that."
Squidward's voice has been compared to that of Jack Benny's: Kenny said, "To me, there's something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [tpl]sic[/tpl] Squidward." Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!, opined that Squidward "sounds a lot like Jack Benny".[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Arthur|title=Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!|publisher=Arthur Brown|year=2008|page=85|isbn=978-1-4357-3248-3|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X-oi8LiETHIC&pg=PA85&dq=SpongeBob&lr=&as_brr=3[/tpl] Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying "Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out."

==Reception==

Squidward has received positive reception from critics and fans alike. Cast member and SpongeBob's voice Tom Kenny names Squidward his favorite character on the show. He said, "He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When he tries to participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it." Staff writer Casey Alexander reflected himself to the character, saying "Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. If I knew a human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does laughter."[tpl]cite news | author = Alexander, Casey | title = The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants | work = Hogan's Alley #17 | year = 2010 | accessdate = September 21, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation[/tpl] American singer Pharrell Williams, who proclaims himself a fan of the show, said that "Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him."[tpl]cite web|last=Chang|first=Bee-Shyuan|title=Dropping in on Oscar|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/fashion/for-pharrell-williams-music-and-fashion-go-hand-in-glove.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=February 23, 2012[/tpl]
In her "Best SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes" list, Nancy Basile of About.com cited her favorite lines and scenes from the show. Her favorite Squidward quotation is "Why must every eleven minutes of my life be filled with misery?"[tpl]cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title=Best 'SpongeBob SquarePants' Episodes|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/tp/bestepisodes.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=April 25, 2014[/tpl] Bill Treadway of DVD Verdict said that Squidward is "a cross between Bert (Sesame Street), Woody Allen, and Roger Addison (the grouchy next-door neighbor on Mister Ed, but he has some heart, if you can find it." Treadway called him "the straight man for his neighbor's antics."[tpl]cite web|last=Treadway|first=Bill|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete First Season|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/spongebobseason1.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=November 10, 2003[/tpl] On a less positive note, Squidward was ranked among Common Sense Media's "10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012". Author Sierra Filucci said that the character's selfishness is his "worst offense". She called Squidward "the mean and nasty cashier at the Krusty Krab" and said that "he is nice only when he wants something".[tpl]cite web|last=Filucci|first=Sierra|title=10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/10-worst-tv-role-models-of-2012|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=October 1, 2012[/tpl]
In 2012, Bumpass was nominated at the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program category for voicing Squidward. He was the first cast member to be nominated for this type of award. However, he did not win, losing to June Foray (The Garfield Show). Bumpass said, "I have the little certificate and everything, and I'm very proud of being given that." He said that "there wasn't really a competition because one of the other nominees was June Foray and she is royalty in the animation world. ... There was no way any of the other three guys had a chance. In fact, if any of us had one, there would have been a riot in that studio." He was "happy to lose to June Foray" and "very pleased and grateful to get a nomination."

==In other media==

Squidward has been included in various SpongeBob SquarePants-related merchandise, including board games, comic books, keychains, plush toys, trading cards and video games.[ref]
In 2009, actor Charles Brunton played Squidward in the musical adaptation of the third season episode "The Sponge Who Could Fly". Brunton said, "I loved that character! It was so much fun trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage." He bought nine SpongeBob SquarePants DVDs and "acted out every single one in my bedroom" to prepare for the role. He said that "it took ages to perfect the voice and the way he used his arms."[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Charles Brunton from Love Never Dies|url=http://www.lastminutetheatretickets.com/londonwestend/interview-with-love-never-dies-star-charles-brunton/|publisher=LastMinuteTheatreTickets.com|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=May 19, 2011[/tpl] Brunton's performance and the musical itself were well received by most critics. A critic from The Public Reviews wrote, "Charles Brunton as Squidward really stole the show for us, his character was nailed to perfection, from his comic acting, voice and mannerisms this was a faultless performance."[tpl]cite web|title=Spongebob Squarepants – Liverpool Empire|url=http://www.thepublicreviews.com/spongebob-squarepants-liverpool-empire/|work=The Public Reviews|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=May 21, 2009[/tpl] In his review for The Northern Echo, Viv Hardwick said, "Charles Brunton makes a convincing Squidward".[tpl]cite news|author=Hardwick, Viv|title=Theatre critics|date=April 24, 2009|newspaper=The Northern Echo|page=25[/tpl]
In 2013, Squidward became the center of a "creepypasta" (a term describing urban legends or scary stories that have become Internet phenomena) called "Squidward's Suicide". It was an alleged lost episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, where Squidward commits suicide. It was originally uploaded to YouTube, but was immediately removed. The "episode" consists of "strange and upsetting noises [tpl]sic[/tpl] in the background" and "quick flashes of dead children and gore". Geek.com's James Plafke ranked it among "The 4 scariest, most believable stories on the internet". He said, "What makes the story so good is not that there's some kind of haunted editing machine, but that someone in real life could've edited the disturbing footage into the animation, as well as made the animation pretty easily. You shouldn't lose any sleep over it, as it is most certainly fake — stuff like a beloved children's show being spliced with footage of child gore would certainly make the news, rather than be traced to an origin on YouTube."[tpl]cite web|last=Plafke|first=James|title=The 4 scariest, most believable stories on the internet|url=http://www.geek.com/news/the-scariest-most-believable-stories-on-the-internet-1574772/|publisher=Geek.com|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=October 31, 2013[/tpl] Show writer Casey Alexander debunked the idea, saying it is "100% hoax".[tpl]cite web|last=Alexander|first=Casey|title=Twitter / _dolza_: @Tannerm0rse 100% hoax|url=https://twitter.com/_dolza_/status/449580196908118016|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=March 28, 2014|archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/6P76cK8fu|archivedate=April 26, 2014[/tpl]
