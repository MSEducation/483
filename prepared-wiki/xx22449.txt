[[17 BC]]

CATEGORIES: 17 BC

Year 17 BCE was either a common year starting on Sunday or Monday or a leap year starting on Saturday, Sunday or Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a leap year starting on Friday of the Proleptic Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Furnius and Silanus (or, less frequently, year 737 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 17 BCE for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
