==Life==

She received her Ph.D. from Cornell University and taught at the University of Illinois before coming to Hopkins in 1999.  
She specializes in Victorian literature and contemporary literary, cultural, and political theory.  Her work on the Victorian period has focused on the relation between forms of modern thought and knowledge (across both literature and the human sciences) and understandings of selfhood, social life, and ethics. 
Her most recent book, The Way We Argue Now, analyzes a number of influential theoretical debates over the past decade or so, with special attention to the forms of argument that shape work in pragmatism, feminism, cosmopolitanism, and proceduralism.  
At Hopkins, her recent graduate teaching has included courses on forms of argument in contemporary theory; Victorian internationalism; Victorian realism; and ethics and aesthetics in Victorian literature.  She has taught undergraduate courses on Jane Austen and Charlotte BrontÃ«, nineteenth-century British fiction, and Victorian poetry and nonfiction prose.
