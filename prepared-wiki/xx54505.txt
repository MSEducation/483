Germanite is a rare copper iron germanium sulfide mineral, Cu26Fe4Ge4S32.  It was first discovered in 1922, and named for its germanium content.  It is only a minor source of this important semiconductor element, which is mainly derived from the processing of the zinc sulfide mineral sphalerite.U.S. Geological Survey (2008), "Germaniumâ€”Statistics and Information", U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/germanium/  Germanite contains gallium, zinc, molybdenum, arsenic, and vanadium as impurities.
Its type locality is the Tsumeb Mine in Namibia where it occurs in a hydrothermal polymetallic ore deposit in dolostone in association with renierite, pyrite, tennantite, enargite, galena, sphalerite, digenite, bornite and 
chalcopyrite. It has also been reported from Argentina, Armenia, Bulgaria, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire), Finland, France, Greece, Japan, Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), Russia and the United States.http://www.mindat.org/min-1681.html Mindat.org
