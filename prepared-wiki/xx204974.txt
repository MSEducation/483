CATEGORIES: Fictional beings from parallel universes

As a fictional character, the Green Goblin has appeared in a number of media, from comic books to films and television series.

===1602===

In the Marvel: 1602 Pocket Universe, Norman Osborne appears as a major villain, attempting to find "the Source", which is guarded by the Natives of Roanoke Island, and utilize it to gain unimaginable power; to achieve his goal, Osborne allies with King James I of England and makes several attempts to create conflict between his fellow American colonists and the Natives. Ultimately, Osborne is captured and imprisoned in stocks after peace between the colonists and Natives resumes and the English are forced from America.Marvel 1602: New World #1-5
In Spider-Man: 1602, Osborne has been released from the stocks, and is now harbourmaster of Roanoke. When Peter Parquagh and Virginia Dare find evidence he is plotting against the natives again, he kills Virginia and exposes Peter's secret identity as The Spider. He is sentenced to be sent back to England, where capital punishment is still practiced. When the Mayflower is attacked by the pirate Wilson Fisk, Osborne's cell is hit by a cannonball. Covered in gangrenous wounds, his sentence is abandoned since he is not expected to live long enough to stand trial in England. He contacts the natural philosopher Henri Le Pym, asking to be cured in return for helping Pym acquire some of Peter's blood for his experiments.[tpl]issue|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Le Pym's attempts to cure Osborne mutate him into a winged, green-skinned creature, and he uses these powers to capture Parquagh. During his final battle with Parquagh (in which Osborne uses exploding spherical vials as projectiles in combat) he is killed by a crossbow bolt fired by Fisk's first mate, the Bull's Eye, who has also been hunting Parquagh.Spider-Man 1602 #1-5

===2099===

In the Marvel 2099 setting, the Goblin is a radical trickster who wants to prove that Spider-Man (Miguel O'Hara) is in the pay of a megacorp. He has bat-like glider-wings and a bag of "tricks", similar to the 20th century version. He also has the ability to project illusions. Spider-Man 2099 #36-41 
He is eventually unmasked, and appears to be Spider-Man's brother Gabriel O'Hara, although it is later revealed, in a retcon, that he is a shapeshifter who took Gabriel's identity. Writer Peter David, who quit the book between creating the character and the unmasking, has said that it was his intent for the Goblin to be female Catholic priest Father Jennifer, and for Gabriel to be a red herring.

===Earth X===

In the alternative future of Earth X, Norman Osborn's business ventures have completely taken over the United States. Citizens work in his businesses and shop in his stores and eat his food. Norman is the prime economic power and de facto ruler of the country, b/c the President. The terrigen mists have shaped his face into a saner version of his goblin mask.  He is partially responsible for the deaths of The Avengers as he sent them to battle a now Super Intelligent Absorbing Man.  The Enforcers and The Vulture seem to serve as his secret service. He is later used as a pawn for the Skull, until Spiders Man makes him think he's with Gwen Stacey who is really the Red Skull who shoves him out the window where his foot catches on a flag and his neck snaps similar to how Gwen died.  Unaware of the irony Skull orders his corpse be brought back up so he can push him out again just so he can make a splat sound.Earth X #0Earth X #9

===House of M===

In the Spider-Man: House of M from the 2005 Marvel comics series House of M, there are two versions of the Green Goblin. The first is Peter's wrestling friend and rival Crusher Hogan, who uses the identity as his wrestling franchise. The second is Peter Parker himself, who, feeling guilty posing as a mutant when really he was a human given powers in the usual Spider-Man fashion (radioactive spider bite), poses as the Green Goblin to reveal the information about him being a human to J. Jonah Jameson, his then publicist, and eventually the entire world.  Norman Osborn is also present in this continuity, as an industrialist whose company is bought out by Peter.Spider-Man: House of M #1-3

===Amalgam Comics===

In the Amalgam Comics community, Green Goblin was combined with DC's Two Face to create the Two Faced Goblin (Harvey Osborn).  He originally looked like the Green Goblin when in costume, but in Dark Claw Adventures #1, he was given a different design with a glider that looked like a giant coin.[tpl]issue|date=February 2013[/tpl]

===Marvel Fairy Tales===

In issue one of Spider-Man Fairy Tales (an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood) Osborn makes an appearance as one of the woodsmen in the employ of Jameson alongside Peter and Thompson.[ref]
