"Somethin' Special (Beijing Olympic Mix)" is a song by pop singer Colbie Caillat, released on July 29, 2008, for charity. The song now appears on the compilation created to give support to the American athletes participating in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, AT&T Team USA Soundtrack. A promotional music video of the song was released in August 2008.
The song was also featured in the 2009 film Bride Wars, however the version played in the film had different lyrics which suggests that it was the original mix, not the Beijing Olympic Mix. The film did not have a soundtrack so the original version remained unreleased until her second album, Breakthrough, where it appears as a bonus track on the Rhapsody edition.http://www.rhapsody.com/colbie-caillat/breakthrough
