Windows XP is a personal computer operating system produced by Microsoft as part of Windows NT family of operating systems. The operating system was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and generally released for retail sale on October 25, 2001.
Development of XP began in the late 1990s as "Neptune", an operating system built on the Windows NT kernel which was intended specifically for mainstream consumer use—an updated version of Windows 2000 was also originally planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were shelved in favor of a single OS codenamed "Whistler", which would serve as a single OS platform for both consumer and business markets. Windows XP was a major advance from the MS-DOS based versions of Windows in security, stability and efficiency[tpl]cite web | url=http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206552.html | title=The 10 top things you MUST know about Win XP | publisher=CNET Networks | work=ZDNet | date=October 25, 2001 | accessdate=July 22, 2008 | first=David | last=Coursey[/tpl] due to its use of Windows NT underpinnings. It introduced a significantly redesigned graphical user interface and was the first version of Windows to use product activation in an effort to reduce software piracy.
Upon its release, Windows XP received generally positive reviews,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] with critics noting increased performance (especially in comparison to Windows ME), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and its expanded multimedia capabilities. Despite poor initial public reception, often centred on driver support and security restrictions,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Windows XP eventually proved to be popular and widely used. It was estimated that at least 400 million copies of Windows XP were sold globally within its first five years of availability,[tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP end-of-life: Thanks for all the fish!|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-xp-end-of-life-what-you-need-to-know-1240791|work=TechRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.itworld.com/Comp/4063/060118xpsp3/pfindex.html | title=Analyst: No effect from tardy XP service pack | publisher=IDG | work=ITworld | date=January 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 5, 2011 | last=Kirk | first=Jeremy | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070317204906/http://www.itworld.com/Comp/4063/060118xpsp3/pfindex.html | archivedate=March 17, 2007[/tpl] and at least one billion copies were sold overall by April 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP finally put to sleep by Microsoft – but it will still haunt us for years to come|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/180062-windows-xp-finally-put-to-sleep-by-microsoft-but-it-will-still-haunt-us-for-years-to-come|work=ExtremeTech|publisher=Ziff Davis Media|accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl] Windows XP remained popular even after the release of newer versions, particularly due to the poorly received release of its successor Windows Vista. While Windows 7 was released as a follow-up in 2009, it only overtook XP in total market share by the end of 2011.
Sales of Windows XP licenses to OEMs ceased on June 30, 2008, but continued for netbooks until October 2010. Extended support for Windows XP ended on April 8, 2014 meaning that the operating system is now end-of-life, and new security updates or support information  will no longer be provided for free. Due to the still-widespread choice of XP (primarily attributed to the poor reception of Vista), Microsoft and others began to actively encourage remaining users to migrate to newer versions (such as 7 or 8) due to the potential security risks of continued use. The looming end of support was a cause for concern among companies and governments due to the large contingents of XP users in several market segments, including enterprise environments, and in China—where there were fears that the end of support would fuel piracy of newer Windows versions.

==Development==

===As "Neptune"===

In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products; "Odyssey", which was reportedly intended to succeed Windows 2000, and "Neptune", which was intended to succeed the MS-DOS-based Windows 98 with a Windows NT-based product designed for consumers. Based off 2000's NT 5.0 kernel, Neptune primarily focused on offering a simplified, task-based interface based around a concept known internally as "activity centers".  A number of activity centers were planned, serving as hubs for communications (i.e. email), playing music, managing or viewing photos, searching the internet, and viewing recently used content. A single build of Neptune, 5111 (which was otherwise based on, and still carried the branding of Windows 2000 in places), revealed early work on the activity center concept, with an updated user account interface and graphical login screen, common functions (such as recently used programs) being accessible from a customizable "Starting Places" page (which could be used as either a separate window, or a full-screen desktop replacement).[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-consolidates-Windows-development-efforts/2100-1040_3-236021.html | title=Microsoft consolidates Windows development efforts | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/windows/supersite-flashback-neptune | title=SuperSite Flashback: Neptune | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-the-development-of-windows-xp-reviewed | title=The Road to Gold: The development of Windows XP Reviewed | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl]
However, the project, at its current state, proved to be too ambitious. Microsoft would ultimately shelve Bill Gates' 1998 promise that Windows 98 would be the final MS-DOS based version of Windows; at the WinHEC conference on April 7, 1999, Steve Ballmer announced an updated version of 98 known as Windows Millennium. Microsoft also planned to push back Neptune in favor of an interim, but consumer-oriented NT-based OS codenamed "Asteroid". Concepts introduced by Neptune would influence future Windows products; in Windows ME, the activity center concept was used for System Restore and Help and Support (which both combined Win32 code with an interface rendered using Internet Explorer's layout engine), the hub concept would be expanded on Windows Phone, and Windows 8 would similarly use a simplified user interface running atop the existing Windows shell.[tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-95/activity-centers-a-windows-me-technology-showcase-127979 | title=Activity Centers: A Windows Me Technology Showcase | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=January 25, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/windowsme_gold.asp | title=The Road to Gold: The development of Windows Me | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | date=July 5, 2000 | accessdate=September 21, 2007 | first=Paul |last=Thurrot[/tpl]

===As "Whistler"===

In January 2000, shortly after the release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed Whistler, after Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp | title=Windows "Longhorn" FAQ | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | date=June 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 4, 2008[/tpl] The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform, further stating that "Neptune became a black hole when all the features that were cut from ME were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project". At WinHEC in April 2000, Microsoft officially announced and presented an early build of Whistler, focusing on a new modularized architecture, built-in CD burning, fast user switching, and updated versions of the digital media features introduced by ME. Windows general manager Carl Stork stated that Whistler would be released in both consumer- and business-oriented versions built atop the same architecture, and that there were plans to update the Windows interface to make it "warmer and more friendly".
In June 2000, Microsoft began the technical beta testing process; Whistler was expected to be made available in "Personal", "Professional", "Server", "Advanced Server", and "Datacenter" editions. At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also released the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an early version of a new visual styles system along with an interim theme known as "Professional" (later renamed "Watercolor"), and contained a hidden "Start page" (a full-screen page similar to Neptune's "Starting Places"), and a hidden, early version of a two-column Start menu design.[tpl]cite web | url=http://windowsitpro.com/windows-server/exclusive-whistler-technical-beta-begins | title=EXCLUSIVE: Whistler technical beta begins | publisher=Penton Media | work=Windows IT Pro | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl] Build 2257 featured further refinements to the Watercolor theme, along with the official introduction of the two-column Start menu, and the addition of an early version of Windows Firewall.

===Beta releases===

Microsoft released Whistler Beta 1, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Build 2410 in January 2001 introduced Internet Explorer 6.0 (previously branded as 5.6) and the Windows Product Activation system. Bill Gates dedicated a portion of his keynote at Consumer Electronics Show to discuss Whistler, explaining that the OS would bring "the dependability of our highest end corporate desktop, and total dependability, to the home", but also "move it in the direction of making it very consumer-oriented. Making it very friendly for the home user to use." Alongside Beta 1, it was also announced that Microsoft would prioritize the release of the consumer-oriented versions of Whistler over the server-oriented versions in order to gauge reaction, but that they would be both generally available during the second half of 2001 (Whistler Server would ultimately be delayed into 2003).[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2102-1001_3-979878.html | title=Windows Server's identity crisis | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | date=January 9, 2003 | accessdate=April 1, 2013[/tpl] Builds 2416 and 2419 added the File and Transfer Settings Wizard and began to introduce elements of the operating system's final appearance (such as its near-final Windows Setup design, and the addition of new default wallpapers, such as Bliss).[tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-two | title=The Road to Gold (Part Two) | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl]
On February 5, 2001, Microsoft officially announced that Whistler would be known as Windows XP, short for "experience". As a complement, the next version of Microsoft Office was also announced as Office XP. Microsoft stated that the name "symbolizes the rich and extended user experiences Windows and Office can offer by embracing Web services that span a broad range of devices." In a press event at EMP Museum in Seattle on February 13, 2001. Microsoft publicly unveiled the new "Luna" user interface of Windows XP. Windows XP Beta 2, build 2462a (which among other improvements, introduced the Luna style), was launched at WinHEC on March 25, 2001.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-to-christen-Windows%2C-Office-with-new-name/2009-1001_3-252047.html | title=Microsoft to christen Windows, Office with new name | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://winsupersite.com/article/product-review/the-road-to-gold-part-three | title=The Road to Gold (Part Three) | publisher=Penton Media | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl]
In April 2001, Microsoft controversially announced that XP would not integrate support for Bluetooth or USB 2.0 on launch, requiring the use of third-party drivers. Critics felt that in the case of the latter, Microsoft's decision had delivered a potential blow to the adoption of USB 2.0, as XP was to provide support for the competing, Apple-developed FireWire standard instead. A representative stated that the company had "recognized the importance of USB 2.0 as a newly emerging standard and is evaluating the best mechanism for making it available to Windows XP users after the initial release."[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-255571.html | title=Windows XP won't support USB 2.0 | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl] The builds prior to and following Release Candidate 1 (build 2505), released on July 5, 2001, and Release Candidate 2 (build 2526, released on July 27, 2001), focused on fixing bugs, acknowledging user feedback, and other final tweaks before the RTM build.

===RTM and release===

On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing. During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on XP-branded helicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general, retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, "Home" and "Professional".[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-stirs-it-up-with-Windows-XP-bash/2100-1016_3-272099.html | title=Microsoft stirs it up with Windows XP bash | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl]
In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to, in conjunction with Intel and other PC makers, spend at least US$1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-269032.html | title=Windows XP marketing tab to hit $1 billion | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 23, 2014[/tpl]

==New and updated features==

===User interface===

While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased use of alpha compositing effects, drop shadows, and "visual styles", which completely change the appearance of the operating system. The amount of effects enabled are determined by the operating system by the computer's processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added ClearType, a new subpixel rendering system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on LCD displays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306527|title=HOW TO: Use ClearType to Enhance Screen Fonts in Windows XP|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|date=October 27, 2002|work=Microsoft Support|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl] A new set of system icons were also introduced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb986055.aspx|title=New Graphical Interface: Enhance Your Programs with New Windows XP Shell Features|work=MSDN|publisher=Microsoft|date=November 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;294770|publisher=Microsoft|title=Computer Slows When You Click Multiple Icons in Windows XP|date=January 15, 2006[/tpl] The default wallpaper, Bliss, is a photo of a landscape in the Napa Valley outside Napa, California, with rolling green hills and a blue sky with stratocumulus and cirrus clouds.[tpl]cite news|url=http://spokesmanreview.com/pf.asp?date=022204&ID=s1490284|title=No view of Palouse from Windows|first=Paul|last=Turner|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|location=Spokane|date=February 22, 2004|accessdate=September 19, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lKhQRgaA|archivedate=November 16, 2009[/tpl]
The Start menu received its first major overhaul on XP, switching to a two-column layout with the ability to list pin and display frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional cascading "All Programs" menu. The taskbar can now group windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a popup menu listing the individual windows. The notification area also hides "inactive" icons by default. The taskbar can also be "locked" to prevent accidental moving or other changes. A "common tasks" list was added Windows Explorer's sidebar was updated to use a new task-based designs with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (i.e. a folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).
Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP machine without existing users having to close their programs and logging out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e. monitor, keyboard and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they regained control of the console.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/279765|title=How To Use the Fast User Switching Feature in Windows XP (Revision 1.5)|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|date=March 27, 2007|work=Microsoft Support|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl]

===Infrastructure===

In an effort to prevent software piracy, XP also introduced Windows Product Activation, which requires that each Windows license be "activated" and tied to a unique ID generated using information from the computer hardware.
Windows XP uses prefetcher to improve startup and application launch times.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/XP_kernel.mspx |title=Kernel Enhancements for Windows XP |publisher=Microsoft |work=Windows Hardware Developer Center (WHDC) |date=January 13, 2003 |accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP: Kernel Improvements Create a More Robust, Powerful, and Scalable OS|work=MSDN Magazine |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/xpkernel/default.aspx[/tpl] It also became possible to revert the installation of an updated device driver, should one not produce desirable results.[tpl]cite web|title=HOW TO: Use the Driver Roll Back Feature to Restore a Previous Version of a Device Driver in Windows XP|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=306546[/tpl]
Numerous improvements were also made to system administration tools such as Windows Installer, Windows Script Host, Disk Defragmenter, Windows Task Manager, Group Policy, CHKDSK, NTBackup, Microsoft Management Console, Shadow Copy, Registry Editor, Sysprep and WMI.[tpl]cite web|url=http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/tip/Windows-XPs-built-in-administration-tools?vgnextfmt=print|title=Windows XP's built-in administration tools|first=Serdar|last=Yegulalp|publisher=TechTarget|date=August 19, 2003|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Elucidate|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Networking and internet functionality===

Windows XP was originally bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer. New networking features were also added to XP, including Internet Connection Firewall, Internet Connection Sharing integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling, Background Intelligent Transfer Service, extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer networking, support for most DSL modems, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connections with auto configuration and roaming, TAPI 3.1, and networking over FireWire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457047.aspx|title=Windows XP Networking Features and Enhancements|publisher=Microsoft|work=Microsoft TechNet|date=August 8, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011[/tpl] Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the Internet and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help.[tpl]cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Remote Desktop|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/rdfaq.mspx[/tpl] Improvements were also made to IntelliMirror features such as Offline Files, Roaming user profiles and Folder redirection.

===Other features===

Users in British schools observed the improved ease of use and advanced capabilities[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]comparing the former to [tpl]nowraplinks|RISC OS[/tpl] and [tpl]nowraplinks|Mac OS[/tpl], and the latter to Unix.[tpl]cite news|first=Jack|last=Schofield|authorlink=Jack Schofield|title=A very good job...?|date=November 13, 2001|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/13/itforschools.schools2|work=The Guardian|accessdate=June 30, 2011|quote=The consensus feeling seems to be that XP provides the ease of use of Acorn and Apple systems, plus the solidity and advanced capabilities of Unix, while retaining most of the compatibility of Windows 95/98 and Me.|location=London[/tpl]

==Removed features==

Some of the programs and features that were part of the previous versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP. CD Player, DVD Player and Imaging for Windows are removed as Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, Windows Media Player and Windows shell take over their duties. NetBEUI and NetDDE are deprecated and are not installed by default. DLC and AppleTalk network protocols are removed. Plug-and-play–incompatible communication devices (like modems and network interface cards) are no longer supported.
Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also remove features from Windows XP but to a less noticeable extent. For instance, Program Manager and support for TCP half-open connections are removed in Service Pack 2. Energy Star logo and the address bar on taskbar are removed in Service Pack 3.

==Editions==

Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch; Home Edition, and Professional. Both editions were made available at retail as pre-loaded software on new computers, and in boxed copies. Boxed copies were sold as "Upgrade" or "Full" licenses; the "Upgrade" versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install. The "Full" version could be installed on systems without an operating system or existing version of Windows. Both versions of XP were aimed towards different markets; Home Edition is explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on Professional, such as the ability to join a Windows domain, Internet Information Services, and Multilingual User Interface. Additionally, users could not directly upgrade to XP Home Edition from Windows NT 4.0 or 2000, although users could upgrade to either variant of XP from Windows 98 or ME.[tpl]cite web|title=Differences with Windows XP Home Edition|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457127.aspx|work=TechNet|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl] Windows' software license agreement for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be "returned" to the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html | title=Dell customer gets Windows refund | publisher=IDG | work=LinuxWorld | date=November 6, 2006 | accessdate=September 13, 2008 | first=Don |last=Marti[/tpl] Despite the refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pages.citebite.com/s2u3d5wajak|title=HP must reimburse Italian PC buyer the amount paid for Microsoft software|publisher=Heise online|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cebit.de/newsanzeige_d?news=30814&tag=1190757601&source=%2Fnewsarchiv_e&noindex=|title=Ruling: Acer must refund purchase price of preinstalled software that is not being used|publisher=Cebit|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2010[/tpl]
Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types of hardware, exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software. Windows XP Media Center Edition was initially designed for high-end home theater PCs with TV tuners (marketed under the term "Media Center PC"), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an electronic program guide, and digital video recorder (DVR) support through the Windows Media Center application.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-reveals-media-XP-details/2100-1016_3-944063.html | title=Microsoft reveals media XP details | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl] Microsoft also unveiled Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, which contains additional pen input features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its Tablet PC specifications.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-launches-tablet-PC-drive/2100-1005_3-964903.html | title=Microsoft launches tablet PC drive | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl] Two different 64-bit editions of XP were made available; the first, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, was intended for IA-64 (Itanium) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in favor of AMD's x86-64 architecture (which was supported by the later Windows XP Professional x64 Edition), the Itanium version was discontinued in 2005.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft nixes Windows XP for Itanium|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/98716/Microsoft_nixes_Windows_XP_for_Itanium?taxonomyId=125|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl]
Microsoft also targeted emerging markets with the 2004 introduction of Windows XP Starter Edition, a special variant of Home Edition intended for low-cost PC's. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners (particularly in developing countries); containing heavy localization (including wallpapers and screen savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a "My Support" area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain "complex" features, and does not allow users to run more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in India and Thailand, Starter was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-xp/windows-xp-starter-edition|title=Windows XP Starter Edition|first==Paul |last=Thurrott|date=January 3, 2005|accessdate=April 12, 2008|work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton Media[/tpl] In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the FlexGo initiative, which would also target emerging markets with subsidized PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft pitches pay-as-you-go PCs|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-pitches-pay-as-you-go-PCs/2100-1003_3-6074589.html|work=CNET|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl]
As the result of unfair competition lawsuits in Europe and South Korea, which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in the PC market to favor its own software, Microsoft was forced to release special versions of XP in these markets that excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the European Commission fined Microsoft €497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft was forced to release "N" versions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own media player software. As it is sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as Dell, who offered it for a short period, along with Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Fujitsu Siemens) chose not to offer it. Consumer interest has been low, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to OEMs, and no reported sales to consumers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39131434,00.htm|publisher=Silicon.com|title=Windows XP-lite 'not value for money'|date=June 28, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/205093_msftfolo24.html | title=Europe gets 'reduced' Windows | publisher=Hearst Corporation | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date=December 24, 2004 | first1=Todd | last1=Bishop[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.redmondmag.com/news/article.asp?EditorialsID=6625|publisher=Redmondmag.com|title=European Windows Called 'Windows XP Home Edition N'|date=March 28, 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4388349.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Microsoft and EU reach agreement|date=March 28, 2005[/tpl] In December 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger.[tpl]cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051207-5702.html | title=South Korea fines Microsoft for antitrust abuses | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=Ars Technica | date=December 7, 2005 | accessdate=April 12, 2008 | first=Nate |last=Anderson[/tpl] The "K" and "KN" editions of Windows XP were released in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean, and also contain links to third-party instant messenger and media player software.

==Service packs==

Three service packs were released for Windows XP, containing various bug fixes and the addition of certain features. Each service pack is a superset of all previous service packs and patches so that only the latest service pack needs to be installed, and also includes new revisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/overview.mspx|title=Windows XP Service Pack 2 Overview|publisher=Microsoft|date=August 4, 2004|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl]

===Service Pack 1===

Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, .NET Framework support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming Media Center and Tablet PC editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of Set Program Access and Defaults, a settings page which allows users and OEMs to set default programs for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and disable access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player). This was added as part of the company's settlement in United States v. Microsoft Corp., which stated that Microsoft would allow users to "enable or remove access to each Microsoft Middleware Product or Non-Microsoft Middleware Product by displaying or removing icons, shortcuts, or menu entries on the desktop or Start menu, or anywhere else in a Windows Operating System Product where a list of icons, shortcuts, or menu entries for applications are generally displayed."[tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP SP1 Irons out the Wrinkles|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,526004,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/windows/microsoft-windows-xp-service/4505-3672_7-20039834.html | title=Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 review | publisher=CNET Networks | work=CNET | accessdate=January 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/windowsxp_sp1_preview.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206040649/http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/windowsxp_sp1_preview.asp|accessdate=September 21, 2007|archivedate=February 6, 2007|title=Windows XP Service Pack 1 preview|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|publisher=Penton Media|date=September 9, 2002[/tpl]

Also raw socket support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by zombie machines). Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security Center, an interface which provides a general overview of the system's security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates.

==Support lifecycle==

Support for Windows XP without a service pack ended on September 30, 2005.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft Product Lifecycle Search: Windows XP|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?alpha=Windows+XP|work=Microsoft Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=October 13, 2012[/tpl] Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a were retired on October 10, 2006 and Windows XP Service Pack 2 reached end of support on July 13, 2010, almost six years after its general availability.

===End of support===

On April 14, 2009, Windows XP exited mainstream support and entered the Extended Support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows XP; however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered. Extended support ended on April 8, 2014, over 12 years since the release of XP; normally Microsoft products have a support life cycle of only 10 years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Businesses-urged-to-ditch-XP/tabid/412/articleID/293539/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ|title=Businesses urged to ditch XP|date=April 9, 2013[/tpl] Beyond the final security updates released on April 8, no more security patches or support information will be provided for XP for free; "critical patches" will still be created, and made available only to customers subscribing to a paid "Custom Support" plan.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241912/Microsoft_will_craft_XP_patches_after_April_14_but_not_for_you?pageNumber=1 | title=Microsoft will craft XP patches after April '14, but not for you | publisher=IDG | work=Computerworld | date=August 26, 2013 | accessdate=December 12, 2013 | last=Keizer | first=Gregg[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP end of support in April: Three more questions answered|url=http://www.zdnet.com/windows-xp-end-of-support-in-april-three-more-questions-answered-7000025151/|work=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=March 24, 2014[/tpl] As it is a Windows component, all versions of Internet Explorer for Windows XP also became unsupported.[tpl]cite web|title=US-CERT urges XP users to dump IE|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9246877/US_CERT_urges_XP_users_to_dump_IE|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl]

Despite the approaching end of support, there have still been notable holdouts who have not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of Windows Vista, sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined due to the Great Recession and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (such as those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows).[tpl]cite web|title=Windows XP end of support: What to do next|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240181208/What-to-do-next-Windows-XP-end-of-support|work=ComputerWeekly|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215005050/http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240181208/What-to-do-next-Windows-XP-end-of-support|archivedate=December 15, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=XP - the operating system that will not die|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26432473|work=BBC News|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Microsoft says there are only 1,000 days left for Windows XP|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2093227/microsoft-days-left-windows-xp|publisher=The Inquirer|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl] Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) plan to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-069A-0 |title=Alert (TA14-069A): Microsoft Ending Support for Windows XP and Office 2003|date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=What should XP users do when Microsoft ends support?

As of January 2014, at least 49% of all computers in China still ran XP. These holdouts have been influenced by several factors; prices of genuine copies of Windows in the country are high, while Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government. The Chinese government also had concerns that the impending end of support could affect their anti-piracy initiatives with Microsoft, as users would simply pirate newer versions rather than purchasing them legally. As such, government officials formally requested that Microsoft extend the support period for XP for these reasons. While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo, Kingsoft and Tencent, will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/china-warns-of-risks-in-plan-to-retire-windows-xp/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1|title=China Warns of Risks in Plan to Retire Windows XP|last==Ramzy |first=Austin|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 24, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Reuters |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-microsoft-partners-lenovo-tencent-to-offer-xp-tech-support-in-china/1889658.html |title=Microsoft Partners Lenovo, Tencent to Offer XP Tech Support in China |publisher=Voanews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16[/tpl] Several governments, in particular the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate "Custom Support" plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government's deal lasts for a year, also covers support for Office 2003 (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost £5.5 million.[tpl]cite web|title=Government signs £5.5m Microsoft deal to extend Windows XP support|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240217389/Government-signs-55m-Microsoft-deal-to-extend-Windows-XP-support|work=ComputerWeekly|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Not dead yet: Dutch, British governments pay to keep Windows XP alive|url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/not-dead-yet-dutch-british-governments-pay-to-keep-windows-xp-alive/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl]
In January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million automated teller machines in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced IBM's OS/2 as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven to ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15.

==Reception==

On release, Windows XP received mostly positive reviews. CNET described the operating system as being "worth the hype", considering the new interface to be "spiffier" and more intuitive than previous versions, but feeling that it may "annoy" experienced users with its "hand-holding". XP's expanded multimedia support and CD burning functionality was also noted, along with its streamlined networking tools. The performance improvements of XP in comparison to 2000 and ME were also praised, along with its increased number of built-in device drivers in comparison to 2000. The software compatibility tools were also praised, although it was noted that some programs, particularly older MS-DOS software, may not work correctly on XP due to its differing architecture. Windows XP's new licensing model and product activation system was panned, considering it to be a "slightly annoying roadblock", but acknowledged Microsoft's intent for the changes.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft Windows XP - Home Edition review:|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-windows-xp-home-edition/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531181049/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3672_7-5020549-2.html|archivedate=May 31, 2007|work=CNET|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl] PC Magazine provided similar praise, although noting that a number of its online features were designed to promote Microsoft-owned services, and that aside from quicker boot times, XP's overall performance showed little difference over Windows 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft Ships Its Biggest OS Upgrade Ever—Early!|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,5772,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl]
