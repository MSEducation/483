==Environmental aspects==

There will be three large 225Â kW wind turbines, 29 meters in diameter, on the building's south facing side in order to generate electricity. These turbines will have the freedom to yaw, in order to maximize power generation. It will also be clad in 4,000 solar panels to generate additional electricity.  The tower will also reduce its overall energy consumption by 65%, and its water consumption by 40% in comparison to an equivalent building. At the building's base, a four story glass lobby will house an environmental visitor center.[tpl]cite book | first=Herbert | last=Wright | year=2008 | title=Skyscrapers - Famous buildings that reach for the sky [/tpl] It was designed by the Atkins group.
