CATEGORIES: North Dakota State University

The Yellow and The Green is the Alma Mater of North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota. The Yellow and The Green was written by a young North Dakota Agricultural College (now known as North Dakota State University) faculty member, Archibald E. Minard, in 1908.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/isern/yellow.htm |title=The Yellow and the Green |accessdate=2007-08-03 |format= |author=Tom Isern (Professor of History â€” North Dakota State University)|publisher=North Dakota State University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070702101119/http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/instruct/isern/yellow.htm  |archivedate = 2007-07-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/archives/recordsandpapers/rg11/2-2.htm |title=Archibald Ellsworth Minard Records |accessdate=2007-08-03 |format= |publisher=North Dakota State University [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Minard later took the lyrics to Dr. Clarence S. Putnam, a fellow NDAC professor, to develop a musical setting for the lyrics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/ndirs/collections/manuscripts/lit&music/CSPutnam/index.html |title=Clarence S. Putnam Records |accessdate=2007-08-03 |format= |publisher=North Dakota State University [/tpl] Minard hoped that the song would become the official song of the state of North Dakota. Instead, that designation went to another song for which Putnam composed the music, the North Dakota Hymn.
