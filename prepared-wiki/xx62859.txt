Between 1980 and 2006, the farm released approximately 30,600 turtles to the wild; because of marking placed on each animal, the released turtles have been seen throughout the Caribbean.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.boatswainsbeach.ky/_media/documents/scientific_sea-turtles.pdf|title = Cayman Islands Turtle Farm |accessdate = 2011-07-09[/tpl]
There are 4 endemic snake species on Grand Cayman and 2 invasive species. They are all non-venomous and the largest is the rarely seen invasive Corn Snake, which may grow to about 5 feet. The smallest grows to just about 6 inches and is the invasive Brahminy Blind Snake. It is also rarely seen. The most common is the endemic Cayman Racer Snake. It can grow to over 4 feet, but 3-foot specimens are much more common. These snakes tend to race away if encountered and in rare cases will rear-up in a threatening manner if cornered. They have been known to bite, but their teeth are very fine and they barely break the skin. Once captured they quickly become very docile, are easy to handle and rarely bite. They feed on lizards, frogs and juvenile iguanas. A word of warning; if you capture a Cayman Racer Snake, chances are it will excrete a foul-smelling chemical which serves as a self-defense mechanism and a deterrent to predators. If it gets on your skin, it washes off easily and is not harmful. The other 3 endemic snake species are the Cayman Ground Boa, Cayman Blind Snake and Cayman Water Snake.
