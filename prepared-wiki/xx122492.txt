When the National Cartoonists Society added a new category, Online Comic Strips, in 2011, Rosenberg was the first winner.
Rosenberg graduated from Cornell University in 1995 with a major in biology. Before working full-time as a webcomic artist, he also worked as a website design consultant. On January 19, 2003, Rosenberg married graphic designer/printmaker and fellow Cornell alum Amy Melnikoff. In August 2006, the Rosenbergs moved from their Manhattan apartment to a house in Westchester County, New York. Because he was living in Manhattan at the time, Rosenberg's early work also tended to be set predominantly in this location. Later works branched off into real and imagined locations vastly disjointed from his previous comics.

Rosenberg has occasionally appeared as a character in other webcomics, particularly as Mr. Jon Rosenberg in Jeffrey Rowland's Overcompensating. That incarnation of Rosenberg's comic alter ego apparently has jewelry in his intestinal system and was fake-killed by Dayfree Press.
