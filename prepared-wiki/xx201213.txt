The [tpl]Nihongo|Sangi Railway Hokusei Line|三岐鉄道北勢線|Sangi Tetsudō Hokusei-sen[/tpl], commonly known as the Sangi Hokusei Line, is a [tpl]RailGauge|762mm|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge railway line of the Japanese private railway company Sangi Railway, connecting Nishi-Kuwana Station (Kuwana, Mie) and Ageki Station (Inabe, Mie) in Japan.  For many years the line was owned by major railway operator Kintetsu but control was transferred to Sangi in 2003.
At Kuwana Station, a short walk from Nishi-Kuwana Station, passengers can transfer to the Kansai Main Line, the Kintetsu Nagoya Line, and the Yōrō Line.
The name Hokusei (北勢) means "northern Mie".  It is a kanji abbreviation of "north" (北) and "Ise" (伊勢).  Ise (as opposed to "Mie") is used in the name because the northern and central parts of present-day Mie Prefecture were called Ise Province during the Edo era before the modern prefecture system was established; it is common for regional companies like railways to use these old province names.

==Narrow gauge railway==

The track gauge is especially narrow. In the early 20th century many of Japan's train lines were built using this gauge however the vast majority of them were widened in the mid 20th century. Today, there are only four [tpl]RailGauge|762mm|lk=on[/tpl] gauge train lines in operation in Japan, of which the Hokusei Line is the longest. This special classification makes the Hokusei Line (as well as the other [tpl]RailGauge|762mm|lk=on[/tpl] gauge lines) popular with Japanese rail fans.
