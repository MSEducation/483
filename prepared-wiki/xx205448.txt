Earth Beams is a studio album recorded by noted jazz performers George Adams and Don Pullen as the George Adams/Don Pullen Quartet. Adams and Pullen had met through their work with composer and double-bassist Charles Mingus, who had died the year the Adams/Pullen Quartet began in 1979. According to Neil Tesser, "The participation of Dannie Richmond, Mingus's longtime drummer and protégé, only strengthened the sense that they were continuing on in Mingus's footsteps."[ref][tpl]cite book| last =Neil Tesser| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =1998| title =The Playboy Guide to Jazz| publisher =Bloomsbury| pages = 167|url =http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q=0747543771[/tpl]
