[[Arpinge]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Kent

Arpinge is a hamlet between Paddlesworth and Newington, Shepway to the west of Folkestone in Kent, England. It consists of three working farms, three now converted to residential use and a further four houses. The name probably originates from the Old English 'eorpa' (dark-skinned (person)) and 'inge' (a settlement). There is no church as it falls within the ecclesiastical parish of Newington-next-Hythe. There are no shops and the nearest pub is the 'Cat and Custard Pot' in Paddlesworth.
