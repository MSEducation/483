[[Plastic in art]]

CATEGORIES: Art materials

With the 20th century came the use of plastics in art. In the latter half of the century, plastic making technology advanced so that it was feasible for artists to start using plastic as a medium.
Artist and Filmmaker Tyler Turkle is credited with the term "Plastometry". Plastometry is used in art to describe the malleable and ubiquitous presence of plastic in our lives.[tpl]cite news|last=Beck|first=John|title=New Habitat chief artist, bureaucrat|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20120909/LIFESTYLE/120909733|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=The Press Democrat|date=September 9, 2012[/tpl] The idea of "Plastometry" is best demonstrated with Turkle's use of liquid acrylics, pouring and molding them into artistic black silhouettes on glass window panes, plasticene puddles of color that lie on the floor and rubbery curtains emblazoned with “Visa” and “MasterCard” as commentary on our national obsession with plastic. 
Art correspondent, publisher and noted critic Steven Kaplan writes, "Somewhere back in his childhood, Tyler Turkle might well have seen an ad for paint: the upended can pouring over a world globe, the northern hemisphere already thickly blanketed by a dripping mass hastily making its way to Antarctica, and the famous headline reading, "Sherwin Williams:Cover the Earth." This ad, at least, begins to suggest the formidable plasticity and volume that Turkle has discovered in his treatment of simple acrylic paint. His strategy is so obvious, so redolent of the idiot savant, that one wonders why no one has thought of it before: to laboriously pour thin sheets of acrylic paint, one layer over the other (giving each adequate time to dry before the fresh application), so that they form a flat pillow or sheet of color, which can be readily peeled off most surfaces and readhered to others.

Artist Roxy Paine created a sculpture making machine: a large metal contraption that oozed Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic on to a conveyor belt that jiggled slowly back and forth. The barely liquid plastic would pile up and solidify. After a few hours, the conveyor belt would move the pile forward and begin a new sculpture. The machine was exhibited at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in January 2001.
