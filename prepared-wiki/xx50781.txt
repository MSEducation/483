Chicago Fire Soccer Club is an American professional association football club based in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois. The team competes in Major League Soccer (MLS). The organization is named for the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, and was founded on October 8, 1997, the event's 126th anniversary. In their first league season in 1998, the Fire won the MLS Cup as well as the U.S. Open Cup (the "double"). They have also won U.S. Open Cups in 2000, 2003, and 2006; in addition to the 2003 MLS Supporters' Shield.
The Fire maintain an extensive development system, consisting of the Chicago Fire Premier (Premier Development League and Super-20 League teams), the Chicago Fire NPSL team, the Chicago Fire Development Academy, and the Chicago Fire Juniors youth organization. They also operate the Chicago Fire Foundation, the team's community-based charitable division. Toyota Park is the Fire's home stadium. The team's head coach is Frank Yallop.

==History==

===Overview===

Founded on October 8, 1997, the club was originally based at Soldier Field. Since 2006, they reside at Toyota Park at 71st and Harlem Avenue in Bridgeview. The owners of the Fire are Andell Holdings, who purchased the club in 2007. Andell Holdings director Andrew Hauptman acts as club chairman, while the director of soccer is Frank Yallop and the Chief Operating Officer is Atul Khosla. The Fire are historically most successful in the U.S. Open Cup; winning championships in 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2006.  The Fire keeps a close connection with the Chicago Sting (its predecessor team in the NASL) by holding frequent commemorative events, reunions, and wearing Sting-inspired shirts.
Many notable players have worn the Fire shirt, including U.S. internationals Chris Armas, Carlos Bocanegra, Frank Klopas, DaMarcus Beasley, Brian McBride, Tony Sanneh, Cory Gibbs, Ante Razov, Josh Wolff and Eric Wynalda. Some of the club's other notable American professional players include C.J. Brown, Jesse Marsch, Chris Rolfe, and Zach Thornton. The Fire also has a reputation for importing international talent, from established veterans like Pável Pardo, Piotr Nowak, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, Tomasz Frankowski, Lubos Kubik and Hristo Stoichkov; in addition to younger players such as Patrick Nyarko, Marco Pappa, Damani Ralph, Bakary Soumare, and Nery Castillo.

===Club foundation and initial success===

Founded in 1997 at Navy Pier, on the anniversary of the Great Fire, the Fire immediately tapped into the diverse ethnic makeup of the city. The team brought in Polish players Piotr Nowak, Jerzy Podbrozny, and Roman Kosecki; the Mexican Jorge Campos; and the Czech Lubos Kubik. While all showed their talent while playing for Chicago that first year, American players (Zach Thornton, Chris Armas, C.J. Brown) proved most integral to the Fire's continued success. Under the club's first head coach, Bob Bradley – and against all expectation – the team completed the double in its first competitive year, beating D.C. United in the 1998 MLS Cup Final, and defeating the Columbus Crew in Chicago to win the 1998 U.S. Open Cup a week later.
The team's momentum continued, reaching the 2000 MLS Cup final (losing to Kansas City) and winning the 2000 U.S. Open Cup. Internationally experienced players such as Hristo Stoitchkov joined the Fire, while young American talents such as DaMarcus Beasley developed. The Fire quickly became cemented as one of the league's preeminent teams.

===Nomadic times===

With Soldier Field undergoing massive renovations, the Fire moved to the western Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois in 2002. That same year, Bob Bradley abruptly departed the team to lead the MetroStars, from his home state of New Jersey. The Fire then selected the U.S. men's national team's top assistant, Dave Sarachan, to assume the vacant post.
Chicago qualified for the league final while also capturing the Supporters' Shield and 2003 U.S. Open Cup along the way. The team returned to Chicago and the renovated Soldier Field midway through the 2003 season.
After that season, longtime captain Piotr Nowak retired to take a position in the front office. He departed a year later to become manager of D.C. United. In this period new talent emerged, including Jamaican striker Damani Ralph. Still, stagnating performances and the building strength of the Eastern Conference made Chicago's league position ever more tenuous. In 2004, the team missed the league playoffs for the first time in their history.

===Turmoil, and a permanent home===

The 2005 season began with the unexpected dismissal of popular club president Peter Wilt by then-owners AEG, a move decried by fans, many players, and club staff.[tpl]cite web|title=Fire Fire Peter Wilt, Fans Protest|work=chicagoist.com|url=http://chicagoist.com/2005/04/19/fire_fire_peter_wilt_fans_protest_at_season_opener.php|accessdate=December 31, 2007[/tpl] This came as a shock, given his brokering of a $100m deal to build the Fire a stadium in the collar suburb of Bridgeview. He was immediately replaced by Metrostars executive John Guppy.
Competitively, the season was most notable for the blockbuster visit of Milan from Italy's Serie A, and the surprising 4–0 away defeat of D.C. United in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.
2006 arrived, and the Fire moved from Soldier Field into its new stadium in Bridgeview, on the southwest side of Chicago: Toyota Park, located at the corner of 71st Street and Harlem Avenue. In its first season, it played host to an unspectacular league campaign; but victory in the 2006 U.S. Open Cup marked a continuation of the club's successes and promise for the future.
The anxiety to win another league title continued to grow, however. Sarachan entered 2007 (his fifth season in charge) under intense pressure from fans and the administration to produce a league championship. Tension mounted further on April 3, 2007, when the Fire signed Mexico and América star Cuauhtémoc Blanco to a Designated Player contract. After a perfect three matches to open the year, they won only one of their next eight, and Sarachan was dismissed. Following a brief search, Millionarios manager Juan Carlos Osorio was named the club's third head coach.

===The Hauptman era===

More change came soon afterward. On September 6, 2007, Andell Holdings, a Los Angeles-based private investment firm controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Hauptman, acquired AEG's interests in both the Chicago Fire Soccer Club and Toyota Park. Reports estimated the purchase price to be upwards of $35 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thesportsbizblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/fire-to-be-sold-to-bronfman-family.html|title=Hauptman to Purchase Chicago Fire|publisher=Thesportsbizblog.blogspot.com|date=July 12, 2007|accessdate=December 3, 2011[/tpl]
On the field, behind Blanco and Wilman Conde, Osorio's central defender at Millionarios, the Fire went on an extended unbeaten run to close the season, easily qualifying for the playoffs but were defeated at New England in the Eastern Conference Final. On December 10, 2007, the Fire announced Osorio's resignation. He was named manager of the New York Red Bulls eight days later. Hauptman filed tampering charges with the league in protest, and the Fire were compensated by the Red Bulls with cash and draft picks.[tpl]cite web|title=The owner that won't let go|work=soccerbyives.net|url=http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/04/fire-just-wont/[/tpl]
Changes came quickly in Osorio's wake. On January 17, 2008, former Fire star Frank Klopas was named Technical Director in charge of player personnel, and longtime Fire assistant Denis Hamlett was appointed manager. While the Fire struggled at home in 2008 the team found unusual success on the road, gathering 22 out of a possible 45 away points. Momentum grew with the long-anticipated signing of Chicago native Brian McBride on a free transfer in July 2008. After disposing of the Red Bulls 5–2 in the season's final game, they decisively conquered New England in the first round of the playoffs with a 3–0 victory at home. This was Chicago's first playoff advancement over the Revolution in four consecutive seasons. But triumph only lasted for a week, as they again missed the league final with their 2–1 Eastern Conference Final loss to eventual champion Columbus.
The 2009 season saw few alterations to the previous year's roster. The story of the season was much the same, as continued poor home form offset excellent performances away from Toyota Park. This led to a second place Eastern Conference finish behind Columbus. Despite this, Real Salt Lake managed to upset the Crew in the quarterfinals, meaning Chicago would host the semifinal for the first time in six years. Chicago's nearly flawless home playoff history meant little in the end, as they lost to Salt Lake, 5–3, on penalties after 120 scoreless minutes. Shortly thereafter, manager Denis Hamlett was dismissed.[tpl]cite web|title=Fire sack Hamlett|work=fifa.com|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1139645.html[/tpl]

===A team in flux===

Leading up to 2010, Chicago hired Carlos de los Cobos as head coach, previously manager of El Salvador.[tpl]cite news|title=Monday Kickaround|work=washingtonpost.com|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2010/01/things_were_hearing_barring_la.html[/tpl] Cuauhtémoc Blanco, Chris Rolfe and Gonzalo Segares all departed. More changes came in the summer transfer window with the trade of Justin Mapp to Philadelphia, the acquisition of Mexican international striker Nery Castillo, and the trade for former Swedish international midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg. Defender Gonzalo Segares returned to the Fire, leaving Apollon Limassol after only six months away. Despite these reinforcements, the Fire failed to qualify for the playoffs for only the second time in club history. Former US international Brian McBride and club original C.J. Brown retired at season's end, followed closely by the departures of Wilman Conde, Ljungberg, and Castillo.
2011 began much in the way of 2010, with foundering performances both home and away. After nine winless matches, Carlos de los Cobos was let go on May 30, 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Fire, CLDC Part Ways|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2011/05/fire-part-ways-carlos-de-los-cobos[/tpl] Technical Director Frank Klopas was named interim head coach. Behind summer reinforcements Pavel Pardo and Sebastián Grazzini, as well as forward Dominic Oduro's 12 goals after being acquired in a trade from Houston, the Fire qualified for the US Open Cup Final (lost at Seattle) and narrowly missed making the playoffs after gaining 24 points in their last 12 league matches. After the season's conclusion, Klopas was given the permanent manager job on November 3, 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=FIRE NAMES FRANK KLOPAS HEAD COACH|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2011/11/fire-names-frank-klopas-head-coach[/tpl]
Although expectations were modest for 2012, Klopas' first full season as coach, the year saw a change in fortune for the Fire. The spring and summer months saw several new acquisitions for the club, starting with the reacquiring of Chris Rolfe from Aalborg BK.[tpl]cite web|title=Fire reacquire forward Chris Rolfe|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2012/04/fire-reacquire-forward-chris-rolfe[/tpl] Rolfe, who scored eight goals and 12 assists in the 21 games he played in 2012, would later be named the Fire's MVP.[tpl]cite web|title=Fire Announce 2012 Team Award Winners|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2012/10/fire-announce-2012-team-award-winners[/tpl] Other signings included Brazilian midfielders Alex Monteiro de Lima from the Swiss side FC Wohlen, Alvaro Fernandez from Seattle Sounders FC, forward Sherjill MacDonald from Beerschot AC of Belgium and veteran defender Arne Friedrich from VfL Wolfsburg. Although they would fall out of the U.S. Open tournament early that season, the Fire eventually compiled a 17–11–6 record, their best since 2000, and ranked as high as second in the Eastern Conference before ending the year in fourth place.[tpl]cite web|title=2012 Regular Season Standings|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/standings[/tpl] On October 31, 2012, in their first playoff appearance since 2009, the Fire lost their first-round MLS Cup playoff match-up at home against the Houston Dynamo, 2–1.[tpl]cite web|title=2013 M.L.S. Preview: Eastern Conference|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2012/10/houston-defeat-fire-2-1[/tpl]
In the 2012-2013 offseason the franchise made some moves to improve on 2012's success. The team acquired Joel Lindpere and Jeff Larentowicz and also traded Dominic Oduro for  Dilly Duka and the rights to Robbie Rogers.[tpl]cite news|title=2013 M.L.S. Preview: Eastern Conference|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/2013-m-l-s-preview-eastern-conference/ | work=The New York Times | first1=Jack|last1=Bell|first2=Andrew|last2=Das|date=February 28, 2013[/tpl] The beginning of the season saw the team struggling to score goals, resulting in a record of 2-5-1, with a goal differential of -8 through April. After two successive losses to the Union in May, and with veteran Arne Friedrich still on IR, the Fire acquired their former centerback Bakary Soumaré from Philadelphia.[tpl]cite news|title=Union trade Bakary Soumaré to Chicago Fire|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/soccer/Union_trade_Bakary_Soumare_to_Chicago_Fire.html|date=May 23, 2013|accessdate=May 23, 2013[/tpl] Also in May, semi-retired International Robbie Rogers returned to the United States and expressed an interest to play only in Southern California, at which point a deal was brokered for Rogers' rights in exchange for Chicago native Mike Magee from the Los Angeles Galaxy.[tpl]cite news|title=Magee trade for Rogers confirmed, expected to join Fire Monday|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-25/sports/chi-mike-magee-robbie-rogers-chicago-fire-20130525_1_galaxy-coach-bruce-arena-fire-roster-mls-player/ | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Jack|last=McCarthy|date=May 25, 2013[/tpl] On June 23, 2013, Friedrich, who had not played a 2012-13 game due to recurring injuries, announced his retirement from professional football.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2013/06/chicago-fire-defender-arne-friedrich-announces-retirement|title=Chicago Fire Defender Arne Friedrich Announces Retirement|publisher=chicago-fire.com|date=June 23, 2013 | accessdate = June 23, 2013[/tpl]  After starting the season 2-7-3, the additions of Soumare and Magee led to seven wins in the squad's last 10 games. The Fire were busy in the transfer window as well, adding veteran defensive midfielder Arévalo Ríos and forward Juan Luis Anangonó.http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/08/12/chicago-fire-coach-frank-klopas-raves-about-new-dp-arevalo-rios-guys-world-c After an energizing 12-6-6 finish to the season, the Fire narrowly missed the playoffs for the third time in the last four years — losing out to the Montreal Impact on goal differential. On October 30, 2013, the club announced that the president of soccer operations Javier Leon and head coach Frank Klopas had stepped down,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2013/10/chicago-fire-soccer-club-president-soccer-operations-javier-leon-and-head-coach-frank-k|title=Chicago Fire Soccer Club President of Soccer Operations Javier Leon and Head Coach Frank Klopas To Step Down|publisher=chicago-fire.com|date=October 30, 2013[/tpl] but the Fire front office had a replacement one day later.

===The Yallop Era===

On October 31, 2013 Chicago Fire named Frank Yallop as its new head coach and director of soccer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2013/10/chicago-fire-names-frank-yallop-new-head-coach-and-director-soccer|title=Chicago Fire Names Frank Yallop as New Head Coach and Director of Soccer|publisher=chicago-fire.com|date=October 31, 2013[/tpl] On December 5, 2013, Fire MVP Mike Magee became the first Fire player to win the Volkswagon MLS MVP Award — beating out Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane and Montreal Impact's Marco Di Vaio for the honor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/11/20/marco-di-vaio-robbie-keane-mike-magee-vie-volkswagen-mvp-mls-reveals-award-f|title=Marco Di Vaio, Robbie Keane & Mike Magee vie for Volkswagen MVP as MLS reveals award finalists |publisher=mlssoccer.com|date=November 20, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/news/article/2013/12/05/chicago-fire-forward-mike-magee-voted-volkswagen-mls-most-valuable-player|title=Chicago Fire forward Mike Magee voted 2013 Volkswagen MLS Most Valuable Player |publisher=mlssoccer.com|date=December 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/news/2013/12/release-chicago-fire-forward-mike-magee-wins-2013-volkswagen-mls-most-valuable-player-a|title=RELEASE: Chicago Fire Forward Mike Magee Wins 2013 Volkswagen MLS Most Valuable Player Award|publisher=chicago-fire.com|date=December 5, 2013[/tpl]  Meanwhile, Yallop was busy recruiting a new coaching staff which included "Ring of Fire" member and Chicago Fire veteran C.

==Colors and badge==

The official club colors are red and white. Over its history, the Fire have also employed navy blue, sky blue, and black as alternate colors.
The Chicago Fire logo is derived from the standard shape of a fire department's crest (also shown by the Chicago Fire Department), also known as a Florian's cross. This style was chosen by the original general manager, Peter Wilt, to establish a timeless image evocative of both classic American sports (as in the logos of the NHL Original Six) and the traditions of European soccer.
The logo features a stylized 'C' at its heart (representing Chicago), similar to the logos of the Bears and Cubs. The six points in a ring around the center allude to the six-pointed stars in the Municipal Flag of Chicago, specifically the star commemorating the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.
Nike, the Fire's original equipment supplier, intended for the team to be named the Chicago Rhythm. The Rhythm identity featured a turquoise, black and green color scheme, and a logo adorned with a cobra. Team officials ignored Nike's work, and privately developed the Fire identity with the help of Adrenalin, Inc., a well known sports-specific branding agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ussoccerplayers.typepad.com/ussoccerplayers/2008/04/sounders-alread.html|title=USSP: "Sounders Already Scoring"|publisher=Ussoccerplayers.typepad.com|date=April 10, 2008|accessdate=December 3, 2011[/tpl]
The original Fire shirts were chosen because of their resemblance to a Chicago fireman's coat, featuring broad horizontal stripes across the torso and sleeves. In the first year, the home jersey was red and white with a silver "FIRE" on the stripe; while the away shirts were white and black in the same style. The jersey has remained remarkably constant ever since, continually maintaining the same format of an all-red shirt with a white horizontal chest stripe, even though changes in equipment sponsor (from Nike, to Puma, and currently adidas). Conversely, the Fire's secondary shirts have changed much over the years from white with black, to white with navy, to white with red, to all-white style and the all-blue currently used. Third shirts have often been yellow (for the Chicago Sting, later for the partnership with Morelia. A popular light blue third shirt was worn in 2005, based on the Municipal Flag of Chicago but was discontinued during the sponsorship change to Adidas the next year.
The club and their fans make frequent use of the symbols of Chicago, as a show of civic pride. Most prominent are the six-pointed Chicago stars, but the light blue color associated with the city, the municipal device, and the city skyline appear regularly on materials produced by the club and its fans. The municipal flag of Chicago is also favored by fans of the club and often seen at the stadium, in a manner akin to the use of the flag of Catalonia for FC Barcelona fans, but without a nationalist subtext.

===Sponsorship===

==Stadium==

Chicago plays its home games at Toyota Park in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois. The soccer-specific stadium opened on June 11, 2006 and was developed at a cost of around $100 million.
For its first years in the league the Fire played at Soldier Field, the 61,500-capacity home of the Chicago Bears of the NFL and one of the main venues of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. While that stadium was undergoing a $632 million renovation, the Fire played at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville, Illinois, on the outskirts of the Chicago metropolitan area. They returned to Soldier Field toward the end of 2003, remaining there through the end of 2005.

==Club culture==

===Supporters===

There is a noteworthy fan culture for the Fire, existing from the date the club was founded, and building on an enthusiasm throughout Chicago sports. At matches, supporters and ultras groups occupy a standing area directly behind the north goal, in the Harlem End of Toyota Park. This area is referred to as Section 8, originating from the numbering of the corresponding section at Soldier Field and the American military designation of mentally unfit soldiers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Needs a reference to the fact it's called Section 8 and why.[/tpl] Section 8 Chicago, the Independent Supporters' Association for the Fire, oversees the activities of these numerous groups. While incorporating a worldwide variety of styles with a Chicago bent, groups as part of Section 8 generally fall under the ultras designation. Additionally, an associated spinoff group called "Sector Latino" congregates in Section 101 at the stadium's South end. The Section 8 Chicago ISA,[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2012[/tpl] an umbrella organization for all Fire fans, is a non-profit organization recognized by the state of Illinois.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Match atmosphere is known for organized displays of stadium-wide support, particularly for matches of prime competitive importance. Call-and-response cheering amongst the crowd is commonplace. Fans at Toyota Park for Fire matches periodically choreograph tifo presentations both to show their pride and inspire the players on the field. Toyota Park remains one of the few American environments to conduct such fan-driven presentations on a large scale.
Their official mascot is Sparky, an anthropomorphic Dalmatian dog. Sparky is usually shown wearing the club's jersey but also arrives wearing firefighter attire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/community/sparky|title=Sparky|accessdate=January 16, 2012[/tpl]

===Club system===

===Rivalries===

While the Fire have heated rivalries with a number of different MLS teams, Fire supporters of different ages will likely give different responses as to who the club's main rival is. The earliest Fire supporters would list Brimstone Cup rival FC Dallas as the Fire's nemesis, or Los Angeles Galaxy following heated playoff and cup matches with Dallas and L.A. in the league's early years.
After the Fire moved to the Eastern Conference, meetings with Dallas and LA became less frequent. Rivalries with DC United and New England Revolution were stoked following several thrilling playoff meetings. The Fire and Revolution are MLS' most frequent playoff matchup, meeting in the MLS Cup Playoffs 8 different times in 10 seasons from 2000 to 2009, splitting those encounters 4-4, with the Fire winning in 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2009. New England ended the Fire's playoff runs in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Newer rivals include Columbus Crew, who are the closest MLS team geographically to the Fire, and New York Red Bulls following the departure of former Fire head coach Juan Carlos Osorio to New York in 2007.

==Broadcasting==

During the 2012 season matches were televised locally by NBC Chicago Nonstop, channel 5.2., with eight games on Comcast SportsNet Chicago and one on WMAQ-TV. For the 2013 season, WPWR-TV will be the official television broadcast partner of the Chicago Fire with up to 23 of the Fire’s matches being shown live on My50 Chicago.  Dan P. Kelly and Kevin Egan will be the broadcast team. In 2013 matches will be simulcast on radio by WLEY-FM. The radio announcer is Oscar Guzman. Select matches are also nationally broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, UniMas, NBC Sports Network, or Univision via the league's television agreements.

===Ring of Fire===

The "Ring of Fire" was established in 2003 by Chicago Fire Soccer Club and the Chicago Fire Alumni Association as permanent tribute to honor those who have made the club proud and successful over its history. Aside from the initial member Piotr Nowak, only "Ring of Fire" members can select new inductees, and no more than one can be selected any year. Names and numbers (if applicable) are prominently displayed inside Toyota Park.
There were no inductees in 2008, 2010, or 2011. In 2008, the members voted to honor two recently deceased fans (supporter leaders Dan Parry and Brandon Kitchens) but were overruled by club Chairman Andrew Hauptman.http://www.section8chicago.com/jm3/component/option,com_myblog/show,Wrong-of-Fire.html/Itemid,96/[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] Parry and Kitchens were later made members of the Wall of Honor, a special recognition for Fire fans. In addition to Parry and Kitchens, the late Fire fans Euan McLean and Al Hack have been inducted into the Wall of Honor as of 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Wall of Honor|work=Chicago Fire SC|url=http://www.chicago-fire.com/club/history/wall-of-honor|accessdate=September 30, 2012[/tpl] C.J.
