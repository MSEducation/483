The reception in Asia was similarly positive. Given its small budget, the film's release in China was a strong 7.7 million RMB box office for the opening weekend, particularly in light of the film's competition, the highly publicized The Founding of a Republic. Cow was also nominated in seven categories for Taiwan's 46th Golden Horse Film Awards, including Best Director.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/territories/asia-pacific/like-a-dream-no-puedo-lead-golden-horse-race/5006527.article| author = Screen Daily Staff| title= Like A Dream, No Puedo lead Golden Horse race |publisher = Screen Daily |date =2009-10-07 | accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] The film would go on to win Best Actor for Huang Bo and Best Adapted Screenplay for Guan Hu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldenhorse.org.tw/gh_tc/gh/gh-e-5.aspx|title= Nominees & Winners | publisher = Taiwan Golden Horse Awards | accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Style==

Despite its seemingly simple story, Guan Hu's presentation of Cow has been described as both "hyper-realistic and surreal" and "magical-realist" by critics, particularly in its use of a non-linear narrative structure.The film also uses personal point of view,like making the character hold a small hidden camera while taking in some scenes.
