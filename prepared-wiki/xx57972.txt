==History==

===1980s===

Horizon Air was formed in May 1981 by Milt Kuolt, and started operations on September 1, 1981 with three Fairchild F-27 aircraft.Endicott 2001, p. 32  Its headquarters were in an area that is now within SeaTac, Washington."World Airline Directory." Flight International. March 31, 1984. 844.
Horizon Air's first route was from Yakima to Seattle, and one week later, Pasco to Seattle.Endicott 2001, p. 52 The general offices of Horizon Air were operated out of an old house behind Sea-Tac airport. Horizon acquired Air Oregon on June 17, 1982, after both airlines were losing hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly, in order to consolidate and reduce their operating deficit.Endicott 2001, pg. 119-125 Horizon agreed to purchase Transwestern Airlines of Utah in September 1983, once again to try to reduce operating deficit of the airline.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?idf=Ma8SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2623,1012698&dq=transwestern+airlines|title=Horizon buys Utah airline|last=Associated Press|date=1983-09-13|work=Spokane Chronicle|publisher=Google News Archives|accessdate=2009-09-15[/tpl] A single Fokker F28, purchased in July 1984 from an African carrier, was the first jet owned by Horizon Air; however their first jet was a wet leased Douglas DC-9.Endicott 2001, p. 141 Additional Fokker 28s were leased from US Air during the mid-1990s.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

In 1988 Horizon signed a codeshare agreement with Northwest Airlines.  In 1989, Horizon became an international carrier when it began service to Vancouver, BC and Victoria, BC in May of that year using both Dash-8-100s and Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner.

===1990s===

Horizon was the launch customer for the Dornier 328 turboprop, intending to replace the Fairchild Metroliners with this new aircraft which promised jetliner speed and comfort.[tpl]citation needed|date+=April 2011|date=April 2011[/tpl] The second Dornier 328 prototype was painted in Horizon colors.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]  Twelve were delivered between November 1993 and November 1995, but they were quickly phased out in 1997 in favor of fleet standardization around the Dash 8.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

===2000s===

In the spring of 2007, Horizon launched service from Los Angeles and Seattle to Santa Rosa, California to take advantage of the burgeoning wine and tourism industry. This was a significant coup [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] for the Sonoma County region which had not had regularly scheduled air service in almost six years. The new routes proved so popular that in the fall of 2007, Horizon commenced non stop service from Portland, OR to Santa Rosa, and expanded the schedule for non stop flights between Los Angeles and Santa Rosa. It is wholly owned by the Alaska Air Group and has 4,040 employees (at March 2007).[tpl]cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= Flight International | page= 91 | date= 2007-04-03[/tpl]

===Fleet history===

Aircraft that have been in service with Horizon Air in the past are (in alphabetical order):
On May 31, 2011, Horizon Air phased out the last of its CRJ-700 planes and now operates only the Q400.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.atwonline.com/news/story.html?storyID=13207|title=ATW Daily News|date=2008-07-01|publisher=Air Transport World|accessdate=2008-10-13[/tpl] In January 2007, the Q200s were removed from Horizon Air service and were dry leased to CommutAir.[tpl]cite press release| title = CommutAir/Continental Connection concludes transaction for larger aircraft| publisher = CommutAir| date =2006-09-12| url = http://www.commutair.com/PressReleases/PressRelease20060912-Q200.pdf |format=PDF|title=Dash 8 acquisition| accessdate = 2007-02-10 [/tpl]

===Livery===

At the start of the carrier, Horizon had a painted sunrise with a small beach with capitalized words saying "Horizon". Until recently, the current Horizon Air livery was very similar to its parent, Alaska Airlines, except for a dark red (rather than blue) cheatline, and the tail includes a stylized sun and sunset logo, rather than an Eskimo. Eleven Q400s are currently painted in special liveries. Some Dash 8-100's and -200's (no longer in service with Horizon Air) had names of Horizon destinations preceded by "Great City of" or "Great Cities of" printed on the front of the airplane.  The first Dash 8-100, N811PH was dedicated as the "Great Cities of Seattle/Tacoma" and the second airplane, N812PH was the "Great City of Portland".  N824PH was dedicated as the "Great Cities of Pullman/Moscow" on one side and the "Great Cities of Moscow/Pullman" on the other side. N363PH (Dash-8-Q200) was the first airplane to incorporate the "deep bing cherry red" on the underside of the engine nacelle.  This became the standard for Horizon's brand liverey as well as the current Alaska Airlines livery.  Prior to this change the underside of the nacelle was painted "Horizon White". 
On January 25, 2011 Horizon Air announced it was retiring its public brand and adopted the trademark Eskimo of its sister company, Alaska Airlines, on its fleet.  As part of the brand change, Horizon's Bombardier Q400 fleet will be repainted with a new paint scheme prominently featuring "Alaska" across the fuselage and the Eskimo on the tail. The plane will continue to include the Horizon logo on the sides of the aircraft, which will now appear in Alaska's dark blue color.

====Special liveries====

Ten Q400s are painted in special liveries: 
Many of the airline's other special liveries feature the colors and logos of universities located on the West Coast.Horizon Air to add more college logos to planes Puget Sound Business Journal  These include:
In addition, two aircraft were in the "Comfortably Greener" scheme to highlight the fuel-saving attributes of the Q400 over regional jets. First N439QX, then N438QX were painted in this scheme;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/Newsroom/QXNews/QXstories/QX_20091117_081506.asp|title=Horizon Air Unveils 'Comfortably Greener' Q400 Livery|date=2009-11-17|publisher=Horizon Air|accessdate=2010-01-01[/tpl] together, these two planes were casually referred to as "Shrek" and "Fiona".[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The aircraft were later repainted into the airline's standard Alaska/Horizon livery introduced in 2011.
