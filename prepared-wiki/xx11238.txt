Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game usually played by two people, where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The "rock" beats scissors, the "scissors" beat paper and the "paper" beats rock; if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied. Other names for the game in the English-speaking world include roshambo, Paper-Scissors-Stone, ick-ack-ock and other orderings of the three items.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rpschamps.com/templates/j15_rps/images/propaganda/faq/game-basics/|title=Game Basics|accessdate=2009-12-05[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/03/16/BA251812.DTL |title=Ready, set ...

The game is often used as a choosing method in a way similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock-paper-scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.[tpl]cite book|last=Fisher|first=Len|title=Rock, paper, scissors: game theory in everyday life|year=2008|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780786726936|page=94[/tpl]

==Game play==

The players usually count aloud to four, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock Paper Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"), each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. On the fourth count saying "says" or "and", and on the fifth count (saying, "Shoot!" or "Go!") or on the third count (saying, "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), the players change their hands into one of three gestures, which they then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only three counts before throwing their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing." The gestures are (in the three gesture version):
The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent. Gestures are resolved as follows:
If both players choose the same gesture, the game is tied and the players throw again. The game is sometimes played as "best of three".

==History==

===Asian origin===

The first known mention of the game was in the book [tpl]ill|zh|Wuzazu|五杂组[/tpl] ([tpl]zh |t=五杂组 |s=五杂俎[/tpl]) by the Chinese Ming Dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi (谢肇淛; fl. ca. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD).[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=Introduction to the game industry|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-168743-1|page=535|coauthors=Sward, Jennifer[/tpl] In the book, the game was called shoushiling (手势令; lit "hand command"). Li Rihua's (李日华) book Note of Liuyanzhai (六砚斋笔记) also reveals this game, calling it shoushiling (手势令), huozhitou (豁指头), or huoquan (豁拳).
Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to "sansukumi-ken" (三竦み拳), meaning "ken" (拳) fist games with a three-way 三 (san) deadlock 竦み (sukumi), in the sense that A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A.[tpl]cite journal|last=Linhart|first=Sepp |title=Some Thoughts on the Ken Game in Japan: From the Viewpoint of Comparative Civilization Studies| journal=Senri Ethnological Studies| year=1995| volume=40| pages=101–124 | id=[tpl]hdl|10502/750[/tpl] [/tpl] The games originated in China before being imported to Japan and subsequently becoming popular. The earliest Japanese "sansukumi-ken" game was known as "mushi-ken" (虫拳), which was imported directly from China.[tpl]cite book|last=Linhart|first=Sepp|title=Ceremony and Ritual in Japan|year=1995|publisher=Routledge| location=London| isbn=9780415116633| chapter=Rituality in the ken game|pages=38–41[/tpl] In "Mushi-ken" the "frog" (represented by the thumb) is superseded by the "slug" (represented by the little finger), which, in turn is superseded by the "snake" (represented by the index finger), which is superseded by the "frog". Although this game was imported from China the Japanese version differs in the animals represented. In adopting the game, the original Chinese characters for the poisonous centipede (蜈蜙) were apparently confused with the characters for the "slug" (蛞蝓). Today, the best-known "sansukumi-ken" is called "jan-ken", which is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Sosnoski|first=Daniel|title=Introduction to Japanese culture|year=2001| publisher=Tuttle| location=Rutland| isbn=9780804820561|pages=44[/tpl] "Jan-ken" uses the rock, paper, and scissors signs and is the game that the modern version of rock-paper-scissors derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper, and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th century, between the Edo and Meiji periods.[tpl]cite book|last=Linhart|first=Sepp|title=Ken no bunkashi|year=1998|publisher=shoten Kadokawa|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-04-702103-2[/tpl]
By the early 20th century, rock-paper-scissors had spread beyond Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west.[tpl]cite book|last=Ogawa|first=Dennis M.|title=Jan Ken Po: The World of Hawaii's Japanese Americans|year=1978|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Hawaii[/tpl] Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors:[tpl]cite book|last=長田須磨・須山名保子共編|title=『奄美方言分類辞典』上巻|year=1977.4|publisher=Kasama shoin|location=Tokyo |asin=B000J8V5WU |asin-tld=co.jp[/tpl] elsewhere in Asia the open-palm gesture represents "cloth" rather than "paper".In Korea the name of the game, Kai Bai Bo, or Kawi Bawi Bo, translates as "scissors, rock, cloth". http://my-seoul-searching.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/kai-bai-bo.html The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style.

===Spread beyond Asia===

The game seems to have arrived in Europe in the early 20th century and to have become popular by the late 1920s.  In Britain in 1924 it was described in a letter to a newspaper as a hand game, possibly of Mediterranean origin, called "zhot".After the Rome correspondent of a British paper described the traditional Italian hand-game of morra, which has some similarities to rock-paper-scissors, a brief correspondence began on the subject.  One contributor described a game he had seen played in Mediterranean ports, called 'zot' or 'zhot', which was clearly identical with the modern "Rock-paper-scissors":'In this game the closed fist represents a stone, the open hand with fingers outstretched paper, and the closed fist with two fingers outstretched scissors...The players stand facing one another, and commence playing simultaneously by raising and lowering the right arm three times rapidly, coming to rest with the fist in any of the three above-mentioned positions. If you keep your fist closed and your opponent flings open his hand then you lose, as paper wraps up stones, and so on.' [tpl]cite journal|title=The Times|date=1 March 1924|page=15[/tpl] Letter to the editor, from Paymaster Lieutenant G.L.P. Garwood, R.N.
A reader then wrote in to say that the game "zhot" referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Times|date=6 March 1924|page=8[/tpl]: Letter to the editor, from Miss F.C.Pringle  Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of a popular thriller with the title Scissors Cut Paper,Gerard Fairlie, Scissors Cuts Paper, Hodder and Stoughton, (1927) followed by Stone Blunts Scissors(1929), suggests it quickly became popular.
In 1927 a children's magazine in France described it in detail,[tpl]cite journal|title=La Vie au patronage|date=January 1927|page=73[/tpl]: "Jeux actifs et mi-actifs pouvant être joués en classe." referring to it as a "jeu Japonais" ("Japanese game"). Its French name,  "Chi-fou-mi", is based on the Japanese words for "one, two, three" ("hi, fu, mi").
A New York Times article of 1932 on the Tokyo rush hour describes the rules of the game for the benefit of American readers, suggesting it was not at that time widely known in the U.S.A.New York Times, May 22, 1932  - The New York Times Magazine, article by Marion May Dilts: "COMMUTING WITH TOKYO'S SUBURBANITES; Their Morning Ritual Is Characteristically Japanese, but In Their Mode of Travel There Is Western Technique"

==Strategies==

It is impossible to gain an advantage over a truly random opponent. However, by exploiting the weaknesses of nonrandom opponents, it is possible to gain a significant advantage.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27228416 |title=How to win at rock-paper-scissors |first=James |last=Morgan |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014[/tpl] Indeed, human players tend to be nonrandom.[tpl]cite news|title=Rock-Paper-Scissors: You vs. the Computer|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html|author=Dance, Gabriel and Jackson, Tom|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=2010-10-07|work=The New York Times[/tpl] As such, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock-paper-scissors.[tpl]cite web|title=Rock Paper Scissors Programming Competition|url=http://www.rpscontest.com|author=Knoll, Byron|accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=First International RoShamBo Programming Competition|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsb-results1.html|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=1999-10-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Second International RoShamBo Programming Competition|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=2001-03-20[/tpl]
In tournament play, some players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent. During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement.Steve Vockrodt, "Student rivals throw down at rock, paper, scissors tournament", Lawrence Journal-World, 8 April 2007.

===Algorithms===

As a consequence of rock-paper-scissors programming contests, many strong algorithms have emerged. For example, Iocaine Powder, which won the First International RoShamBo Programming Competition in 1999, uses a heuristically designed compilation of strategies.[tpl]cite web|title=Iocaine Powder Explained|url=http://www.ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html|author=Egnor, Dan|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=1999-10-01[/tpl] For each strategy it employs, it also has six metastrategies which defeat second-guessing, triple-guessing, as well as second-guessing the opponent, and so on. The optimal strategy or metastrategy is chosen based on past performance. The main strategies it employs are history matching, frequency analysis, and random guessing. Its strongest strategy, history matching, searches for a sequence in the past that matches the last few moves in order to predict the next move of the algorithm. In frequency analysis, the program simply identifies the most frequently played move. The random guess is a fallback method that is used to prevent a devastating loss in the event that the other strategies fail. More than ten years later, the top performing strategies on an ongoing rock-paper-scissors programming competition similarly use metastrategies.[tpl]cite web|title=Rock Paper Scissors Programming Competition entry: DNA werfer 5 L500|url=http://www.rpscontest.com/entry/109010|author=dllu|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=2011-06-14[/tpl] However, there have been some innovations, such as using multiple history matching schemes that each match a different aspect of the history — for example, the opponent's moves, the program's own moves, or a combination of both. There have also been other algorithms based on Markov chains.[tpl]cite web|title=Rock Paper Scissors Programming Competition entry: sixth-order markov chain|url=http://www.rpscontest.com/entry/34014|author=rfw|accessdate=2011-06-15|date=2011-05-22[/tpl]

===American case===

In 2006, American federal judge Gregory Presnell from the Middle District of Florida ordered opposing sides in a lengthy court case to settle a trivial (but lengthily debated) point over the appropriate place for a deposition using the game of rock-paper-scissors.[tpl]cite news | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003052251_game10.html | title = Exasperated judge resorts to child's game | agency = Associated Press | date = 2006-06-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-20 | work=The Seattle Times[/tpl]  The ruling in Avista Management v.

===Auction house rock-paper-scissors match===

When Takashi Hashiyama, CEO of a Japanese television equipment manufacturer, decided to auction off the collection of impressionist paintings owned by his corporation, including works by Cézanne, Picasso, and van Gogh, he contacted two leading auction houses, Christie's International and Sotheby's Holdings, seeking their proposals on how they would bring the collection to the market as well as how they would maximize the profits from the sale. Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to get Hashiyama's business. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included Cézanne's Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan, worth $12–16 million.
The houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock-paper-scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that "it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good".
The auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie's went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of the international director of Christie's Impressionist and Modern Art Department Nicholas Maclean, who suggested "scissors" because "Everybody expects you to choose 'rock'." Sotheby's said that they treated it as a game of chance and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with "paper".
Christie's won the match and sold the $20 million collection, with millions of dollars of commission for the auction house.

===Rock-paper-scissors in video games===

In many real-time strategy, first-person shooter, and role-playing video games, it is common for a group of possible weapons or unit types to interact in a rock-paper-scissors style, where each selection is strong against a particular choice, but weak against another, emulating the cycles in real world warfare (such as cavalry being strong against archers, archers being strong against pikemen, and pikemen being strong against cavalry[tpl]cite book|last=Egenfeldt-Nielsen|first=Simon|title=Understanding video games: the essential introduction|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-415-97721-5|page=103|coauthors=Jonas Heide Smith, Susana Pajares Tosca[/tpl]). Such game mechanics can make a game somewhat self-balancing, and prevent gameplay from being overwhelmed by a single dominant strategy.
Many card-based video games in Japan use the rock-paper-scissors system as their core fighting system, with the winner of each round being able to carry out their designated attack. Other games use simple variants of rock-paper-scissors as subgames.

Kirkup, Jr. demonstrated that these antibiotics, bacterioicins, were active as Escherichia coli compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock-paper-scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kirkup|first=Benjamin C.|coauthors=Riley, Margaret A.|title=Antibiotic-mediated antagonism leads to a bacterial game of rock–paper–scissors in vivo|journal=Nature|date=25 March 2004|volume=428|issue=6981|pages=412–414|doi=10.1038/nature02429|pmid=15042087[/tpl]

UK Champions Team GB (Andrew Bladon, Jamie Burland, Tom Wilkinson and Stephen Preston) went in as overwhelming favorites, but after a "domestic incident" team captain and UK Team Champion Joe Kenny was forced to pull out, allowing Stephen Preston to fill his gloves. Great Britain came a respectable third to achieve the Bronze Medal, while the crowd favorite Vatican City got the Silver and Lapland A took the prestigious Gold Medal. British team captain Tom Wilkinson commented "after a 4-0 whitewash of hot favorites Vatican City we thought we had it. A simple lapse of concentration lost it for us, but we are happy with our bronze medal. We'll come back from this and look to take the title back again next year. The support was immense, and we are thankful of everyone who came out to support us".[ref]

==Variations==

Players have developed numerous cultural and personal variations on the game, from simply playing the same game with different objects, to expanding into more weapons and rules.
In Korea, a two-player upgraded version exists by the name muk-jji-ppa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hancinema.net/play-muk-zzi-ppa-the-upgraded-rock-paper-scissors-30907.html|title=Play muk-zzi-ppa! The upgraded rock-paper-scissors|date=2011-06-25|publisher=Hancinema|accessdate=2014-02-06[/tpl]
In Japan, a "strip-poker" variant of Rock-paper-scissors is known as 野球拳 (Yakyuken). The loser of each round removes an article of clothing. The game is a minor part of porn culture in Japan, and other Asian countries after the influence of TV variety shows and Soft On Demand.
In the Philippines, the game is called jak-en-poy, from one of the Japanese names of the game, transliterated as jan-ken-pon.  In a longer version of the game, a four-line song is sung, with hand gestures displayed at the end of each line: "Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Sino'ng matalo, / siya'ng unggoy!" ("Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Whoever loses is the monkey!")  The person with the most wins at the end of the song, wins the game.
In the Malaysian version of the game, "scissors" is replaced by "bird," represented with the finger tips of five fingers brought together to form a beak.  The open palm represents water.  Bird beats water (by drinking it); stone beats bird (by hitting it); and stone loses to water (because it sinks in it).
Singapore also has a related hand-game called "ji gu pa," where "ji" refers to the bird gesture, "gu" refers to the stone gesture, and "pa" refers to the water gesture.  The game is played by two players using both hands.  At the same time, they both say, ji gu pa!" At "pa!" they both show two open-palmed hands.  One player then changes his hand gestures while calling his new combination out (e.g., "pa gu!").  At the same time, the other player changes his hand gestures as well.  If one of his hand gestures is the same as the other one, that hand is "out" and he puts it behind his back; he is no longer able to play that hand for the rest of the round.  The players take turns in this fashion, until one player loses by having both hands sent "out."  "Ji gu pa" is most likely a transcription of the Japanese names for the different hand gestures in the original jan-ken game, "choki" (scissors), "guu" (rock) and "paa" (paper).
Using the same tripartite division, there is a full-body variation in lieu of the hand signs called "Bear, Hunter, Ninja".http://fortheloveofplay.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/after-another-short-break-not-much-equipment-games-returns-bear-hunter-ninja/ In this iteration the participants stand back-to-back and at the count of three (or ro-sham-bo as is traditional) turn around facing each other using their arms evoking one of the totems.http://seanthorenson.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/ninja-hunter-bear/ The players' choices break down as: Hunter shoots bear; Bear eats ninja; Ninja kills hunter.http://www.pigsdontfly.com/2008/04/bear-hunter-ninja.html The game was popularized with a FedEx commercialhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhFbbq0zpHY FedEx Bear, Hunter, Ninja Commercial where warehouse employees had too much free time on their hands.

===Additional weapons===

As long as the number of moves is an odd number and that each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combination of moves will function as a game. For example, 5-, 7-, 9-, 11-, 15-, 25-, and 101-weapon versions exist.[tpl]cite web | title = RPSx | url = http://www.umop.com/rps.htm [/tpl]  Adding new gestures has the effect of reducing the odds of a tie, while increasing the complexity of the game. The probability of a tie in an odd-number-of-weapons game can be calculated based on the number of weapons n as 1/n, so the probability of a tie is 1/3 in RPS, 1/5 in RPSLS and 1/101 in RPS101.
Similarly, the French game "pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits" (stone, paper, scissors, well) is unbalanced; both the rock and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both rock and well. This means two "weapons", well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the other two weapons each defeats only one of the other three choices. The well is made by forming a circle with the thumb and index finger to show the opening of a stone well; the bull is made by making a fist but extending the little finger and index finger to show the bull's horns. In theory, "unbalanced" games are less random but more psychological, more closely resembling real world conflicts. However, games of this sort[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2013[/tpl] are popular more for novelty than for exploring such ideas.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]  This version is also played in some areas of Germany; it often adds "the bull" (which drinks the well empty, eats the paper, but gets stabbed by the scissors, and is crushed by the rock)[tpl]elucidate|date=July 2013[/tpl].

One popular five-weapon expansion is "Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock", invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla,[tpl]cite web | title = Original Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard Page | url = http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html | author = Sam Kass | accessdate = 2009-03-11 [/tpl] which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproven by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article of The Times[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article1080425.ece | title = ... and paper scissors | publisher = The Times Online | date = 11 June 2005 | accessdate = 2009-06-09 | location=London[/tpl] and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008.
The majority of such proposed generalizations are isomorphic to a simple game of modulo arithmetic, where half the differences are wins for player one.  For instance, rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock may be modeled as a game in which each player picks a number from one to five. Subtract the number chosen by player two from the number chosen by player one, and then take the modulo 5 of the result. Player one is the victor if the difference is one or two, and player two is the victor if the difference is three or four. If the difference is zero, the game is a tie.
Alternatively, the rankings in rock-paper-scissors-spock-lizard (note the different order of the last two moves) may be modelled by a comparison of the parity of the two choices. If the it is the same (two odd-numbered moves or two even-numbered ones) then the higher number wins, while if they are different (one odd and one even) the lower wins. Using this algorithm, additional moves can easily be added two at a time while keeping the game balanced:
