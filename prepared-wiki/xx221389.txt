Abu Dhabi houses federal government offices, is the seat of the United Arab Emirates Government, home to the Abu Dhabi Emiri Family and the President of the UAE, who is from this family. Abu Dhabi has grown to be a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed Abu Dhabi to a larger and advanced metropolis. Today the city is the country's center of political and industrial activities, and a major cultural and commercial centre, due to its position as the capital. Abu Dhabi alone generated 56.7% of the GDP of the United Arab Emirates in 2008.Gulfnews: Dubai contributes more than 30% of the UAE economy. Archive.gulfnews.com (16 June 2009).

==History==

===Early civilizations===

Abu Dhabi is full of archeological evidence that points to civilizations, such as the Umm an-Nar Culture, having been located there from the third millennium BC. Settlements were also found further outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi but closer to the modern city of Al Ain. There is evidence of civilizations around the mountain of Hafeet (Jebel Hafeet). This location is very strategic because it is the UAE’s second tallest mountain, so it would have great visibility. It also contains a lot of moisture in its springs and lakes, which means that there would have been more moisture thousands of years ago.[tpl]cite book|last=Potts|first=Daniel|title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates|year=2003|publisher=Trident Press[/tpl]

===Origin of the name Abu Dhabi===

The origin of the name "Abu Dhabi" is uncertain. Meaning "Father of Deer", when literally translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, assistant under-secretary for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, "The area had a lot of dhibaa (plural), and was nicknamed after that." An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer (deer - singular) and was named the "father" of the animal. Abu Dhabi's original name was Milh "salt", possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient salt marshes that surround the city. Some Bedouins called the city Umm Dhabi (mother of deer), while British records refer to the place as Abu Dhabi. According to some historical accounts, the name Abu Dhabi was first used more than 300 years ago. The first word of Abu Dhabi is pronounced "Bu" by inhabitants on the city's western coast. In the eastern part of the city, the pronunciation is "Abu".

===Origins of the Al Nahyan family===

The Bani Yas bedouin were originally centered on the Liwa Oasis. This tribe was the most significant in the area, having over 20 subsections. In 1793, the Al Bu Falah subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi on the coast of the Persian Gulf due to the discovery of fresh water there. One family within this section was the Al Nahyan family. This family makes up the rulers of Abu Dhabi today.[tpl]cite web|title=Bani Yas|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae|work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum|accessdate=13 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110430085200/http://sheikhmohammed.co.ae/| archivedate= 30 April 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Pearl trade===

Abu Dhabi worked in the pearl business and traded with others. According to a source about pearling, the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no oxygen tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters.[tpl]cite book|last=Trench|first=Richard|title=Arab Gulf Cities|year=1995|publisher=Archive International Group|location=Oxford[/tpl] The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received a portion of the season’s earnings.[tpl]cite web|title=Pearl Diving|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae|work=His Highness Sheikh Maktoum|accessdate=13 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110430085200/http://sheikhmohammed.co.ae/| archivedate= 30 April 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Trucial coast===

In the 19th century, as a result of treaties (known as "truces" which gave the coast its name) entered into between Great Britain and the sheikhs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, Britain became the predominant influence in the area.Trucial Gulf Sheikdoms and Great Britain The main purpose of British interest was to protect the trade route to India from pirates, hence the earlier name for the area, the "Pirate Coast". After piracy was suppressed other considerations came into play, such as a strategic need of the British to exclude other powers from the region. Following their withdrawal from India in 1947, the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew.

===First oil discoveries===

In the 1930s, as the pearl trade declined, interest grew in the oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company, entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan al Nahyan, to explore for oil. This was followed by a seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of BP, obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total). In 1958, using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise, oil was struck in the Umm Shaif field at a depth of about [tpl]convert|8,755|ft|m[/tpl]. This was followed in 1959 by PDTC’s onshore discovery well at Murban No.3.Morton,Michael Quentin, "The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries", GEO Expro article, issue 3, 2011.GEO ExPro - The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries
In 1962, the company discovered the Bu Hasa field and ADMA followed in 1965 with the discovery of the Zakum offshore field. Today, in addition to the oil fields mentioned, the main producing fields onshore are Asab, Sahil and Shah, and offshore are al-Bunduq, and Abu al-Bukhoosh.

==Geography and climate==

The city of Abu Dhabi is on the northeastern part of the Persian Gulf in the Arabian Peninsula. It is on an island less than [tpl]convert|250|m|-1[/tpl] from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Mussafah Bridges. A third, Sheikh Zayed Bridge, designed by Zaha Hadid, opened in late 2010. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to Saadiyat Island by a five-lane motorway bridge. Al-Mafraq bridge connects the city to Reem Island and was completed in early 2011. This is a multilayer interchange bridge and it has 27 lanes which allow roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges of the project, the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in.[tpl]cite web|title=Abu Dhabi Municipality [tpl]![/tpl] Media Center |url=http://www.adm.gov.ae|work=Municipality of Abu Dhabi City|accessdate=7 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110202175555/http://www.adm.gov.ae/| archivedate= 2 February 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Most of Abu Dhabi city is located on the island itself, but it has many suburbs on the mainland, for example: Khalifa City A, B, and C;http://www.iscadkc-sabis.net Khalifa City Al Raha Beach;Al Raha Beach Resort Al Bahia City A, B, and C; Al Shahama; Al Rahba; Between Two Bridges; Baniyas; and Mussafah Residential.
The Emirate of Abu Dhabi’s land surface measures 67,340 square kilometres, which is equivalent to about 87% of the UAE’s total land area.Abu Dhabi Surface Area Only 30% of the emirate is inhabited, with the remaining vast expanses covered mainly by desert and arid land — constituting about 93% of the total land area.
Land cultivation and irrigation for agriculture and forestation over the past decade has increased the size of "green" areas in the emirate to about 5% of the total land area, including parks and roadside plantations. About 1.2% of the total land area is used for agriculture. A small part of the land area is covered by mountains, containing several caves. The coastal area contains pockets of wetland and mangrove colonies. Abu Dhabi also has dozens of islands, mostly small and uninhabited, some of which have been designated as sanctuaries for wildlife.Islands of Abu Dhabi
Abu Dhabi has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh). Sunny blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of June through September are generally extremely hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above [tpl]convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. During this time, sandstorms occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility to a few meters.Abu Dhabi Sandstorm
The cooler season is from November to March, which ranges between moderately hot to warm. This period also sees dense fog on some days. On average, January is the coolest month in the year, while July and August are the hottest.
The oasis city of Al Ain, about [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] away, bordering Oman, regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country; however, the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year-round humidity of the capital city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT002910|title=Sharjah, United Arab Emirates|work=BBC Weather|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Governance and politics==

[tpl]Main|Politics of the United Arab Emirates[/tpl]Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the hereditary ruler of Abu Dhabi (UAE). He is a son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the United Arab Emirates. His half-brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and wields considerable influence as Chairman of Abu Dhabi's Executive Council and Deputy Supreme Commander of the armed forces of The United Arab Emirates.[tpl]cite web|author=UAEinteract.com |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/business/gabu.asp |title=UAE Government Offices: Abu Dhabi |publisher=UAEinteract |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090602214743/http://www.uaeinteract.com/business/gabu.asp| archivedate= 2 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The total number of members of the Executive Council has been slimmed down to 98 since the succession and it now consists largely of prominent members of the ruling family as well as a number of respected politicians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abudhabi.alloexpat.com/abudhabi_information/government_abudhabi.php |title=Government in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Politics - Allo' Expat Abu Dhabi |publisher=Abudhabi.alloexpat.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090612045908/http://www.abudhabi.alloexpat.com/abudhabi_information/government_abudhabi.php| archivedate= 12 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The emirates maintain their hereditary rulers who, as a group, form the UAE’s Supreme Council of Rulers, headed by the president. Although the presidency is renewable every five years through a vote in the council, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan held the presidency from the formation of the UAE until his death in November 2004, and there is an implicit understanding that Abu Dhabi’s ruler will always be elected president.
At a federal level, laws must be ratified by the Supreme Council. The Council of Ministers forms the executive authority of the state. This 20-member cabinet is headed by the president’s chosen prime minister, a post currently held by Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The cabinet also refers to the Federal National Council (FNC), a 40-member consultative body to which each emirate appoints a certain number of members. In the case of Abu Dhabi, this is eight. The procedures for appointment to the FNC have recently been amended so that each emirate must now select its representatives through an electoral body. The size of each electoral authority must be 100 times greater than the number of representatives it appoints. Half the members of each electoral body will be selected by the ruler of the emirate while the other half will be directly elected by residents of the emirate. These amendments are considered to be the first step in a wider electoral reform program which will see greater representation at a federal level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/country.asp?country=36 |title=Emirates: Abu Dhabi: Country Profile - Geography, History, Government and Politics, Population and Economy |publisher=Oxfordbusinessgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque====

One of the most important architectural landmarks is the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. This is arguably one of the most important architectural treasures of contemporary UAE society—and one of the most opulent in the world. It was initiated by the late president of the United Arab Emirates, HH Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fondly thought of as the father of the UAE.SZGMC www.szgmc.ae
Its design and construction reportedly 'unites the world', using artisans and materials from many countries including Italy, Germany, Morocco, India, Turkey, Iran, China, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Greece and of course the United Arab Emirates. More than 3,000 workers and 38 renowned contracting companies took part in the construction of the mosque. Natural materials were chosen for much of its design and construction due to their long-lasting qualities, including marble, stone, gold, semi-precious stones, crystals and ceramics. Construction began on 5 November 1996. The maximum capacity is approximately 41,000 people and the overall structure is 22,412 square metres, the internal prayer halls were initially opened in December 2007.
As one of the most visited buildings in the UAE, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center was established to manage the day-to-day operations, as a place of worship and Friday gathering and as a centre of learning and discovery through its education and visitor programs.Sheik Zayed Grand Mosque Center

==Economy==

The UAE’s large hydrocarbon wealth gives it one of the highest GDP per capita in the world and Abu Dhabi owns the majority of these resources – 95% of the oil and 6% of gas. Abu Dhabi thus holds 9% of the world’s proven oil reserves (98.2bn barrels) and almost 5% of the world’s natural gas (5.8 trillion cu metres). Oil production in the UAE was in the region of 2.3m barrels per day (bpd) in 2010,
and projects are in progress to boost production to 3m bpd. In recent years the focus has turned to gas as increasing domestic consumption for power, desalination and reinjection of gas into oil fields increases demand. Gas extraction is not without its difficulties, however, as demonstrated by the sour gas project at Shah where the gas is rich in hydrogen sulphide content and is expensive to develop and process.
Recently the government has been diversifying their economic plans. Served by high oil prices, the country’s non-oil and gas GDP has outstripped that attributable to the energy sector. Remarkably, non-oil and gas GDP now constitutes 64% of the UAE’s total GDP. This trend is reflected in Abu Dhabi with substantial new investment in industry, real estate, tourism and retail. As Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer of the UAE, it has reaped the most benefits from this trend. It has taken on an active diversification and liberalisation programme to reduce the UAE’s reliance on the hydrocarbon sector. This is evident in the emphasis on industrial diversification with the completion of free zones, Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, twofour54 Abu Dhabi media free zone and the construction of another, ICAD II, in the pipeline. There has also been a drive to promote the tourism and real estate sectors with the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority and the Tourism and Development Investment Company undertaking several large-scale development projects. These projects will be served by an improved transport infrastructure with a new port, an expanded airport and a proposed rail link between Abu Dhabi and Dubai all in the development stages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/191913051.html |title=Abu Dhabi - Economic Base Diversifying |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl]
Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest emirate of the UAE in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income. More than $1 trillion is invested worldwide in this city alone. In 2010, the GDP per capita also reached $49,600, which ranks ninth in the world after Qatar, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg and many others. Taxation in Abu Dhabi, as in the rest of the UAE, is nil for a resident and for a non-bank, non-oil company. Abu Dhabi is also planning many future projects sharing with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) and taking 29% of all the GCC future plannings. The United Arab Emirates is a fast-growing economy: in 2006 the per capita income grew by 9%, providing a GDP per capita of $49,700 and ranking third in the world at purchasing power parity. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), currently estimated at US$ 875 billion, is the world's wealthiest sovereign fund in terms of total asset value.Asset-backed insecurity.

==City planning==

The city was planned in the 1970s for an estimated maximum population of 600,000. In accordance with what was considered to be ideal urban planning at the time, the city has wide grid-pattern roads, and high-density tower blocks.Mention of City Grid Patterns
On the northerly end of the island, where the population density is highest, the main streets are lined with 20- to 30-story towers. Inside this rectangle of towers is a normal grid pattern of roads with lower density buildings (2-story villas or 6-story low-rise buildings).
Abu Dhabi is a modern city with broad boulevards, tall office and apartment buildings, and busy shops. Principal thoroughfares are the Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the Corniche, all horizontal streets are oddly and the vertical ones evenly numbered. Thus, the Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5,Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam Street is St #8.[tpl]cite web |title=Google Map of Abu Dhabi |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=abu+dhabi&ie=UTF8&ll=24.48543,54.374685&spn=0.022264,0.047035&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1&output=embed&s=AARTsJrE00-YUggvMJHd59dndcY7Dx3zCA |publisher=Google Maps[/tpl]
Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organizations.
There are many parks throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entrance fee for adults. The Corniche, the city's seaside promenade, is about [tpl]convert|7|km|mi[/tpl] in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/skateboard ring.The Corniche

White-and-mustard metered taxis traverse most of the city in UAE and Abu Dhabi has about 8,000 of these. At present, newer silver-coloured taxis are coming in, while the old mustard-coloured ones are being phased out.Welcome to Abu Dhabi – Taxis. Visitabudhabi.ae (1 July 2009)
The first town bus entered service in about 1969 but this was all part of a very informal service. There are other inter-city buses departing the Abu Dhabi Dhabi central bus station; these inter-city buses are not only intra-emirate buses, but also inter-emirate services. On 30 June 2008 the Department of Transport began public bus service in Abu Dhabi with four routes.[tpl]cite news |title=Abu Dhabi bus network |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080629/ONLINESPECIAL/679771484/9999 |publisher=The National |date=29 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080712070700/http://thenational.ae/article/20080629/ONLINESPECIAL/679771484/9999| archivedate= 12 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] There are also public buses serving the airport.

Within the first week of service the bus network had seen high usage. Some of the buses, which have a maximum capacity of 45 passengers, only had room for standing left.

==Culture==

Abu Dhabi has a diverse and multicultural society."Country and Metropolitan Stats in Brief". MPI Data Hub [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous pearling community was changed with the arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals—first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by Indians and Pakistanis in the 1960s. Abu Dhabi has been criticized for perpetuating a class-based society, where migrant workers are in the lower classes, and suffer abuse which is "is endemic to the system".The Dark Side of Dubai, Johann Hari, The Independent, 7 April 2009. [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kVUIHXHn|date =2009-10-14[/tpl] Despite the diversity of the population, only minor and infrequent episodes of ethnic tensions, primarily between expatriates, have been reported in the city.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] Major holidays in Abu Dhabi include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, Eid ul-Adha which marks the end of Hajj, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gowealthy.com/gowealthy/wcms/en/home/articles/entertainment/events-and-festivals/Official-holidays-in-UAE-kvOQ0zrKKl.html|title=Official holidays in UAE|publisher=Gowealthy.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-15[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
This unique socioeconomic development in the Persian Gulf has meant that Abu Dhabi is generally more tolerant than its neighbours, including Saudi Arabia.UAE Religious Freedom Emaritis have been known for their tolerance; Christian churches, Hindu temples, and Sikh gurdwaras (but no synagogues) can be found alongside mosques. The cosmopolitan atmosphere is gradually growing and as a result, there are a variety of Asian and Western schools, cultural centers and themed restaurants.
Abu Dhabi is home to a number of cultural institutions including the Cultural Foundation and the National Theater. The Cultural Foundation, while closed for reconstruction as of spring 2011, is home to the UAE Public Library and Cultural Center.UAE Public Library Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city. The recently launched Emirates Foundation offers grants in support of the arts, as well as to advance science and technology, education, environmental protection and social development. The International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF) will be based in Abu Dhabi.

The diversity of cuisine in Abu Dhabi is a reflection of the cosmopolitan nature of the society. Arab food is very popular and is available everywhere in the city, from the small shawarma to the upscale restaurants in the city's many hotels. Fast food and South Asian cuisine are also very popular and are widely available.

Poetry in Abu Dhabi and the UAE is highly regarded and often is centric around the themes of satire, religion, family, chivalry and love. According to an article from an Abu Dhabi tourism page, sheikhs, teachers, sailors and princes make a large bulk of the poets within the UAE. A unique form of poetry to the UAE was formed in the 8th century by Al Khalil bin Ahmed and it was written in 16 meters. The first known poet from the UAE, Ibn Majid, was born sometime between 1432 and 1437 in Ras Al Khaimah. According to the tourism page Majid came from a family of sailors and 40 of his works have survived. Another Emirati poet, Ibn Daher is from the 17th century. Daher is important because he used Nabati poetry (AKA Bedouin poetry), poetry written in the vernacular instead of the classical/religious Arabic. Other important poets from the UAE are Mubarak Al Oqaili (1880–1954), Salem bin Ali al Owais (1887–1959) and Abdulla bin Sulayem (1905–1976). These poets made headway in the field of Classical Arabic poetry as opposed to the Nabati poetry of the 17th century.[tpl]cite web|title=Literature and Poetry|url=http://www.visitabudhabi.ae|work=Welcome to Abu Dhabi|accessdate=28 February 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110207225805/http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/|archivedate=7 February 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
One of Ibn Masjid's most prominent works is a book called, Kitab al-Fawa'id fi Usul 'Ilm al-Bahr wa 'l-Qawa'id (Book of Useful Information on the Principles and Rules of Navigation), and it was written in 1490. This book is effectually an encyclopædia about navigation and sailing in and around the Indian Ocean. Masjid also goes into detail about the intricacies and technologies of the Arab sailing techniques. An excerpt from his book is:
[tpl]Quote_box|width=55%|align=right|quote="We have 32 rhumbs, and tirfa, and zam, and the measurement of stellar altitudes, but they have not. They cannot understand the way we navigate, but we can understand the way they do; we can use their system and sail in their ships. For the Indian Ocean is connected to the All-Encompassing Ocean, and we possess scientific books that give stellar altitudes, but they do not have a knowledge of stellar altitudes; they have no science and no books, only the compass and dead reckoning… We can easily sail in their ships and upon their sea, so they have great respect for us and look up to us. They admit we have a better knowledge of the sea and navigation and the wisdom of the stars."|source=Ahmad Ibn Majid on European NavigationThe Navigator: Ahmad Ibn Majid, Saudi Aramco World, accessed 28 February 2011.
