The first gig Oakes attended was one of Suede's at the Poole Arts Centre in May 1993. Upon hearing that guitarist Bernard Butler had left the band and that the band were auditioning for a replacement, he recorded versions of Suede songs and some of his own material on a 4 track recorder, which he sent to the band's fanclub along with a note that read "Take me or leave me." When drummer Simon Gilbert heard Anderson playing back the tape whilst going through audition tapes, he mistakenly believed it to be an early Suede demo. After the second audition Oakes was invited to join the band.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guitargodoakes.tripod.com/BlackorBlue/intermusic.html |title=The Oakes Playground |publisher=Guitargodoakes.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-06[/tpl]
