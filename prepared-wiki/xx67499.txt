==Early years==

Julia de Burgos (birth name: Julia Constanza de Burgos García[tpl]Spanish name|de Burgos|García[/tpl]) was born to Francisco Burgos Hans (a farmer) and Paula García de Burgos. Although her father worked for the National Guard and farmed near the town of Carolina, Puerto Rico, where she was born, the family later moved to the barrio of Santa Cruz of the same city. She was the oldest of thirteen children, and six of her youngest siblings died of malnutrition. Her family's poverty did not keep her from developing a love for nature and her country, as noted in her first work Río Grande de Loíza. According to Burgos:  "My childhood was all a poem in the river, and a river in the poem of my first dreams."  After she graduated from Muñoz Rivera Primary School in 1928, her family moved to Rio Piedras where she was awarded a scholarship to attend University High School.[tpl]cite book|title=Song of the Simple Truth: The Complete Poems of Julia de Burgos|publisher=Curbstone Books; 1st edition (January 1997)|isbn=1-880684-24-1[/tpl] In 1931, she enrolled in University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus to become a teacher.
In 1933, Burgos graduated at the age of 19 from the University of Puerto Rico with a degree in teaching.  She became a teacher and worked at Feijoo Elementary School in Barrio Cedro Arriba of  Naranjito, Puerto Rico. She also worked as writer for a children's program on public radio, but was reportedly fired for her political beliefs. Her love for literature led her to write poetry. Among her early influences were Luis Lloréns Torres, Clara Lair, Rafael Alberti and Pablo Neruda.

==Nationalist==

In 1934, she married Ruben Rodrigues Beauchamp and ended her teaching career to devote time to her marriage and her passion for writing. In 1936, she was a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico) and elected Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, a non-partisan  women's organization which was the women's branch of the Nationalist Party. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was the independence party headed by Pedro Albizu Campos, a Puerto Rican Nationalist. Due to time and constraints, her activities affected her marriage, and she divorced her husband in 1937.

==Literature==

By the early 1930s, Burgos was already a published writer in journals and newspapers. She published three books which contained a collection of her poems.  For her first two books, she traveled around the island promoting herself by giving book readings.  Her third book was published posthumously in 1954. Burgos's lyrical poems are a combination of the intimate, the land and the social struggle of the oppressed.  Many critics assert that her poetry anticipated  the work of feminist writers and poets as well as that of other Hispanic authors.Hispanic Heritage In one of her poems, she writes: “I am life, strength, woman.” [tpl]cite web|title=Julia de Burgos, Celebrated Poet, Honored on U.S. Stamp|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2010/pr10_089.htm[/tpl]  Burgos received numerous awards and recognition for her work and was celebrated by poets including Pablo Neruda, who stated that her calling was to be the greatest poet of the Americas.Truth & lies: an anthology of poems.
