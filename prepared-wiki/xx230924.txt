CATEGORIES: Israeli punk rock groups

Zikney Tzfat (or “Elders Of Zefat” in Hebrew) were a grunge / punk band formed in Tel Aviv, Israel around 1990 by Maor Cohen, Yoni Bentovim, Oren Lutenberg and Adiel Portugaly who was later replaced by Rea Mochiach. They were known for their wild and chaotic concerts and their extreme lyrics which were full with absurdist and childish humour. 

==Description==

In the period of their first album (simply titled Zikney Tzfat) their music was very noisy and influenced by American grunge bands like Killdozer and Butthole Surfers. Around 1994 the band members changed and the band released another album (Zikney Tzfat 2), which was more soft and melodic and was more successful commercially (it sold gold[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]) but musically was less appreciated by critics and band fans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] In 1995 they released two more albums (Ten Li Shlager and Ten Li Shlager 2 which were more "Low Fi" in their nature and were musically more reminiscent of the first album. The band split in 1996.
