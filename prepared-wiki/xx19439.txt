Hereford [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Hereford.ogg|ˈ|h|ɛr|ɨ|f|ər|d[/tpl] is a cathedral city, civil parish and county town of Herefordshire, England. It lies on the River Wye, approximately [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] east of the border with Wales, [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Worcester, and [tpl]convert|23|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of Gloucester. With a population of 53,516 people, it is the largest settlement in the county.
The name "Hereford" is said to come from the Anglo-Saxon "here", an army or formation of soldiers, and the "ford", a place for crossing a river. If this is the origin it suggests that Hereford was a place where a body of armed men forded or crossed the Wye. The Welsh name for Hereford is Henffordd, meaning "old road", and probably refers to the Roman road and Roman settlement at nearby Stretton Sugwas.
An early town charter from 1189 granted by Richard I of England describes it as "Hereford in Wales".[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.herefordwebpages.co.uk/charters.shtml | title= The Royal Charters of the City of Hereford | work= Hereford Web Pages | accessdate= 7 September 2011[/tpl] Hereford has been recognised as a city since time immemorial, with the status being reconfirmed as recently as October 2000.Beckett, J V (2005).

It is now known chiefly as a trading centre for a wider agricultural and rural area. Products from Hereford include: cider, beer, leather goods, nickel alloys, poultry, chemicals, and cattle, including the famous Hereford breed.

==History==

Hereford became the seat of Putta, Bishop of Hereford, some time between AD 676 and 688, after which the settlement continued to grow due to its proximity to the border between Mercia and Wales, becoming the Saxon capital of West Mercia by the beginning of the 8th century.Sims-Williams "Putta (d. c.688)" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
Hostilities between the Anglo-Saxons and the Welsh came to a head with the Battle of Hereford in 760, in which the Britons freed themselves from the influence of the English.Annales Cambriae Hereford was again targeted by the Welsh during their conflict with the Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor in AD 1056 when, supported by Viking allies, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, King of Gwynedd and Powys, marched on the town and put it to the torch before returning home in triumph.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] Hereford had the only mint west of the Severn in the reign of Athelstan (924–39), and it was to Hereford, then a border town, that Athelstan summoned the leading Welsh princes.J and M Tonkin, The Book of Hereford, 1975
The present Hereford Cathedral dates from the early 12th century, as does the first bridge across the Wye.J. Hillaby, Bishop Richard de Capella and the foundation of Herefordshire's market towns, in Woolhope Naturalists Field Club,Essays in honour of Jim and Muriel Tonkin, 2011  Former Bishops of Hereford include Saint Thomas de Cantilupe and Lord High Treasurer of England Thomas Charlton.
The city gave its name to two suburbs of Paris, France: Maisons-Alfort (population 54,600) and Alfortville (population 36,232), due to a manor built there by Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford, in the middle of the 13th century.
Hereford, a base for successive holders of the title Earl of Hereford, was once the site of a castle, Hereford Castle, which rivalled that of Windsor in size and scale. This was a base for repelling Welsh attacks and a secure stronghold for English kings such as King Henry IV when on campaign in the Welsh Marches against Owain Glyndŵr. The castle was dismantled in the 18th century and landscaped into Castle Green.
After the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in 1461, during the Wars of the Roses, the defeated Lancastrian leader Owen Tudor (grandfather of the future Henry VII of England) was taken to Hereford by Sir Roger Vaughan and executed in High Town. A plaque now marks the spot of the execution. Vaughan was later himself executed, under a flag of truce, by Owen's son Jasper.
During the civil war the city changed hands several times. On 30 September 1642 Parliamentarians led by Sir Robert Harley and Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford occupied the city without opposition. In December they withdrew to Gloucester because of the presence in the area of a Royalist army under Lord Herbert. The city was again occupied briefly from 23 April to 18 May 1643 by Parliamentarians commanded by Sir William Waller but it was in 1645 that the city saw most action. On 31 July 1645 a Scottish army of 14,000 under Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven besieged the city but met stiff resistance from its garrison and inhabitants. They withdrew on 1 September when they received news that a force led by King Charles was approaching. The city was finally taken for Parliament on 18 December 1645 by Colonel Birch and Colonel Morgan. King Charles showed his gratitude to the city of Hereford on 16 September 1645 by augmenting the city's coat of arms with the three lions of Richard I of England, ten Scottish Saltires signifying the ten defeated Scottish regiments, a very rare lion crest on top of the coat of arms signifying "defender of the faith" and the even rarer gold-barred peer's helm, found only on the arms of one other municipal authority: those of the City of London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/h/hereford.htm |title=Coat of arms of Hereford (England) |publisher=Ngw.nl |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]
Nell Gwynne, actress and mistress of King Charles II, is said to have been born in Hereford in 1650 (although other towns and cities, notably Oxford, also claim her as their own); Gwynn Street is named after her. Another famous actor born in Hereford is David Garrick (1717–1779).
The Bishop's Palace next to the Cathedral was built in 1204 and continually used to the present day.http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol04/4_069_080.pdf[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/hereford.html |title=A History of Hereford |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]  Hereford Cathedral School is also one of the oldest schools in England.
During World War I, in 1916, a fire at the Garrick Theatre killed eight young girls who had been performing at a charity concert.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-25154112|title=World War One: Hereford theatre fire killed eight at fundraiser|last=Chester|first=Jerry|date=24 February 2014|work=BBC Online|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl]

==Governance==

The main local government body covering Hereford is Herefordshire Council. Hereford has a "City Council" but this is actually a parish council with city status, and has only limited powers.
Historically Hereford has been the county town of Herefordshire. In 1974 Herefordshire was merged with Worcestershire to become part of the county of Hereford and Worcester, and Hereford became a district of the new county. Hereford had formed a historic borough and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.Vision of Britain – Hereford MB On 1 April 1998 the County of Hereford and Worcester was abolished, and Herefordshire and Worcestershire were re-established as separate counties, although with slightly altered borders.
However the new Herefordshire was a unitary authority without any districts, and so Hereford lost its district status (although, confusingly, the authority's full legal name is the County of Herefordshire District Council). Charter Trustees were appointed to preserve mayoral traditions until a civil parish council could be set up, which happened in 2000. Hereford is one of only seven civil parishes in England which have city status.
Hereford was the name of a parliamentary constituency centring on the city, from 1295 to 2010, when it was renamed as Hereford and South Herefordshire. The current member of the House of Commons for Hereford and South Herefordshire is Jesse Norman of the Conservative Party.

==Climate==

As with all of the UK, Hereford experiences a maritime climate, with limited seasonal temperature ranges, and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest Met Office weather station for which 30-year averages are available is Preston Wynne weather station, about [tpl]convert|5|mi|0[/tpl] north east of the city centre. Since 2001 a weather station at Credenhill, under [tpl]convert|4|mi|0[/tpl] to the west, has provided data.
Since 2001, extremes at Hereford Credenhill have ranged from  [tpl]convert|33.6|°C|°F[/tpl] during July 2006, to as low as [tpl]convert|-15.8|°C|°F[/tpl] during December 2010

==Transport==

===Roads===

There have been plans for many years for a north–south bypass[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4157187.High_hopes_for_Hereford___60m_bypass_bid/ |title=Hereford Times |publisher=Hereford Times |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl] and currently the plan is for a nine-mile (14 km) dual carriageway; however, HM Government as yet has refused to grant permission or supply funds. Until then the A49 Trunk Road, A465, and A438 continue to run through the city centre.

===Rail===

Hereford is served by a 4-platform railway station on the Welsh Marches Line which opened in 1854. Services regularly connect to Worcester, Birmingham, London, Manchester, Cardiff and other settlements in south Wales. The station is currently operated by Arriva Trains Wales. A second station, Hereford Barton, was closed and later redeveloped.

===Air===

There is no airport in or near Hereford. The nearest are at Gloucester, Bristol, Birmingham, and Cardiff.

==Military associations==

RAF Hereford was a non-flying station of the Royal Air Force located nearby to Hereford. It was the home of a wide variety of training schools from 1940 until it closed for RAF training in 1999. Subsequently the  Special Air Service (SAS) moved their base to there from its previous location in the city. There is a clocktower in Hereford where the names of dead SAS men are inscribed.

==Economy==

The main public service employers in Hereford include:

==Regeneration==

For much of the 20th century, Hereford City remained structurally stagnant with no major investment. Since the council became independent from Worcester in 1998, much has changed in that regard.
Many of the schools in Hereford have been rebuilt and improved,.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/8189738.stm |title=Bbc News |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]  The Herefordshire College of Technology has also been rebuilt to a 21st-century standard.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hct.ac.uk/College/h_campus.html |title=Herefordshire College of Technology |publisher=Hct.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]
Hereford benefitted from the PFI reconstruction schemes for NHS hospitals, with the former County Hospital site having £60 million spent on a brand new, one-site hospital to replace the former 3 hospitals: the General, the Eye Hospital, and the County Hospital. The new Hereford County Hospital was the single largest investment in Herefordshire at that point.

===Current and future projects===

A major regeneration project is taking place in Hereford city centre, formerly known as the Edgar Street Grid, it is now managed by Hereford Futures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herefordfutures.co.uk |title=Hereford Futures website |publisher=Herefordfutures.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]  This covers an area of around [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2[/tpl] just north of the old city walls. Work started on 8 October 2012,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/9172256.Work_starts_on_Hereford_s_old_cattle_market/|title=Work Starts on Hereford's Old Cattle Market |publisher=Herefordtimes.com |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl] and should take around 15 years to complete the whole project. The regeneration includes the rebuilding of the canal basin at the end of the currently disused Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal.
The £80 million phase 1 includes a supermarket, department store, multiplex cinema, shops, restaurants, and other facilities and will open in late Spring 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=42&id=617 |title=Stanhope PLC |publisher=Stanhope PLC |date=5 January 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]

A proposed bypass has been drawn up to circulate the city, which suffers from rush hour traffic, with potential routes either to the east or west of the city. Both routes would connect with the Rotherwas Access Road which was recently completed, connecting the Rotherwas Industrial Estate to the A49. Rotherwas itself has recently been awarded an Enterprise Zone status by the government which is expected to boost the economy and bring in thousands of new jobs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-14555547 |title=Rotherwas named Enterprise Zone |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl]

Sadly with the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak the market suffered and trade reduced. Established by Act of Parliament, the market must be provided, and so a new Bill was introduced in 2003[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/2003/4/introduction/enacted |title=Hereford Markets Act 2003 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=30 October 2003 |accessdate=28 January 2012[/tpl] to move the site to the outskirts of the city.
