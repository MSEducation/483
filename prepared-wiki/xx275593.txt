[[Liechtenstein–European Union relations]]

CATEGORIES: Third-country relations of the European Union, Bilateral relations of Liechtenstein

Relations between Liechtenstein and the European Union (EU) are shaped heavily by Liechtenstein's participation in the European Economic Area (EEA).

==Market access==

Liechtenstein is the only microstate (not counting Iceland by population or EU members) that is a part of the EEA. It joined on 1 May 1995 after becoming a full member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1991 (previously, it had been in EFTA as part of Switzerland). All EFTA states bar Switzerland are in the EEA, which gives them access to the EU single market. It also obliges Liechtenstein to apply certain European Union laws. There are very few issues not covered by the EEA agreement and there is some further cooperation with the EU via Switzerland as Liechtenstein is highly integrated with the Swiss economy (including using the Swiss franc).Principality of Liechtenstein, European External Action Service

==Schengen==

On 28 February 2008 Liechtenstein signed the Schengen Agreement and became part of the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Trukhachev|first=Vadim|title=Tiny state lost in the Alps becomes more accessible to foreigners|url=http://english.pravda.ru/world/europe/22-12-2011/120047-liechtenstein-0/|work=Pravda.Ru|publisher=Pravda|accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] Before this, Switzerland shared an open border with Liechtenstein and was already a full Schengen Area member. This open border was not considered a threat to European security because it would be highly difficult or impossible to enter Liechtenstein without first landing in or entering a Schengen state. The border with Austria was not open, and it was treated as an external border post by Austria and Liechtenstein, making it necessary to pass through customs and passport control before crossing.
