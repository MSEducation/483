[[Naresh (city)]]

CATEGORIES: Babylonia, Former populated places in Iraq

Naresh was a city in Babylonia, situated near Sura on a canal. It may be identical with the city of Nahras or Nahar Sar on the Tigris, and is mentioned together with Maá¸¥uza, Safonia, and Pumbedita, although it must not be inferred that these cities were near one another.
