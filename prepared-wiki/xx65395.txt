On April 12, 2010, Eubanks announced on the show that he would be leaving The Tonight Show following its 18th season.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] His last show was on Friday, May 28, 2010. Eubanks indicated in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer that he wanted to refocus on music, adding that his leaving was not provoked by any problems with Leno or NBC.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/arts/music/31eubanks.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nate | last=Chinen | title=Sidekick No More: Eubanks Starts Post-Leno Life | date=2010-05-30[/tpl] Following his departure from The Tonight Show, Eubanks began touring with band mate Marvin "Smitty" Smith on drums and Bill Pierce on sax.
On February 21, 2013, Eubanks had a performance slot on The Tonight Show, and then joined Leno for an interview. As the two talked, it became evident that Leno and Eubanks have kept in touch, at least remotely, since his departure, which dispelled the claims that he left the show because of his anger towards Leno for the Conan O'Brien controversy, as their chemistry was still very much intact.

He has written four feature film scores.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004903/ | title = Kevin Eubanks | publisher = Internet Movie DataBase | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-01-27 [/tpl]
