[[Zareth-shahar]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

Zareth-shahar - the splendor of the dawn, a city "in the mount of the valley" (Josh. 13:19). It is identified with the ruins of Zara, near the mouth of the Wady Zerka Main, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, some 3 miles south of the Callirrhoe, in the territory of the Tribe of Reuben. Of this town but little remains. "A few broken basaltic columns and pieces of wall about 200 yards back from the shore, and a ruined fort rather nearer the sea, about the middle of the coast line of the plain, are all that are left" (Henry Baker Tristram's Land of Moab).
