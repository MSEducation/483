"Wrapped Up In You" is a love song. A man expresses his love for a special someone using various analogies and describing how she supports him in hard times and how his life would be if she weren't around. The song doesn't feature any drums, but does have traces of percussion (such as maracas). It is in the key G Major.

==Music video==

The introduction to the music video begins with a quartet of old men at a barbershop executing unique and moderately complex percussions (using household objects such as a broom, board game piece, newspaper etc.) while Garth and back-up band arrive for a bite to eat. Garth and co. can't get in the restaurant but notice the old men's performance. They pick-up some instruments lying about and join them to perform "Wrapped Up In You." A small group of women appear near the end of the song and observe the men's performance. This video was directed by Jon Small, and was shot in Watertown, Tennessee.

==Chart positions==

"Wrapped Up in You" debuted at number 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the chart week of October 27, 2001.
