[[Gross rating point]]

CATEGORIES: Marketing analytics, Marketing terminology

Gross rating point (GRP) is a term used in advertising to measure the size of an audience reached by a specific media or schedule. Specifically, GRPs quantify impressions as a percentage of the population reached rather than in absolute numbers reached. Target rating points express the same concept, but with regard to a more narrowly defined target audience.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010).

GRPs are used predominantly as a measure of media with high potential exposures or impressions.

==Purpose==

The purpose of the GRP metric is to measure impressions in relation to the number of people in the audience for an advertising campaign. GRP values are commonly used by media buyers to compare the advertising strength of  various media vehicles.[tpl]cite web | url=http://advisionoutdoor.com/index.php?option=com_glossary&func=view&Itemid=84&catid=31&term=GRP | title=GRP defined | publisher=Ad Vision Outdoor | accessdate=March 12, 2012[/tpl]

==Construction==

GRPs are the product of the percentage of the audience reached by an advertisement, times the frequency they see it in a given campaign (frequency × % reached).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.marketing-metrics-made-simple.com/gross-rating-points.html | title=Gross Rating Points (GRPs) | publisher=Marketing Metrics Made Simple | accessdate=March 12, 2012[/tpl]
A television advertisement that is aired five times reaching 50% of the audience each time it is aired would have a GRP value of 250 (5 × 50%). To achieve a common denominator and compare media, (reach × frequency) are expressed over time (divided by time) to determine the 'weight' of a media campaign.
Alternatively, GRPs may be calculated in relation to the number of impressions:
