==History==

One and a half miles northwest of the village, at the top of Wears Hill, are the earthworks of Abbotsbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort.[tpl]cite book|title=West Dorset Holiday and Tourist Guide|publisher=West Dorset District Council|year=c. 1983|page=2[/tpl] The earthworks cover a roughly triangular area of about [tpl]convert|10|acre|ha[/tpl], of which about [tpl]convert|4.5|acre|ha[/tpl] are inside the ramparts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=127186|title=An Inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments in West Dorset.

In the 10th century a charter of King Edmund records a granting of land at Abbedesburi,Keynes, "The lost cartulary of Abbotsbury", p. 207. a name which indicates the land may have once belonged to an abbot. In the 11th century King Cnut granted land at nearby Portesham to the Scandinavian thegn Orc (also Urki, Urk), who took up residence in the area with his wife Tola.Keynes, "The lost cartulary of Abbotsbury", p. 208. The couple founded Abbotsbury Abbey and enriched it with a substantial amount of land. The abbey existed for 500 years, but was destroyed in the dissolution, although the abbey barn survived and today is the world's largest thatched tithe barn.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jurassiccoast.org/visiting-the-coast/gateway-towns/445-abbotsbury|title=Abbotsbury|publisher=jurassiccoast.org|year=2012|accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl] The barn is a Grade I listed building.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-105139-tithe-barn-abbotsbury-dorset Stone from the abbey was used in the construction of many buildings in the village,[tpl]cite book|title=Portrait of Dorset|author=Ralph Wightman|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|year=1983|edition=4|page=169|isbn=0-7090-0844-9[/tpl] including the house of Abbotsbury's new owner, Sir Giles Strangways.[tpl]cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|year=1980|pages=165–7|isbn=0-7091-8135-3[/tpl]
In 1664, during the English Civil War, Roundheads (Parliamentarians) and Cavaliers (Royalists) clashed at Abbotsbury. Parliamentarians besieged the Royalists in the church of St. Nicholas;Treves, p242 two bullet holes from the fight remain in the Jacobean pulpit. The Strangways house which had replaced the Abbey after the dissolution was also the scene of a skirmish, as the Royalist Colonel Strangways resisted the Parliamentarians, who besieged the house and burned it. The house gunpowder store exploded in the fire and the house was destroyed, together with the old abbey records which had been stored there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40138|title=Houses of Benedictine monks 1.

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries Abbotsbury experienced several fires, resulting in the destruction of virtually all its medieval buildings. Most of the historic secular buildings in the village today were built from stone in the 17th and 18th centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=163421&filetype=pdf|title=Dorset Historic Towns Survey, Abbotsbury.

County historian John Hutchins (1698–1773) recorded that fishing was the main industry in the village, and 18th-century militia ballot lists reveal that husbandry was also particularly important. Ropemaking, basketry and the manufacture of cotton stockings were other notable trades within the village, with records indicating hemp and withies being grown in the area.
In the early 19th century Abbotsbury's population grew steadily, from about 800 in 1801 to nearly 1,100 sixty years later.
Between 1885 and 1952 Abbotsbury was served by the Abbotsbury Railway, a [tpl]convert|6|mi|km|[/tpl] branch from the main line to Weymouth. It was primarily designed for freight, in anticipation of the development of oil shale deposits and stone at Portesham, as well as iron ore at Abbotsbury which would be shipped to South Wales for processing. The Abbotsbury terminus of the line was inconveniently sited [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|[/tpl] east of the village because the railway could not buy the land needed to build the station closer to the village.[tpl]cite web|title=Abbotsbury|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/a/abbotsbury/index.shtml|publisher=Disused Stations: Closed Railway Stations in the UK|accessdate=23 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]self-published source|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Church==

The Parish Church of St Nicholas dates from the 14th century but has had various revisions over the centuries. The tower contains three bells dating from 1773 and made by Thomas Castleman Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton.[tpl]cite book |last=Moore |first=James |author2=Roy Rice & Ernest Hucker |title=Bilbie and the Chew Valley clock makers |year=1995 |publisher=The authors |isbn=0-9526702-0-8 [/tpl][tpl]self-published source|date=January 2014[/tpl] The chancel was classicised in the 18th century and still has its plastered barrel roof and fine altarpiece. There are also some 15th-century painted glass, a stone effigy of one of the abbots and a Jacobean canopied pulpit.Betjeman, John, ed.

==Places of interest==

Abbotsbury is well known for its swannery, subtropical gardens, Abbey and abbey barn, castle, St Catherine's Chapel and the nearby Chesil Beach. The swannery, subtropical gardens and an estate of some [tpl]convert|15000|acre|km2[/tpl] in Dorset covering Chesil Beach and Abbotsbury is held by the Ilchester Estate owned by Mrs Charlotte Townshend, the daughter of Viscount Galway, a descendant of the first Countess of Ilchester and owner of the Melbury Estate.

===Swannery===

Situated south of the village on the shore of the Fleet lagoon, Abbotsbury Swannery is over 600 years old, having previously been owned by the abbot and managed, using decoys, to provide meat for the abbey. When the abbey was destroyed the swannery passed to the earls of Ilchester, and today the decoys are used for monitoring and recording purposes. The swannery has a large colony of Mute Swans, as well as other waterfowl, and is open to the public. The site is an important nesting and breeding ground for the swans and, from May through the summer, cygnets can be seen at close quarters.

===Subtropical gardens===

The subtropical gardens at Abbotsbury were founded in 1765 by the Countess of Ilchester, as a kitchen garden for the nearby castle.[tpl]cite news|last=Cumming|first=Ed|title=Subtropical garden wins the HHA/Christie's award|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/ed-cumming/9160415/Subtropical-garden-wins-the-HHAChristies-award.html|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=23 March 2012[/tpl] Since then, the gardens have developed into a 20 acre (81,000 m²) site filled with exotic plants, many of which were newly discovered species when they were first introduced. There are formal and informal gardens, with woodland walks and walled gardens. In 1990 violent storms damaged many of the rare specimens, which have since been replaced by younger plants.[tpl]cite web|title=Chainsaw art at Abbotsbury Sub-tropical Gardens|url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/8091295.Chainsaw_art_at_Abbotsbury_Sub_tropical_Gardens/|publisher=Dorset Echo|accessdate=15 September 2013[/tpl]

===St Catherine's Chapel===

To the south of the village, on a bare hill about 80 m (260 ft) high, stands St Catherine's Chapel, a small 14th-century pilgrimage chapel used by the monks of the abbey as a place for private prayer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/abbotsbury-st-catherines-chapel/history-and-research/|title=History and research: Abbotsbury St Catherine's Chapel|publisher=English Heritage|date=|accessdate=15 September 2013[/tpl] It is built entirely of stone, including the roof and even the panelled ceiling. The walls are [tpl]convert|1.2|m|ft[/tpl] thick and buttressed. The chapel overlooks the English Channel, and may have served as a beacon for sailors, warning of the nearby Isle of Portland.
