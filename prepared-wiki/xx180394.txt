The 2008 United States Senate special election in Mississippi was held on November 4, 2008. This election is held on the same day of Thad Cochran's re-election bid in the United States Senate election in Mississippi, 2008. The rules of this special election is that the winner will serve rest of Senate term, which ends in January 2013. Unlike most senate elections, this will be a non-partisan election in which the candidate who gets a majority of the vote wins, and if the first place candidate does not get 50%, a runoff election with the top two candidates will be held. In the election, no run off was necessary as Republican nominee and incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Roger Wicker won re-election to finish the term.

There was a dispute about the date on which the special election should occur and whether the governor appointed the interim senator in keeping with state law.
Mississippi law states that Gov. Barbour had 10 days after receiving official notification of the vacancy to appoint an interim senator pending a special election.

The state Democratic party objected to the timing of the special election.  Barbour set the special election for November 4, 2008 . Democrats claimed that he had 10 days to set a special election within 90 days (no later than March 29, 2008 ), and the issue went to court for resolution.
