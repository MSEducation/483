==History==

CCB was founded on 1 October 1954 under the name of People's Construction Bank of China ([tpl]zh|c=中国人民建设银行|p=Zhōngguó Rénmín Jiànshè Yínháng[/tpl]), and later changed to China Construction Bank on 26 March 1996.
In January 2002, CCB Chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for "personal reasons".  Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1 million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/business/worldbusiness/22bribe.html | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Barboza | title=Lawsuit Involving Bribery Preceded Bank Resignation | date=22 March 2005[/tpl]http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-11/03/content_724071.htm
China Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee's approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin.
During the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.mubasher.info/portal/CASE/getDetailsStory.html?goToHomePageParam=true&storyId=2316528 |title=More Chinese banks stop transactions with N.Korea - Mubasher |publisher=English.mubasher.info |date=2013-05-11 |accessdate=2013-05-18[/tpl]

==Investment by Bank of America==

In 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3 billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.
On or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares.Bank of America | Newsroom - Press Releases
