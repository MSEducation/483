===Cathedral builder===

Walkelin began work on a new cathedral church, the current Winchester Cathedral, in 1079. His transepts and crypt, though little else, are retained in the present building. King William II granted Walkelin half a hide in the Isle of Wight with license to search for and excavate stone for his new cathedral "throughout the plain and the forest: if the forest is sufficiently small that the horns of a deer may be seen passing through it"."per planum et silvam: si silva tantae parvitatis fuerit ut per eam transeuntes cornua cervi appareant."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
William I also granted Wlkelin as much timber for the building and its scaffolding from the Forest of Hempage Wood (on the Old Alresford Road in Hampshire) as his carpenters could take in four days and nights.

The following year more relics "of St. Swithun and of many other saints" were found under that altar and translated to the new church.[tpl]Citation needed|date= April 2010|date=May 2010[/tpl]
