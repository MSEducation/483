The Wallowa Mountains are a mountain range located in the Columbia Plateau of northeastern Oregon in the United States. The range runs approximately [tpl]convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest to southeast in southwestern Wallowa County between the Blue Mountains to the west and the Snake River to the east. The range is sometimes considered to be an eastern spur of the Blue Mountains, and it is known as the "Alps of Oregon".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opb.org/programs/ofg/segments/view/1739|title=Old Tree|year=2010|work=Oregon Field Guide|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|accessdate=21 February 2010[/tpl] Much of the range is designated as the Eagle Cap Wilderness, part of the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest.

==Geography==

The range is drained by the Wallowa River, which flows from the north side of the mountains, and its tributary the Minam River, which flows through the west side of the range. The Imnaha River flows from the east side of the range.
The highest point in the range is Sacajawea Peak, at an elevation of [tpl]convert|9838|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web | title = Elevations of Points Near Eagle Cap Wilderness | publisher = U.S. Forest Service | archiveurl = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20050321002445/http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/w-w/recreation/wilderness/elevations-ecw.shtml | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/w-w/recreation/wilderness/elevations-ecw.shtml | archivedate=21 March 2005[/tpl]  Sacajawea is the sixth highest mountain in Oregon and the state's highest peak outside of the Cascade Range.Engeman, Richard H.

==Geology==

Many geologists believe the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon are a displaced fragment of the Insular Belt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Coast%20Range%20Episode.htm |title=The Coast Range Episode |accessdate=25 May 2008 |publisher=The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture |year=2006 [/tpl] The core of the Wallowas is composed of the Wallowa Batholith surrounded by Columbia River basalt.[tpl]cite journal|last = Krauskopf | first = K.B.| year = 1943| journal = American Journal of Science| volume = 241| issue = 10 | pages = 607–628|url = http://www.ajsonline.org/content/241/10/607.full.pdf+html | accessdate = 16 October 2012|doi = 10.2475/ajs.241.10.607|title = The Wallowa Batholith[/tpl] In addition there are many older terranes between the batholith and basalt flows.[tpl]cite web | title = America's Volcanic Past - Oregon | publisher = United States Geological Survey | date = 26 October 2004 | first = Lyn | last = Topinka | url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicPast/Places/volcanic_past_oregon.html | accessdate = 18 November 2007[/tpl]
The Wallowa Batholith is formed of granite from a magma upwelling in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time (between 160 million and 120 million years ago). The placement of this rock caused uplift of the surface, which at the time was tropical sea. This is evident from the slate, quartzite, and marble present in the mountains, which come from metamorphism of the sedimentary deposits of oceans during the Triassic.[tpl] cite journal | title = Physical and Economic Geography of Oregon: Chapter XIII The Wallowa Mountains and County | last = Smith | first = Warren | journal = "The Commonwealth Review of the University of Oregon" | volume = 10 | issue = 1 |date=January 1928 | url = http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/12051/Phy_Eco_Geo.pdf?sequence=1 | format = PDF | accessdate = 22 March 2012 [/tpl] At the center of the Batholith are granodioritic rocks, while the outer limits of the range are tonalitic.[tpl]cite conference | title = The Origin of the Mafic Enclaves within the Wallowa Batholith, Oregon | last = West | first = Andrew | conference = 4th Keck Geology Consortium Undergraduate Research Symposium | location = Franklin and Marshall College | year = 1991 | url = http://keckgeology.org/node/1 | accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl] The granite batholith is cut by dikes;[tpl]cite conference | title = Contact Metamorphic Effects of the Wallowa Batholith on the Hurwal Formation, Wallowa Mountains, Oregon | last = Mbalue | first = Chuma | conference = 4th Keck Geology Consortium Undergraduate Research Symposium | location = Franklin and Marshall College | year = 1991 | url = http://keckgeology.org/files/pdf/symvol/4th/Oregon/mbalu.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl] however, these are uncommon.

==Climate==

In the mountains, much precipitation falls as snow. Total snowfall peaks around March.[tpl]cite web | title = Hydrological and ecologic impacts of climate change in the Grande Ronde River Basin | last = Rheinheimer | first = David | year = 2007 | url = https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/shlemoncourse/trips/GrandeRonde/backgroundpapers/Rheinheimer.pdf | accessdate = 22 March 2012 | format = PDF | publisher = University of California, Davis[/tpl] Most precipitation in the area is orographic precipitation. Near the tops of the mountains, total annual precipitation can exceed [tpl]convert|100|in|mm|abbr = on[/tpl] per year, while in the valleys it can be as low as [tpl]convert|10|in|mm|abbr = on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title = Climate of Wallowa County | last1 = Taylor | first1 = George | last2 = Hale | first2 = Candee | last3 = Joos | first3 = Sarah | url = http://www.ocs.oregonstate.edu/county_climate/Wallowa_files/Wallowa.html | work = Oregon Climate Service | publisher = Oregon State University | accessdate = 22 March 2012[/tpl]

==Ecology==

The higher precipitation of the mountains compared with the surrounding country has created a mesic habitat in the Wallowas.[tpl]cite web | title = Mid-Montane Wetland Plant Associations of the Malheur, Umatilla and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests | last = Crowe | first = Elizabeth A. | last2 = Clausnitzer | first2 = Rodrick R. | date = February 1997 | url = http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/16061/MidMontaneWetlandPlantAssociationsWallowaWhitnf.pdf?sequence=1 | accessdate = 24 March 2012 | format = PDF | publisher = U.S. Forest Service[/tpl] Vegetation in the region contains combinations of plants found in both the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades.[tpl]cite web | last = Wells | first = Aaron | title = Deep Canyon and Subalpine Riparian and Wetland Plant Associations of the Malheur, Umatilla, and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests | date = November 2006 | url = http://ecoshare.info/uploads/publications/PNW-GTR-682.pdf | accessdate = 24 March 2012 | format = PDF[/tpl] At low elevations, Douglas fir is the most common tree for slopes, whereas Engelmann spruce and lodgepole pine occur in valley bottoms, with grand fir common below [tpl]convert|5300|ft|m|abbr = on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title = Vegetation of two drainages in Eagle Cap Wilderness, Wallowa Mountains, Oregon | last = Cole | first = David | year = 1982 | url = http://content.lib.umt.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/forest/id/321/rec/20 | accessdate = 24 March 2012 [/tpl] In meadows and around springs and seeps, willows and sedge occur.

==History==

The area was home to the Wallowa band of the Lower Nez Perce. The Nez Perce lived in the canyons and burned trees to create meadows for the horses that they obtained around 1730.[tpl]cite web | title = The History of Grazing in Wallowa County | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jennifer | last2 = Melville | first2 = Erin | date = September 2005 | page = 7 | publisher = Oregon State University | url = http://extension.oregonstate.edu/wallowa/sites/default/files/_in_Wallowa_County_Compilation_edited_4_2009.pdf | accessdate = 24 March 2012 | format = PDF[/tpl] In 1834, Captain Bonneville crossed through the mountains and met with the lower Nez Perce on his way to Fort Walla Walla.[tpl]cite book | title = The Adventures of Captain Bonneville | last = Irving | first = Washington |  year = 1861 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=2_4htIWyuWEC&pg=PA19&dq=captain+bonneville+and+the+nez+perce#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = 24 March 2012[/tpl] In the 1840s, people began to move west, bringing settlers through the land. The Nez Perce began to trade with these settlers. A settlement in the mountains was built in 1861.[tpl]cite web | title = Historical land & resource use in the Grande Ronde basin, Oregon | last = Lawson | first = Abigail J. | year = 2007 | url = https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~shlemoncourse/trips/GrandeRonde/backgroundpapers/Lawson.pdf | publisher = University of California, Davis | accessdate = 24 March 2012 | format = PDF[/tpl] In 1863, a new treaty was signed that relinquished lands that granted by an 1855 treaty, turning them over to the American government. This same year, the settlers in the mountains moved to present-day La Grande. These lands included the Wallowa Valley, home of Chief Joseph. The government first opened the Wallowa Valley to settlement in 1867. Surveyors began to come through and would continue until 1869.[tpl]cite book | last = Josephy | first = Alvin | title = The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest | url = http://books.google.com/?id=D1Ffhzz0UOkC&pg=PR7&dq=captain+bonneville+and+the+nez+perce#v=onepage&q&f=false | year = 1965 | isbn = 9780395850114[/tpl] The Wallowa Valley was partitioned in 1873, with one half for the Nez Perce[tpl]cite web | title = Non-Native Exploration, Settlement, and Land Use of the Greater Hells Canyon Area, 1800s to 1950s | last = Buckendorf | first = Madeline | last2 = Bauer | first2 = Barbara | last3 = Jacox | first3 = Elizabeth | year = 2001 | url = http://www.idahopower.com/pdfs/Relicensing/hellscanyon/hellspdfs/techappendices/Cultural/e04_11.pdf | accessdate = 24 March 2012 | format = PDF[/tpl] and the other for settlers. Two years later, in 1875, the government banned the Nez Perce from the valley. The first road into the valley, a toll road, was constructed the same year. The U.S. Government attempted to force the removal of the Nez Perce in 1877; however, this angered the natives, who chose instead to raid the settlers, leading to the Nez Perce War.
Logging came in the late 1880s, using streams and rivers to transport the wood. A dam was constructed on Wallowa Lake in 1884 to help irrigate the valley. In 1908, the first railroad into the valley was completed. Rail lines were built to the upper valley by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1919, allowing for safer transportation of logs. The dam beneath Wallowa Lake was replaced by a concrete dam in 1916, and a new dam was completed in 1929.
