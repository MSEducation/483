The third Handsworth riot occurred on 2 September 1991 in Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, when a power cut plunged the area into darkness and sparked a looting spree in local shops. 200 police officers in riot gear were called in to bring the unrest under control. Hundreds of shops and houses were looted and cars were stolen. This occurred around the same time as rioting in Oxford, Dudley, Tyneside and Cardiff.http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=TIM&SrchText=birmingham+and+riot&DateFromDD=01&DateFromMM=Jan&DateFromYY=1991&DateToDD=31&DateToMM=Dec&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=3649701673591209763E200&advsrch=0&QueryText=%28birmingham+and+riot%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DTIM%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D1%2F1%2F1991%29+%3CAND%3E+%28SDate%3C%3D12%2F31%2F1992%29%29&_P=1
