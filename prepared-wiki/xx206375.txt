==Sounds of the Earth==

Without a doubt, the project “Sonidos de la tierra” (Sounds of the Earth), is the most important and elaborated communitarian project about musical culture in Paraguayan history. The project is being emulated nowadays in other countries in America.
The project is directed towards the kids and young people, and was created by Luis Szarán himself, who through the music schools, bands and cultural associations, gives access to musical education to 3.000 people of scarce resources, in 72 communities in the interior of the country. 
The program is inspired in the concept of “education for the art”; it was initiated in 2002 with the support of the AVINA Foundation, expanding it with alliances with other organizations like; the National Parliament, FONDEC, ITAIPU Bi-National, Asuncion’s Philharmonic Society, the Embassies of Germany, United States, France and Italy, Partners of the Americans (Paraguay-Kansas), Culture Direction of Asunción Municipality and others. More than 100 organizations, municipalities, business and sponsors are involved. 
In 2005, Luis Szarán was awarded with the Skoll Awards for The Social Entrepreneurships, given by the Skoll Foundation of California (USA). This award made possible to expand the project to other sector of society in need. The same year Sounds from my land is included as a program of Fundación Tierranuestra.
On 16th May 2011, Luis Szarán conducted the Paraguayan Bicentennial Chamber Orchestra, a musical ensemble brought together especially to celebrate the 200th Anniversary of the Independence of the Republic of Paraguay, 1811-2011.  The orchestra comprised leading members of the City of Asunción Symphony Orchestra, The National Symphony Orchestra, plus some of the most gifted young musicians of the Sounds of the Earth Project.  The program offered an overview of Paraguay's own compositions from the 19th century to the present, and included works in a variety of styles.  The celebrations were held at Church House, near Westminster Abbey, London, and the event was hosted by His Excellency Mr Miguel Solano-Lopez, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary representing Paraguay in London.
