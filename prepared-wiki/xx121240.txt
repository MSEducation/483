[[Klaverjas]]

CATEGORIES: Jass, Dutch culture

Klaverjas, or Klaverjassen, is the Dutch name for a four player trick-taking card game using the piquet deck of playing cards. It is closely related to the card game klaberjass, which is popular internationally and also known as Kalabriasz, Klobiash, Clobiosh, and other similar spellings. It is one of the most popular card games in the Netherlands, traditionally played in cafes and social clubs.Rules of Card Games: Klaverjas at Pagat.com The game offers a considerable level of complexity and depth. It has numerous variants, but the core rules are basically the same.

==History==

The name dates to 1890–95 from the Dutch word klaverjas, combining klaver (the suit of clubs, literally "clover") plus jas, the original name for the highest trump card.Random House Unabridged Dictionary 2006 http://www.dictionary.com at Dictionary.com According to Scarne,John Scarne Scarne on Card Games: How to Play and Win at Poker, Pinochle, Blackjack, Gin and Other Popular Card Games pg. 414 Dover Publications (2004) ISBN 0-486-43603-9 its origin has been variously claimed by the Dutch, Swiss, French, and Hungarians.

==Rules==

The game is played clockwise by four players in two teams, partners sitting opposite as in whist. It uses a piquet deck, i.e. a set of 32 cards in the four French suits: Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 7–10.
All cards are dealt to the players, in batches of 3–2–3 or 4–4.

===Bidding===

Starting with the elder hand, the first player prepared to do so chooses a trump suit and thereby becomes obliged to win the deal. Various versions handle the special case when all players pass differently.

===Trick-play===

As in most trick-taking games, players must follow suit if they can, and the highest trump in the trick, or in the absence of trumps the highest card in the suit of the first card, takes the trick. But there are additional restrictions on the cards that may be played. There are two variants; both agree that following a trump lead all players must head the trick if they can. 
Rotterdam rules: A player who cannot follow suit must trump if possible. A player who plays a trump must head the trick if possible, even if the player's partner currently heads the trick.
Amsterdam rules: Undertrumping is only allowed when it cannot be avoided. A player who cannot follow suit and whose partner is not heading the trick must head the trick if possible.
Aces and tens are high, i.e. cards in ordinary suits rank Ace, 10, King, Queen, Jack, 9, 8, 7. The Jack ("Jas") and nine ("Nel") in the trump suit, however, are the highest trumps. Thus trumps rank Jack, 9, Ace, 10, King, Queen, 8, 7.

===Scoring===

The point values of cards are as in Jass and Belote. In addition, the last trick ("Slag") scores 10 points.
Additional points are scored by players who have certain combinations in a single trick:
Four cards of the same rank (very rare) – 100 (or 200 for four jacks), 3 or 4 consecutive cards in the same suit – 20/50, King and Queen of trumps ("Stuk") – 20. These additional points combinations are called "Roem", and must be declared explicitly, otherwise they don't count.
There is a reward of 100 points if the other team doesn't get any tricks. This is called a march ("pit").

==Variants==

There are a wide number of variants of the game, with different names and spellings. Some of the versions include Klaberjass, Kolobiosh, Kabababrious, Kalabriasz, Clobnberyash, Kob, Klan, Club, Clabber, Clobber, Indiana Clobber, Clubby, Clobyosh, Bela, or Bella. The South African version of the game is known as Klawerjas.

==Popular culture==

It is the famous two hand game played by the Broadway characters in Damon Runyon’s stories.
