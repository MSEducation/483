The Teen Titans, also known as the New Teen Titans and Titans, is a comic book superhero team who appear in comic books published by DC Comics, often in an eponymous monthly series. As the group's name suggests, its members are teenage superheroes. The theme of teenagers learning to take on adult roles and responsibilities was common throughout the series.
The team unofficially debuted in The Brave and the Bold #54 (1964) as a "junior Justice League" featuring Dick Grayson, Kid Flash (Wally West) and Aqualad, the sidekicks of Justice League members Batman, the Flash and Aquaman respectively. The group made its first official appearance under the name of "Teen Titans" in The Brave and the Bold #60, joined by Wonder Girl (Donna Troy), Wonder Woman's younger sister.Wonder Girl refers to Wonder Woman's mother, Queen Hippolyta, as "Mother" in her first two appearances, The Brave and the Bold #60 and Showcase #59. Later, Green Arrow's sidekick, Speedy (Roy Harper) replaced Aqualad.
After only modest initial success, the series became a hit in a 1980s revival[tpl]Cite journal | last=MacDonald | first=Heidi D. | title=DC's Titanic Success | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=76 | date=October 1982 | pages=46–51[/tpl][tpl]cite book|quote=Wolfman and George Pérez created a title that would be DC's sales leader throughout the 1980s.|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America |year=2010| ISBN= 978-3-8365-1981-6|page= 454[/tpl] under writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez. In 1980, the team relaunched as The New Teen Titans, aging the characters to young adulthood. Original members Robin, Wonder Girl and Kid Flash were joined by new characters Cyborg, Starfire and Raven, as well as the former Doom Patrol member Beast Boy, as Changeling. The group had several encounters with the original Titans of Greek mythology, particularly Hyperion. The series was re-titled Tales of the Teen Titans with issue #41 (April 1984). A second volume was launched in August 1984. Pérez left in 1985 to headline the DC Comics 50th Anniversary limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. Tales of the Teen Titans was canceled in July 1988 after #91. The New Teen Titans Volume 2 was retitled The New Titans in December 1988 (issue #50) and was ultimately canceled in February 1996 after 130 issues.
The series was relaunched as Teen Titans in October 1996, with all-new members under Atom (Ray Palmer), who had been de-aged to a teenager. This series ended in September 1998 after 24 issues. A three-issue limited series titled JLA/The Titans: The Technis Imperative (December 1998 – February 1999) led to the March 1999 debut of The Titans, a series featuring select Titans from across the group's incarnations that produced 50 issues until April 2003. A new regular series titled Teen Titans began in September 2003, featuring Cyborg, Starfire, Beast Boy and Raven of the 1980s group joined by new teenaged versions of Robin (Tim Drake), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) and Kid Flash (Bart Allen), as well as the Superman clone Superboy (Kon-El). By 2006, the team included only the younger members and some new additions. A concurrent series titled Titans debuted in April 2008 featuring some of the original and 1980s members, such as Nightwing, Troia, Flash (Wally West), Tempest, Arsenal, Cyborg, Beast Boy and Raven.
In September 2011, the franchise rebooted again as part of DC's The New 52 event with a new team consisting of Red Robin (Tim Drake), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark), Kid Flash (Bart Allen), Solstice, Superboy and two new members - Bunker and Skitter.
A Teen Titans animated television series ran on Cartoon Network from July 2003 to January 2006 based on the 1980s team, but differed from the original. The series spawned two comic book titles, Teen Titans Go! and Tiny Titans. The series returned as a series of mini-shorts on the DC Nation block on Cartoon Network.

==Publication history==

===Original incarnation===

Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West) and Aqualad teamed up to defeat a weather-controlling villain known as Mister Twister in The Brave and the Bold #54 (July 1964) by writer Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani.[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 111 |quote = They were never given a team name when scribe Bob Haney and artist Bruno Premiani spun them against Mister Twister. However, this first team-up of Robin, Kid Flash and Aqualad came to be classically regarded as the inaugural story of the Teen Titans.[/tpl] They appeared under the name "Teen Titans" in The Brave and the Bold #60 (July 1965), joined by Wonder Woman's younger sister Wonder Girl (Donna Troy).The name "Wonder Girl" itself had been regularly used for a variety of flashback tales of Wonder Woman's childhood exploits.McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 115: "Writer Bob Haney and artist Nick Cardy added another member to the ranks of the newly formed Teen Titans: Wonder Girl." After being featured in Showcase #59 (December 1965), the Teen Titans were spun off into their own series with Teen Titans #1 by Haney and artist Nick Cardy.McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 116: "The Teen Titans earned their own series after successful tryouts in both The Brave and the Bold and Showcase. Scribe Bob Haney and artist Nick Cardy promptly dispatched Robin, Aqualad, Wonder Girl and Kid Flash...as the newest members of the Peace Corps."
The series' original premise had the Teen Titans helping teenagers and answering calls. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Haney "took some ribbing for the writing style that described the Teen Titans as 'the Cool Quartet' or 'the Fab Foursome'. The attempt to reach the youth culture then embracing performers like the Beatles and Bob Dylan impressed some observers."[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter= Teen Titans Assistants Earn a Promotion|publisher = Bulfinch|year = 1995|page = 134|isbn = 0821220764[/tpl] Green Arrow's sidekick Speedy makes guest appearances[tpl]cite comic| writer= Haney, Bob | penciller= Cardy, Nick | inker= Cardy, Nick| story= The Secret Olympic Heroes| title= Teen Titans| issue= 4| date= July–August 1966[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Haney, Bob| penciller= Novick, Irv| inker= Cardy, Nick| story= Monster Bait!| title= Teen Titans| issue= 11| date= September–October 1967[/tpl] before officially joining the team in Teen Titans #19.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Friedrich, Mike| penciller= Kane, Gil | inker= Wood, Wally| story= Stepping Stones for a Giant Killer!| title= Teen Titans| issue= 19| date= January–February 1969[/tpl] Aqualad takes a leave of absence from the group in the same issue, but makes several later guest appearances,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Skeates, Steve| penciller= Cardy, Nick| inker= Cardy, Nick| story= Blindspot| title= Teen Titans| issue= 28| date= July–August 1970[/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= Skeates, Steve| penciller= Cardy, Nick| inker= Cardy, Nick| story= Captives!| title= Teen Titans| issue= 29| date= September–October 1970[/tpl] sometimes with girlfriend Aquagirl.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Skeates, Steves| penciller= Infantino, Carmine| inker= Cardy, Nick| story= Some Call it Noise| title= Teen Titans| issue= 30| date= November–December 1970[/tpl] Neal Adams was called upon to rewrite and redraw a Teen Titans story which had been written by  Len Wein and Marv Wolfman.

The series explored events such as inner-city racial tension and protests against the Vietnam War. One storyline beginning in issue #25 (February 1970) saw the Titans deal with the accidental death of a peace activist, leading them to reconsider their methods.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 138: "Tragedy initiated a new era for the Teen Titans as told by scribe Robert Kanigher and artist Nick Cardy." As a result, the Teen Titans briefly abandoned their identities to work as ordinary civilians, but the effort was quickly abandoned. Along the way, Aqualad left the series and the character of Mr. Jupiter, who was Lilith's mentor and employer was introduced. He financially backed the Titans for a brief period. The series was canceled with #43 (January–February 1973).[tpl]cite comic| writer= Haney, Bob| penciller= Saaf, Art| inker= Cardy, Nick| story= Inherit the Howling Night!| title= Teen Titans| issue= 43| date= January–February 1973[/tpl]

===1970s revival===

The series resumed with issue #44 (November 1976).McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 171: "More than three years since Teen Titans was canceled, writers Paul Levitz and Bob Rozakis, with artist Pablo Marcos, revived the series."  The stories included the introduction of the African-American superheroine Bumblebee,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Rozakis, Bob | penciller= Delbo, Jose | inker= Colletta, Vince | story= Daddy's Little Crimefighter | title= Teen Titans | volume= | issue= 48 |date= June 1977 |publisher= |page= | panel= [/tpl] the introduction of the “Titans West” team, consisting of a number of other teen heroes including Bat-Girl (Betty Kane) and Golden Eagle[tpl]cite journal|last = Franklin|first = Chris|title = Go West, Young Heroes: The Teen Titans in La-La Land|magazine = Back Issue|issue = 65|pages = 56–58|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = July 2013[/tpl] and the introduction of Joker's Daughter in #48. The revival was short-lived and the series was canceled as of #53 (February 1978), that featured an origin story.McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 176: "The team's untold origin...was vividly transcribed by writer Bob Rozakis and artist Juan Ortiz." At the end, they realized that, now in their early 20s, they had outgrown the "Teen" Titans. In the last panel, without speaking, they go their separate ways.
The title appeared again in 1999 for the Teen Titans Annual #1, 1967 issue (ISBN 1-56389-486-6), a one-shot special that reprinted selected Silver Age stories in the 1960s-style 80-Page Giant format. An Annual issue was also published at that time.

===The New Teen Titans (1980–1996) [tpl]anchor|The Judas Contract[/tpl]===

DC Comics Presents #26 introduced a new team of Titans, anchored by Robin, Wonder Girl and Kid Flash and soon followed by The New Teen Titans #1 (November 1980). The series, created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, re-introduced Beast Boy as Changeling and introduced the machine man Cyborg, the alien Starfire and the dark empath Raven.Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 188: "New Teen Titans went on to become DC's most popular comic team of its day. Not only the springboard for the following month's The New Teen Titans'' #1, the preview's momentous story also featured the first appearance of future DC mainstays Cyborg, Starfire and Raven." Raven, an expert manipulator, forms the group to fight her demonic father Trigon the Terrible and the team remains together.
Wolfman and Pérez's working relationship quickly evolved to the point where they were plotting the series jointly. Wolfman recalled that "once George moved to the same town I lived in, only five blocks or so away, we usually got together for lunch and would work out a story over the next few hours. In many cases I would then go home and write up a plot based on it, or sometimes George would take the verbal plotting we did and take it from there."[tpl]cite news|last = Nickerson|first= Al|date = August 2006|title = Who is Donna Troy?|work = Back Issue|issue = 17|pages = 64–66|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing[/tpl]
The team's adversaries included Deathstroke the Terminator,Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 189: "Debuting in the shadows of the cover to the team's second issue, written by Marv Wolfman and meticulously illustrated by artist George Pérez, Deathstroke was...asked to kill the Teen Titans." a mercenary who takes a contract to kill the Titans to fulfill a job his son had been unable to complete. This led to perhaps the most notable Titans storyline of the era. 1984's "The Judas Contract," in Tales of the Teen Titans #42-44 and Teen Titans Annual #3[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=34&postid=147 | title=Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Awards Archives | work=CBGextra.com | accessdate=2009-03-21 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516031527/http://www.cbgxtra.com/default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=34&postid=147 | archivedate=2008-05-16[/tpl] featured a psychopathic girl named Terra with the power to manipulate earth and all earth-related materials.

====The New Teen Titans and the Uncanny X-Men====

The New Teen Titans was widely thought of as DC's answer to the increasingly popular Uncanny X-Men from Marvel Comics, as both series featured all-new members and depicted young heroes from disparate backgrounds whose internal conflicts were as integral to the series as was their combat against villains. The two teams met in the 1982 crossover one-shot entitled "Apokolips... Now", which teamed Darkseid, Deathstroke and Dark Phoenix against both teams. The story was written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Walt Simonson and Terry Austin.Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 199: "The issue, written by longtime X-Men scribe Chris Claremont and drawn by Walter Simonson was...one of the most well-received crossovers of its time - or of any time for that matter - the team-up was a huge success."[tpl]cite journal|last = Brown|first = Jonathan|title = The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans: The Breakfast Club of the Comics Crossover|magazine = Back Issue|issue = 66|pages = 65–68|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = August 2013[/tpl]

====The New Teen Titans (vol. 2)====

The New Teen Titans relaunched with a new #1 issue in August 1984Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 209: "As one of DC's most popular team books, The New Teen Titans was a natural choice to receive the deluxe paper quality and higher price point of the new Baxter format. With the regular newsstand title having already changed its name to Tales of the Teen Titans with issue #41, the path was clear for a new comic to once again be titled The New Teen Titans. Featuring the trademark writing of Marv Wolfman and the art of George Pérez, this second incarnation was a success from the start, providing readers with the perfect blend of high-quality paper with high-quality storytelling." as part of a new initiative at DC informally referred to as "hardcover/softcover". The New Teen Titans along with Legion of Super-Heroes and Batman and the Outsiders were the first and only titles included in this program. The same stories were published twice, first in a more expensive edition with higher-quality printing and paper distributed exclusively to comic book specialty stores, then republished a year later in the original format, distributed to newsstands. The title was renamed Tales of the Teen Titans, while a new concurrently published series named The New Teen Titans (vol. 2) launched with a new #1. After both titles ran new stories for one year, the former book began reprinting the latter's stories, continuing until the idea was abandoned after #91.
Issue #1 of New Teen Titans (vol. 2) created controversy when Grayson and Starfire were depicted in bed together, although it had been established for some time that they were a couple. The initial storyline, "The Terror of Trigon",[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Pérez, George| story= Shadows in the Dark!| title= The New Teen Titans| volume= 2| issue= 1| date= August 1984[/tpl] [tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Pérez, George| story= The Search for Raven| title= The New Teen Titans| volume= 2| issue= 2| date= October 1984[/tpl] [tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Tanghal, Romeo| story= Souls as White as Heaven...| title= The New Teen Titans| volume= 2| issue= 3| date= November 1984[/tpl] [tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Tanghal, Romeo| story= --Torment!| title= The New Teen Titans| volume= 2| issue= 4| date= January 1985[/tpl] [tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Pérez, George| inker= Tanghal, Romeo| story= The Terror of Trigon!| title= The New Teen Titans| volume= 2| issue= 5| date= February 1985[/tpl] featuring Raven's demon father attempting to take over Earth and Raven's own struggle to remain good despite Trigon's demonic blood inside her. Pérez left the series after issue #5.[tpl]Cite journal | title=George Pérez signs contract with DC, Takes leave of absence from Titans | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=92 | date=August 1984 | page=16[/tpl] José Luis García-López followed Pérez as the title's artist and Eduardo Barreto followed García-López. Paul Levitz scripted and wrote several issues of the Brother Blood saga when Wolfman briefly left. Pérez temporarily returned with issue #50, when the series took the name The New Titans without the "Teen" prefix, as the characters were no longer teenagers.
Issue #50 told a new origin story for Wonder Girl, her link to Wonder Woman having been severed due to retcons created in the aftermath of Crisis on Infinite Earths. Pérez sketched through issues #55, 57 and 60, while only providing layouts for issues #58-59 and 61, with artist Tom Grummett finishing pencils and Bob McLeod as inker. Pérez remained as cover inker to issues #62-67. He would return for the series finale #130 (Feb. 1996) providing cover art. Wolfman and Grummett revitalized the seriesManning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 249: "Writer Marv Wolfman had revitalized the Titans franchise yet again, with the help of his new creative partner, artist Tom Grummett." with new characters and put older characters through radical changes. Members during this time included Phantasm,[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Grummett, Tom| inker= Vey, Al| story= Paradise Lost| title= The New Titans| issue= 73| date= February 1991[/tpl] Pantha[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Grummett, Tom| inker= Vey, Al| story= When Pantha Strikes| title= The New Titans| issue= 74| date= March 1991[/tpl] and Red Star.[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Grummett, Tom| inker= Vey, Al| story= Red Star Rising| title= The New Titans| issue= 77| date= June 1991[/tpl]

As a result, the group that appeared in #130 had little resemblance to earlier lineups.

===Teen Titans Spotlight On===

Another new title was launched in August 1986, this time to focus less on the team itself than on individual Titans, hence "Spotlight".Teen Titans Spotlight at the Grand Comics Database The series aimed to "put the spotlight on individual members of the Teen Titans, one at a time and let each story dictate how many issues it should run".[tpl]cite comic| writer= Wolfman, Marv| penciller= Cowan, Denys| inker= Giordano, Dick| story= Black and White| title= Teen Titans Spotlight| issue= 1| date= August 1986[/tpl] Most storylines occupied a single issue, after the series launched with a two-part focus on Starfire and a four-issue highlighting of Jericho. One issue focused on another team, the Brotherhood of Evil. The series spanned 21 issues, culminating in a "Spotlight" on the 1960s Teen Titans team as a whole (April 1988).[tpl]cite comic| writer= Lofficier, Jean-Marc; Lofficier, Randy| penciller= Orlando, Joe| inker= Patterson, Bruce| story= The Brotherhood is Dead| title= Teen Titans Spotlight On| issue= 11| date= June 1987[/tpl]

===Team Titans===

The Team Titans were one of 100 groups sent back through time to prevent the birth of Lord Chaos, the son of Donna Troy and Terry Long. Their mission was to kill the pregnant Troy before she could give birth. Mirage, Killowat, Redwing, Terra, Dagon, Prestor Jon and Battalion made up the team.

===Teen Titans (vol. 2, 1996–1998)===

Teen Titans was written and penciled by Dan Jurgens. It began in 1996 with a new #1 (October 1996), with Pérez as inker for the first 15 issues. Atom, who had become a teenager following the events of Zero Hour, leads the brand-new team (of Prysm, Joto, Risk and Argent). Arsenal became a mentor about halfway through. The series ended in September 1998.
A contest was held in the letters pages to determine who would join the team. Robin (Tim Drake), won the vote, but editors on the Batman titles banned his appearance, forcing Jurgens to use Captain Marvel Jr. instead.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] His inclusion failed to boost sales and the series was then canceled.

===Titans (1999–2002)===

The team returned in a three-issue limited series, JLA/Titans: The Technis Imperative,Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 285: "Writer Devin Grayson and artist/co-plotter Phil Jimenez revived another stalled DC property in the JLA/Titans miniseries." featuring nearly every Titan and showcased the return of Cyborg. This led into Titans, written by Devin Grayson,Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 287: "Writer Devin Grayson, alongside artist Mark Buckingham, relaunched the Titans in a new ongoing series." starting with Titans Secret Files #1 (March 1999).
This team consisted of Nightwing, Troia, Arsenal, Tempest, Wally West and Starfire, Cyborg and Changeling, Damage and Argent. One new member, Jesse Quick, joined. This team lasted until issue #50 (2002). The West Coast branch of the team, Titans L.A., appeared once, in the pages of Titans Secret Files #2.
Between Teen Titans and Titans, a new generation of young heroes formed a team in Young Justice, consisting of Superboy, Robin, Impulse, Wonder Girl, Secret and Arrowette. The two series concluded with the three-issue limited series Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day, which led to two new series: Teen Titans and Outsiders.

===Teen Titans (vol. 3, 2003–2011)===

Writer Geoff Johns' Teen Titans series began in 2003.Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 310: "None the Teen Titans series had reached the heights of the Marv Wolfman and George Pérez era until writer Geoff Johns and artist Mike McKone's relaunch." Most of the members had been part of Young Justice. Johns wrote the book for forty-five issues. Adam Beechen then wrote four issues from #46 to #49. Sean McKeever wrote from #50 through #71.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/030919-Titans-McKeever.html | title=Sean McKeever Leaves Teen Titans With #71 |first= Vaneta|last= Rogers | publisher=Newsarama | date=March 19, 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090323084056/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/030919-Titans-McKeever.html|archivedate= April 28, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= April 28, 2012|quote= [/tpl][tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20483 | title=Sean McKeever Leaves Teen Titans |first= |last= | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=March 19, 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090324094117/http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20483 |archivedate= April 28, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= April 28, 2012|quote= [/tpl] Following McKeever, Bryan Q.

Starfire left for the Outsiders. During the “Insiders” crossover with The Outsiders (issues #24–25), Superboy comes under Lex Luthor's control and attacks the team, afterwards taking a leave of absence that ends during Infinite Crisis. The team relocated to the west coast, locating in San Francisco instead of the traditional New York City location. The new Titans Tower has a memorial hall with statues of the fallen Titans.

====One Year Later: The new Teen Titans====

One year after Infinite Crisis, Robin has returned to the Teen Titans while Wonder Girl has quit to fight the Brotherhood of Evil, Starfire is missing in action after going into space, Raven's whereabouts are unknown and Beast Boy has left to join the new Doom Patrol along with Bumblebee and Herald (now called Vox). Speedy is on an island with Connor Hawke. Kid Flash becomes the fourth Flash. Cyborg is damaged and has been inactive since his return from space, but 16-year-old genius twins Wendy and Marvin, repair him, giving him new abilities. New members include Kid Devil and Ravager.

Robin cures Batgirl and she, along with Duela Dent, defeats Deathstroke's team.
Soon after, events related to the Countdown story arc impact the Titans. Duela Dent andBart Allen are killed. Cyborg leaves, Supergirl joins and Blue Beetle is invited to train.
The Titans Tomorrow return, allied with Lex Luthor, to alter the present to fit their future. During the fight, Miss Martian's future self reveals the rationale behind the Sinestro Corps and their war to subjugate the universe. The vision spurs Miss Martian to free Robin, who again confronts his future self, Batman. Cassie intervenes and changes the future by kissing Robin, causing the future versions to fade away. The Titans then join the fight against the Sinestro Corps.
After the encounter with future selves, Supergirl quits. Cassie and Tim begin a relationship, while Kid Devil pines for Rose. Miss Martian finds that her mind was implanted with a piece of her future demented psyche. Kid Devil is left in Titans Tower alone and throws a massive party for local Titans fans, which leads to him being captured by Dreadbolt.
Later Ravager and the twins are attacked inside the tower by Persuader and Copperhead, who are being directed by the Clock King. Disruptor is sent to capture Miss Martian. Clock King's group is the Terror Titans. He intends to sell his captives to the "Dark Side Club"[tpl]cite comic| writer= McKeever, Sean| penciller= Rodriguez, Carlos| inker= Palmiotti, Jimmy| story= The Other Half| title= Teen Titans| volume= 3| issue= 58| date= June 2008[/tpl] to fight in the combat arena. M'gann frees Kid Devil from Clock King. Robin, Wonder Girl and Blue Beetle help defeat the Terror Titans. Following the attack, Kid Devil sets out to capture Shockwave and is helped by Blue Beetle. Although they argue the whole time, they eventually stop Shockwave. After the battle Eddie takes the name Red Devil, along with a new costume. Miss Martian suddenly leaves the team assuring them she'd return.
After the Batman R.I.P storyline, Robin leaves and Wonder Girl leads the team. Red Devil loses his powers after Brother Blood absorbs them. Miss Martian returns with several teen heroes liberated from the Dark Side Club. A new team is formed: Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle and the now powerless Red Devil are joined by Kid Eternity and Static, with Aquagirl, Miss Martian and Bombshell signing up.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17453 | title=CCI: McDuffie Reaches Milestone with DC |first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud| publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=July 27, 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080914122141/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17453|archivedate= April 28, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= April 28, 2012|quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite comic| writer= McKeever, Sean| penciller= Barrows, Eddy| inker= Jose, Ruy; Ferreira, Julio| story= The New Deal, Part 1: Choices| title= Teen Titans| volume= 3| issue= 66| date= February 2009[/tpl] In Teen Titans #74, Red Devil is killed and Kid Eternity is kidnapped by the Calculator.

===Titans (vol. 2, 2008–2011)===

A second ongoing Teen Titans series, titled Titans, launched in April 2008, written by Judd Winick.Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 333: "Writer Judd Winick and penciller Ian Churchill produced a Titans series to please both modern-day fans and those of the classic Marv Wolfman/George Pérez era." Issue one was drawn by Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund, issue 2 by Joe Benitez and Victor Llamas. The opening storyline follows the events of the Teen Titans East Special one-shot released in November 2007, revealing that Cyborg's team survived the attack, except Power Boy, dead after being impaled. The team's new line up consists of former New Teen Titans Nightwing, Wally West, Donna Troy, Beast Boy, Raven, Cyborg, Red Arrow and Starfire.Wizard Magazine #193 (November 2007)
In the series' first story, Trigon makes a series of attacks on every member, former or current, of the Teen Titans and Trigon has "another child" that, unlike Raven, will assist him in his attack. After reclaiming Titans Island and establishing a headquarters on the East River, Cyborg sets out to create an East Coast Titans team. However, during a training session, the team was massacred by an unseen force. Though Cyborg survives, Titans' members past and present are attacked by demonic entities across the globe. Raven, sensing Trigon's presence once again, calls upon her former Titans allies to defeat her fiendish father.
After rescuing several Titans and questioning Trigon himself, the Titans learn that Trigon's three children have prepared his second invasion for him. Raven's three grown half brothers — Jacob, Jared and Jesse are responsible. Working as a team, the Titans thwart the Sons of Trigon and stop Trigon's invasion plan. Following this adventure, Raven chooses her adopted family over her biological family, Red Arrow decided to join his former teammates (although both he and Flash retain their JLA membership) and the Titans were back together as a team.
Following this, the team settles at Titans Tower (the New York base), to recover from the events. While Dick and Kory attempt to make a decision on where their relationship will lead, Raven and Beast Boy go out on a "not-a-date". During this, Raven reveals that since she faced her brothers, she has begun to feel as if she is losing control and slipping back under her father's influence. Although Beast Boy rejects the idea, he is unexpectedly blind-sided as Raven gives in to her darker side, under the influence of her half-brother's coaxing. Using her teleporting powers, she and the sons of Trigon vanish, leaving a distraught Beast Boy to warn the others. Using a gemstone that carries Raven's pure essence within it, the Titans free Raven of her father's evil. As a result, Raven leaves each Titan with an amulet that can be used to cleanse any evil influence from her body.
Following this, Jericho arrives, frantically asking for help to separate himself from Match's body. Jericho has turned renegade again and fights the Titans. He is under the control of the numerous people that he has taken command of over the years. Nightwing resigns from the Titans due to his new responsibilities in Gotham.

====Brightest Day: Titans - Villains for Hire====

A Comic-Con announcement stated that Cyborg, Donna Troy and Starfire were leaving the team to pursue the JLA.

The final issue of the limited series, Justice League: The Rise of Arsenal ended with an advertisement stating that Arsenal's storyline would continue.
The team debuted in the one-shot, Titans: Villains for Hire, where they are hired to assassinate Ryan Choi (Atom) in his home in Ivy Town.

====Teen Titans (2003–2006)====

A Teen Titans animated series ran on Cartoon Network and The WB from July 19, 2003, to January 16, 2006. Drawn in an anime-style, the show featured a 1980s-era lineup composed of Robin, Starfire, Beast Boy, Raven and Cyborg as teenagers, voiced respectively by Scott Menville, Hynden Walch, Greg Cipes, Tara Strong and Khary Payton. The series adapted some Wolfman/Pérez storylines (including "The Judas Contract" and "The Terror of Trigon") and featured versions of many other Titans characters, including Aqualad, Speedy, Slade, Bumblebee and Terra. The show generally developed new stories and introduced new characters.
Each of the five seasons featured a main story arc, as well as stand-alone episodes. Season 1 focused on Robin's search for the line between right and wrong, tested by the lengths to which he goes in his obsession with Slade. Season 2 is based on "The Judas Contract"; the Titans meet Terra, a well-meaning but confused girl who repeatedly struggles with self-control. She betrays the Titans for Slade but later turns on him. Season 3 features Cyborg's struggle to appreciate his own humanity, despite occupying a mostly robotic body. He undergoes numerous ordeals to 'become his own man', including conflicts with Brother Blood and the Hive, as well as temporarily leading the Titans East. Season 4, an adaptation of "The Terror of Trigon", addresses Raven's struggle to control her own fate. She ushers the demon Trigon into the Titans' dimension, but is supported by her friends and ultimately manages to undo the end of the world. In season 5, the Teen Titans come against the "Brotherhood of Evil", composed of beast boy's past enemies. The final few episodes see Beast Boy develop courage and leadership, rallying the remaining teen heroes from around the world and organizing a last-ditch strike on the Brotherhood of Evil. After the show's completion, the movie Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo premiered on Kids' WB! on September 16, 2006. There were some indications throughout the show that Robin and Starfire were interested in each other romantically and they finally kiss at the end of the movie.
The series spawned a related comic book, Teen Titans Go! and three video games.

====Teen Titans: The Judas Contract====

At the San Diego Comic-Con International in 2006, a Judas Contract animated movie was announced. Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, creators of The New Teen Titans, were assigned to work on the direct-to-DVD movie.

Despite its title, the show is not an adaptation of the Young Justice comic series, but rather, an adaptation of the entire DC Universe with a focus on young superheroes.[tpl]YouTube|id=DzoopkET0m8|title=DC Animated Showcase: Greg Weisman Interview, Part 1 |date= July 30, 2010|archiveurl= |archivedate= April 28, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= April 28, 2012|quote= [/tpl]
The television series is based on a cross between the Teen Titans and Young Justice franchises, drawing influences from 1960s Teen Titans run and the 1990s Young Justice run in addition to recent Teen Titans comics. The line-up reflects the variety of sources on which the show is based: Superboy, Robin, Wally West as Kid Flash, Miss Martian, Artemis and Kaldur'ahm as Aqualad. Later in the first season, the team adds Zatanna, Rocket and Red Arrow to its roster. In the show's second season, the Cassandra Sandsmark version of Wonder Girl, the Tim Drake version of Robin, Beast Boy, the Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl, Bumblebee, the Jamie Reyes version of Blue Beetle and Mal Duncan joined the team.

====DC Nation (2012)====

During the premiere of Green Lantern: The Animated Series on Cartoon Network, a new block of animation with the Green Lantern and Young Justice shows alongside animated shorts was announced for 2012. One of these shorts previewed was a Chibi-version of the Teen Titans using the art style and voice actors of the Teen Titans TV series. Formerly known as the New Teen Titans, the principal cast members reprised their roles as the lead Titans.

====Teen Titans Go! (2013–Present)====

After a test run with DC Nation's New Teen Titans shorts, a new full-length series called Teen Titans Go! premiered in 2013 on Cartoon Network, with the voice actors from the original Teen Titans animated series reprising their roles. This series takes a humorous look at the Titans' day-to-day lives when they are not fighting crime.

====Mad (2010)====

In season 2 of MAD, Cyborg appeared in a contest and in the next episode, the Teen Titans (Robin, Raven, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Starfire, Blue Beetle, Superboy, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl and Aqualad) get spoofed along with Titanic.

===Cultural references===

In a skit during the Robot Chicken episode "Vegetable Funfest", the animated series Titans (Robin, Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy and Raven) are out-matched by a giant tentacled monster and they allow two new "heroes" to join their ranks - Beavis and Butt-head. In "They Took My Thumbs", the original Titans line-up (Robin, Wonder Girl, Speedy, Kid Flash and Aqualad) join their mentors on the Justice League's satellite headquarters for "Bring Your Sidekick to Work Day". Various hijinks ensue such as Speedy shooting an arrow from the Justice League satellite and Kid Flash ripping off Wonder Woman's outfit. At the end, the kids are teleported and immolated in a lava pit on another planet. The older heroes blame Martian Manhunter (who they suspected of being jealous of them for having sidekicks), but he blames his "invisible sidekick' Martian Boyhunter for the sabotage. As they all jump on Martian Manhunter to beat him up, back at the teleportation console Martian Boyhunter materializes, snickering to himself at the mischief he created.
