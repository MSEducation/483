[[Implementation of bus rapid transit by country]]

CATEGORIES: Bus rapid transit

This page describes the implementation of bus rapid transit in different countries, and gives operational and historical details by country, as well as giving details of confirmed plans or proposals for new BRT systems.

===Nigeria===

http://allafrica.com/stories/200704220288.html http://www.lamata-ng.com/brt.htm It is expected operate on eight routes on special BRT Lanes running through the city but will expand its operation.
First phase of the Lagos BRT to run from Mile 12 through Ikorodu Road and Funsho Williams Avenue up to CMS is now in operation (officially commissioned on March 17, 2008).
It is projected that the system will carry up to 10,000 passengers per direction per hour during peak travel hours.
The LAMATA BRT corridor is about 22 kilometres in length.
Two operators, NURTW Cooperative and LAGBUS, a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company are contributing about 180 high capacity buses for the implementation of the first phase Mile 12 to CMS BRT Lite system.
It is the cheapest to develop in the world costing only $1.6 million/km for the 22-km route.
Cost of first corridor (Mile 12 to CMS): N4.5 billion (~US$35 million). This includes elevated segregation barriers, road repairs on bus and service lanes, desilting of blocked drainage channels and provision of bus stops.

Just like most of the current transport projects, the system will be implemented into phases. Phase 1 of the estimated R2-billion project, which is now reaching the end of the operational planning phase, will run arti-culated ‘right-of-way’ buses along dedicated median bus lanes in both directions across Johannesburg by 2010, covering almost half of Johannesburg.BRT offers celebratory free rides on opening day M&G
The 120-km Phase 1 route will include 150 stations, eight terminals and six depots. Phase 1A, comprising a 40-km route with 48 stations, will be completed by April 2009, ahead of the FIFA Confederations Cup, while Phase 1B will add 86 km and 102 stations to the system ahead of the 2010 World Cup.
According to the City of Johannesburg website, one of the most important aspects of this new system is that it will be fully integrated with other transport networks. Rea Vaya will not be competing with other transport systems such as the South African Rail Commuter Corporation or the Gautrain.http://www.joburg.org.za/content/view/3043/266/
The BRT busses will make use of dedicated median lanes (as opposed to kerbside lanes) to be developed on current road alignments, thereby minimising costs. Busses will operate at two to four minute intervals during peak periods, and seven to ten minutes during off-peak periods. The system will be operational from five in the morning to midnight.http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=114600
Other Cities that are in the process of implementing the BRT systems are:

Before it even had the name, Bus Rapid Transit first got major backing in the United States with the rise of federal funding for urban mass transportation during the 1960s. The first exclusive busway in the United States was the El Monte Busway, an exclusive bus lane between El Monte and Los Angeles, California. It opened in 1973. Today, American BRT initiatives receive a great deal of support from the Federal Transit Administration. Planned BRT lines are now eligible to be included in the FTA's New Starts program, which was formerly reserved only for rail projects.
That notwithstanding, the FTA, in announcing its New Starts for 2005, has rated the New Britain-Hartford Busway (Connecticut) "Recommended" but Phase III of the MBTA's Silver Line BRT project "Not Recommended" based on "MBTA's unreasonable operating cost assumptions." This implies that BRT will be subject to the same scrutiny as rail projects, though (also as with rail projects) the FTA will work with the localities to see if projects can be brought into compliance with requirements.

===China===

Kunming developed China's first BRT system starting in 1999.http://www.itdp.org/index.php/projects/update/a_new_generation_of_bus_rapid_transit_systems_open_in_china/ There are also systems operating in Beijing (2005 with 3 routes over 34.5 km, 60 stations and 4 terminals), Shanghai (2005), Guangzhou (2010) (1 route 22.5 km with 26 stations), Hangzhou (2006 with 2 routes over 18.8 km, 50 stations), Chongqing (2007 with 1 route over 6 km, 9 stations and 1 terminal), Dalian (2007), and Xiamen (1 route on 38.2 with 31 stations). As of 2008 there are half-a-dozen BRT systems in different stages of implementation.
In Hong Kong bus lanes and bus-only roads are designated extensively. Some roads, including Des Vœux Road Central, Caine Road (westbound), King's Road (eastbound) are open only to buses and minibuses. Bus routes serving on these roads do not compete with other vehicles for road space.

===India===

India has a number of operational BRT systems and many more under construction 
Existing BRT systems with segregated lanes
Existing BRT Systems without segregated lanes
BRT Systems Under construction
BRT systems exist in Pune, Ahmedabad, Jaipur  and Delhi with segregated lane. And exist in Indore, Mumbai where they run on normal roads. But these buses are high capacity and thus government has characterised them as BRTs.

===Indonesia===

===Iran===

Tehran Bus Rapid Transit was inaugurated on January 14, 2008. Tehran has 4 BRT line.
The total length of BRT in Tehran is about 100 km that will be increased to 300 km in future.

===Jordan===

According to Greater Amman Municipality, The construction of the first phase BRT in Amman had started last Friday June 25, 2010 starting phase 1 and it will be completed at 2012. This is according to the GAM master plan for phase 1.
BRT Phase 1: Routes
Route 1: (15.46 km ) Mahatta to Sweileh
Route 2: (6.79 km ) Muhajireen to Sports City
Route 3: (7.88 km) Mahatta to Customs Square

===Pakistan===

Construction of two more lines of this system also started in January 2014.

===Philippines===

The Cebu Bus Rapid Transit System is a proposed mass transit system for the City of Cebu located within the greater Cebu Metropolitan area. It is expected to become the first operational Bus Rapid Transit project in the Philippines when it becomes operational late 2014. The 16 kilometre route traverses Cebu City from Bulacao in the south-west to Talamban in the north-east, linking the following key destinations; Central Business District, Capitol Site, Ayala Shopping Mall and a proposed tributary to SM Shopping Mall. A spur to the 300-hectare Cebu South Reclamation Project (SRP) is also planned as developers Filinvest seek to integrate BRT provision into their development plans.
The feasibility of a BRT scheme for Metro Manila is being studied.

===Thailand===

Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, has been working on a BRT system for the past few years. The first route starts from Sathon running along Narathiwat Ratchanakharin Rd., then turns right at Rama III Rd., crossing the Chao Phraya River at Rama III Bridge and follows Ratchadaphisek Rd. before turning right at Ratchahruek Rd at the end of its route.
At the Sathon-Narathiwat Ratchanakharin interestion, there is a walkway connecting BRT Sathon with BTS Chong Nonsi station.
The Bangkok BRT started operating on 15 May 2010 on a free-trial basis.

===Vietnam===

The Hanoi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is one of the components of Hanoi Urban Transport Development Project which has been approved by Hanoi People's Committee at Decision 1837/QĐ-UBND dated May 10, 2007. This World Bank funded ODA project is an important step in improving the city's urban transportation network and strengthening public transport capacity. 
The Hanoi BRT project is under construction.

Australia has 4 BRTs in place:
Melbourne, Victoria operates the SmartBus system which contains elements of BRT infrastructure but uses relatively little dedicated bus lanes.
Generally, investment in BRTs is covered by state government transport agencies, rather than by corporations, since most major public transport services in the country are owned and operated by the same departments.
