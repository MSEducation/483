[[HMS Abelia (K184)]]

CATEGORIES: Flower-class corvettes of the Royal Navy, 1940 ships

HMS ''Abelia'' was a [tpl]sclass2|Flower|corvette[/tpl] that served in the Royal Navy.
She was launched on 28 November 1940, and was fitted for minesweeping. She served in World War II; her commanding officer for parts of 1943 and 1944 was Lieutenant Orme G. Stuart.
On 9 January 1944 Abelia encountered a U-Boat while on convoy escort duty, and moved to attack with depth charges. Lieutenant Stuart ordered an increase in speed at 950 yards to prevent being torpedoed, not knowing that the U-boat was equipped with T5 torpedoes, for which he would have needed to increase speed at 700 yards. Abelia was hit and lost her rudder, and the U-boat escaped.
She was sold in 1947 and became the merchant vessel Kraft in 1948. She was renamed Arne Skontorp in 1954. She was eventually scrapped in December 1966.
