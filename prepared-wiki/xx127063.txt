Richard "The Alien" Grant (b. October 17, 1973 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a former light-heavyweight boxer, and former EBA Light Heavyweight and Super Middleweight champion. He had a career record of 19-15-1, with 5 wins coming by way of knockout.
Although Grant made a name for himself by fighting contenders Jeff Lacy and Antwun Echols, he is best known for the aftermath of his nationally-televised bout on November 23, 2001 at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York with James Butler.  After winning a unanimous decision over the heavily favored Butler, Grant met Butler in the middle of the ring for an expected exchange of congratulations. Suddenly, Butler hit the unsuspecting Grant with a right hook to the jaw. Grant's jaw had been knocked temporarily out of its socket. Grant received 26 stitches; he also had some loose teeth and experienced severe headaches [tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/27/sports/boxing-boxer-barred-and-charged-for-sucker-punch-after-loss.html |title=BOXING; Boxer Barred and Charged For Sucker Punch After Loss |last=Wong |first=Edward |date=November 27, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=September 12, 2011[/tpl]; Butler was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and later served time in prison for his actions.
