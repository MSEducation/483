Chaekgye of Baekje (died 298, r. 286–298) was the ninth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.  He was the eldest son of King Goi.
His wife, whose name is recorded as Bogwa (보과, 寶菓), was a daughter of the governor of Daifang commandery.  This marital alliance contributed to friction between the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo and Baekje, after Goguryeo attacked Daifang in 286 and Chaekgye sent troops to Daifang's aid.  Chaekgye fortified the Wiryeseong, Acha Mountain Fortress and Sa-seong to defend the Han River valley against expected retaliation.
In 298, Baekje was invaded by Maek-in (맥인, 貊人, probably referring to Dongye) and the Lelang commandery, and Chaekgye was killed.
