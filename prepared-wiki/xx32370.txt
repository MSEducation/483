==Early life==

Hawk was born on May 12, 1968 in Carlsbad, California, to Nancy and Frank Peter Rupert Hawk, and was raised in San Diego, California.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Hawk-Tony.html | title = Tony Noonga vert skater hawk Biography - Skateboarding to the rescue, A skateboard slump, Back in the game | work = Notablebiographies.com | accessdate = March 25, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.biography.com/articles/Tony-Hawk-40989 | title = Tony Hawk Biography | work = Biography.com | accessdate = October 20, 2010[/tpl] When Hawk was young, he was described as being "hyperactive," and his mother says that he was "so hard on himself and expected himself to do so many things." One time, Tony struck out in baseball and was so distraught that he hid in a ravine and had to be "physically coaxed out" by his father. His frustration with himself was so harsh that his parents had him psychologically evaluated at school. The results were that Tony was "gifted," he tested with an I.Q. of 144,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500164_162-532506.html |title=Tony Hawk Takes Off |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl] and school advisors recommended placing him in advanced classes.
His parents supported his skateboarding because it served as an outlet for his excessive energy, and as Hawk's skills developed, he became a professional skateboarder at age fourteen. Hawk was the National Skateboard Association world champion for twelve consecutive years.
Hawk attended Jean Farb Middle School from 1980 to 1981, and eventually returned for the show, Homecoming with Rick Reilly, where he set up a ramp and did a demonstration.

===Amusement park ride===

A series of amusement park rides known as Tony Hawk's Big Spin were built in three Six Flags parks in 2007 and 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/tony_hawk_build/ |title=Tony Hawk Builds a Roller Coaster | Underwire |publisher=Wired.com |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl] The ride was originally billed as the "total Tony Hawk experience" and was designed to have the look and feel of a giant red-and-black skatepark. It offered a full "extreme sports" experience, with monitors in the queue lines displaying highlights of the history of action sports and a large spinning Tony Hawk figure crowning the ride. In 2010 Six Flags cancelled its license and the rides were renamed to Pandemonium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/coasters/yellowpages/coasters/pandemonium_sfdk.shtml |title=Pandemonium - Six Flags Discovery Kingdom - Roller Coasters |publisher=Ultimaterollercoaster.com |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl] The ride at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom was moved to Six Flags Mexico in 2012 to make way for a new ride known as Superman: Ultimate Flight. Additionally, a water park ride called Tony Hawk's Halfpipe (renamed The Halfpipe in 2011) was opened at Six Flags America in Bowie, Maryland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waterfunproducts.com/portfolio/tony-hawk-halfpipe.asp |title=Waterfun Products |publisher=Waterfun Products |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15[/tpl]

And, he called my house when I was fifteen, and was, like, "Do you wanna do something with us?", not knowing anything about me. Yeah, Tony's the man, sure, he's the best.[tpl]cite web|title=Andrew Reynolds on Bake and Destroy, Riley Hawk, Figgy and More on Free Lunch ...|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOczLcTn4S8|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=19 January 2013|author=RIDEChannel|format=Video upload|date=17 October 2012[/tpl]

 ... I was just, kinda like, "it's kinda touchy, you know what I mean, like?" It's kinda weird, you know? Tony's kid, he rides for Birdhouse. But I look at it, like, I picture him on Baker, you know what I mean? So we just approached Tony, "Yeah, we wanna talk to Riley about maybe gettin' some Baker boards, or something like that." And Tony's like, "Man, he's rippin', he's nineteen years-old, he can, you know, it's really up to him. You guys talk to him, you know?" So we just kinda said, "You wanna get some boards?", he's like, "I'm down, man!" And I look at it, like, there would be no Baker without Tony and Birdhouse. I know it's an ongoing process, you know? Tony quits to start Birdhouse; I quit to start Baker; my guys quit to start a new brand, you know? It's just an ongoing thing.
