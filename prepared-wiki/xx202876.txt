Mihăileşti is a town located in Giurgiu County, Romania. It administers three villages: Drăgănescu, Novaci and Popeşti.

Popeşti village is the location of an important archeological discovery: a large Dacian settlement believed by some historians such as Vasile Pârvan and professor Radu Vulpe to be the Argedava mentioned in the Decree of Dionysopolis. This ancient source links Argedava with the Dacian king Burebista, and it is believed to be his court or capital.
