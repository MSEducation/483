On occasion when either the tank army was unavailable, or the terrain was not suitable for the employment of large number of tanks and self-propelled artillery, only a cavalry mechanized group was used.p.147, Glantz The Front mobile group was usually used to deepen the penetration of the enemy front 70-100km or more.p.123, Simpkin The organisation of the Front mobile group was retained by the Soviet Army during the Cold War in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany known as second echelon tank forces.p.122, Simpkin The employment of the tank armies is intended to create a local numerical superiority on a narrow front of 3-5:1 in manpower, 6-8:1 in tanks and artillery, and 3-5:1 in Combat aircraft.p.147, Glantz
