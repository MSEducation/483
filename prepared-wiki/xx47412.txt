There is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver. The scientific consensus is reflected in, for example, reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and US Global Change Research Program.
Although the IPCC AR4 concluded that “warming of the climate system is unequivocal,” public debate over the evidence for global warming continues.[ref]Edited quote from public-domain source:

The methods used to derive the principal estimates of global surface temperature trends — HadCRUT3, NOAA and NASA/GISS — are largely independent. So, the spread of the three estimates indicates the likely degree of uncertainty in the evolution of the global mean surface temperature. Independently derived estimates of tropospheric temperature trends for the whole troposphere channel from satellites differ by an order of magnitude more than do estimated surface temperature trends.
Numerous studies attest to the robustness of the global LSAT records and their non-reliance on individual stations. Evidence from recent re-analyses lends further support.
The IPCC conclusion that “warming of the climate system is unequivocal” does not rest solely upon LSAT records.  These constitute only one line of evidence among many, for example: uptake of heat by the oceans, melting of land ice such as glaciers, the associated rise in sea level and increased atmospheric surface humidity (see the figure opposite and effects of global warming).  If the land surface records were systematically flawed and the globe had not really warmed, then it would be almost impossible to explain the concurrent changes in this wide range of indicators produced by many independent groups.  The observed changes in a broad range of indicators provide a self-consistent story of a warming world.
