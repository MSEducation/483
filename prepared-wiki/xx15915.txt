Industrial hemp products are made from Cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the UN Narcotics Convention, some Cannabis strains have been bred to produce minimal levels of THC, the principal psychoactive constituent responsible for the high associated with it and which is obtained through the dried flowers of Cannabis plants selectively bred to produce high levels of THC and other psychoactive cannabinoids. Various extracts including hashish and hash oil are also produced from the plant.Erowid. 2006. Cannabis Basics. Retrieved on 25 February 2007

==Etymology==

The word cannabis is from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|κάνναβις[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc|kánnabis[/tpl]) (see Latin [tpl]lang|la|cannabis[/tpl]),"cannabis" OED Online. July 2009. Oxford University Press. 2009. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50032466 which was originally Scythian or Thracian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannabis|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] It is related to the Persian kanab, the English canvas and possibly even to the English hemp (Old English [tpl]lang|ags|hænep[/tpl]). In modern Hebrew, [tpl]hebrew|קַנַּבּוֹס[/tpl] [tpl]transl|he|qannabōs[/tpl] modern pronunciation: [tpl]IPA-he|kanaˈbos|[/tpl] is used but [tpl]hebrew|מַעֲלֶה עָשָׁן[/tpl] [tpl]transl|he|maʿăleh ʿāšān[/tpl] modern pronunciation: [tpl]IPA-he|ma.aˈle aˈʃan|[/tpl] (smoke bringer) is the ancient term.Not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible but in the Talmud, Keriotot 6a (see Tractate Keritot, at page 24 for footnote 26) and Yoma 53a, used "in minute quantities" in incense to make the fragrant smoke rise -- its identification with Cannabis is uncertain, especially since Maimonides explained (Kele Hammikdash, ii, sec. 3) that its identity was known only to those trained in making incense, "a secret that was imparted by tradition". Old Akkadian qunnabtu, Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian qunnabu were used to refer to the plant meaning "a way to produce smoke."[tpl]cite book|author=Reinhard K.

==Description==

Cannabis is an annual, dioecious, flowering herb. The leaves are palmately compound or digitate, with serrate leaflets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/termlf1.htm|title=Leaf Terminology (Part 1)|publisher=Waynesword.palomar.edu|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.
The leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern that enables persons poorly familiar with the plant to distinguish a Cannabis leaf from unrelated species that have confusingly similar leaves (see illustration). As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip. However,the serration vein originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of, not the first notch down, but the next notch. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will actually pass tangent to the notch, but often it will pass by at a small distance, and when that happens a spur vein (occasionally a pair of such spur veins) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. This venation pattern varies slightly among varieties, but in general it enables one to tell Cannabis leaves from superficially similar leaves without difficulty and without special equipment. Tiny samples of Cannabis plants also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, but that requires special expertise and equipment.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub. E & S Livingstone 1962
Cannabis normally has imperfect flowers, with staminate "male" and pistillate "female" flowers occurring on separate plants.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(97)01012-1|title=Genetics of sex determination in flowering plants|year=1997|last1=Lebel-Hardenack|first1=Sabine|last2=Grant|first2=Sarah R.|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=130–6[/tpl] It is not unusual, however, for individual plants to bear both male and female flowers.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10681-004-4758-7|title=The sexual differentiation of Cannabis sativa L.: A morphological and molecular study|year=2004|last1=Moliterni|first1=V.

Male flowers are normally borne on loose panicles, and female flowers are borne on racemes.Bouquet, R. J. 1950. Cannabis. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

It is also known as hemp, although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of Cannabis cultivated for non-drug use. Cannabis plants produce a group of chemicals called cannabinoids, which produce mental and physical effects when consumed.
Cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other compounds are secreted by glandular trichomes that occur most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bracts of female plants.Mahlberg, Paul G. and Eun Soo Kim. 2001.

==Taxonomy==

The genus Cannabis was formerly placed in the Nettle (Urticaceae) or Mulberry (Moraceae) family, and later, along with the Humulus genus (hops), in a separate family, the Hemp family (Cannabaceae sensu stricto).Schultes, R. E., A. Hofmann, and C. Rätsch. 2001. The nectar of delight. In: Plants of the Gods 2nd ed., Healing Arts Press, Rochester, Vermont, pp. 92–101. ISBN 0-89281-979-0 Recent phylogenetic studies based on cpDNA restriction site analysis and gene sequencing strongly suggest that the Cannabaceae sensu stricto arose from within the former Celtidaceae family, and that the two families should be merged to form a single monophyletic family, the Cannabaceae sensu lato.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s006060170041|title=Further evidence for paraphyly of the Celtidaceae from the chloroplast gene mat K|year=2001|last1=Song|first1=B.-H.|last2=Wang|first2=X.-Q.|last3=Li|first3=F.-Z.|last4=Hong|first4=D.-Y.|journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution|volume=228|pages=107–15[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.3732/ajb.89.9.1531|title=Urticalean rosids: Circumscription, rosid ancestry, and phylogenetics based on rbcL, trnL-F, and ndhF sequences|year=2002|last1=Sytsma|first1=K.

Cannabis plants produce a unique family of terpeno-phenolic compounds called cannabinoids, which produce the "high" one experiences from consuming marijuana. There are 483 identifiable chemical constituents known to exist in the cannabis plant,[tpl]cite web|url=http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000636|title=What chemicals are in marijuana and its byproducts?|publisher=ProCon.org|year=2009|accessdate=2013-01-13[/tpl] and at least 85 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the plant.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2010.03.004|title=Antidepressant-like effect of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids isolated from Cannabis sativa L|year=2010|last1=El-Alfy|first1=Abir T.|last2=Ivey|first2=Kelly|last3=Robinson|first3=Keisha|last4=Ahmed|first4=Safwat|last5=Radwan|first5=Mohamed|last6=Slade|first6=Desmond|last7=Khan|first7=Ikhlas|last8=Elsohly|first8=Mahmoud|last9=Ross|first9=Samir|journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior|volume=95|issue=4|pages=573–82|pmid=20332000|display-authors=9|pmc=2866040[/tpl] The two cannabinoids usually produced in greatest abundance are cannabidiol (CBD) and/or Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but only THC is psychoactive.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] Since the early 1970s, Cannabis plants have been categorized by their chemical phenotype or "chemotype," based on the overall amount of THC produced, and on the ratio of THC to CBD.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=4744553|year=1973|last1=Small|first1=E|last2=Beckstead|first2=HD|title=Common cannabinoid phenotypes in 350 stocks of Cannabis|volume=36|issue=2|pages=144–65|journal=Lloydia[/tpl] Although overall cannabinoid production is influenced by environmental factors, the THC/CBD ratio is genetically determined and remains fixed throughout the life of a plant.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12586720|year=2003|last1=De Meijer|first1=EP|last2=Bagatta|first2=M|last3=Carboni|first3=A|last4=Crucitti|first4=P|last5=Moliterni|first5=VM|last6=Ranalli|first6=P|last7=Mandolino|first7=G|title=The inheritance of chemical phenotype in Cannabis sativa L|volume=163|issue=1|pages=335–46|pmc=1462421|journal=Genetics[/tpl] Non-drug plants produce relatively low levels of THC and high levels of CBD, while drug plants produce high levels of THC and low levels of CBD.

Whether the drug and non-drug, cultivated and wild types of Cannabis constitute a single, highly variable species, or the genus is polytypic with more than one species, has been a subject of debate for well over two centuries. This is a contentious issue because there is no universally accepted definition of a species.Small, E. 1979. Fundamental aspects of the species problem in biology. In: The Species Problem in Cannabis, vol. 1: Science. Corpus Information Services, Toronto, Canada, pp. 5–63. ISBN 0-919217-11-7 One widely applied criterion for species recognition is that species are "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."Rieger, R., A. Michaelis, and M. M. Green. 1991. Glossary of Genetics, 5th ed. Springer-Verlag, pp. 458–459. ISBN 0-387-52054-6 Populations that are physiologically capable of interbreeding, but morphologically or genetically divergent and isolated by geography or ecology, are sometimes considered to be separate species. Physiological barriers to reproduction are not known to occur within Cannabis, and plants from widely divergent sources are interfertile. However, physical barriers to gene exchange (such as the Himalayan mountain range) might have enabled Cannabis gene pools to diverge before the onset of human intervention, resulting in speciation.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10722-003-4452-y|title=Genetic evidence for speciation in Cannabis (Cannabaceae)|year=2005|last1=Hillig|first1=Karl W.|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|volume=52|issue=2|pages=161–80[/tpl] It remains controversial whether sufficient morphological and genetic divergence occurs within the genus as a result of geographical or ecological isolation to justify recognition of more than one species.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Small|first1=E|year=1975|url=http://www.botany.org/PlantScienceBulletin/psb-1975-21-3.php|title=On toadstool soup and legal species of marihuana|journal=Plant Science Bulletin|volume=21|issue=3|pages=34–9[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1080/02791072.1981.10471446|title=The Genus Cannabis and the Correct Use of Taxonomic Categories|year=1981|last1=Emboden|first1=William A.|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|volume=13|pages=15–21|pmid=7024491|issue=1[/tpl]Schultes, R.

===Early classifications===

The Cannabis genus was first classified using the "modern" system of taxonomic nomenclature by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species.Linnaeus, C. 1753. Species Plantarum 2: 1027. Salvius, Stockholm. edition, 1957–1959. Ray Society, London, U.K. He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named Cannabis sativa L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck published a description of a second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica Lam.de Lamarck, J.B. 1785. Encyclopédie Méthodique de Botanique, vol. 1, pt. 2. Paris, France, pp. 694–695 Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described C. indica as having poorer fiber quality than C. sativa, but greater utility as an inebriant. Additional Cannabis species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names Cannabis chinensis Delile, and Cannabis gigantea Delile ex Vilmorin.[tpl]cite journal|first1=Ernest|last1=Small|first2=Arthur|last2=Cronquist|year=1976|title=A Practical and Natural Taxonomy for Cannabis|journal=Taxon|volume=25|issue=4|pages=405–35|jstor=1220524|doi=10.2307/1220524[/tpl] However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the Soviet Union where Cannabis continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name Cannabis indica was listed in various Pharmacopoeias, and was widely used to designate Cannabis suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.3109/15563657708987969|title=Some Historical Aspects of Marijuana|year=1977|last1=Winek|first1=Charles L.|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=243–53|pmid=322936[/tpl]

===20th century===

In 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that ruderal Cannabis in central Russia is either a variety of C. sativa or a separate species, and proposed C. sativa L. var. ruderalis Janisch. and Cannabis ruderalis Janisch. as alternative names. In 1929, renowned plant explorer Nikolai Vavilov assigned wild or feral populations of Cannabis in Afghanistan to C. indica Lam. var. kafiristanica Vav., and ruderal populations in Europe to C. sativa L. var. spontanea Vav. In 1940, Russian botanists Serebriakova and Sizov proposed a complex classification in which they also recognized C. sativa and C. indica as separate species. Within C. sativa they recognized two subspecies: C. sativa L. subsp. culta Serebr. (consisting of cultivated plants), and C. sativa L. subsp. spontanea (Vav.) Serebr. (consisting of wild or feral plants). Serebriakova and Sizov split the two C. sativa subspecies into 13 varieties, including four distinct groups within subspecies culta. However, they did not divide C. indica into subspecies or varieties.Serebriakova T. Ya. and I. A. Sizov. 1940. Cannabinaceae Lindl. In: Vavilov N. I. (ed.), Kulturnaya Flora SSSR, vol. 5, Moscow-Leningrad, USSR, pp. 1–53. Russian This excessive splitting of C. sativa proved too unwieldy, and never gained many adherents.
In the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of Cannabis took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting Cannabis in the United States and Canada specifically named products of C. sativa as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized Cannabis material may not have been C. sativa, and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while Dr. Richard E. Schultes and others testified for the defense. The botanists engaged in heated debate (outside of court), and both camps impugned the other's integrity. The defense attorneys were not often successful in winning their case, because the intent of the law was clear.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7534.175|title=Cannabis confusions|year=2006|last1=Watts|first1=G.|journal=BMJ|volume=332|issue=7534|pages=175–6|pmid=16424501|pmc=1336775[/tpl]
In 1976, Canadian botanist Ernest SmallErnest Small (biography). National Research Council Canada. Retrieved on 23 February 2007 and American taxonomist Arthur Cronquist published a taxonomic revision that recognizes a single species of Cannabis with two subspecies: C. sativa L. subsp. sativa, and C. sativa L. subsp. indica (Lam.) Small & Cronq. The authors hypothesized that the two subspecies diverged primarily as a result of human selection; C. sativa subsp. sativa was presumably selected for traits that enhance fiber or seed production, whereas C. sativa subsp. indica was primarily selected for drug production. Within these two subspecies, Small and Cronquist described C. sativa L. subsp. sativa var. spontanea Vav. as a wild or escaped variety of low-intoxicant Cannabis, and C. sativa subsp. indica var. kafiristanica (Vav.) Small & Cronq. as a wild or escaped variety of the high-intoxicant type. This classification was based on several factors including interfertility, chromosome uniformity, chemotype, and numerical analysis of phenotypic characters.[tpl]cite journal|first1=Ernest|last1=Small|first2=Perry Y.|last2=Jui|first3=L.

Professors William Emboden, Loran Anderson, and Harvard botanist Richard E. Schultes and coworkers also conducted taxonomic studies of Cannabis in the 1970s, and concluded that stable morphological differences exist that support recognition of at least three species, C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis.Schultes, R. E., W. M. Klein, T. Plowman, and T. E. Lockwood. 1974. Cannabis: an example of taxonomic neglect. Harvard University Botanical Museum Leaflets 23: 337–367.Anderson, L. C. 1974.

E. 1970. Random thoughts and queries on the botany of Cannabis. In: Joyce, C. R. B. and Curry, S. H. (eds), The Botany and Chemistry of Cannabis. J. & A. Churchill, London, pp. 11–38. According to Schultes' and Anderson's descriptions, C. sativa is tall and laxly branched with relatively narrow leaflets, C. indica is shorter, conical in shape, and has relatively wide leaflets, and C. ruderalis is short, branchless, and grows wild in central Asia. This taxonomic interpretation was embraced by Cannabis aficionados who commonly distinguish narrow-leafed "sativa" drug strains from wide-leafed "indica" drug strains.Interview with Robert Connell Clarke. 1 Jan 2005.

===Continuing research===

Molecular analytical techniques developed in the late 20th century are being applied to questions of taxonomic classification. This has resulted in many reclassifications based on evolutionary systematics. Several studies of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and other types of genetic markers have been conducted on drug and fiber strains of Cannabis, primarily for plant breeding and forensic purposes.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s001220051043|title=Identification of DNA markers linked to the male sex in dioecious hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.)|year=1999|last1=Mandolino|first1=G.|last2=Carboni|first2=A.|last3=Forapani|first3=S.|last4=Faeti|first4=V.|last5=Ranalli|first5=P.|journal=TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics|volume=98|page=86[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2135/cropsci2001.1682|title=Comparison of Hemp Varieties Using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Markers|year=2001|last1=Forapani|first1=Silvia|last2=Carboni|first2=Andrea|last3=Paoletti|first3=Claudia|last4=Moliterni|first4=V.

They also commented that these analyses confirm the continuity of the Cannabis gene pool throughout the studied accessions, and provide further confirmation that the genus comprises a single species, although theirs was not a systematic study per se.
Karl W. Hillig, a graduate student in the laboratory of long-time Cannabis researcher Paul G. MahlbergDr. Paul G. Mahlberg's Cannabis Research. North American Industrial Hemp Council. Retrieved on 23 February 2007 at Indiana University, conducted a systematic investigation of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation among 157 Cannabis accessions of known geographic origin, including fiber, drug, and feral populations. In 2004, Hillig and Mahlberg published a chemotaxomic analysis of cannabinoid variation in their Cannabis germplasm collection. They used gas chromatography to determine cannabinoid content and to infer allele frequencies of the gene that controls CBD and THC production within the studied populations, and concluded that the patterns of cannabinoid variation support recognition of C. sativa and C. indica as separate species, but not C. ruderalis. The authors assigned fiber/seed landraces and feral populations from Europe, central Asia, and Asia Minor to C. sativa. Narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug accessions, southern and eastern Asian hemp accessions, and feral Himalayan populations were assigned to C. indica. In 2005, Hillig published a genetic analysis of the same set of accessions (this paper was the first in the series, but was delayed in publication), and proposed a three-species classification, recognizing C. sativa, C. indica, and (tentatively) C. ruderalis. In his doctoral dissertation published the same year, Hillig stated that principal components analysis of phenotypic (morphological) traits failed to differentiate the putative species, but that canonical variates analysis resulted in a high degree of discrimination of the putative species and infraspecific taxa.Hillig, Karl William. 2005.

He also concluded there is little support to treat C. ruderalis as a separate species from C. sativa at this time, but more research on wild and weedy populations is needed because they were underrepresented in their collection.

===Popular usage===

The scientific debate regarding taxonomy has had little effect on the terminology in widespread use among cultivators and users of drug-type Cannabis. Cannabis aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, native range, aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. Sativa is the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. Indica designates shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. Ruderalis is the informal name for the short plants that grow wild in Europe and central Asia.
Breeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type Cannabis often describe the ancestry or gross phenotypic characteristics of cultivars by categorizing them as "pure indica," "mostly indica," "indica/sativa," "mostly sativa", or "pure sativa."

==Reproduction==

===Breeding systems===

Cannabis is predominantly dioecious,[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1201|title=Boys and Girls Come Out to Play: The Molecular Biology of Dioecious Plants|year=2000|last1=Ainsworth|first1=C|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=86|issue=2|page=211[/tpl] although many monoecious varieties have been described.de Meijer, E. P. M. 1999. Cannabis germplasm resources. In: Ranalli P. (ed.). Advances in Hemp Research, Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, pp. 131–151. ISBN 1-56022-872-5 Subdioecy (the occurrence of monoecious individuals and dioecious individuals within the same population) is widespread.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20030313091047/http://www.globalhemp.com/Archives/Government_Research/UN/03_odccp_bulletin.html|title=Cannabis as a licit crop: recent developments in Europe|accessdate=February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1008696018533|year=1999|last1=Schumann|first1=Erika|last2=Peil|first2=Andreas|last3=Weber|first3=Wilhelm Eberhard|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|volume=46|issue=4|page=399[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10681-004-4760-0|title=Current status and future scenarios of hemp breeding|year=2004|last1=Ranalli|first1=Paolo|journal=Euphytica|volume=140|page=121[/tpl] Many populations have been described as sexually labile.Hirata, K. 1924. Sex reversal in hemp. Journal of the Society of Agriculture and Forestry 16: 145–168.[tpl]cite journal|first=John H.|last=Schaffner|year=1931|title=The Fluctuation Curve of Sex Reversal in Staminate Hemp Plants Induced by Photoperiodicity|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=18|issue=6|pages=424–30|jstor=2435878|doi=10.2307/2435878[/tpl]
As a result of intensive selection in cultivation, Cannabis exhibits many sexual phenotypes that can be described in terms of the ratio of female to male flowers occurring in the individual, or typical in the cultivar.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12441630|year=2002|last1=Truţa|first1=E|last2=Gille|first2=E|last3=Tóth|first3=E|last4=Maniu|first4=M|title=Biochemical differences in Cannabis sativa L. Depending on sexual phenotype|volume=43|issue=4|pages=451–62|journal=Journal of applied genetics[/tpl] Dioecious varieties are preferred for drug production, where typically the female flowers are used. Dioecious varieties are also preferred for textile fiber production, whereas monoecious varieties are preferred for pulp and paper production. It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops. However, sativa strains often produce monoecious individuals, probably as a result of inbreeding.

===Mechanisms of sex determination===

Cannabis has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of sex determination among the dioecious plants. Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in Cannabis.
Based on studies of sex reversal in hemp, it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an XY sex-determination system is present. At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The X:A system was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925.[tpl]cite journal|first=Calvin B.|last=Bridges|year=1925|title=Sex in Relation to Chromosomes and Genes|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=59|issue=661|pages=127–37|jstor=2456354|doi=10.1086/280023[/tpl] Soon thereafter, Schaffner disputed Hirata's interpretation,[tpl]cite journal|id=[tpl]hdl|1811/2398[/tpl]|last=Schaffner|first=John H.|year=1929|title=Heredity and sex|journal=Ohio Journal of Science|volume=29|issue=1|pages=289–300[/tpl] and published results from his own studies of sex reversal in hemp, concluding that an X:A system was in use and that furthermore sex was strongly influenced by environmental conditions.
Since then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants. Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=11743084|year=2001|last1=Negrutiu|first1=I|last2=Vyskot|first2=B|last3=Barbacar|first3=N|last4=Georgiev|first4=S|last5=Moneger|first5=F|title=Dioecious plants.

Since the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for Cannabis. Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using "an X/autosome dosage type".
The question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a karyotype. Cannabis was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see History of Cytogenetics). Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious "Kentucky" hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious "Kentucky" hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious "Kentucky" hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX.[tpl]cite journal|first=Margaret Y.|last=Menzel|year=1964|title=Meiotic Chromosomes of Monoecious Kentucky Hemp (Cannabis sativa)|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|volume=91|issue=3|pages=193–205|jstor=2483524|doi=10.2307/2483524[/tpl] According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of Cannabis had been published as of 1996.[tpl]cite journal|first1=Shao|last1=Hong|first2=Robert C.|last2=Clarke|year=1996|url=http://www.hempfood.com/IHA/iha03207.html|title=Taxonomic studies of Cannabis in China|journal=Journal of the International Hemp Association|volume=3|issue=2|pages=55–60[/tpl] Proponents of the XY system state that Y chromosome is slightly larger than the X, but difficult to differentiate cytologically.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12835935|year=2003|last1=Peil|first1=A|last2=Flachowsky|first2=H|last3=Schumann|first3=E|last4=Weber|first4=WE|title=Sex-linked AFLP markers indicate a pseudoautosomal region in hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.)|volume=107|issue=1|pages=102–9|doi=10.1007/s00122-003-1212-5|journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics|doi_brokendate=December 25, 2013[/tpl]

Several other research groups have reported identification of male-associated markers using RAPD and AFLP.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1020204729122|year=2002|last1=Törjék|first1=Ottó|last2=Bucherna|first2=Nándor|last3=Kiss|first3=Erzsébet|last4=Homoki|first4=Hajnalka|last5=Finta-Korpelová|first5=Zsuzsanna|last6=Bócsa|first6=Iván|last7=Nagy|first7=István|last8=Heszky|first8=László E.|journal=Euphytica|volume=127|issue=2|page=209[/tpl] Ainsworth commented on these findings, stating, "It is not surprising that male-associated markers are relatively abundant. In dioecious plants where sex chromosomes have not been identified, markers for maleness indicate either the presence of sex chromosomes which have not been distinguished by cytological methods or that the marker is tightly linked to a gene involved in sex determination.

==Industrial and personal uses==

Cannabis is used for a wide variety of purposes.

===Hemp===

The term Hemp is used to name the durable soft fiber from the Cannabis Plant stem (stalk). Cannabis sativa cultivars are used for fibers due to their long stems; Sativa varieties may grow more than six metres tall. However, hemp can refer to any industrial or foodstuff product that is not intended for use as a drug. Many countries regulate limits for psychoactive compound (THC) concentrations in products labeled as hemp.
Hemp is valuable in tens of thousands of commercial products, especially as fibre[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/hemp_facts.html|title=Hemp Facts|publisher=Naihc.org|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] ranging from paper, cordage, construction material and textiles in general, to clothing. Hemp is stronger and longer-lasting than cotton. It also is a useful source of foodstuffs (hemp milk, hemp seed, hemp oil) and biofuels. Hemp has been used by many civilizations, from China to Europe (and later North America) during the last 12,000 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/IHA/iha02111.html|title=The cultivation and use of hemp in ancient China|publisher=Hempfood.com|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] In modern times novel applications and improvements have been explored with modest commercial success.[tpl]cite journal|title=Hemp Pulp and Paper Production|author=Van Roekel, Gerjan J.|journal=Journal of the International Hemp Association|year=1994|location=Wageningen, The Netherlands|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/hemp/IHA/iha01105.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Industrial Hemp Production in Alberta|year=2011|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/econ9631|author=Atkinson, Gail|publisher=Government of Alberta, Agriculture and Rural Development|location=CA[/tpl]

===Psychoactive drug===

Cannabis is a popular recreational drug around the world, only behind alcohol, caffeine and tobacco. In the United States alone, it is believed that over 100 million Americans have tried Cannabis, with 25 million Americans having used it within the past year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5442|title=Introduction|publisher=NORML|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl]
The psychoactive effects of Cannabis are known to have a biphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, tetrahydrocannabinol. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking, introspection and metacognition have been reported amongst cases of anxiety and paranoia.[tpl]cite web|author=Cannabis|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis (Marijuana) Vault : Effects|publisher=Erowid.org|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by 11-OH-THC, a psychoactive metabolite of THC produced in the liver.
Normal cognition is restored after approximately three hours for larger doses via a smoking pipe, bong or vaporizer. However, if a large amount is taken orally the effects may last much longer. After 24 hours to a few days, minuscule psychoactive effects may be felt, depending on dosage, frequency and tolerance to the drug.
Various forms of the drug cannabis exist, including extracts such as hashish and hash oil which, because of appearance, are more susceptible to adulterants when left unregulated.
The plant Cannabis sativa is known to cause more of a "high" by stimulating hunger and by producing a rather more comedic, or energetic feeling. Conversely, the Cannabis indica plant is known to cause more of a "stoned" or meditative feeling, possibly because of a higher CBD to THC ratio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.growery.org/3032/Indica-Sativa-Whats-the-difference|title=Indica?

According to Delphic analysis by British researchers in 2007, Cannabis has a lower risk factor for dependence compared to both nicotine and alcohol.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4|title=Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse|year=2007|last1=Nutt|first1=David|last2=King|first2=Leslie A|last3=Saulsbury|first3=William|last4=Blakemore|first4=Colin|journal=The Lancet|volume=369|issue=9566|page=1047|pmid=17382831[/tpl] However, everyday use of Cannabis can in some cases be correlated with psychological withdrawal symptoms such as irritability and insomnia, and evidence could suggest that if a user experiences stress, the likeliness of getting a panic attack increases because of an increase of THC metabolites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=7951|title=Marijuana Detection Times Influenced By Stress, Dieting|publisher=NORML|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cannabis.net/panic-attacks/pd.html|title=Cannabis use and panic disorder|publisher=Cannabis.net|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl] However, Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and are never life-threatening.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/factsmyths/|title=Myths and Facts About Marijuana|publisher=Drugpolicy.org|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl]

===Medical use===

===Ancient and religious uses===

The Yanghai Tombs, a vast ancient cemetery (54 000 m2) situated in the Turfan district of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China, have revealed the 2700-year-old grave of a shaman. He is thought to have belonged to the Jushi culture recorded in the area centuries later in the Hanshu, Chap 96B.Hulsewé (1979), p. 183. Near the head and foot of the shaman was a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled with 789g of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination.
