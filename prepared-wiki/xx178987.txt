Scouting continued in different ways:
Helga Barth, the Cubmaster of  the pack Zeisige in Karlsruhe, was arrested and died in Ravensbrück concentration camp.

===1945-1948===

In 1945, there were plans of a re-foundation by the Chief Scout Helmut Hövetborn and other old scouts of the association. In 1946, former members of the Scout group Rüppurr met in Ettlingen. In 1947, there were groups in Mannheim, Heidelberg and Karlsruhe. The  Landesmark Nordbaden and later the Tübinger Bund were founded and allowed by the French Military government. On 14 March 1948, the Chief Scout Helmut Hövetborn died. He was succeeded by Richard König (Scout name: Alter), a member of the Scout group Rüppurr.
The Tübinger Bund had contacts with Scout groups in Bavaria, Hesse and Alexander Lion, one of the founders of German Scouting.
In 1948, the Tübinger Bund joined the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder, the interreligious member organization of the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverbände. Erich Mönch, one of the founders of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder was a founder member of this association.
In 1956, the Gau Grauer Reiter, named after the Scout group Graue Reiter in Soldin of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder, left the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder.
Today, there is still a group of former Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder within the association "Fördergemeinschaft Grauer Reiter e. V." The Fördergemeinschaft Grauer Reiter e. V. is a group of adults, grown up in different youth and Scout association, which support the work of the Scout association Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter and especially its national centre, the Castle Hohenkrähen near Lake Constance (Bodensee). The Pfadfinderschaft Grauer Reiter is a small independent Scout association in Germany with about 350 members. It was founded by Erich Mönch. It preserves the history and traditions of the Sturmtrupp-Pfadfinder.

==Program==

The work of the Scout association was based on the teachings of Ernest Thompson Seton. A big part of the programme was arts and crafts and adventurous travels, especially to Sweden and Norway. Each member of the association should make one piece of art or handicraft each year. All the pieces were shown at the National Jamborees.
Decision making was organised as a grassroots democracy. Decisions on national level were made by a meeting of all leaders of the local Scout groups called Bundesthing. On a group level, decision were made in a similar way.
The magazine of the association was Jugendland. Between 1929 and 1933, 24 issues were published, and between 1946 and 1948, 3 more.
The national camp site of this Scout association was called Jungenland and it was situated near Döffingen. Döffingen is today a quarter of Grafenau. It was bought in 1927.
Troops of the association travelled to foreign countries and took part in international camps with scouts from groups associated with the International Organisation of Good Templars from the United States, Great Britain, The Netherlands and Scandinavia.

==Membership==

Most groups of the association were based in Southern Germany and there never was more than 500 members.
