==Life and career==

He was born in Amsterdam, as the son of Théophile Cazenove and Marie de Rapin-Thoyras, French/Swiss Huguenots.http://huguenot-manakin.org/manakin/brock1.php His father was a merchant and banker on Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, Stockholm and the West-Indies. In 1759 he lost four ships loaded with sugar and coffee, which were taken by a Bristol privateer, on their way back.Miscellaneous correspondence, containing a variety of subjects, relative to ... by Benjamin Martin http://books.google.nl/books?id=L7QPAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA925&dq=1759+Dutch+ships+privateer+bristol&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=vJILUP32F8WY1AWkv6m8Cg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false In 1760 he gave up his business and his sons Charles and Theophile stepped in the company. In 1763, Theophile married Margaretha Helena van Jever, the daughter of a tradesman in Russia, and a member of the vroedschap. Cazenove spent his early career in commercial transactions in France and Russia, but went broke in 1770. In the same year, his portrait was painted by Jean-Baptiste Perronneau.Musée des Arts décoratifs, Lyonhttp://www.pastellists.com/Genealogies/Cazenove.pdf After the death of his father-in-law he was involved in a plantation in Surinam.

In November 1789 Cazenove was retained by Pieter Stadnitski to travel to the United States to act as an investment agent for Stadnitski and other Dutch investors (Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst, Pieter & Christiaen Van Eeghen, and Ten Cate & Vollenhoven).Amsterdam City Archives on the Holland Land CompanyThe Holland Land Company.

Boon believed that harvesting maple syrup could be a year-round activity, so slavery on the sugar plantations could be avoided.
In 1792 Cazenove invested his clients' money, at first in development bonds issued by the new states and the federal government, after Alexander Hamilton promised to fully pay the debt. Another venture included investing in large tracts of undeveloped land in Genesee County, New York, which included the Holland Purchase.The great American land bubble by Sakolski, A.M In order to implement these large and difficult purchases (sometimes complicated by the claims of Indians), he employed the advisory services of Hamilton and later Aaron Burr.
Cazenove lived well as a "grand seigneur" and was known for his extreme carelessness.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyccazen/Biographies/CazenoveT.html His business dealings in maple syrup and canals were not particularly successful and the investors barely made any profit, even losing money in the Pennsylvania land dealings which he organized with James Wilson.  He was also hard pressed to account for funds that were under his control.  Around those days he helped his cousin from Geneva to settle in Philadelphia.Papers, 1791-1852, bulk 1792-1796 Alexander Baring wrote: ‘Cazenove is a sad dirty fellow and does all the mischief he can’.http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_bij005196001_01/_bij005196001_01_0003.php In 1798 he hired Joseph Ellicott  http://www.buffaloah.com/h/1799 but Paolo Busti became his successor.
In 1799, Cazenove returned to Europe even though he had become an American citizen in 1794. Casanove went to Amsterdam, where he started to archive purchase of land for the financiers. He left the employment of the Dutch investors in 1802 and sought a position under Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who he had met in Philadelphia in 1795, when also Talleyrand invested in land purchase.http://www.archive.org/stream/cazenovejournal101caze/cazenovejournal101caze_djvu.txt Cazenove died in Paris in the Rue du Bac.Cazenove journal, 1794: a record of the journey of Theophile Cazenove through New Jersey and Pennsylvania http://www.archive.org/stream/cazenovejournal101caze/cazenovejournal101caze_djvu.txt
