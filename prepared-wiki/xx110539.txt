Lumpia are pastries of Chinese origin similar to fresh popiah or fried spring rolls popular in Southeast Asia. The term lumpia derives from Hokkien lunpia ([tpl]zh|t=潤餅|p=rùnbǐng|poj=jūn-piáⁿ, lūn-piáⁿ[/tpl]), which is an alternate term for popiah. The recipe, both fried and fresh versions, was brought by the Chinese immigrants from the Fujian province of China to Southeast Asia and became popular where they settled in Indonesia and the Philippines.
In the Netherlands, Belgium and France, it is spelled loempia which is the old Indonesian spelling for lumpia and has also become the generic name for "spring roll" in Dutch and French. A variant is the Vietnamese lumpia, wrapped in a thinner piece of pastry, in a size close to a spring roll though, the wrapping closes the ends off completely, which is typical for lumpia.  In Venezuela, it is spelled "lumpia" and it was introduced by Chinese people who migrated to the South American country.

Lumpia sometimes also served with sweet and spicy chili sambal or fresh bird's eye chili pepper.
