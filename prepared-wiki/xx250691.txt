==History==

Formed in 2003, the original 15 piece lineup experimented with walls of sound and eventually pared down to a five piece before its first show. The band's first release came in 2005 with a self-released EP, Must You Smash Your Ears Before You Learn to Listen with Your Eyes.  After a 90.3 KEXP-FM live performance, the band went in the studio to record their full length debut with the production assistant from the show, Andy Boyd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/prescriptionaudio |title=Andy Boyd (Andy Boyd) on Myspace |publisher=Myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-16[/tpl]  Released in May 2007 on local collective label Beep Repaired
