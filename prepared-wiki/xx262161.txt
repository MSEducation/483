==Season overview==

===January===

On 2 January the issue of an official manager was under examination by the Federación Salvadoreña de Fútbol (FESFUT) and had been discussed by them. Fernando Palomo stated in his ESPN blog that discussions had possibly taken place with a potential Spanish manager and FESFUT.[tpl]cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/blogs/index?name=fernando_palomo&month=1&year=2011  |title=Se avecina un técnico español en El Salvador  |language=Spanish |publisher=espndeportes.espn.go.com |accessdate=2 January 2011 [/tpl] The following day La Prensa Grafica, a mainstream metropolitan newspaper in El Salvador, released the names of 3 possible Spanish managers to elsalvadorfc.com.

According to Carlos Méndez Cabezas, FESFUT president and Comisión Ejecutiva de Selecciones Nacionales (CESEN) coordinator, Lillo would arrive in El Salvador on 10 January to view a better perspective of Salvadoran football. He would be accompanied by Iñigo Dominguez, his assistant, who contributed to Real Sociedad, UD Almería, and UD Almería's women's team.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.losprovocadores.net/home/juanma-lillo-llegara-a-el-salvador-el-lunes-por-la-noche/ |title=Juanma Lillo llegará a El Salvador el lunes por la noche |language=Spanish |publisher=losprovocadores.net |accessdate=7 January 2011 [/tpl] His visit was to meet FESFUT and negotiate his probable appointment as El Salvador national football team coach. Lillo declared, "The most important thing right now is that all of El Salvador is of support to his national team and his coach, José Luis Rugamas, to reach the goal is to qualify for the next Gold Cup. It is the most important thing right now." Lillo would be in Panama the following week to see the performance of the national team in the 2011 Copa Centroamericana.

Central defence player Álexander Mendoza, from C.D. Universidad de El Salvador, lost the chance to represent his country in the 2011 Copa Centroamericana when he suffered a knee injury and could not recover in time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-01-07-mendoza-no-jugara-copa-centroamericana |title=Mendoza, el primer descarte en la Azul |language=Spanish |publisher=elsalvadorfc.com |accessdate=7 January 2011 [/tpl] On 7 January coach Rugamas announced the names of the 21 players for the official roster of the El Salvador national football team to participate in the 2011 Copa Centroamericana, played in Panama from 14 to 23 January.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=314 | title= Copa Centroamericana squad released |language=Spanish| publisher=FESFUT.org.sv | accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] From January 14 – 23 the El Salvador national football team participated in the 2011 Copa Centroamericana, the eleventh edition of the competition formerly known as UNCAF Nations Cup, a tournament for the CONCACAF-affiliated national teams of Central America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fedefutguate.org/index.php?news=469 |title=Panama will be the host of the 2011 Central American Cup |language=Spanish – UNCAF |date=1 February 2010 |publisher=FedefutGuate |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl] El Salvador qualified for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup earning 2 wins, 1 draw (p.s.o.) and 2 losses from 5 matches, finishing in 4th place.

===February===

On 9 February El Salvador were scheduled to play a FIFA international friendly against Haiti. The match team was coached by Rugamas after FESFUT had awarded him a 6 month renewal of his interim contract. The match was won by El Salvador with a goal in the 15th minute by Rafael Burgos, the season's top goalscorer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/9111-el-salvador-haiti-minuto-a-minuto.html |title=El Salvador wins Haiti |language=Spanish |date=9 February 2011 |publisher=elsalvadorfc.com |accessdate=19 February 2011[/tpl]
FESFUT presented an economic budget to Lillo of US$300,000 per year (5 person deal). After days of speculation the Spanish coach turned down the offer of coaching La Azul y Blanco. The main reason of his rejection was that he could not commit to something without the right tools and infrastructure to do so, "within all this, there is dis-proportionality between what they intend and what you can give. You can not build a pool with a beach shovel."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-02-09-lillo-elsalvador-quiere-mucho-y-ofrece-poco |title='For five people, $ 300 thousand is not serious' |language=Spanish |date=9 February 2011 |publisher=elsalvadorfc.com |accessdate=19 February 2011[/tpl]
As announced on 18 February El Salvador would continue its preparation for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup with a friendly match against Syria on the 25th of March. There was still no definite coach, with interim coach José Luis Rugamas taking care of the friendly matches while he still had a valid contract with FESFUT.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=351 |title=FESFUT confirms friendly between El Salvador and Syria |language=Spanish |date=18 February 2011 |publisher=FESFUT |accessdate=19 February 2011[/tpl]

===March===

On 3 March the tense situations in North African and Arab countries forced Syria to cancel the match with the Salvadoran national team. The Salvadoran football federation turned to the First Division and the preliminary list of 23 players with who Rugamas, the interim coach, attempted to play the friendly games for 25 and 29 March – the second and third year's FIFA date. From the original 23 players only 18 could participate in the matches. The representative Promotora Figueroa ("Figueroa Promoter") has indicated that they are making arrangements to play against El Salvador, Iraq or Jordan on the agreed date.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.com.sv/deportes/7606-iraq-y-no-siria-seria-rival-de-el-salvador.html |title=Iraq, not Syria, will be El Salvador's opponent |language=Spanish |date=3 March 2011 |publisher=Diario El Mundo |accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl] On 7 March C.D. Águila players did not present themselves for training. The five members of Águila: Osael Romero, Marvin González, Ramón Sánchez, Miguel Montes & Shawn Martin, did not receive permission from the board of directors of the team. Rugamas expected to work two microcycles, but the absence of players attached to the First Division left 16 and would affect training plans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_opinion.asp?idCat=6429&idArt=5637845 |title=The bad habit of putting obstacles |language=Spanish |date=7 March 2011 |publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=7 March 2011[/tpl]
On 9 March it was announced that the international friendlies scheduled for March in Dubai were canceled; reasons for the cancellation could be due to tense situations in North African and Arab countries. Although new friendlies for March were confirmed: on March 24 in La Habana, against Cuba; and on March 27 in San Salvador, against Jamaica. These games would be fundamental in order to reach the CONCACAF top eight places.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=368 | title= Rivals change for March friendlies |language=Spanish| publisher=FESFUT | accessdate=2011-03-09 |format=[/tpl] El Salvador rose six positions and was 92 in the FIFA rankings. It was in ninth place in CONCACAF, ahead of teams such as Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti. El Salvador needed to be among the top 8 in the region to be seeded in the play-offs for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=367 | title= March ranking released |language=Spanish| publisher=FESFUT | accessdate=2011-03-09 |format=[/tpl] On 17 March Purdy was selected to play for El Salvador in the two friendlies against Jamaica and Cuba.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prostamerika.com/2011/03/18/two-timbers-get-international-calls-39040/ | title= Two Timbers Get International Calls | publisher=Prost Amerika | accessdate=2011-03-17 |format=[/tpl] However El Salvador did not give the Portland Timbers the 15 days notice required by FIFA and the Timbers chose not to release him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=378 | title= Purdy will not play the two friendlies |language=Spanish | publisher=FESFUT | accessdate=2011-03-19 |format=[/tpl]
On 21 March José Luis Rugamas released the list of 18 players to face Cuba. Henry Hernandez, Milton Molina, Edwin Sanchez, Gilberto Baires, Henry Escobar and Reynaldo Hernandez were discarded, but were eligible for the next preliminary squad against Jamaica.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-03-21-lista-nomina-que-enfrentara-a-cuba | title= Rugamas made the cut |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-03-21 |format=[/tpl] The game was played on the 24 March. A long outside kick by substituted midfielder Dennis Alas gave La Selecta a victory over the Cuban side at the Estadio Pedro Marrero in Havana, Cuba. The game saw Brazilian-born Marcelo Messias' debut and the comeback of both Miguel Montes, after a 1 year suspension, and Ramon Sanchez. Luis Anaya, Ramón Sánchez and Dagoberto Portillo were injured by the constant contacts by the Cubans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-03-24-cuba-vs-elsalvador | title= El Salvador conquered Havana |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-03-24 |format=[/tpl]
The game against Jamaica was rescheduled from the 27 to the 29 due to flight problems in Miami.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-03-26-elsalvador-vs-jamaica-sera-el-martes | title= Reprogrammed for Tuesday |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-03-26 |format=[/tpl] El Salvador lost 2–3 against the Raggae Boyz (Jamaica) due to defensive errors. Deris Umanzor tried to raise up to the midfield but lost the ball and Dane Richards scored for Jamaica. Then a mistake by defender Messias meant Watson could pass to Richards scoring the second Jamaican goal. After the Jamaican 0–2 lead El Salvador began to produce problems for the caribbean side, mostly from Eliseo Quintanilla and Arturo Alvarez. In the 41st minute Jaime Alas scored to make El Salvadors first goal and the score at 1–2. El Salvador promised a good second half but Omar Cummings received a pass inside the El Salvador goal area and scored to make it 3–1 in Jamaica's favor. The clearest El Salvadoran opportunity was a penalty given against Osael Romero at 80 minutes which unfortunately crashed off the crossbar. In added time a shot from Edwin Sánchez was denied by Jamaican goalkeeper Kerr with Léster Blanco finishing off the goal, ending the match 3–2 at the final whistle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-03-29-elsalvador-vs-jamaica | title= Defeat with defensive fragility |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-03-29 |format=[/tpl]
On the last day of March the Federación Hondureña de Fútbol and the Federación Salvadoreña de Fútbol came to an agreement to settle an international friendly between the two countries. This match, scheduled for 29 May 2011 at the Robertson Stadium, will commemorate the debut of Honduras' new coach Luis Fernando Suárez. Alfredo Hawit, secretary of the FENAFUTH (Honduran football federation), said "we have reached a satisfactory agreement between the two federations, now everything is up to the coach to begin to prepare this blank to serve as a prelude to our participation in the Gold Cup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-03-31-honduras-proximo-rival-de-la-selecta | title= Honduras, next rival of the Blue and White |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-03-31 |format=[/tpl]

The technical director explained that, "we have come here with our coaching staff to honor the work, beyond the mistakes and successes, the healthy intention is to work on Salvadoran football as a whole, working with major selections, but have a chronogram of action for youth teams, who are the future of the country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-04-06-israel-hemos-venido-a-honrar-el-trabajo | title= 'We have come to honor the work,' Israel |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-04-13 |format=[/tpl] Also La Selección Salvadoreña, Salvadoran national team in Spanish, will play against Argentina on 14 September 2011, although only players from the local league would participate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-04-06-elsalvador-enfrentaria-a-argentina | title= Against Argentina in September |language=Spanish| publisher=elsalvadorfc.com | accessdate=2011-04-06 |format=[/tpl] Israel left Uruguay for personal reasons on 14 April and returned on 25 April.

===May===

On 2 May the coaching staff started training a 11-man preliminary squad that would eventually take part in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Also, the head coach gave the players know their work system and objectives set out, "We will work to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. We know there are prior commitments such as the Gold Cup but we must never lose sight that our goal will be the playoffs", said Israel. They started off with a strong physical training. As intense that surprised even the players themselves. The idea was that they had spent several days without any activity thus would regain the rhythm as the members in the semifinals of the Clausura 2011, which will be added in coming weeks. One certanty was Israel's commands which were strong. And one fact was that he well knew the names of the players. He closed off by saying: "Good job, guys."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6429&idArt=5804907 | title= Israel Day 1 |language=Spanish| publisher=el salvador.com | accessdate=2011-05-03 |format=[/tpl]

After Isidro Metapán and Luis Ángel Firpo were eliminated from the semifinals of the Clausura 2011, Rubén Israel called-up some of these players to add up to the eleven players active in the training ground. From the new twelve players, Diego Chavarría and Ricardo Orellana did not participate in the semifinals of the Clausura 2011 but were chosen by the head coach for their performance in the El Salvador U–23.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fesfut.org.sv/actualidad.php?id_noticia=408 | title= Israel calls new players |language=Spanish| publisher=fesfut.org.sv | accessdate=2011-05-09 |format=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/12521-dos-nuevas-incorporaciones-a-la-azul.html | title= Two new additions to the blue |language=Spanish| publisher=fesfut.org.sv | accessdate=2011-05-09 [/tpl] Also after two years and one month of absence goalkeeper Juan José "el Halcón" Gómez is called to the national team after his participation in World Cup 2010 South Africa qualification. Gómez was effusive in noting that both Miguel Montes as Dagoberto Portillo are by far the best goalkeepers in the country and is eager to work with them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/12546-el-retorno-del-halcon-a-la-seleccion.html | title= The return of the "Halcon" to the national team |language=Spanish| publisher=elgrafico.com | accessdate=2011-05-10 [/tpl]
In a press conference on 10 May Israel expressed his consideration that it would be necessary to face strong rivals. He said that he has asked for strong rivals in preparation for the qualifying stages for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He also noted that Dustin Corea, a stricker currently training in FESA, may incorporate for he had received him Salvadoran passport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/12568-dustin-corea-a-la-seleccion.html | title= Corea to the national team |language=Spanish| publisher=elgrafico.com | accessdate=2011-05-10 [/tpl]
The members of El Salvador did not train on Friday, May 13, 2011, morning, because they did not have a financial arrangement with the FESFUT for the period in which they attended to the training camps. This would be the last day of the second week of the trainings. The players issued a statement for which was signed by the group and released by Marvin González, central defender and captain. The document proposed that they would assist the concentration but would not train until there were an agreement. The preliminary squad asked to cancel salaries that they earned on their club and to not receive a bonus. The FESFUT also sent a statement in which Rafael Villacorta, a member, proposed a meeting for 16 May. Villacorta mentioned that they have not talked about the economical part because the rest of the members have been out of the country and because the financial structure of the federation does not allow them to.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/destacado-portada/36-destacadas/12702-seleccion-entrenara-hasta-que-exista-acuerdo.html | title= Selection will train until there is agreement |language=Spanish| publisher=elgrafico.com | accessdate=2011-05-13 [/tpl]
