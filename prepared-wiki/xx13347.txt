CATEGORIES: 8

Year 8 (VIII) was a leap year starting on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Camillus and Quinctilianus (or, less frequently, year 761 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 8 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
