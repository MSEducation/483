Among his pupils were Stephan Witasek, Vittorio Benussi, R. Ameseder, Konrad Zindler, Wilhelm Maria Frankl, Eduard Martinak, Ernst Mally and F. Weber.
Also his earlier students, Christian von Ehrenfels (founder of Gestalt psychology), Alois HÃ¶fler and Anton Oelzelt-Newin, can be considered part of this school.
