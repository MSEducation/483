Wensleydale is a cheese produced in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, England.

==Flavour and texture==

Good Wensleydale has a supple, crumbly, moist texture and resembles a young Caerphilly. The flavour suggests wild honey balanced with fresh acidity.

==History==

Wensleydale cheese was first made by French Cistercian monks from the Roquefort region, who had settled in Wensleydale. They built a monastery at Fors, but some years later the monks moved to Jervaulx in Lower Wensleydale. They brought with them a recipe for making cheese from sheep's milk.[tpl]cite book |last= Rance |first= Patrick |title= The Great British Cheese Book |year= 1982 |publisher= Macmillan[/tpl] During the 14th century cows' milk began to be used instead, and the character of the cheese began to change. A little ewes' milk was still mixed in since it gave a more open texture, and allowed the development of the blue mould. At that time, Wensleydale was almost always blue with the white variety almost unknown. Nowadays, the opposite is true, with blue Wensleydale rarely seen. When the monastery was dissolved in 1540 the local farmers continued making the cheese right up until the Second World War, during which most milk in the country was used for the making of "Government Cheddar".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/encyclopaedia!openframeset&frame=Right&Src=/edible.nsf/pages/governmentcheddarcheese!opendocument | title=Practically Edible | publisher=www.practicallyedible.com | accessdate=2008-07-31 | last=Potter | first=Mich[/tpl] Even after rationing ceased in 1954, cheese making did not return to pre-war levels.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.wensleydale.co.uk/about/history/ | title=History of Wensleydale Cheese | accessdate=2008-07-03 | publisher=Wensleydale Creamery[/tpl]

===Wensleydale Creamery===

Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes has been hand-making cheese for more than 100 years.
In May 1992, Dairy Crest, a subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, closed the Hawes creamery with the loss of 59 jobs. This was the last creamery in the dale.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Dairy Crest transferred production of Wensleydale cheese to Yorkshire's traditional rival, Lancashire.
Six months later, in November 1992, following many offers to rescue the Creamery, a management buyout took place, led by local businessman John Gibson and the management team. With the help of eleven members of the former workforce, cheese making recommenced in Wensleydale.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/3558111.Cheese_firm_wins_overseas_contracts_worth_millions/ | title=Cheese firm wins overseas contracts worth millions |work=The Northern Echo |date=30 July 2008 | accessdate=20 November 2012 | last=McAteer | first=Owen[/tpl] It now employs 190 locals and buys from 36 farms located in Wensleydale.

===The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer===

In the Series 2, episode 6 of The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer the introductory sequence tells the tale of a German hair metal band called Wensleydale Cheese whose obsolete jet malfunctioned and crashed an hour's flight out of Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The only survivors were guitarists Ralf and Karl Haussmann, subsequently driven to cannibalism of their backup singers in the hostile wilderness.

===George Orwell===

In his essay 'In Defence of English Cooking', George Orwell rates Wensleydale as second only to Stilton among British cheese varieties.

===Monty Python===

Wensleydale was one of the cheeses named by John Cleese in the Monty Python sketch "The Cheese Shop", which originally appeared in a 1972 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. In addition the shop owner, played by Michael Palin, was named Henry Wensleydale.

===Wallace and Gromit===

In the 1990s, sales of Wensleydale cheese had fallen so low that production was at risk of being suspended.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/Wensleydale-is-big-cheese-in.1571748.jp | title=Wensleydale is big cheese in world awards - Yorkshire Post | publisher=www.yorkshirepost.co.uk | accessdate=2008-07-31 | last= | first=[/tpl] However, the popular Wallace and Gromit animated shorts A Grand Day Out and A Close Shave had the main character Wallace, a cheese connoisseur, mention Wensleydale as a particularly favourite cheese. Animator Nick Park chose it solely because it had a good name that would be interesting to animate rather than due to its origins in northern England where the shorts were set. He was also unaware of the company's financial difficulties.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0104361/ | title=A Grand Day Out with Wallace and Gromit (1989) | publisher=uk.imdb.com | accessdate=2008-07-31 | last= | first=[/tpl] The company contacted Aardman Animations about a licence for a special brand of "Wallace and Gromit Wensleydale", which proved to be an enormous success.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php | title=WallaceAndGromit.net | publisher=www.wallaceandgromit.net | accessdate=2008-07-31 | last= | first=[/tpl] When the 2005 full-length Wallace and Gromit film, Curse of the Were-Rabbit, was released, sales of Wensleydale cheeses jumped by 23%.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=1781/ | title=Wallace & Gromit Boost Cheese Sales | accessdate=2008-07-03 | publisher=Hearst Communications Inc. | work= | first=Karen | last=Reardanz | date=2005-11-15[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=1781 | title=SFGate: Daily Dish : Wallace and Gromit Boost Cheese Sales | publisher=www.sfgate.com | accessdate=2008-07-31 | last= Reardanz| first=Karen | date=2005-11-15[/tpl]
