Zimbabwe [tpl]IPAc-en|z|ɪ|m|ˈ|b|ɑː|b|w|eɪ[/tpl], officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest and Mozambique to the east. The capital is Harare. Zimbabwe achieved de jure sovereignty from the United Kingdom in April 1980, following 14 years as an unrecognised state under the conservative white minority government of Rhodesia, which unilaterally declared independence in 1965.
Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona and Ndebele being most common. The present territory was first demarcated by Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company during the 1890s, becoming a self-governing colony as Southern Rhodesia in 1923. President Robert Mugabe is head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

==Etymology==

The name "Zimbabwe" is based on a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe, an ancient ruined city in the country's south-east whose remains are now a protected site.  There are two theories on the origin of the word. Various sources hold that the word is derived from dzimba-dza-mabwe, translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as "large houses of stone" (dzimba = plural of imba, "house"; mabwe = plural of bwe, "stone").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.somalipress.com/zimbabwe-overview/zimbabwe-big-house-stone-1145.html|title=Zimbabwe – big house of stone|publisher=Somali Press|accessdate=14 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Shona Class 5 revisited: a case against *ri as Class 5 nominal prefix |journal=Zambezia|year=1994|volume=21|pages=51–80|author=Lafon, Michel |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol21n1/juz021001005.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Mediated monuments and national identity|author=Vale, Lawrence J. |doi=10.1080/136023699373774|journal=Journal of Architecture|volume=4|year=1999|pages=391–408|issue=4[/tpl] The Karanga-speaking Shona people are found around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day province of Masvingo. Archaeologist Peter Garlake claims that "Zimbabwe" is a contracted form of dzimba-hwe which means "venerated houses" in the Zezuru dialect of Shona, and is usually applied to chiefs' houses or graves.[tpl]cite book |last=Garlake |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Garlake |title=Great Zimbabwe: New Aspects of Archaeology |year=1973 |publisher=Thames & Hudson |location=London|isbn= 978-0-8128-1599-3|page=13[/tpl]
Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia (1923), Rhodesia (1965), and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979).  The first recorded use of "Zimbabwe" as a term of national reference was in 1960, when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema, whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.  The term Rhodesia—derived from the surname of Cecil Rhodes, the primary instigator of white colonisation of the territory during the late 19th century—was perceived as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.[tpl]cite book|title=The Silence of Great Zimbabwe: Contested Landscapes and the Power of Heritage|last=Fontein|first=Joost|location=London|publisher=University College London Press|date=September 2006|edition=First|isbn=978-1844721238|pages=119–120[/tpl] According to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, and the names Machobana and Monomotapa were proposed before his suggestion, Zimbabwe, prevailed.[tpl]cite journal|title=What's in a Name? Welcome to the 'Republic of Machobana'|journal=Read on|publisher=Training Aids Development Group|location=Harare|year=1991|page=40[/tpl] A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland, had been "Matopos", referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo.[tpl]cite book|title=Do 'Zimbabweans' Exist?

It was initially not clear how the chosen term was to be used—a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to "Zimbabweland"—but "Zimbabwe" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement. In a 2001 interview, black nationalist Edson Zvobgo recalled that the name was mentioned by Mawema during a political rally, "and it caught hold, and that was that". The name was subsequently used by the black nationalist factions during the Second Chimurenga campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the Rhodesian Bush War. The most major of these were the Zimbabwe African National Union (led by Robert Mugabe from 1975), and the Zimbabwe African People's Union, led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s.

==History==

===Pre-colonial era (1000–1886)===

Proto-Shona speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century.
Around the early 10th century, trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe, near Masvingo, and other smaller sites. The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture.
The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal. They traded in gold, ivory and copper for cloth and glass.[tpl]cite book |title=Historical Archaeology |last=Hall |first=Martin |coauthors=Stephen W. Silliman |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0751-8 |pages=241–244 |url= [/tpl]
From about 1300 until 1600, Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe. From c. 1450–1760, Zimbabwe gave way to the Kingdom of Mutapa. This Shona state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today, and parts of central Mozambique. It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire, also known as Mwene Mutapa or Monomotapa as well as "Munhumutapa," and was renowned for its stategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal. Eventually, however, the Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.
As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior, a new Shona state emerged, known as the Rozwi Empire. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning "destroyers") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau by force of arms. They continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding muskets to their arsenal and recruiting a professional army to defend recent conquests.
Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan successfully rebelled against King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other petty Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.
After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland, establishing Bulawayo as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868 and, following a violent power struggle, was succeeded by his son, Lobengula.

===Colonial era (1888–1965)===

In the 1880s, white colonists arrived with Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company (BSAC).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldtrek.org/odyssey/africa/062699/062699monicabula.html|title=So Who Was Shaka Zulu- Really?|publisher=The Odyssey|accessdate=14 December 2008[/tpl] In 1888, Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples.Hensman, Howard (1901). Cecil Rhodes: A Study of a Career. pp. 106–107. He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as Mashonaland as well.Parsons, pp. 178–181.
Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of Europeans protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now Harare), and thereby establish company rule over the area. In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the First Matabele War. Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika, then known as "Zambesia".
In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties, mass settlement was encouraged, with the British maintaining control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources.Bryce, James (2008). Impressions of South Africa. p. 170, ISBN 055430032X. In 1895 the BSAC adopted the name "Rhodesia" for the territory, in honour of Rhodes. In 1898 "Southern Rhodesia" became the official denotation for the region south of the Zambezi,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N1/V3N1.htm|title=A Country in Search of a Name |author=Gray, J. A.|year=1956|journal=The Northern Rhodesia Journal|volume=3 |issue=1|page=78[/tpl] which later became Zimbabwe. The region to the north was administered separately and later termed Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia).
Shortly after Rhodes' disastrous Jameson Raid on the South African Republic, the Ndebele rebelled against their white rulers, led by their charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The Second Matabele War lasted until 1897, when Mlimo was killed. Shona agitators also staged unsuccessful revolts (known as Chimurenga) against company rule during 1896 and 1897.Palamarek, Ernie (2006). Hatari, Trafford Publishing. p. 132, ISBN 1412018269. Following these failed insurrections, the Ndebele and Shona groups were finally subdued by the Rhodes administration, which organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.
Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing British colony in October 1923, subsequent to a 1922 referendum. Rhodesians served on behalf of the United Kingdom during World War II, mainly in the East African Campaign against Axis forces in Italian East Africa. Proportional to the white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more per capita to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the Empire, including Britain itself.
In 1953, in the face of African opposition,Parsons, p. 292. Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.
With Zambian independence, Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front (RF) dropped the designation "Southern" in 1964 and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (commonly abbreviated to "UDI") from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965, intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of "no independence before majority rule". It was the first such course taken by a British colony since the American declaration of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.historytoday.com/paul-moorcraft/rhodesias-war-independence|title=Rhodesia's War of Independence|date=31 August 1990|journal=History Today|volume=40 |issue= 9|first=Paul|last=Moorcraft|quote=Per head of (white) population Rhodesia had contributed more in both world wars than any other part of the empire, including the United Kingdom. ... There is little doubt now that after a few resignations here and there, the army, the Royal Navy and even the Royal Air Force (supposedly the most disaffected service) would have carried out any orders to subdue the first national treason against the Crown since the American War of Independence.[/tpl]

===UDI and civil war (1965–1979)===

After the Unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), the British government petitioned the United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with the Smith government in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state.Hastedt, Glenn P. (2004) Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Infobase Publishing, p. 537, ISBN 143810989X. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.
The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion, but did not re-establish control by force. A guerilla war subsequently ensued when Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated guerilla operations against the white government. ZAPU was supported by the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a Marxist–Leninist ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China.
Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a mostly white referendum the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant nationalists.
In March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The internal settlement left control of the police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in settler hands. It also reserved one-third of the seats in parliament for whites.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm|title=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=1 June 1979[/tpl] On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.
Following the fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), held in Lusaka, Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence.Chung, Fay (2006). Re-living the Second Chimurenga: memories from the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe, Preben (INT) Kaarsholm. p. 242, ISBN 9171065512.
With Lord Carrington, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, in the chair, these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, producing a total of 47 plenary sessions. On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the Lancaster House Agreement, effectively ending the guerilla war.Preston, Matthew (2004). Ending Civil War: Rhodesia and Lebanon in Perspective. p. 25, ISBN 1850435790.

===Post-Independence (1980–present)===

==Geography and environment==

Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S, and longitudes 25° and 34°E. Most of the country is elevated in the central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest to the northwest at altitudes between 1,200 and 1,600 m. The country's east is mountainous with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m. About 20% of the country consists of the low veld under 900m. Victoria Falls, one of the world's biggest and most spectacular waterfalls, is located in the country's northwest as part of the Zambezi river. The country has a tropical climate with a rainy season usually from late October to March. The climate is moderated by the altitude. Zimbabwe is faced with recurring droughts; and severe storms are rare.Baughan, M. (2005). Continent in the Balance: Zimbabwe-Juvenile literature. Philadelphia, PA: Mason Crest Publishers, ISBN 1590848101.

===Flora and fauna===

The country is mostly savannah, although the moist and mountainous east supports tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees include teak and mahogany, knobthorn, msasa and baobab. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya.
There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.

===Environmental issues===

Large parts of Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with an abundant wildlife. Deforestation and poaching has reduced the amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation, due to population growth, urban expansion and lack of fuel, are major concerns.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00156-5|title=Deforestation of woodlands in communal areas of Zimbabwe: is it due to agricultural policies?|year=2000|last1=Chipika|first1=J|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment|volume=79|page=175|last2=Kowero|first2=G.|issue=2–3[/tpl] and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Zimbabwe is a country that relies mostly on hydroelectric power. Zimbabwe had once relied heavily on electricity from Mozambique and other neighbouring countries, but due to the accumulation of debt Mozambique has cut off Zimbabwe's power supply. This has caused ZESA, Zimbabwe's main electricity supplier, to begin excessive load shedding all over Zimbabwe with some urban areas only having electricity three days a week. Thus the amount of deforestation has increased as the population in urban areas has also started using firewood for fuel whereas before it was mainly the rural population due to lack of electricity in the rural areas.

==Government and politics==

Zimbabwe is a republic with a presidential system of government. The semi-presidential system was done away with the adoption of a new constitution after a referendum in March 2013. Under the constitutional changes in 2005, an upper chamber, the Senate, was reinstated.Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 17) Act, 2005 NGO Network Alliance Project The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament.
President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (commonly abbreviated ZANU-PF) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence.Mugabe, Robert. (2007). Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica. In 1987 then-prime minister Mugabe revised the constitution, abolishing the ceremonial presidency and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president, a Presidential system. His ZANU party has won every election since independence, in the 1990 election the second-placed party, Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement, won only 20% of the vote.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/review27.15680.html|title=Tekere says Mugabe 'insecure' in new book |accessdate=6 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071227185709/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/review27.15680.html  |archivedate = 27 December 2007[/tpl] During the 1995 parliamentary elections most opposition parties, including the ZUM, boycotted the voting, resulting in a near-sweep by the ruling party.Frankel, Matthew. "Myanmar Boycott is Misguided", The Brookings Institution, 26 May 2010. When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000, they won 57 seats, only five fewer than ZANU.
Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud.Zimbabwe: Election Fraud Report, University of Pennsylvania, 18 April 2005. The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies.Mugabe's former ally accuses him of foul play, 12 March 2005. Independent Online Zimbabwe. Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.

On 22 June, citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a "violent, illegitimate sham of an election process", Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run-off, the ZEC held the run-off and President Mugabe received a landslide majority.[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7467990.stm |title=Mugabe rival quits election race |work=BBC News |date=22 June 2008 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now the majority in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Morgan Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1660337.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |title=Contrast in styles as contenders hold rallies in Harare townships |date=4 March 2002|author=Latham, Brian[/tpl]
Mutambara, a robotics professor and former NASA robotics specialist has replaced Welshman Ncube who was the interim leader of MDC-M after the split. Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections, while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the senate. The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto. As of 2008, the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular, with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500–5,000 for the other formation.
On 28 April 2008, Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in Johannesburg that the two MDC formations were co-operating, enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.[tpl]Wayback |date=20080502155226 |url=http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0,2172,168544,00.html |title=Zimbabwe’s MDC factions reunite [/tpl], SABC News, 28 April 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7371823.stm |title=Opposition reunites in Zimbabwe |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2008 |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain President without a parliamentary majority. On the same day, Silaigwana announced that the recounts for the final five constituencies had been completed, that the results were being collated and that they would be published on 29 April.Chinaka, Cris (29 April 2008) All eyes on Zim as ZEC wrap-up recount, Reuters (IOL).
In mid-September 2008, after protracted negotiations overseen by the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army. Donor nations have adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude, wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts, which are estimated to take at least five years. On 11 February 2009 Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Mugabe.
In November 2008, the government of Zimbabwe spent $7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent, except that it was not for the intended purpose, and the government has failed to honour requests to return the money.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/world/africa/03zimbabwe.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Aid Group Says Zimbabwe Misused $7.3 Million |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 3 November 2008[/tpl]

===Human rights===

There are widespread reports of systematic and escalating violations of human rights in Zimbabwe under the Mugabe administration and his party, the ZANU-PF.
In 2011 there were reports of 640 corpses having been recovered from the Monkey William Mine in Chibondo. They were allegedly authenticated by the Fallen Heroes Trust of Zimbabwe and the Department of National Museums and Monuments who are leading the exhumation process as victims of the Ian Smith regime during the liberation war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.manicapost.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27171:mass-grave-discovered-&Itemid=131 |title=Mass grave discovered |publisher=Manicapost.com |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-27743-article-Exhumation+begins+at+the+Rusape+Heroes+Acre.html |title=Exhumation begins at the Rusape Heroes Acre |publisher=Bulawayo24.com |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl] One body was identified as a ZANLA cadre, Cde Rauya, by the Fallen Heroes Trust Chief exhumer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zbc.co.zw/news-categories/top-stories/11136-zanla-cadre-exhumed-in-chibondo.html |title=ZANLA cadre exhumed in Chibondo |publisher=Zbc.co.zw |date=2011-08-14 |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl] Government Minister, Saviour Kasukuwere admitted the remains were discovered in 2008, but claimed the remains were decades old despite clear evidence the exhumed skeletons still had hair and clothes.

The opposition MDC called for research on all violence that included killings of its supporters during disputed elections in 2008. Amnesty International expressed concern that "international best practice on exhumations is not being adhered to." Adding that, "mishandling of these mass graves has serious implications on potential exhumations of other sites in Zimbabwe. Thousands of civilians were also killed in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in the mid 1980s and are allegedly buried in mine shafts and mass graves in these regions."[tpl]cite web|author=|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/zimbabwe-mass-grave-bodies-must-be-exhumed-forensic-experts-2011-04-06 |title=Zimbabwe: Mass grave bodies must be exhumed by forensic experts |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl]

There have been alleged assaults on the media, the political opposition, civil society activists, and human rights defenders.
Opposition gatherings are frequently the subject of brutal attacks by the police force, such as the crackdown on a 11 March 2007 Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) rally and several others during the 2008 election campaign.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10517688 |title=Zimbabwe election violence spreads to Harare |accessdate=7 December 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |first=Raymond |last=Whitaker |date=22 June 2008[/tpl] In the attacks of 2007, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other opposition activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police.

The newspaper also argued that the opposition had been "willfully violating the ban on political rallies".
There are also abuses of media rights and access. The Zimbabwean government suppresses freedom of the press and freedom of speech. It has also been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, as a propaganda tool.Zimbabwe Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers Press Reference, 2006.

In February 2013, Zimbabwe's election chief, Simpson Mtambanengwe, resigned due to ill health. His resignation came months before the country's constitutional referendum and elections.

===Armed forces===

The Zimbabwe Defence Forces were set up by the integration of three belligerent forces – the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) – after the Second Chimurenga and Zimbabwean independence in 1980. The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) as separate entities under the command of Rtd General Solomon Mujuru and Air Marshal Norman Walsh who retired in 1982, and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai in 1985.
In December 2003, General Constantine Chiwenga, was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. Lieutenant General P. V. Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.zw/zdf/zdf.htm |title=Zimbabwe Ministry of Defence |accessdate=17 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102151320/http://www.mod.gov.zw/zdf/zdf.htm |archivedate=2 November 2007[/tpl]

Following majority rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If he or she was from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa.[tpl]cite book | first=Peter | last=Godwin | authorlink=Peter Godwin (writer) | year=1996 | title=Mukiwa – A White Boy in Africa | isbn=0-333-67150-3 | publisher=Macmillan | location=London [/tpl] This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.
The ZNA was originally formed into four brigades, composed of a total of 28 battalions. The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army, while unintegrated battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles were assigned to the 1st, 3rd and 4th Brigades. The Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after the demonstration of mass brutality and murder during the brigade's occupation of Matabeleland in what has become known as Gukurahundi ([tpl]Lang-sn|"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains"[/tpl]), the campaign which finished off Mugabe's liberation struggle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.zw/army/zna.htm |title=Ministry of Defence, Zimbabwe |accessdate=11 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102184314/http://www.mod.gov.zw/army/zna.htm |archivedate=2 November 2007[/tpl] The Brigade had been reformed by 2006, with its commander, Brigadier-General John Mupande praising its "rich history".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.zimbabwedefence.com/News_5th_Gets_Comm.html|publisher=Zimbabwe Defence Forces News|title=5th Brigade gets new commander|date=22 February 2006|accessdate=18 April 2009[/tpl]

==Administrative divisions==

Zimbabwe has a centralised government and is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital from where official business is usually carried out.
The names of most of the provinces were generated from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation: Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people, although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor, appointed by the President.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081221053703/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-21 |format=PDF|title=Constitution of the Republic of Zimbabwe|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008[/tpl] The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission.

The provinces are subdivided into 59 districts and 1,200 wards (sometimes referred to as municipalities). Each district is headed by a District Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a chief executive officer. The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors, the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/RURAL_DISTRICT_COUNCILS_ACT_29_13.pdf |format=PDF|title=Rural District Councils Act (Chapter 29:13)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008[/tpl]
At the ward level there is a Ward Development Committee, comprising the elected ward councillor, the kraalheads (traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs) and representatives of Village Development Committees. Wards are subdivided into villages, each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman (traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/TRADITIONAL_LEADERS_ACT_29_17.pdf |format=PDF|title=Traditional Leaders Act (Chapter 29:17)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008[/tpl]

===Agriculture===

Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land reform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products.CIA World Factbook, Zimbabwe. Downloaded 19 February 2014. For the past ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been assisting Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping and the use of organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content. Between 2005 and 2011, the number of smallholders practising conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5000 to more than 150000. Cereal yields rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different regions.Conservation agriculture and microdosing in Zimbabwe, WRENmedia, January 2013

===Tourism===

Since the land reform programme in 2000, tourism in Zimbabwe has steadily declined. After rising during the 1990s, (1.4 million tourists in 1999) industry figures described a 75% fall in visitors to Zimbabwe in 2000.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] By December, less than 20% of hotel rooms had been occupied.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1220218.stm |title=Sun sets on Zimbabwe tourism |author=Machipisa, Lewis |accessdate=16 November 2007 |work=BBC News | date=14 March 2001[/tpl] This has had a huge impact on the Zimbabwean economy. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the industry due to companies closing down or simply being unable to pay staff wages due to the decreasing number of tourists.
Several airlines have also pulled out of Zimbabwe. Australia's Qantas, Germany's Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines were among the first to pull out and most recently British Airways suspended all direct flights to Harare.[tpl]cite news|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20071130233121/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/10/29/wairways129.xml |title=British Airways abandons flights to Zimbabwe |author=Berger, Sebastien |accessdate=16 November 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | date=29 October 2007[/tpl] The country's flagship airline Air Zimbabwe, which operated flights throughout Africa and a few destinations in Europe and Asia, ceased operations in February 2012.[tpl]cite web|last=Sibanda |first=Tichaona |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201202231437.html |title=Zimbabwe: Air Zimbabwe Vanishes From the Skies Indefinitely |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] Many light aircraft charter companies operate in Zimbabwe, providing a quick and safe means of travel in the region.

Zimbabwe boasts several major tourist attractions. Victoria Falls on the Zambezi, which are shared with Zambia, are located in the north west of Zimbabwe. Before the economic changes, much of the tourism for these locations came to the Zimbabwe side but now Zambia is the main beneficiary. The Victoria Falls National Park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national parks in Zimbabwe,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zimbabwetourism.co.zw/hwange.htm |title=Zimbabwe Tourism Authority |accessdate=16 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071203100122/http://www.zimbabwetourism.co.zw/hwange.htm  |archivedate = 3 December 2007[/tpl] largest of which is Hwange National Park.
The Eastern Highlands are a series of mountainous areas near the border with Mozambique. The highest peak in Zimbabwe, Mount Nyangani at 2,593 m (8,507 ft) is located here as well as the Bvumba Mountains and the Nyanga National Park. World's View is in these mountains and it is from here that places as far away as 60–70 km (37–43 mi) are visible and, on clear days, the town of Rusape can be seen.
Zimbabwe is unusual in Africa in that there are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style. The most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo. Other ruins include Khami Ruins, Zimbabwe, Dhlo-Dhlo and Naletale, although none of these is as famous as Great Zimbabwe.
The Matobo Hills are an area of granite kopjes and wooded valleys commencing some [tpl]convert|22|mi|km[/tpl] south of Bulawayo in southern Zimbabwe. The Hills were formed over 2,000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface, then being eroded to produce smooth "whaleback dwalas" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Mzilikazi, founder of the Ndebele nation, gave the area its name, meaning 'Bald Heads'. They have become famous and a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and local wildlife. Cecil Rhodes and other early white pioneers like Leander Starr Jameson are buried in these hills at a site named World's View.[tpl]cite web|url=http://zimbabwe.safari.co.za/spirit-of-zimbabwe.html |title=Zimbabwe: The Spirit of Matobo |work=zimbabwe.safari.co.z[/tpl]

As in other African countries, Christianity may be mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. Besides Christianity, ancestral worship is the most practised non-Christian religion, involving spiritual intercession; the Mbira Dza Vadzimu, which means "Voice of the Ancestors", an instrument related to many lamellophones ubiquitous throughout Africa, is central to many ceremonial proceedings. Mwari simply means "God the Creator" (musika vanhu in Shona).

===Language===

English is the main language used in the education and judiciary systems.  The Bantu languages Shona and Sindebele are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe. Shona is spoken by 70% of the population, Sindebele by 20%.  Other minority Bantu languages include Venda, Tsonga, Shangaan, Kalanga, Sotho, Ndau and Nambya. Less than 2.5%, mainly the white and Coloured (mixed race) minorities, consider English their native language.[tpl]Wayback |date=20080307163813 |url=http://www.gapadventures.com/docs/pdi/africa/Zimbabwe.pdf |title=Zimbabwe [/tpl].

===Refugee crisis===

The economic meltdown and repressive political measures in Zimbabwe have led to a flood of refugees into neighbouring countries. An estimated 3.4 million Zimbabweans, a quarter of the population, had fled abroad by mid-2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2115988,00.html|title=Refugees flood from Zimbabwe The Observer |work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=Andrew | last=Meldrum | date=1 July 2007 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl] Some 3 million of these have gone to South Africa and Botswana.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/zimrefugeessufferinsouthafricaandzimbabwe_20July2007.html|title=Zimbabwean refugees suffer in Botswana and South Africa Sokwanele Civic Action Group[/tpl]

The above surveys do not include people displaced by Operation Chikorokoza Chapera or beneficiaries of the fast-track land reform programme but who have since been evicted.

==Culture==

Zimbabwe has many different cultures which may include beliefs and ceremonies, one of them being Shona. Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group is Shona. The Shona people have many sculptures and carvings which are made with the finest materials available.
Zimbabwe first celebrated its independence on 18 April 1980.[tpl]cite book|last=Owomoyela|first=Oyekan|year=2002|title=Culture and Customs of Zimbabwe|page=77|isbn=0-313-31583-3|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.[/tpl] Celebrations are held at either the National Sports Stadium or Rufaro Stadium in Harare. The first independence celebrations were held in 1980 at the Zimbabwe Grounds. At these celebrations doves are released to symbolise peace and fighter jets fly over and the national anthem is sung. The flame of independence is lit by the president after parades by the presidential family and members of the armed forces of Zimbabwe. The president also gives a speech to the people of Zimbabwe which is televised for those unable to attend the stadium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20061010093006/http://www.kas.de/proj/home/home/35/2/ |title=Zimbabwe Celebrates 25 years of Independence |accessdate=6 January 2008[/tpl]

===Arts===

Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewellery and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture has become world famous in recent years having first emerged in the 1940s. Most subjects of carved figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with sedimentary rocks such as soapstone, as well as harder igneous rocks such as serpentine and the rare stone verdite. Some of these Zimbabwean artefacts being found in countries like Singapore, China and Canada. i.e. Dominic Benhura's statue in the Singapore botanic gardens.
Shona sculpture in essence has been a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.
Several authors are well known within Zimbabwe and abroad. Charles Mungoshi is renowned in Zimbabwe for writing traditional stories in English and in Shona and his poems and books have sold well with both the black and white communities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://zimbabwe.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=5752|title=Tribute to Charles Mungoshi|accessdate=2 November 2007[/tpl] Catherine Buckle has achieved international recognition with her two books African Tears and Beyond Tears which tell of the ordeal she went through under the 2000 Land Reform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://africantears.netfirms.com/beyondtears.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030001000/http://africantears.netfirms.com/beyondtears.htm|archivedate=30 October 2007|title=Tribute to Cathy Buckle|accessdate=2 November 2007[/tpl] Prime Minister of Rhodesia, the late Ian Smith, has also written two books  The Great Betrayal and Bitter Harvest.

In 2013 NoViolet Bulawayo's novel We Need New Names was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.  The novel tells the story of the devastation and emigration caused by the brutal suppression of Zimbabwean civilians during the Gukurahundi in the early 1980s.
Internationally famous artists include Henry Mudzengerere and Nicolas Mukomberanwa.

===Cuisine===

Like in many African countries, the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. "Mealie meal", also known as cornmeal, is used to prepare sadza or isitshwala, as well as porridge known as bota or ilambazi. Sadza is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste/porridge. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste.
This is usually eaten as lunch or dinner, usually with sides such as gravy, vegetables (spinach, chomolia, spring greens/collard greens), beans and meat that has been stewed, grilled, roasted or sundried. Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk (sour milk), commonly known as lacto (mukaka wakakora), or dried Tanganyika sardine, known locally as kapenta or matemba. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter, milk, butter, or jam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zambuko.com/mbirapage/resource_guide/pages/culture/sadza_text.html | author=Zambuko.com |title=Sadza ne Nyama: A Shona Staple Dish |accessdate=3 November 2007[/tpl] Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.
Graduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow, which will be barbecued or roasted by the family.
Afrikaner recipes are popular though they are a small group (10%) within the white minority group. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade.[tpl]cite web | author=Stephanie Hanes | title=Biltong: much more than just a snack | work=The Christian Science Monitor | date=20 September 2006 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0920/p13s01-lifo.html | accessdate=3 October 2006[/tpl] Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued.
Since Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea that is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.
Rice, pasta, and potato based foods (french fries and mashed potato) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine. A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, bambara groundnut known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, indigenous fruit like horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, Sugar plum/Mazhanje, and many others.

===Sports===

Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe, although rugby union and cricket also have a following, traditionally among the white minority. Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals, one in field hockey at the (boycotted) 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and seven in swimming, three at the 2004 Summer Olympics and four at the 2008 Summer Olympics, all by Kirsty Coventry.
Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All-Africa Games in swimming with Kirsty Coventry obtaining 11 gold medals in the different competitions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2004/schedules/117BySport.html |title=2004 Olympic Games swimming results|accessdate=22 July 2007 | work=CNN[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Montreal_2005/results/sw.php |title=Montreal 2005 Results|accessdate=9 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070128064425/http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Montreal_2005/results/sw.php |archivedate = 28 January 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Melbourne_2007/results/swimming.php|title=12th FINA World Championships|accessdate=9 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070606111744/http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Melbourne_2007/results/swimming.php |archivedate = 6 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/bsp/statistics/results.stm |title=BBC Sport Commonwealth Games 2002 Statistics|accessdate=29 August 2007 |work=BBC News[/tpl] Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis, most notably with the Black family, which comprises Wayne Black, Byron Black and Cara Black. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has ever done in the 24-year history of the Ranking.[tpl]cite web|last=Gold |first=Jack Of |url=http://www.freetv4africa.co.uk/2012/05/africa-punching-above-its-weight-in.html |title=Africa punching above it's weight in golf |publisher=Free TV 4 Africa |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl]
Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, netball, and water polo, as well as squash, motorsport, martial arts, chess, cycling, polocrosse, kayaking and horse racing. However, most of these sports don't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level.

===Media===

The media of Zimbabwe, once diverse, have come under tight restriction in recent years by the government, particularly during the growing economic and political crisis in the country. The Zimbabwean constitution promises freedom of the media and expression; the media is currently hampered by political interference and the implementation of strict media laws. In its 2008 report, Reporters Without Borders ranked the Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081101010153/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031 |archivedate=2008-11-01 |title=Reporters without Borders Press Freedom Index |publisher=Rsf.org |accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl] The government also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the BBC (since 2001), CNN, CBC, Sky News, Channel 4, American Broadcasting Company, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Fox News. News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country. In July 2009 the BBC and CNN were able to resume operations and report legally and openly from Zimbabwe. CNN welcomed the move. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Media, Information and Publicity stated that, "the Zimbabwe government never banned the BBC from carrying out lawful activities inside Zimbabwe". The BBC also welcomed the move saying, "we're pleased at being able to operate openly in Zimbabwe once again".[tpl]cite web|author=Williams, Jon |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/07/resuming_operations_in_zimbabw.html |title=Resuming operations in Zimbabwe |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 29 July 2009[/tpl]
Privately owned news outlets used to be common; since the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) was passed, a number have been shut down by the government, including Daily News whose managing director Wilf Mbanga went on to form the influential The Zimbabwean."The nine lives of Wilf Mbanga"[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl], Metrovox, Mach 17, 2005. As a result, many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by exiled Zimbabweans. Because the internet is currently unrestricted, many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&year=2007 |title=Freedom House 2007 Map of Press Freedom: Zimbabwe |publisher=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] Reporters Without Borders claims the media environment in Zimbabwe involves "surveillance, threats, imprisonment, censorship, blackmail, abuse of power and denial of justice are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news." The main published newspapers are The Herald and The Chronicle which are printed in Harare and Bulawayo respectively.
In 2010 the Zimbabwe Media Commission was established by the inclusive, power-sharing government. In May 2010 the Commission licensed three new privately owned newspapers, including the previously banned Daily News, for publication.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64P5NX20100526 |title=Zimbabwe licenses new private newspapers |publisher=Reuters.com |date=26 May 2010|author=Banya, Nelson [/tpl] Reporters Without Borders described the decisions as a "major advance"."independent dailies allowed to resume publishing", International Freedom of Expression Exchange, 28 May 2010.

===Scouting===

It was in the Matabeleland region in Zimbabwe that, during the Second Matabele War, Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, and Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship.[tpl]cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page & company |year=1926 |page=2; Chapters 3 & 4 |oclc=407686[/tpl] In mid-June 1896, during a scouting patrol in the Matobo Hills, Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell woodcraft. Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance.[tpl]cite book |last=van Wyk |first=Peter |year=2003|url=http://www.burnhamkingofscouts.com/| title=Burnham: King of Scouts |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1-4122-0028-8[/tpl] It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham.[tpl]cite book |first=Tim |last=Jeal |authorlink=Tim Jeal |title=Baden-Powell |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1989 |isbn=0-09-170670-X[/tpl]
Scouting in the former Rhodesia and Nyasaland started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered. Scouting grew quickly and in 1924 Rhodesia and Nyasaland sent a large contingent to the second World Scout Jamboree in Ermelunden, Denmark. In 1959, Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at Ruwa. In 2009, Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at Gordon Park, a Scout campground and training area, as part of these celebrations.[tpl]cite web| title= Zimbabwe Scouts celebrate their centenary in a park that Baden-Powell had visited in 1936 | url= http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/africa/information_events/news/zimbabwe_scouts_celebrate_their_centenary_in_a_park_that_b_p_once_visited | accessdate =26 August 2009[/tpl]
Besides scouting, there are also leadership, life skills and general knowledge courses and training experiences mainly for school children ranging from pre-school to final year high school students and some times bthose beyond High school. These courses and outings, are held at places like Lasting Impressions ([tpl]YouTube|Q5GiuX0O_so|Lasting Impressions ~Zimbabwe[/tpl]), Far and Wide Zimbabwe (Far and wide.) and Chimanimani Outward Bound ([tpl]Wayback |date=20070616100110 |url=http://www.outwardbound.net/locations/zimbabwe.php |title=Outwardbound Zimbabwe [/tpl]), Just to name a few.

===National symbols===

The stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia, as well as on banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). It probably represents the Bateleur eagle or the African Fish Eagle.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds from Great Zimbabwe |journal=African Arts|year=1985|volume=18|pages=68–73, 99–100|author=Huffman, Thomas N. |jstor=3336358|issue=3|doi=10.2307/3336358[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Review: The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe Symbols of a Nation by Edward Matenga |journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|year=2001|volume=56|pages=105–106|author=Sinclair, Paul |jstor=3889033|issue=173/174|doi=10.2307/3889033[/tpl]
The famous soapstone bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe, built, it is believed, sometime between the 13th and 16th centuries by ancestors of the Shona. The ruins, which gave their name to modern Zimbabwe, cover some [tpl]convert|1800|acre|km2[/tpl] and are the largest ancient stone construction in Zimbabwe.[tpl]cite web | title = Great Zimbabwe |url=http://usp.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/art/greatzim/gz1.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070809145423/http://usp.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/art/greatzim/gz1.html|archivedate=2007-08-09|author= Landow, George P. |work=Brown University[/tpl]
Balancing Rocks are geological formations all over Zimbabwe. The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports. They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to weathering, as softer rocks surrounding them erode away. They are often remarked on and have been depicted on both the banknotes of Zimbabwe and the Rhodesian dollar banknotes. The ones found on the current notes of Zimbabwe, named the Banknote Rocks, are located in Epworth, approximately [tpl]convert|9|mi|km[/tpl] south east of Harare.[tpl]cite web|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/madzimbabwe/Buildings/Natural/Balancing%20Rocks/BalancingRocks.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090817012750/http://members.fortunecity.com/madzimbabwe/Buildings/Natural/Balancing%20Rocks/BalancingRocks.html |archivedate=2009-08-17 |title=Balancing Rocks|accessdate=15 November 2007[/tpl] There are many different formations of the rocks, incorporating single and paired columns of 3 or more rocks. These formations are a feature of south and east tropical Africa from northern South Africa northwards to Sudan. The most notable formations in Zimbabwe are located in the Matobo National Park in Matabeleland.
The National Anthem of Zimbabwe is "Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe" ([tpl]Lang-sn|"Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe"[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-nd|"Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe"[/tpl]). It was introduced in March 1994 after a nation-wide competition to replace "[tpl]Lang|sn|Ishe Komborera Africa[/tpl]" as a distinctly Zimbabwean song. The winning entry was a song written by Professor Solomon Mutswairo and composed by Fred Changundega. It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Zimbabwe.

==Health==

At independence, the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority. The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate.Davies, R. and Sanders, D. (1998).

In June 2011, the United Nations Population Fund released a report on The State of the World's Midwifery. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe is 790. This is compared with 624.3 in 2008 and 231.8 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 93 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 32. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 – Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 – improve maternal health. In Zimbabwe the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is unavailable and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 42.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State of the World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011[/tpl]

The wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government-run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidised by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrolment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe's education system consists of 2 years of pre-school, 7 years of primary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad. The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year. National examinations are written during the third term in November, with "O" level and "A" level subjects also offered in June.[tpl]cite web|url=http://harare.usembassy.gov/zimbabwe_educational_profile.html |title=Zimbabwe US Embassy |accessdate=15 November 2007[/tpl]
There are seven public universities as well as four church-related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited. The University of Zimbabwe, the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant. Notable alumni from Zimbabwean universities include Welshman Ncube; Peter Moyo (of Amabhubesi); Tendai Biti, Secretary-General for the MDC; Chenjerai Hove, Zimbabwean poet, novelist and essayist; and Arthur Mutambara, President of one faction of the MDC. Many of the current politicians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from universities in USA or other universities abroad.
The highest professional board for accountants is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa, Canada, the UK and Australia. A qualified Chartered Accountant from Zimbabwe is also a member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a conversion paper. In addition, Zimbabwean-trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States. The Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers (ZIE) is the highest professional board for engineers.
Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6566919.stm |title=BBC report on 40 years in Zimbabwe's schools |accessdate=3 November 2007 | date=19 April 2007 |work=BBC News[/tpl]
