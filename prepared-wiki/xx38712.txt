[[Lipid bilayer]]

CATEGORIES: Biological matter, Membrane biology

The lipid bilayer is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around cells. The cell membrane of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by pumping ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.
Natural bilayers are usually composed of phospholipids, which have a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails each. When phospholipids are exposed to water, they arrange themselves into a two-layered sheet (a bilayer) with all of their tails pointing toward the center of the sheet. The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water but not in oil. This assembly process is similar to the coalescing of oil droplets in water and is driven by the same force, called the hydrophobic effect. Because lipid bilayers are quite fragile and are so thin that they are invisible in a traditional microscope, bilayers are very challenging to study. Experiments on bilayers often require advanced techniques like electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the surface chemistry of a bilayer and can, for example, mark a cell for destruction by the immune system. Lipid tails can also affect membrane properties, for instance by determining the phase of the bilayer. The bilayer can adopt a solid gel phase state at lower temperatures but undergo phase transition to a fluid state at higher temperatures. The packing of lipids within the bilayer also affects its mechanical properties, including its resistance to stretching and bending. Many of these properties have been studied with the use of artificial "model" bilayers produced in a lab. Vesicles made by model bilayers have also been used clinically to deliver drugs.
Biological membranes typically include several types of lipids other than phospholipids. A particularly important example in animal cells is cholesterol, which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability. Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain integral membrane proteins. Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer. Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments, these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes. Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together. This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the fertilization of an egg by sperm or the entry of a virus into a cell.

==Structure and organization==

A lipid bilayer, also known as the phospholipid bilayer, is a sheet of lipids two molecules thick, arranged so that the hydrophilic phosphate heads point “out” to the water on either side of the bilayer and the hydrophobic tails point “in” to the core of the bilayer. This arrangement results in two “leaflets” that are each a single molecular layer. Lipids self-assemble into this structure because of the hydrophobic effect, which creates an energetically unfavorable interaction between the hydrophobic lipid tails and the surrounding water. Thus, a lipid bilayer is typically held together by entirely non-covalent forces that do not involve formation of chemical bonds between individual molecules.
Phospholipid-deficient mixed lipid bilayers are unique to plant thylakoid membranes. Thylakoid membranes contain largely reverse-hexagonal cylindrical phase forming monogalactosyl diglyceride(MGDG) and only 10 percent phospholipids. However, the second most abundant lipid, digalactosyl diglyceride forms aqueous lipid bilayer organisation. However, total lipid extract of thylakoid membranes does form aqueous lipid bilayers which find matching fluidity with native thylakoid membranes - thus interpreted to consist largely of lipid bilayer lamellae.YashRoy R.C. (1990) Magnetic resonance studies of dynamic organisation of lipids in chloroplast membranes. Journal of Biosciences, vol. 15(4), pp. 281-288.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225688482_Magnetic_resonance_studies_of_dynamic_organisation_of_lipids_in_chloroplast_membranes?ev=prf_pub
There are a few similarities between this structure and a common soap bubble, although there are also important differences. As illustrated, both structures involve two single-molecule layers of an amphiphilic substance. In the case of a soap bubble, the two soap monolayers coat an intervening water layer. The hydrophilic heads are oriented “in” toward this water core, while the hydrophobic tails point “out” to the air. In the case of a lipid bilayer, this structure is reversed with heads out and tails in. Another important difference between lipid bilayers and soap bubbles is their relative size. Soap bubbles are typically hundreds of nanometers thick, on the same order as the wavelength of light, which is why interference effects cause rainbow colors on a bubble surface. A single lipid bilayer, on the other hand, is around five nanometers thick, much smaller than the wavelength of light and is therefore invisible to the eye, even with a standard light microscope.

===Cross section analysis===

The lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometre) were magnified to the size of a watermelon (~1 ft/30 cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry,[tpl]cite journal |author=Lewis BA, Engelman DM |title=Lipid bilayer thickness varies linearly with acyl chain length in fluid phosphatidylcholine vesicles |journal=J.

The first region on either side of the bilayer is the hydrophilic headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9 nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5 nm outside the hydrophobic core.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nagle JF, Tristram-Nagle S |title=Structure of lipid bilayers |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1469 |issue=3 |pages=159–95 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11063882 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304-4157(00)00016-2 |pmc=2747654 |doi=10.1016/S0304-4157(00)00016-2[/tpl] In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane,[tpl]cite book |author=Parker J, Madigan MT, Brock TD, Martinko JM |title=Brock biology of microorganisms |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2003 |edition=10th |isbn=0-13-049147-0 [/tpl] which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.
Next to the hydrated region is an intermediate region that is only partially hydrated. This boundary layer is approximately 0.3 nm thick. Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail (core) side.[tpl]cite journal |author=Marsh D |title=Polarity and permeation profiles in lipid membranes |journal=Proc.

===Asymmetry===

In many naturally occurring bilayers, the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids,[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/236011a0 |author=Bretscher MS, |title= Asymmetrical lipid bilayer structure for biological membranes |journal=Nature |volume=236 |issue=61 |pages=11–12 |date=March 1972 |pmid=4502419|bibcode = 1972Natur.236...11O [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Verkleij AJ, Zwaal RF, Roelofsen B, Comfurius P, Kastelijn D, van Deenen LL |title=The asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in the human red cell membrane. A combined study using phospholipases and freeze-etch electron microscopy |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=323 |issue=2 |pages=178–93 |date=October 1973 |pmid=4356540 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0005-2736(73)90143-0 |doi=10.1016/0005-2736(73)90143-0[/tpl] In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bell RM, Ballas LM, Coleman RA |title=Lipid topogenesis |journal=J. Lipid Res. |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=391–403 |date=1 March 1981|pmid=7017050 |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7017050 [/tpl] The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine — normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet — is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.
Lipid asymmetry arises, at least in part, from the fact that most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.181.4100.622 |author=Bretscher MS |title=Membrane structure: some general principles |journal=Science |volume=181 |issue=4100 |pages=622–629 |date=August 1973 |pmid=4724478 |bibcode = 1973Sci...181..622B [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rothman JE, Kennedy EP |title=Rapid transmembrane movement of newly synthesized phospholipids during membrane assembly |journal=Proc.

Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kornberg RD, McConnell HM |title=Inside-outside transitions of phospholipids in vesicle membranes |journal=Biochemistry |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1111–20 |date=March 1971 |pmid=4324203 |doi=10.1021/bi00783a003 [/tpl]
It is possible to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells.[tpl]cite journal |author=Litman BJ |title=Determination of molecular asymmetry in the phosphatidylethanolamine surface distribution in mixed phospholipid vesicles |journal=Biochemistry |volume=13 |issue=14 |pages=2844–8 |date=July 1974 |pmid=4407872 |doi=10.1021/bi00711a010 [/tpl] By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition[tpl]cite journal |author=Crane JM, Kiessling V, Tamm LK |title=Measuring lipid asymmetry in planar supported bilayers by fluorescence interference contrast microscopy |journal=Langmuir |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=1377–88 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15697284 |doi=10.1021/la047654w [/tpl] or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition[tpl]cite journal |author=Kalb E, Frey S, Tamm LK |title=Formation of supported planar bilayers by fusion of vesicles to supported phospholipid monolayers |journal=Biochim.

This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lin WC, Blanchette CD, Ratto TV, Longo ML |title=Lipid asymmetry in DLPC/DSPC-supported lipid bilayers: a combined AFM and fluorescence microscopy study |journal=Biophys.

===Phases and phase transitions===

At a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane.[tpl]cite book |author=Berg, Howard C. |title=Random walks in biology |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=1993 |isbn=0-691-00064-6 |edition=Extended Paperback[/tpl] Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer are locked in place.
The phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.
Most natural membranes are a complex mixture of different lipid molecules. If some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase[tpl]cite journal |author=Dietrich C, Volovyk ZN, Levi M, Thompson NL, Jacobson K |title=Partitioning of Thy-1, GM1, and cross-linked phospholipid analogs into lipid rafts reconstituted in supported model membrane monolayers |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=19 |pages=10642–7 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11535814 |pmc=58519 |doi=10.1073/pnas.191168698 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810642D [/tpl] and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.

===Surface chemistry===

While lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior, it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.
Other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include phosphatidylserine (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis,[tpl]cite journal |author=Fadok VA, Bratton DL, Frasch SC, Warner ML, Henson PM |title=The role of phosphatidylserine in recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes |journal=Cell Death Differ. |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=551–62 |date=July 1998 |pmid=10200509 |doi=10.1038/sj.cdd.4400404 [/tpl] whereas PS in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization.[tpl]cite journal |author=Anderson HC, Garimella R, Tague SE |title=The role of matrix vesicles in growth plate development and biomineralization |journal=Front.

==Biological roles==

===Containment and separation===

The primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids.[tpl]cite journal |author=Koch AL |title=Primeval cells: possible energy-generating and cell-division mechanisms |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |year=1984 |pmid=6242168 |doi=10.1007/BF02102359 [/tpl] The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. Nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayer, and other structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatuses and lysosomes). See Organelle.http://csls-text.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/active/05_01.html
Prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer- the cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes have a range of organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.

===Signaling===

Probably the most familiar form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the end of one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.
Lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martelli PL, Fariselli P, Casadio R |title=An ENSEMBLE machine learning approach for the prediction of all-alpha membrane proteins |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=19 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=i205–11 |year=2003 |pmid=12855459 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12855459 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1027[/tpl] Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface.[tpl]cite book |author=Alberts, Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2002 |edition=4th |isbn=0-8153-4072-9 [/tpl] Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Filmore D |title=It's A GPCR World |journal=Modern Drug Discovery |volume=11 |pages=24–9 |year=2004[/tpl]
In addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes, it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.

==Characterization methods==

The lipid bilayer is a very difficult structure to study because it is so thin and fragile. In spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function.
Electrical measurements are a straightforward way to characterize an important function of a bilayer: its ability to segregate and prevent the flow of ions in solution. By applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current, the resistance of the bilayer is determined. This resistance is typically quite high[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] since the hydrophobic core is impermeable to charged species. The presence of even a few nanometer-scale holes results in a dramatic increase in current.[tpl]cite journal |author=Melikov KC, Frolov VA, Shcherbakov A, Samsonov AV, Chizmadzhev YA, Chernomordik LV |title=Voltage-induced nonconductive pre-pores and metastable single pores in unmodified planar lipid bilayer |journal=Biophys.

Electrical measurements do not provide an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.
Electron microscopy offers a higher resolution image. In an electron microscope, a beam of focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than a beam of light as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heuser JE, Reese TS, Dennis MJ, Jan Y, Jan L, Evans L |title=Synaptic vesicle exocytosis captured by quick freezing and correlated with quantal transmitter release |journal=J.

31P-NMR(nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy is widely used for studies of phospholipid bilayers and biological membranes in native conditions.

In addition, a specific H-N...(O)-P NMR experiment (INEPT transfer by scalar coupling 3JH-P~5 Hz) could provide a direct information about formation of hydrogen bonds between amid protons of protein to phosphate of lipid headgroups, which is useful in studies of protein/membrane interactions.
A new method to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force microscopy (AFM). Rather than using a beam of light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes)Y. Roiter, M. Ornatska, A. R. Rammohan, J. Balakrishnan, D. R. Heine, and S. Minko, Interaction of Nanoparticles with Lipid Membrane, Nano Letters, vol. 8, iss. 3, pp. 941–944 (2008). and phase transitions in supported bilayers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tokumasu F, Jin AJ, Dvorak JA |title=Lipid membrane phase behavior elucidated in real time by controlled environment atomic force microscopy |journal=J. Electron Micros. |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2002 |doi=10.1093/jmicro/51.1.1 |pmid=12003236[/tpl] Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution.[tpl]cite journal |author=Richter RP, Brisson A |title=Characterization of lipid bilayers and protein assemblies supported on rough surfaces by atomic force microscopy |journal=Langmuir |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1632–40 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/la026427w[/tpl] AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Steltenkamp S, Müller MM, Deserno M, Hennesthal C, Steinem C, Janshoff A |title=Mechanical properties of pore-spanning lipid bilayers probed by atomic force microscopy |journal=Biophys.

Lipid bilayers exhibit high levels of birefringence where the refractive index in the plane of the bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.
Lipid bilayers are complicated molecular systems with many degrees of freedom. Thus atomistic simulation of membrane and in particular ab initio calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive. Quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and quadrupole moments of lipid membranes.Alireza Mashaghi et al., Hydration strongly affects the molecular and electronic structure of membrane phospholipids.

==Transport across the bilayer==

===Passive diffusion===

Most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer. This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chakrabarti AC |title=Permeability of membranes to amino acids and modified amino acids: mechanisms involved in translocation |journal=Amino Acids |volume=6 |issue= 3|pages=213–29 |year=1994 |pmid=11543596 |doi=10.1007/BF00813743 [/tpl] Anions typically have a higher rate of diffusion through bilayers than cations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hauser H, Phillips MC, Stubbs M |title=Ion permeability of phospholipid bilayers |journal=Nature |volume=239 |issue=5371 |pages=342–4 |date=October 1972 |pmid=12635233 |doi=10.1038/239342a0 |bibcode = 1972Natur.239..342H [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Papahadjopoulos D, Watkins JC |title=Phospholipid model membranes.

When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the bilayer with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate.[tpl]cite journal |author=Paula S, Volkov AG, Van Hoek AN, Haines TH, Deamer DW |title=Permeation of protons, potassium ions, and small polar molecules through phospholipid bilayers as a function of membrane thickness |journal=Biophys.

This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.[tpl]cite journal |author=Xiang TX, Anderson BD |title=The relationship between permeant size and permeability in lipid bilayer membranes |journal=J.

===Ion pumps and channels===

Two special classes of protein deal with the ionic gradients found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, as is the case for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.
In contrast to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate them in order to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gouaux E, Mackinnon R |title=Principles of selective ion transport in channels and pumps |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5753 |pages=1461–5 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16322449 |doi=10.1126/science.1113666 |bibcode = 2005Sci...310.1461G [/tpl]

===Endocytosis and exocytosis===

Some molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to  pass through a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gundelfinger ED, Kessels MM, Qualmann B |title=Temporal and spatial coordination of exocytosis and endocytosis |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=127–39 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12563290 |doi=10.1038/nrm1016 [/tpl] In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour.[tpl]cite journal |author=Steinman RM, Brodie SE, Cohn ZA |title=Membrane flow during pinocytosis. A stereologic analysis |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=665–87 |date=March 1976 |pmid=1030706 |pmc=2109655 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1030706 |doi=10.1083/jcb.68.3.665[/tpl] If these two processes were not balancing each other the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.

===Electroporation===

Electroporation is the rapid increase in bilayer permeability induced by the application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core.[tpl]cite journal |author=Neumann E, Schaefer-Ridder M, Wang Y, Hofschneider PH |title=Gene transfer into mouse lyoma cells by electroporation in high electric fields |journal=EMBO J. |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=841–5 |year=1982 |pmid=6329708 |pmc=553119 [/tpl] Because of this, electroporation is one of the key methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Demanèche S, Bertolla F, Buret F, et al. |title=Laboratory-scale evidence for lightning-mediated gene transfer in soil |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=67 |issue=8 |pages=3440–4 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11472916 |pmc=93040 |doi=10.1128/AEM.67.8.3440-3444.2001 [/tpl]
This increase in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, indicating that the mechanism is the creation of nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.

==Mechanics==

As discussed in the Structure and organization section, the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together. Thus, the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart.[tpl]cite book |author=Boal, David H. |title=Mechanics of the cell |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-79681-4 [/tpl] It is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that studies have shown that Ka varies strongly with osmotic pressure [tpl]cite journal |author=Rutkowski CA, Williams LM, Haines TH, Cummins HZ |title=The elasticity of synthetic phospholipid vesicles obtained by photon correlation spectroscopy |journal=Biochemistry |volume=30 |issue=23 |pages=5688–96 |date=June 1991 |pmid=2043611 |doi=10.1021/bi00237a008 [/tpl] but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation. Because the forces involved are so small, it is difficult to experimentally determine Ka. Most techniques require sophisticated microscopy and very sensitive measurement equipment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Evans E, Heinrich V, Ludwig F, Rawicz W |title=Dynamic tension spectroscopy and strength of biomembranes |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=2342–50 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14507698 |pmc=1303459 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74658-X |bibcode=2003BpJ....85.2342E[/tpl]
In contrast to Ka, which is a measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb is a measure of how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase.YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of thylakoid membrane lipids by sucrose. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, vol. 1212, pp. 129-133.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15042978_Destabilisation_of_lamellar_dispersion_of_thylakoid_membrane_lipids_by_sucrose?ev=prf_pub Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.

==Fusion==

Fusion is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge, resulting in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.
There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step.[tpl]cite journal |author=Papahadjopoulos D, Nir S, Düzgünes N |title=Molecular mechanisms of calcium-induced membrane fusion |journal=J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=157–79 |date=April 1990 |pmid=2139437 |doi=10.1007/BF00762944 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Leventis R, Gagné J, Fuller N, Rand RP, Silvius JR |title=Divalent cation induced fusion and lipid lateral segregation in phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidic acid vesicles |journal=Biochemistry |volume=25 |issue=22 |pages=6978–87 |date=November 1986 |pmid=3801406 |doi=10.1021/bi00370a600 [/tpl] One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion. Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved "stalk" must form between the two bilayers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Markin VS, Kozlov MM, Borovjagin VL |title=On the theory of membrane fusion. The stalk mechanism |journal=Gen. Physiol. Biophys. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=361–77 |date=October 1984 |pmid=6510702 [/tpl] Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine, a highly curved lipid, promotes fusion.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chernomordik LV, Kozlov MM |title=Protein-lipid interplay in fusion and fission of biological membranes |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=72 |issue= 1|pages=175–207 |year=2003 |pmid=14527322 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161504 [/tpl] Finally, in the last step of fusion, this point defect grows and the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact.
