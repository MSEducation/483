==Traditions==

Rally began in 1948 as a way for classes to show their school spirit in the areas of volleyball intramurals, through skits, posters, songs, and cheers. Each class was given a name (Skip, Mac,or Sioux) to replace existing sororities on campus and carried  them until they graduated and passed them on to a little sister class.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ursulineneworleans.org/content.cfm?id=178|title=Our Heritage|accessdate=2007-05-11|author=UA[/tpl]
