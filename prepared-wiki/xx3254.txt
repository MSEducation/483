An elf (plural: elves) is a type of supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore.Lass 1994, p. 205; Lindow 2002, p. 110; Hall 2007. Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends almost entirely on texts in Old English or relating to Norse mythology.Hall 2007. Later evidence for elves appears in diverse sources such as medical texts, prayers, ballads, and folktales.
In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem generally to have been thought of as a group of beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the precise character of beliefs in elves across the Germanic-speaking world has varied considerably across time, space, and different cultures. In Old Norse mythological texts, elves seem at least at times to be counted among the pagan gods.
Elves are prominently associated with sexual threats, seducing people and causing them harm. A number of ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, perhaps stemming from the medieval period, describe human encounters with elves, elf-maids, etc. Related ballads on these themes are often attested over several countries. Some common motifs, which may also be seen in English, Scottish and Scandinavian folklore, are elves enticing men with their dance, and causing death.Hall 2007, 75-76.
In English literature of the Elizabethan era, elves became conflated with the fairies of Romance culture, so that the two terms began to be used interchangeably. German romanticist writers were influenced by this (particularly Shakespearean) notion of the "elf," and reimported the word Elf in that context into the German language. In Scandinavia, probably through a process of euphemism, elves often came to be known as (or were conflated with) the beings called the huldra or huldufólk. Meanwhile, German folklore has tended to see the conflation of elves with dwarves.Hall 2007, 32-33.
The "Christmas elves" of contemporary popular culture are of relatively recent tradition, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States, in publications such as Godey's Lady's Book. Elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, for which, see Elf (Middle-earth).

==Etymology==

The English word elf is from the Old English word most often attested as ælf (whose plural would have been *ælfe). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form elf during the Middle English period.Hall 2007, 176-81. During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as ælfen, putatively from common Germanic *ɑlβ(i)innjō), but during the Middle English period the word elf came routinely to include female beings.Hall 2007, 75-88, 157-66.
The main medieval Germanic cognates of elf are Old Norse alfr, plural álfar and Old High German alp, plural alpî, elpî (alongside the feminine elbe).Hall 2007, 5 These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, German, and the Scandinavian languages: the Common Germanic forms must have been *ɑlβi-z and ɑlβɑ-z.Hall 2007, 5, 176-77.
Germanic *ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z is generally agreed to be cognate with the Latin albus ('(matt) white'), Old Irish ailbhín (‘flock’); Albanian elb (‘barley’); and Germanic words for ‘swan’ such as Old English ylfetu and Modern Icelandic álpt. These all come from an Indo-European base *albh-, and seem to be connected by whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant 'white person', perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought that whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar suggested that elves were divinities of light. Alaric Hall, noting that the cognates suggest matt white, has instead tentatively suggested that later evidence associating both elves and whiteness with feminine beauty may indicate that it was this beauty that gave elves their name.Hall 2007, 54-55. A connection to the Rbhus, semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by Kuhn, in 1855.[tpl]cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Adalbert|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Die sprachvergleichung und die urgeschichte der indogermanischen völker|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=4|year=1855|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA110[/tpl], "Zu diesen ṛbhu, alba.. stellt sich nun aber entschieden das ahd. alp, ags. älf, altn . âlfr"in K.

While still sometimes repeated, however, this idea is not widely accepted.Hall 2007, 54-55 fn. 1.

===Elves in names===

Throughout the medieval Germanic languages, elf was one of the nouns that was used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.
Personal names provide the only evidence for elf in Gothic, which must have had the word *albs (plural *albeis). The most famous such name is Alboin. Old English names in elf- include the cogname of Alboin Ælfwine ('elf-friend', m.), Ælfric ('elf-powerful', m.), and Ælfweard (m.) and Ælfwaru (f.) ('elf-guardian). The only widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred (Old English Ælfrēd). German examples are Alberich, Alphart and Alphere (father of Walter of Aquitaine)[tpl]cite book|last=Paul|first=Hermann|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Grundriss der germanischen philologie unter mitwirkung|publisher=K. J. Trübner|year=1900|page=268|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wXcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA268[/tpl][tpl]cite book|editor-last=Althof|editor-first=Hermann|title=Das Waltharilied|publisher=Dieterich|year=1902|page=114|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3AcnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA114[/tpl] and Icelandic examples include Álfhildur. It is generally agreed that these names indicate that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Other words for supernatural beings in personal names almost all denote pagan gods, suggesting that elves were in a similar category of beings.Hall 2007, 55-62.
Elves appear in some place-names, though it is hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, and personal names, can appear similar to elf in early medieval and especially later evidence. The clearest English example is Elveden ('elves' hill', Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ('Elves' hill', Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ('elves' valley', Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.Hall 2007, 64-66

==Relationship of elves to Christian cosmologies==

Almost all of our textual sources about elves were written by Christians—whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, or nineteenth-century folklore collectors. As with the Aos Sí, beliefs in elves have, therefore, been a part of Christian cultures throughout their recorded history and there is a complex relationship between ideas about elves and mainstream Christian thought.The seminal statements of this theme are Jolly 1996 and Shippey 2005.
People have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology (though of course there are no rigid distinctions between these):

==Elves in medieval and early modern English-language sources==

The earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves are from Anglo-Saxon England. Here elves are most often attested in Old English glosses which translate Latin words for nymphs and in medical texts, which attest to elves afflicting humans and livestock with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm Wið færstice ('against a stabbing paid'), from the tenth-century compilation called Lacnunga, but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century Bald's Leechbook and Leechbook III.
Because of elves' association with illness, in the second half of the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illness with arrows. Scholars, but not the texts, labelled the illnesses elves caused as 'elf-shot'.Hall 2007, 96-118. This was encouraged by the idea that 'elf-shot' is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection.J. H. G. Grattan and Charles Singer, Anglo-Saxon Magic and Medicine Illustrated Specially from the Semi-Pagan Text ‘Lacnunga’, Publications of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, New Series, 3 (London: Oxford University Press, 1952), frontispiece.
However, the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons.Jolly, Karen Louise, ‘Elves in the Psalms? The Experience of Evil from a Cosmic Perspective’, in The Devil, Heresy and Witchcraft in the Middle Ages: Essays in Honor of Jeffrey B. Russell, ed. by Alberto Ferreiro, Cultures, Beliefs and Traditions, 6 (Lieden, 1998), pp. 19–44. Recent arguments suggest that while they caused disease, Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in later evidence from Britain and Scandinavia or the Irish Aos Sí, were like people.Shippey 2005, 168-76; Hall 2007, esp. 172-75. Like words for gods and men, the word elf is used in names where words for monsters and demons are not.Hall 2007, 55-62. Just as álfar are associated with Æsir in Old Norse, Wið færstice associates elves with ēse; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods.Hall 2007, 35-63. In Old English, the plural ælfe is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group).Hall 2007, 62-63.
While they may have been thought to cause disease with weapons, elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English sīden and sīdsa, cognate with Old Norse seiðr, and also paralleled in the Old Irish Serglige Con Culainn.Hall 2007, 119-56. This fits well with the use of Old English ælf and its feminine derivative ælbinne to gloss words for nymphs and with the word ælfscȳne, which meant 'elf-beautiful' and is attested describing seductively beautiful women.Hall 2007, 75-95.
Later in medieval English evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear more clearly as human-like beings, and increasingly as females rather than males, which may reflect developments in elf-beliefs during the medieval period.Hall 2007, 157-66; Shippey 2005, 172-76. They became associated with medieval romance traditions of fairies and particulary with the idea of a Fairy Queen. Sexual allure becomes increasingly prominent in the source material.Shippy 2005, 175-76; Hall 2007, 130-48.
In the early modern period, elves are most prominent in English-language sources in Lowland Scotland, where the early moden Scottish witchcraft trials produced many depositions of people who believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves. The similarities with Old English material, and particularly Wið færstice are close.Hall 2007, 112-15. It seems clear that elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people.Henderson and Cowan, 2001; Hall 2005.
It is in sixteenth-century Scotland that the term 'elf-shot' is first attested. It may not always have denoted an actual projectile as there is evidence that 'shot' could mean 'a sharp pain', but it and terms like elf-arrow(head) are sometimes used of neolithic arrow-heads, apparently thought to have been made by elves, and in a few witchcraft trials people attest that these were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged to be used by witches (and perhaps elves) to injure people and cattle.Hall 2005. Compare with the following excerpt from an 1750 ode by Willam Collins:

==Norse Eddas==

The Eddas describe the aboriginal spiritual traditions of the Norse culture, especially Iceland and Norway.

===Creation===

The Elder Edda couples the Æsir race of gods and álfar race of elves, mentioning the two classes side-by-side in a number of instances.(Stallybrass tr.) [tpl]Harvnb|Grimm|1880|loc=vol. 1, p. 25[/tpl] lists examples citing Saem. (=[tpl]cite book|editor1-last=Rask|editor1-first=Rasmus Kristian|editor2-last=Afzelius|editor2-first=Arvid August|title=Edda Saemundar|place=Stockholm|publisher=Typis Elmenianis|year=1818|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=ja&id=bWUAAAAAcAAJ[/tpl]), p. 8b (Völuspá 53);  p. 71a (Þrymskviða 7) (This juxtaposition also recurs in Old English ês and ylfe). The association sometimes extends to a third class, the Vanir gods, as in the poem För Skírnis (or Skirnir's Journey).[tpl]Refn|Grimm, citing [tpl]Harvnb|last=Rask|Afzelius|1818|loc=Saem. 83b[/tpl], i.e., the stanzas in Skírnismál where Skírnir is interrogated whether he is one of the Æsir, Vanir, or elves.[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Larrington|1996|loc=Skirnir's Journey, stanzas 17-18, p.64[/tpl]
Elves are mentioned as a distinct race, separate from other races such as the  Æsir gods, Vanir gods, giants (jǫtnar), dwarves, and mankind (męnn); and the elves evidently do not count among the "gods" (goð) or the "higher powers" (ginn-regin) — in Alvíssmál ("The Sayings of All-Wise").Cf. [tpl]cite journal|last=|first=|title=A Study of the Old Norse word Regin|journal=Journal of English and Germanic Philology|volume=15|year=1916|pages=251-|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=3tQlBRLkeUwC&pg=PA251[/tpl] The poem also mentions as a race the denizens of Hel, which may be marginally relevant, insofar as Grimm identifies them with the "dark elves" as distinct from "black elves" in his attempt to rationally explain that there may originally have been three sub-classes of elves. (See #Light-elves and dark-elves below).
Lokasenna relates that a large group of Æsir and elves had assembled at Ægir's court for a banquet, and from the many names named here, veritably "most of the Scandinavian pantheon," scholars have attempted to find a name of the elf here in vain.[tpl]Harvnb|Hall|2004|p=43[/tpl]. Not finding the elf is underlying argument for Hall saying Vanir and elves may be assimilated. It has been remarked that no individual elf with a known name has passed down to our knowledge,"other divine types are mentioned such as the Elves (ON alfar)..but no important or even specifically named gods are found.."

In German tradition his family is of mermaid lineage: in the Thidrekssaga (aka Vilkina saga), Velundr's father Vadi is given birth by a mermaid (sjákona), and in the German heroic poem Rabenschlacht, his son Witige is rescued by a mermaid kinswoman. Völundr also referred to as 'One among the Elven Folk' (álfa ljóði), in the poem Völundarkviða, whose later prose introduction also identifies him as the son of a king of 'Finnar', an Arctic people respected for their shamanic magic (most likely, the Sami). 
Just as elves are one of several races of beings, the elf's home Alfheim is assumed to be one of the Nine Worlds of Norse cosmology.[tpl]cite book|last=Hahn|first=Werner|title=Saemunds Edda: Lieder germanischer Göttersage|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QrNUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA270|page=270[/tpl] points out that the dwarf Alvis's poem only names 6 worlds, but worlds of 11 beings are named by various poems.
The eddic poem Völuspá contains a lengthy list of dwarf names that include Gandálfr "Wand-elf",  Vindálfr "Wind-elf", and Álfr "Elf".[tpl]cite book|last=Larrington|first=Caroline|title=The Poetic Edda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|pages=5–6|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=nBzuQZ4MCPIC&pg=PA5[/tpl] has "Staff-elf", "Wind-elf", "Elf"による Elsewhere, personages in the Yngling royal house carry names such as Álfr and Gandálfr. 

===Abode===

In the Elder Edda, Álfheimr (literally "elf-world") is mentioned as being given to Frey
as a tooth-gift—in Grímnismál. This may mean that Frey was given lordship over the dominion of elves. However, Larrington for example glosses Álfheim merely as the name of a "palace"a palace, like Valaskjálf mentioned in the adjacent stanza. See Grimnir's sayings 5.3 ([tpl]Harvnb|Larrington|1996|p=52[/tpl]), and "Annotated Index of Names".
For additional concrete description of Álfheimr, Snorri's Prose Edda must be consulted:
For a description of the more real-life geographical region of Álfheimr, see mentions in the §Sagas, below.

===Light-elves and dark-elves===

The Icelandic mythographer and historian Snorri Sturluson referred to dwarves (dvergar) as "dark-elves" (dökkálfar) or "black-elves" (svartálfar). He referred to other elves as "light-elves" (ljósálfar), which has often been associated with elves' connection with Freyr, the god of fertility (according to Grímnismál, Poetic Edda). Snorri describes the elf differences.
Snorri in the Prose Edda states that the light elves dwell in Álfheim while the dark elves dwell underground.

====Black elves====

Confusion arises from the introduction of the additional term svartálfar "black elves", which at first appears synonymous to the "dark elves"; Snorri identifies with the dvergar and has them reside in Svartálfaheim. This prompts Grimm to assume a tripartite division of light elves, dark elves and black elves, of which only the latter are identical with dwarves, while the dark elves are an intermediate class, "not so much downright black, as dim, dingy". In support of such an intermediate class between light elves, or "elves proper", on one hand, and black elves or dwarves on the other, Grimm adduces the evidence of the Scottish brownies and other traditions of dwarves wearing grey or brown clothing.

===Kennings===

In Skaldic poetry, the álfr word stem is used nearly always in a kenning for a warrior or a full-fledged man[tpl]Harvnb|Hall|2004|p=37[/tpl]. Citing [tpl]cite book|author=Sveinbjörn Egilsson|authorlink=Sveinbjörn Egilsson|year=1931|origyear=1860|title=Lexicon poeticum|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YpAVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA9[/tpl], entry under "álfr," which reads "hinc in appellationibus virorum poeticis usurpatur sec. Skaldam". The entry gives as an example the kenning álfr lindar, lit. "elf of the linden tree" that siginified a man or warrior ([tpl]lang-la|[tpl]linktext|vir[/tpl][/tpl]), which is from Sturla Þórðarson's fragment (preserved in the late Laufás-Edda).[tpl]Harvnb|Motz|1973-74|pp=98–99[/tpl](e.g. Jörmunrekr is periphrased by the kenning sóknar alfr ("álfr of attack").)Ragnarsdrápa 4 ([tpl]Harvnb|Hall|2004|p=37[/tpl])
Also much discussed is the kenning for the sun, álfroðull, literally "glory of the elves"[tpl]Harvnb|Davidson|1943|p=115[/tpl] or "ray or rod of the elves."[tpl]Harvnb|Motz|1973|p=95[/tpl] The kenning is suggestive of the elves' close link to the sun to some,[tpl]Harvnb|Motz|1973|p=99[/tpl] although others have been dismissive of such link, since roðull by itself denotes the sun.[tpl]Harvnb|Hall|2004|p=40[/tpl]

==Norse Sagas==

The sagas preserve the stories about prominent families, especially in Iceland and Norway during the Viking Era. The stories tend to be naturalistic and realistic, but sometimes mention strange encounters with elves, dwarves, giants, and magic, which convey indigenous folkbelief.
In the Thidrek's Saga a human queen is surprised to learn that the lover who has made her pregnant is an elf and not a man. In the saga of Hrolf Kraki a king named Helgi rapes and impregnates an elf-woman clad in silk who is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.

===Rituals===

Men after death could be venerated and sacrificed to, such as the petty king Olaf Geirstad-Elf.
In addition to this, Kormáks saga accounts for how a sacrifice to elves (álfablót) was apparently believed able to heal a severe battle wound:
Sigvat Thordarson, a missionary for St. Olaf wrote a poem around 1020, the Austrfaravísur ('Eastern-journey verses') describing his journey to the border areas. While in Sweden, being a Christian was refused board in a heathen household, because an álfablót ("elves' sacrifice") was being conducted there.
From the time of year (close to the autumnal equinox) and the elves' association with fertility and the ancestors, it might be assumed that it had to do with the ancestor cult and the life force of the family.
The legendary sagas and more fantastical portions of the bibliographical sagas of the kings contain reference to elves. The fays foreign tales also appear as elves in saga adaptations.

===Crossbreeding===

Several sources suggest that elves and men could procreate.
According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolf Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr) and could cause fallen warriors, including other elves,Setr Skuld hér til inn mesta seið at vinna Hrólf konung, bróður sinn, svá at í fylgd er með henni álfar ok nornir ok annat ótöluligt illþýði, svá at mannlig náttúra má eigi slíkt standast.http://www.heimskringla.no/original/fornaldersagaene/hrolfsagakraka.php to rise again.  Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material.
The Thidrekssaga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungr) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, the Volsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied.
In the saga of Hrolf Kraki a king named Helgi rapes and impregnates an elf-woman who is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.

===Elf as a kind of spirit===

At the beginning of Norna-Gests þáttr, which is a portion of the Greatest Saga of Olaf Tryggvason, the king (Olaf Tryggvasson) sees the presence of something which could have been either an ‘elf’ or an ‘[tpl]linktext|andi[/tpl]’ (spirit) slipping into a locked mansion. The elf, as it turns out, moved to the bed where Norna-Gest was sleeping, and prophesied about him. The elf said the ‘lock is strong’, but the king was not so wise to allow Norna-Gest inside to sleep with them. The elf was referring to the fact the King assumed Norna-Gest was a Christian. Norna-Gest had been christened with oil but was never baptized in water: ‘The elf had spoken so about the lock, because Gest had crossed himself in the evening like other Christians, even though he was actually heathen.’ The elf exits the king’s room by dematerializing thru the locked door.

===Alfr line of kings===

Mention of the land of Álfheimr, somewhat conflated with the view of the elven home Álfheimr is found in the Heimskringla and in The Saga of Thorstein, Viking's Son accounts of a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, and since they had elven blood they were said to be more beautiful than most men.

The Alberich who aids Ortnit is paralleled by the French Auberon, who aids Huon de Bordeaux. Both figures occur in 13th-century works, but commentators typically regard Auberon as the derivative form.[tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=208[/tpl], citing Grimm says Auberon derives from Alberich by a usual l→u change. Auberon entered English literature through Lord Berner's translation of the chanson de geste around 1540, then as Oberon, the king of elves and fairies in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (see below).
In early modern  sources, the German alp would be described as "cheating" or "deceiving" ([tpl]lang-gmh|trieben[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|trüben[/tpl]) its victims.(Stallybrass tr.) [tpl]Harvnb|Grimm|1883|p=463[/tpl]In Lexer's Middle High German dictionary under alp, alb is an example: Pf.  arzb. 2 14b= [tpl]Harvnb|Pfeiffer|1863|p=44[/tpl] ([tpl]cite book|last=Pfeiffer|first=F.|contribution=Arzenîbuch 2= Bartholomäus" (Mitte 13.

The editor glosses alp here as "malicious, teasing spirit" ([tpl]lang-de|boshafter neckende geist[/tpl]) In particular, Germans of the medieval age ascribed incidents of nightmare to the alp, and the idea stuck so that by the early modern age, the alp became known primarily as a spirit causing nightmares. (Hence the word for "nightmare" in German is Alptraum "elf dream", archaic form Alpdruck "elf pressure.") It was believed that nightmares are a result of an elf sitting on the dreamer's chest (incubi). This aspect of German elf-belief largely corresponds to the Scandinavian belief in the mara.

==Folklore==

===Late Middle Ages to Elizabethan era===

From around the Late Middle Ages, the word elf began to be used as a term loosely synonymous with fairy and other beings.it evolved to a general denotation of various nature spirits like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, the Northumbrian English hob and so forth. This mingling is found already in Geoffrey Chaucer's satirical Sir Thopas (1387 or later) where the title character sets out in quest of the "elf-queen", who dwells in the "countree of the Faerie".[tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=53[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Scott|1803|loc=vol.2, p.210[/tpl] Edmund Spenser in his Faerie Queene (1590-) uses "fairy" and "elf" interchangeably,"The names given by Spenser to those beings are Fayes (Fées), Farys or Fairies, Elfes and Elfins.. " ([tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=57[/tpl]) though his conceptions of the elf must be treated with caution, since they are "imaginary or allegorical characters" that populate his Utopian world,[tpl]Harvnb|Scott|1803|loc=vol.2, p.223n[/tpl] and Spenser's origins of the "Elfe" and "Elfin kynd" as being made and quickened by Prometheus is entirely his invention.[tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=57[/tpl]
Significant for the distancing of the concept of elves from its mythological origins was the influence from literature. In Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare imagined elves as little people. He apparently considered elves and fairies to be the same race. In his A Midsummer Night's Dream, his elves are almost as small as insects.[tpl]dubious|date=December 2011[/tpl]Although Spenser applies elf to full-sized beings in The Faerie Queene. The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of elf and fairy for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves collected in the modern period. But not all traditional tales were contaminated by Shakespearean era notions of elves as the wee people, notably the #Ballads such as The Queen of Elfan's Nourice.

====Elf-lock====

The elf-lock, or a tangle in the hair purportedly caused by the mischief of the elves, can be traced to the Shakespearean period. In a speech in Romeo and Juliet (1592) the "elf-lock" is not caused by an "elf" as such, but Queen Mab who is referred to as "the fairies' midwife", and who travels over people's face unnoticed and matting up their hair.[tpl]Citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50073178 |title=elf-lock |edition=2 |year=1989 |work=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 November 2009 [/tpl]; "Rom. & Jul. I, iv, 90 Elf-locks" is the oldest example of the use of the phrase given by the OED.Mercutio's speech in Romeo and Juliet quoted in: [tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|pp=331–2[/tpl]
German counterparts of the "elf-lock" are alpzopf, drutenzopf, wichtelzopf, weichelzopf, mahrenlocke, elfklatte, etc. (where alp, drude, mare, and wight are given as the beings responsible). Grimm who compiled the list, also remarked on the similarity to Frau Holle, who entangled people's hair and herself had matted hair.(Stallybrass tr.) [tpl]Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=vol. 2, p. 464[/tpl]

====Ballads====

References to the elf, elfland, or people of elfin nature can be found in a number of ballads of English and Scottish origin, surviving mostly in early modern redactions, though often rooted in Medieval tradition.
In a late version of the ballad of Thomas the Rhymer([tpl]citation|last=Child|first=Francis James|title=37. Thomas Rymer|work=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|volume=I|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1884|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wr1MdoTuBiQC&pg=PA317|pages=317-[/tpl]) taken down around 1800, Thomas's abductor is called the "queen of fair Elfland",[tpl]Refn|Child's Ballad # 37A, Brown's recited version in Tytler's MS[/tpl] and commentators have taken license to refer to her variously as "elfin queen,"[tpl]Harvnb|Scott|1803|loc=vol.2, p.280[/tpl], while commenting on the ancient MS.

And her original identity is more obscure, since in the ancient verse dating perhaps to c. 1400,"shortly after 1400, or about a hundred years after Thomas's death," ([tpl]Harvnb|Murray|1875|p=xxiii[/tpl]), but "MS. to be.. older, probably not much later period than the middle of the fourteenth century." ([tpl]cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Thomas|last2=Thoms|first2=William J.|title=Thomas and the Elf Queen|journal=The Folk-Lore Record|volume=2|year=1879|pages=165–173|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jOAtAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA165[/tpl][tpl]JSTOR|1252468[/tpl]) she is only referred to as "lady gaye" or "quene" in another "cuntre".[tpl]Harvnb|Murray|1875|p=xxiii[/tpl]Thomas ventures to address her as "qwene of heune" (late ballad:"Queen of Heaven") and she corrects him, saying "I took never so high degree / I am a lady of another country" (late ballad: I am queen of fair Elfland)
In Thomas the Rhymer, the Queen of Elfland is portrayed in a positive light. But in additional ballad examples, elves exhibit sinister character, bent on rape and murder, as in the Childe Rowland, or Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned. In none of these cases is the elf a spritely character with pixie-like qualities.

====Scandinavian ballads====

Sir Olaf/Oluf and the elf is a ballad type widely disseminated, with seventy Scandinavian ballads (counting variants)  according to Child's tally.[tpl]citation|last=Child|first=Francis James|title=42. Clerk Colvill|work=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|volume=I|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1884|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wr1MdoTuBiQC&pg=PA374|pages=374[/tpl] The common premise is that Olaf on his wedding day is invited to dance by elves, he refuses and as a consequence he lies dead the next day, and his would-be bride dies of grief.

===Modern period===

====Scandinavian folklore====

In Scandinavian folklore, which is a later blend of Norse mythology and elements of Christian mythology, an elf is called elver in Danish, alv in Norwegian, and alv or älva in Swedish (the first is masculine, the second feminine). The Norwegian expressions seldom appear in genuine folklore, and when they do, they are always used synonymous to huldrefolk or vetter, a category of earth-dwelling beings generally held to be more related to Norse dwarves than elves which is comparable to the Icelandic huldufólk (hidden people).
In Denmark and Sweden, the elves appear as beings distinct from the vetter, even though the border between them is diffuse. The insect-winged fairies in British folklore are often called "älvor" in modern Swedish or "alfer" in Danish, although the correct translation is "feer". In a similar vein, the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author H. C. Andersen is so tiny that he can have a rose blossom for home, and has "wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet". Yet, Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill. The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the huldra in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.
The elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones.An account given in 1926, [tpl]cite book|author=Hellström|year=1990|title=En Krönika om Åsbro|isbn=91-7194-726-4 |page=36[/tpl] The Swedish älvor.For the Swedish belief in älvor see mainly [tpl]cite book|last=Schön|first=Ebbe|year=1986|title=Älvor, vättar och andra väsen|isbn=91-29-57688-1|chapter=De fagra flickorna på ängen[/tpl]Cf. Keightely's chapter on Scandinavia: Elves ([tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1833|vol=1|pp=135-[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|pp=78-[/tpl], [tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1870|pp=78-[/tpl]) (sing. älva) were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king. They were long-lived and light-hearted in nature. The elves are typically pictured as fair-haired, white-clad, and (like most creatures in the Scandinavian folklore) nasty when offended. In the stories, they often play the role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven blow) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), pointing to their believed usage. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill – perhaps a custom with roots in the Old Norse álfablót.
In order to protect themselves against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects.The article Alfkors in Nordisk familjebok (1904). It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves. As the name suggests, the elves were perceived as a potential danger against people and livestock. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross one was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church during three consecutive Sundays.
The elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a kind of circle where they had danced, which were called älvdanser (elf dances) or älvringar (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. Typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle:
If a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Human being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif carried over from older Scandinavian ballads (as seen in the §Ballads section).
Elves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale Little Rosa and Long Leda, an elvish woman (älvakvinna) arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the subterraneans.[tpl]cite book|chapter=Lilla Rosa och Långa Leda|title=Svenska folksagor|year=1984|publisher=Almquist & Wiksell Förlag AB|location=Stockholm|page=158[/tpl]

====Huldra and huldufólk====

In Norwegian folklore are huldra or huldrafolk, which Keightley said were the regional names for elves."The Norwegians call the Elves Huldrafolk, and their music Huldraslaat" ([tpl]Harvnb|Keightley|1850|p=79[/tpl]) In Iceland, expression of belief in the cognate huldufólk or "hidden folk", the elves that dwell in rock formations, is still common. If the natives do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.novatoadvance.com/articles/2007/10/24/novato_living/doc471fb91b8f622734769663.txt |title=Novatoadvance.com, Chasing waterfalls ... and elves |publisher=Novatoadvance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14[/tpl] A 2006 and 2007 study on superstition by the University of Iceland’s Faculty of Social Sciences supervised by Terry Gunnell (associate folklore professor), reveal that natives would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts (similar results of a 1974 survey by Professor Erlendur Haraldsson, Fréttabladid reports). Gunnell stated: "Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations." His results were consistent with a similar study conducted in 1974.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=40764&ew_0_a_id=290137 |title=Icelandreview.com, Iceland Still Believes in Elves and Ghosts |publisher=Icelandreview.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14[/tpl]

===German lore===

The notion of the alp (and alias mare, drude) that caused nighmares continued into the early modern age. Meanwhile, Shakespearean and later English notions of elves were introduced into Germany, as discussed above under the #German cognates chapter of etymology.  Then legends about the "Erl-king", evidently an import from Scandinavia, but often construed as a form of elf, were German Romanticist writers in the 18th century.

====Erl-king====

An elven king occasionally appears among the predominantly female elves as in Denmark and Sweden. 
The legend of Der Erlkönig appears to have originated in fairly recent times in Denmark and Goethe based his poem on "Erlkönigs Tochter" ("Erlkönig's Daughter"), a Danish work translated into German by Johann Gottfried Herder.
The Erlkönig's nature has been the subject of some debate. The name translates literally from the German as "Alder King" rather than its common English translation, "Elf King" (which would be rendered as Elfenkönig in German). It has often been suggested that Erlkönig is a mistranslation from the original Danish ellerkonge or elverkonge, which does mean "elf king".
According to German and Danish folklore, the Erlkönig appears as an omen of death, much like the banshee in Irish mythology. Unlike the banshee, however, the Erlkönig will appear only to the person about to die. His form and expression also tell the person what sort of death they will have: a pained expression means a painful death, a peaceful expression means a peaceful death. This aspect of the legend was immortalised by Goethe in his poem Der Erlkönig, later set to music by Schubert.

====Elves and the cobbler====

In the first story of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Die Wichtelmänner, the title protagonists are two naked mannequins, which help a shoemaker in his work. When he rewards their work with little clothes, they are so delighted, that they run away and are never seen again. Even though Wichtelmänner are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale has been translated into English as The Elves and the Shoemaker, and is echoed in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories (see House-elf).
Variations of the German elf in folklore include the moss peopleThistelton-Dyer, T.F. The Folk-lore of Plants, 1889. Available online by Project Gutenberg. File retrieved 3-05-07. and the weisse frauen ("white women"). On the latter Jacob Grimm does not make a direct association to the elves, but other researchers see a possible connection to the shining light elves of Old Norse.Grimm, Jacob (1835). Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology); From English released version Grimm's Teutonic Mythology (1888); Available online by Northvegr 2004-2007, Chapter 32, pages 2,3; Marshall Jones Company (1930). Mythology of All Races Series, Volume 2 Eddic, Great Britain: Marshall Jones Company, 1930, pp. 221-222.

====English fairy tales====

In the Victorian period stereotype of the elf, appearing in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale Princess Nobody (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps.

===Christmas elf===

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland the modern children's folklore of Santa Claus typically includes green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats as Santa's helpers or hired workers. They make the toys in a workshop located in the North Pole. In this portrayal, elves slightly resemble nimble and delicate versions of the elves in English folktakes in the Victorian period from which they derived. The role of elves as Santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie Elf.

==Fantasy fiction==

The fantasy genre in the 20th century grows out of 19th-century Romanticism.
19th-century scholars such as Andrew Lang and the Grimm brothers collected "fairy-stories" from popular folklore and in some cases retold them freely.
A pioneering work of the genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien (1937) is seminal, predating the lecture On Fairy-Stories by the same author by a few years. In the 1939 lecture, Tolkien introduced the term "fantasy" in a sense of "higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent". Elves played a central role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion. Tolkien's writing has such popularity that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels (like Quenya, and Sindarin) became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games.
Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (popularized by the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game) tend to be more beautiful and wiser than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.
