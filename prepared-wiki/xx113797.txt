[[Segue (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Chilliwack (band) albums, 1983 compilation albums

Segue is a compilation album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack released in 1983.  It includes songs released throughout the band's career up to that point, as well as a preview of two tunes that would later appear (in slightly different versions) on the band's next album, Look In Look Out, released the following year.
The album was later re-released as Chilliwack's Greatest Hits, although the two new tracks were presented in their Look In Look Out versions, and several other tracks that appeared in single versions on Segue were featured in their full-length album versions on the later compilation.
