[[Mechanochemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Chemistry

Mechanochemistry or mechanical chemistry is the coupling of mechanical and chemical phenomena on a molecular scale and includes mechanical breakage, chemical behaviour of mechanically-stressed solids (e.g., stress-corrosion cracking), tribology, polymer degradation under shear, cavitation-related phenomena (e.g., sonochemistry and sonoluminescence), shock wave chemistry and physics, and even the burgeoning field of molecular machines.  Mechanochemistry can be seen as an interface between chemistry and mechanical engineering. It is possible to synthesize chemical products by using only mechanical action. The mechanisms of mechanochemical transformations are often complex and different from usual thermal or photochemical mechanisms.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Charles R. |last1=Hickenboth |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Moore |first3=Scott R. |last3=White |first4=Nancy R. |last4=Sottos |first5=Jerome |last5=Baudry1 |first6=Scott R. |last6=Wilson |year=2007 |title=Biasing Reaction Pathways with Mechanical Force, |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue= 7134|pages=423–427 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/nature05681 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7134/full/nature05681.html |accessdate=20 June 2013 |pmid=17377579[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]Carlier L. & al. , Greener pharmacy using solvent-free synthesis: investigation of the mechanism in the case of dibenzophenazine, Powder Technol. 2013,  240, 41-47.

The term mechanochemistry is sometimes confused with mechanosynthesis, which refers specifically to the machine-controlled construction of complex molecular products.[tpl]cite book|last=Drexler|first=K.

Mechanochemical phenomena have been utilized since time immemorial, for example in making fire.  The oldest method of making fire is to rub pieces of wood against each other, creating friction and hence heat, allowing the wood to undergo combustion at a high temperature.  Another method involves the use of flint and steel, during which a spark (a small particle of pyrophoric metal) spontaneously combusts in air, starting fire instantaneously.
