During World War II, Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2010/02/19/swarthmore-at-war-part-1/ |title=Daily Gazette |publisher=Swarthmore, Pennsylvania: Swarthmore College |last= |first= |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |year=2011[/tpl]
Wolfgang Köhler, Hans Wallach and Solomon Asch were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left Nazi Germany because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his noted conformity experiments at Swarthmore.

===Academic program===

Swarthmore's Oxbridge tutorial-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their junior year and often write honors theses. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students.  Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20-30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their senior year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded "Highest Honors"; others are either awarded "High Honors" or "Honors"; rarely, a student is denied any Honors altogether by the outside examiner. Each department usually has a grade threshold for admission to the Honors program.
Unusual for a liberal arts college, Swarthmore has an engineering program; at the completion of four years' work, students are granted a B.S. in Engineering. Other notable programs include minors in peace and conflict studies, cognitive science, and interpretation theory.
Swarthmore has a total undergraduate student enrollment of 1,491 (for the 2007-2008 year) and 165 faculty members (99% with a terminal degree), for a student-faculty ratio of 8:1. The small college offers more than 600 courses a year in over 50 courses of study.http://www.swarthmore.edu/quickfacts.xml Swarthmore has a reputation as a very academically oriented college, with 90% of graduates eventually attending graduate or professional school. Alumni earn graduate degrees at such institutions as UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, Harvard, MIT, Columbia, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale.Swarthmore Unspun
Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium (or TriCo) with nearby Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College, which allows students from any of the three to cross-register for courses at any of the others. The consortium as a whole is additionally affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, and students are able to cross-register for courses there.
While many in higher education recognize Swarthmore College's relative lack of grade inflation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2002/02/27/news/reed/ |title=Reed, Swarthmore: case studies in fighting inflation |publisher=TheDartmouth.com |date=2002-02-27 |accessdate=2011-03-24[/tpl]Swarthmore College Bulletin (October 2010) there is some controversy over the accuracy of such perceptions. One study by a Swarthmore professor in 1993 found "significant grade inflation." However, other professors and students dispute the findings based on their own experience. Current students sport Swarthmore t-shirts proclaiming, "Anywhere else it would've been an A."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmorephoenix.com/2004/03/25/news/grade-inflation-not-a-concern-for-professors |title=Grade inflation not a concern for professors - The Phoenix |publisher=Swarthmorephoenix.com |accessdate=2011-03-24[/tpl] Some have pointed out that statistics suggesting grade inflation over the past decades may be exaggerated by reporting practices, and the fact that grades were not given in the Honors program until 1996.Swarthmore College Bulletin (October 2010)  In the end, many still credit Swarthmore with having resisted grade inflation, bucking the perceived trend amongst peer institutions.Supplemental Information on the “National Grade”, Richard Sander, June 2005[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SRfNZFK5RSMC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=swarthmore+grade+inflation&source=bl&ots=tv4tdIfqJG&sig=omM4vBLNoDufN7f0z1c1IXI9qi0&hl=en&ei=AKdpTJyTIMyMnQfOx5HCBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=swarthmore%20grade%20inflation&f=false |title=Cool Colleges: For the Hyper-Intelligent, Self-Directed, Late Blooming, and Just Plain Different, Donald Asher, p.82-83 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2011-03-24[/tpl]
Since the 1970s, Swarthmore students have won 30 Rhodes Scholarships, 8 Marshall Scholarships, 151 Fulbright Scholarships, 22 Truman Scholarships, 13 Luce Scholarships, 67 Watson Fellowships, 3 Soros Fellowships, 18 Goldwater Scholarships, 84 Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowships, 13 National Endowment for the Humanities Grants for Younger Scholars, 234 National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships, 35 Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, and 2 Mitchell Scholarships.

===Admissions===

In 2012, 14.1% of applicants were admitted to Swarthmore for the Class of 2016. 33% of the admitted students were valedictorians or salutatorians, 53% were in the top 2% of their high school class, and 90% in the top decile.http://www.swarthmore.edu/x41965.xml For the Class of 2014, the middle 50% SAT range for mathematics, critical reading, and writing were 670-770, 670-760, and 680-770, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/documents/admissions/Class_Of_2014_Profile.pdf |title=Swarthmore College: Class of 2014 Profile |publisher=swarthmore.edu |accessdate=2011-09-21[/tpl] The Middle 50% ACT range is 29 - 33.

==Tuition and finances==

The total cost of tuition, student activity fees, room, and board for the 2008-2009 academic year was $47,804 (tuition alone was $36,154).http://www.swarthmore.edu/quickfacts.xml Swarthmore Quickfacts
One hundred percent of admitted students' demonstrated need is offered by the college. In total, about half of the student body receives financial aid, and the average financial aid award was $32,913 during the 2007-2008 year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x17668.xml |title=Swarthmore College :: Financial Aid :: FAQs: For Early & Regular Decision |publisher=Swarthmore.edu |accessdate=2011-12-01[/tpl] As a "need-blind" school, Swarthmore makes admission decisions and financial aid decisions independently.
Swarthmore's endowment at the end of FY2008 was $1,412,609,000. Endowment per student was $966,631 for 2007–2008, one of the highest in the country.
Operating revenue for the 2007-2008 school year was $130,536,000, over 40% of which was provided by the endowment. As is the case with most elite institutions of higher education, actual costs as measured on a per-student basis far exceed revenue from tuition and fees, and so Swarthmore's endowment serves to offset ever-rising costs of education, subsidizing every student's education at Swarthmore—even those paying full tuition.  For the 2008-2009 year, tuition, fees, and room & board charges ($47,804) fell well short of the actual cost of education per student, which was approximately $81,073 in 2007-2008.
Swarthmore ended a $230 million capital campaign on October 6, 2006, when President Bloom declared the project completed, three months ahead of schedule. The campaign, christened the "Meaning of Swarthmore," had been underway officially since the fall of 2001. 87% of the college's alumni participated in the effort.

===Loan-free movement===

At the end of 2007, the Swarthmore Board of Managers approved the decision for the college to eliminate student loans from all financial aid packages. Instead, additional aid scholarships will be granted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x16525.xml |title=Swarthmore College :: Financial Aid :: More about Swarthmore's Expanded Financial Aid Program |publisher=Swarthmore.edu |date=2007-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-01[/tpl]

==Campus==

Swarthmore is located [tpl]convert|11|mi[/tpl] southwest of the city of Philadelphia. The campus consists of [tpl]convert|399|acre|km2[/tpl], based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses campus radio station WSRN-FM as well as the weekly student newspaper, The Phoenix.
From the SEPTA Swarthmore commuter train station and the ville of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is also adjacent to the Scott Arboretum, cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33 |title=Press Releases from |publisher=Greater Philadelphia Gardens |accessdate=2011-03-24[/tpl] In 2011, Travel+Leisure named Swarthmore as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States."America's most beautiful college campuses", Travel+Leisure (September 2011)
The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms of Willets, Mertz, Worth, Alice Paul, and David Kemp Hall. To the west are the dorms of Wharton, Dana, and Hallowell, along with the Scott Amphitheater. The Crum Woods generally extend westward from the campus, toward the Crum Creek. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall, the two non-residential fraternities (Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon), and various other buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as  are the athletic facilities, while Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.Campus Map 
The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.http://www.swarthmore.edu/x4593.xml In total, the libraries hold over 800,000 print volumes as well as an expanding digital library of over 10,000 online journal subscriptions, reference materials, e-books, and other scholarly databases.

===Friends Historical Library===

Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present.  Besides the obvious focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America.  The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society. 

===Swarthmore College Peace Collection===

An internationally important archive of papers and books concerning the work of pacifist organizations and individuals, the Peace Collection forms part of the Swarthmore College Library. Its mission is to gather, preserve, and make accessible material that documents non-governmental efforts for nonviolent social change, disarmament, and conflict resolution between peoples and nations.Home Page, Swarthmore College Peace Collection

==Clubs and organizations==

There are more than 100 chartered clubs and organizations at Swarthmore, in addition to many other unchartered groups.  Clubs and organizations are a fundamental part of the College, and the center of many students' energies and social life. This extracurricular involvement contributes to the frequent characterization of Swarthmore students as both motivated and overworked.

===Mock Trial===

Founded in 2000, the Swarthmore Mock Trial program has won numerous accolades and boasts a team of over 30 members for the 2011-2012 season. The 2010-2011 competitive season resulted in all three teams competing at Regional Championships, two teams going on to Opening Round Championships, and one team qualifying and competing at the 2011 National Championships held in Des Moines, Iowa, where the team placed 15th in their section. Mock Trial’s A Team placed first out of 28 teams in the Philadelphia Regional Championship on February 20, 2011.

===Debate Society===

The Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society, named after a former United States Ambassador to Australia, is one of the few independently endowed organizations on campus. Members of the Society generally debate on the American Parliamentary Debate Association circuit.

===College Bowl===

Swarthmore's College Bowl team was considered one of the best in the country during the late 1990s and early 2000s - it won the 1998 Division I Undergraduate NAQT tournament.

===Student Political Groups===

====Swarthmore College Democrats====

The Swarthmore College Democrats are a student-run political organization on campus. In 2008, they brought Rep. Joe Sestak (D-PA) and former Alaska senator and then-presidential candidate Mike Gravel to campus.Sestak town-hall meeting focused on environmental issues :: The Daily GazetteGravel Stumps at Swat :: The Daily Gazette

====Swarthmore College Republicans====

While Swarthmore has historically had a mostly liberal student body, the Swarthmore College Republicans were revived as a group in the spring of 2008. However, they are no longer an active group on campus. Conservatives are now represented in their own Swarthmore Conservatives group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2010/11/18/syaf-responds |title=SYAF Responds to Criticisms | Daily Gazette |publisher=Daily.swarthmore.edu |accessdate=2011-12-01[/tpl]

===Greek life===

Two Greek organizations exist on the campus in the form of fraternities, Delta Upsilon and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. A third, Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.[tpl]Citation | last = Rand | first = Frank Prentice | coauthors = Ralph Watts, James E.

Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system,http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html Discrimination in the sorority system leading to a 79-year ban. Kappa Alpha Theta Chapter Official at Swarthmore | The Phoenix. Swarthmorephoenix.com (2014-04-03). Retrieved on 2014-04-12. However, in September 2012, the college announced that the ban on sororities would be reversed, citing Title IX regulations, as of the 2013 term. This prompted Kappa Alpha Theta to plan establishment of a chapter the following spring. The announcement sparked controversy on campus. Students initiated a petition for a referendum to vote on the existence of sororities on campus. However, this petition was dismissed, again citing a legal opinion that to disallow the chapter would be a violation of Title IX regulations. The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. This drew criticism from the Phoenix which published a staff editorial urging a referendum on Greek Life, which was later published after lobbying by anti-Greek advocates.  The non-binding referendum resulted in no definitive conclusions.StuCo Report: Referendum Not Binding | Daily Gazette. Daily.swarthmore.edu (2013-02-26). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.

Generally, the anti-Greek sentiment that curtailed fraternities and sororities on a scattering of Eastern and private schools has lessened. Even Ivy League schools where they had been long inactive are now home to thriving systems, for example, at Yale and Brown. Nationally, chapter membership is up markedly (citing public NIC and PHC figures) in what may be termed a more pragmatic decade, as the Greeks market their employment networking benefits. Also clearly pragmatic, administrators at several of the schools have relaxed their antagonism as the loss of chapters has resulted in decreased alumni funding, for example, in the case of Franklin & Marshall.[tpl]cite web|author=— Jack Stripling |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/12/22/frats |title=Stripling, Jack.

Inside Higher Ed, Dec 22, 2009 |publisher=Insidehighered.com |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12[/tpl] New colonization activity at Swarthmore therefore is following a broader trend toward increased acceptance, and diversity of student activity on campus.

===Athletics===

Swarthmore offers a wide variety of sporting teams with a total of 22 Division III Varsity Intercollegiate Sports Teams. 40 percent of Swarthmore students play intercollegiate or club sports.
Varsity teams include badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball. Notably lacking among these teams is football, which was controversially eliminated in 2000, along with wrestling and initially badminton. The Board of Managers offered a number of reasons for eliminating football, including lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting.Athlete recruiting difficulty[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]Athlete recruiting difficulty[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] Swarthmore also offers a number of club sport options, including men's and women's rugby, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, fencing, and squash.
Swarthmore is a charter member of the Centennial Conference, a group of highly selective private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland.

===Publications===

Swarthmore has two main student news publications.
One, a weekly newspaper called The Phoenix, is published nearly every Thursday. Founded in 1881, the paper began putting stories online in 1995. Its current tabloid format is more similar to a newsmagazine than a newspaper, with a color front cover. Two thousand copies, free of charge, are distributed across the college campus and to the Borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Bartash printing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The Daily Gazette, another student newspaper, is published daily and sent out via email to over 2,500 people on campus and across the world. Its coverage includes news, arts, and sports, and each issue includes opinion columns and/or op-eds. The first issues were distributed through e-mail during the fall semester of 1996, with an online edition soon following.
There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published biannually at the end of each semester. One is Spike, Swarthmore's humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including Nacht, which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and artwork; Small Craft Warnings, which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; Scarlet Letters, which publishes women's literature; Enie, for Spanish literature; OURstory, for literature relating to diversity issues; Bug-Eyed Magazine, a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as SWIL; Remappings (formerly "CelebrASIAN"), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; Alchemy, a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; Mjumbe, published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An erotica magazine, ! (pronounced "bang") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, Untouchables. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a new photography magazine, Pun/ctum, which features work from students and alumni.
The school's yearbook, The Halcyon, has been published annually since 1887.  Because Commencement is such an important event, The Halcyon includes professional photos of the ceremony and is therefore printed later, in the fall.  The new alumni, however, receive their book in the mail over the summer. The Halcyon is free to all students who attended Swarthmore for at least one semester during the academic year it covers.  As a result, The Halcyon is the college's most costly student publication and there is currently a movement to offer books free only to seniors, and to reallocate money towards subsidizing student textbook costs.

===A Cappella===

As of the 2009-2010 school year, there are five active a cappella groups. Sixteen Feet, founded in 1981, is the College's oldest group, as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group, and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Essence of Soul is a group whose music focuses on the music of the African Diaspora. Lastly, Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the Tri-College Consortium and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. Once every semester, all of the school's a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree.

===Radio===

WSRN 91.5 FM is the college radio station. It has a mix of indie, rock, hip-hop, folk, world, jazz, and classical music, as well as a number of radio talk shows. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the "Crisis of '69",Crisis of '69[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] extensively. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.Swarthmore Folk Festival Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000Cuts to athletic programs[tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] and the effects of 11 September 2001 on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is "Oído al Tambor", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show "Rayuela", which has been running since September 2009.

===Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association===

Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.

===Activism and community service===

Swarthmore is known as a center of social and political activism. The Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, endowed by philanthropist and Swarthmore alumnus Eugene M. Lang '38 in 2002, prepares students for leadership in civic engagement, public service, advocacy and social action. Swarthmore students are active in the local community, performing outreach programs in nearby Chester. The college has recently received significant coverage due to two student groups founded in 2004, the Genocide Intervention Network (now an independent non-profit organization) and War News Radio. Swarthmore's political landscape is generally considered almost exclusively far-left, though student activism is far less than it was in the heyday of the protest culture of the 1960s. Recent high-profile campaigns included a living wage organization (Swarthmore Living Wage & Democracy Campaign); actions surrounding the electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions) by campus groups Students for Free Culture and Why War?; and a "Kick Coke" campaign aimed at replacing soda machines offering Coca-Cola with alternative products.  The Kick-Coke campaign had a victory in November 2006 when the College agreed to cut its contract with Coca-Cola.
