===Host selection===

The SEA Games Federation (SGF) meeting in Myanmar on July 2012 confirmed that Malay­sia would host the regional biennial event in 2017, should there be no other country willing to bid for the host job. Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) secretary general Datuk Sieh Kok Chi, who attended the meeting, said that Myanmar would host the Ga­­mes next year, followed by Singapore in 2015. Then it should be Brunei’s turn but it wants to host the 2019 Games instead of the 2017 edition. So, Malaysia is willing to be the host for the 2017 Games. Co-host will in Sarawak and Sabah, but still decision..
Since the inaugural SEA Games, which was held in Bangkok in 1959, Malaysia has hosted the 1977, 1989 and 2001 Games. The last time Malaysia host the Games is in Kuala Lumpur 2001. By the time the country will host the games, it will be 16 years after Malaysia hosted the biennial event.
