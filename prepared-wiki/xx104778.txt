CATEGORIES: Bandplans, Implants, Medical technology

Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) is the name of a specification for using a frequency band between 402 and 405 MHz in communication with medical implants. It allows bi-directional radio communication with a pacemaker or other electronic implants. The maximum transmit power is very low, EIRP=25 microwatt, in order to reduce the risk of interfering with other users of the same band. The maximum used bandwidth at any one time is 300 kHz, which makes it a low bit rate system compared with WiFi or Bluetooth. The main advantage is the additional flexibility compared to previously used inductive technologies, which required the external transceiver to touch the skin of the patient. MICS gives a range of a couple of meters.
The standard is defined by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI):

Different antennas can be used for communication inside living bodies. For implanted applications, dipole, loop and patch antennas can all be used within this band.
