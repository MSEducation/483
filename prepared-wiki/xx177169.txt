The district court in Sendai sentenced him to life imprisonment on March 30, 2004 for one murder and four attempted murders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/weekly/news/nn2004/nn20040410a6.htm|title=Nurse gets life for patient slaying|publisher=The Japan Times WEEKLY|date=2004-04-10|accessdate=2008-03-22[/tpl] Japanese police insisted that Vecuronium's molecular mass is 258, but this true molecular mass is 557.

He appealed to Supreme Court, which upheld the sentence on February 25, 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hdrjapan.com/option,com_myblog/show,Top-court-dismisses-nurses-protest-over-life-sentence-for-murdering-patient.html/Itemid,67/|title=Top court dismisses nurse's protest over life sentence for murdering patient|author=Mainichi Shimbun|publisher=HDR Japan|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2008-03-21[/tpl]
