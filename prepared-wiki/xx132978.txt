==Career==

===Millwall===

Born in Greenwich, London, Craig came through the youth ranks at Millwall. Adept as a centre back or a left back, Craig received his maiden call into the first team squad for a Division One league match against Derby County on 16 April 2003. He was an unused substitute during the 2–1 win. Craig was an unused substitute for three of the following four games and made his professional debut with a starting appearance in a 3–3 draw with Nottingham Forest on 26 April 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=132 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2002/2003 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] He lasted 67 minutes before being substituted for Robbie Ryan. He started in the final game of the 2002–03 season at home to Coventry City and scored the first senior goal of his career in the 2–0 win, opening the scoring on 51 minutes. Craig started the 2003–04 season as a virtual ever-present and completed his first 90 minutes for the club in a 0–0 draw with Stoke City on 26 August 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=133 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2003/2004 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] His final appearance of the season came in a 0–0 draw with Rotherham United on 11 October. Craig made 10 appearances during the 2003–04 season and scored no goals. Craig began the 2004–05 season out of favour with manager Dennis Wise[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chairboys.co.uk/onthenet/news0405/dec2004.htm |title=Wycombe Wanderers - December 2004 News from Chairboys on the Net |publisher=www.chairboys.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] and had to wait until 19 February 2005 for his first appearance, which came with a start in a 1–0 league defeat to Stoke City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=134 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2004/2005 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] He appeared in 10 successive games for the Lions through to mid-April, which were his only appearances of the season. Under new manager Colin Lee, Craig made sporadic appearances during the opening two months of the 2005–06 season, before cementing a regular place in the team in late 2005[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=135 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2005/2006 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] under new manager and former teammate Dave Tuttle. The first red card of his senior career in a 2–0 defeat to Reading on 17 December failed to halt Craig's progress. Craig received his second red card of the season for two bookable offences in a 1–1 draw with Ipswich Town on 11 March 2006. Craig made 33 appearances during the 2005–06 season and scored no goals as the Lions suffered relegation to League One. Under new manager Nigel Spackman, Craig started Millwall's first two games of the season, but was sent off after only four minutes of the latter game against Leyton Orient.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=136 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2006/2007 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Craig returned to the team after his suspension and the replacement of Spackman with Willie Donachie, but a dislocated shoulder suffered in a 2–0 Football League Trophy second round win over Bournemouth on 14 October 2006[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.millwall-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/craig_remains_an_injury_doubt_306578/index.shtml |title=Craig remains an injury doubt - Millwall FC |publisher=Millwall MAD |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] saw Craig out of action until January 2007.

====Wycombe Wanderers (loan)====

Craig joined League Two side Wycombe Wanderers on a "short term" loan on 22 October 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3708180.stm |title=BBC SPORT | Football | Transfers - October 2004 |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] and made his debut with a starting appearance in a 1–1 home draw with Mansfield Town. The loan was later extended to 22 January 2005, but a failure to extend the loan further saw Craig make his final appearance for the club on the final day of his loan in a 1–1 draw with Macclesfield Town. Craig made 18 appearances for the Chairboys and scored no goals.

===Crystal Palace===

Craig signed for Championship side Crystal Palace on 27 June 2007 on a three year deal for an undisclosed fee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/6245602.stm |title=BBC SPORT | Football | My Club | Crystal Palace | Eagles swoop for Lions left-back |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Upon joining, he said "It's a nice step up for me. I've played in the Championship before with Millwall and I'm thoroughly looking forward to it". Craig had a successful start to his Palace career, starting in 13 of the Eagles' opening 14 games, but a shoulder injury suffered in a 0–0 draw with Scunthorpe United on 3 November 2007 put him out of action for the next four months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1851267.print/ |title=Craig injury twist (From Lancashire Telegraph) |publisher=Lancashiretelegraph.co.uk |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=137 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2007/2008 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] He was an unused substitute for the final game of the season against Burnley, which saw Palace confirm a spot in the 2008 Championship play-offs. Craig was an unused substitute for the 2–1 playoff first round second leg defeat to Bristol City, which saw Palace defeated 4–2 on aggregate to consign them to Championship football for another season. Craig departed the Eagles in July 2008, having made just 14 appearances and fallen behind Clint Hill and Lee Hills in the pecking order for the left back position.[tpl]cite web|author=Holmesdale Online www.holmesdale.net |url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=3968 |title=Craig returns to Lions - Crystal Palace FC Supporters' Website - The Holmesdale Online |publisher=Holmesdale.net |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]

Craig signed permanently for the second time with Millwall on 11 July 2008, on a three-year deal. Manager Kenny Jackett said he "was very impressed with Tony during his loan spell here last season and I think he'll be a good asset for us". Craig made a personal-best 52 appearances during the 2008–09 season, scoring two goals and helping Millwall to a place at Wembley Stadium for the 2009 League One play-off Final versus Scunthorpe United.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=138 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2008/2009 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Goals from Gary Alexander put the Lions 2–1 ahead, but the season ended in heartbreak for Craig after second half strikes from Matt Sparrow and Martyn Woolford sent Scunthorpe to the Championship. Craig was in and out of the team during the 2009–10 season, not holding a regular place until December 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=139 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2009/2010 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] In the absence of Paul Robinson, Craig took over the captaincy.

In the 2010 League One play-off Final, the Lions were triumphant and defeated Swindon Town 1–0 to return to the Championship after three seasons in League One, though Craig was forced off with a broken metatarsal on 44 minutes. Craig had a mixed 2010–11 season back in the Championship, having runs as a starter through the middle of the campaign and made 26 appearances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=140 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2010/2011 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Craig began the 2011–12 season as a regular starter, but fell out of favour and didn't recover his starting position back on a regular basis until the final month of the season, though he still managed 28 appearances.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=34861&season_id=141 |title=Tony Craig | Football Stats | Brentford | Season 2011/2012 |publisher=Soccer Base |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Craig left the club in July 2012, having made 141 appearances and scored four goals in his third stint with the club.
