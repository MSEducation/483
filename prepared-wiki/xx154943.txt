Macarthur Anglican School is an independent, Anglican, co-educational, day school, located in Cobbitty, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

==Foundation==

The school was founded and enrolled its first students in 1984. Under the guidance of the Foundation Headmaster, Mr David Lloyd, 90 students were enrolled in Years 7 and 8, with the first of these to complete their Higher School Certificate in 1988. During 1984, the school moved from temporary facilities in Campbelltown to the [tpl]convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] site in Wilson Crescent Narellan, adjacent to St Thomas' Anglican Church. In its first year, the school had five members of staff and one secretary.  Mr Riley Warren, was appointed in 1989, just as the school was reaching 500 students. In 1993, 60 students were enrolled in the newly established Junior School, under the leadership of Mr Andrew McPhail.
Rapid growth of the school beyond early expectations confirmed the need for independent school education in the surrounding district. It was soon apparent that more land would be needed and the [tpl]convert|120|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site at Cobbitty was purchased. All secondary students and facilities were moved to Cobbitty in 1997 while the Junior School expanded to 400 children at the Narellan Campus. After years of trying to sell the Narellan campus, in order to relocate the Junior School to the Cobbitty campus, it was sold in early 2004. New facilities were built and from July 2005 the whole school was together again at the Cobbitty campus.
In 2009 Macarthur not only marked it's Silver Jubilee it also celebrated the appointment of a new Headmaster, Dr David Nockles.
Today, Macarthur Anglican School provides Christian education for more than 1000 young people of the Macarthur Region, ranging from 4 to 18 years of age.

==The School Crest and Motto==

The School Crest, worn by students on the front of the school blazer, depicts the Christian foundations of the school. On it can be seen the Cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible containing the Word of God, and three gold crowns representing the three Persons of the Godhead - Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The motto "Through Christ Alone" aims to remind students of God. The school also uses two other mottos, 'Enter to Learn' and 'Go Out to Serve'. These mottos reflect the vision of the school,

Macarthur Anglican School has established links with a number of overseas schools in Hungary, Japan and Canada. These links have provided Macarthur students the opportunity to gain a more international education with student exchange and international school visits. From the link with Pacific Academy in Vancouver, Canada, Macarthur students have been able to take place in a Christian Outreach mission trip to Thailand, which has happened annually since 2004. In 2005, Macarthur Anglican School has been supporting the building of an Anglican School, St. Michael's Secondary School, in Tanzania. In 2006, the school gave over $40,000 to support this.
