==Later in life==

Due to the shortage of work Amos joined the army in 1938, enlisting as a signaller in the 7th Field Artillery but eventually becoming the unit’s camouflager, serving in New Guinea and Borneo, and obtaining the rank of Lieutenant, before he was discharged on 21 December 1945. Still wanting a career in the art world he sold cartoons to Rydges and Quiz before worked freelance for K.G. Murray Publishing Company.  Amos' first assignment for K.G. Murray was to draw a full comic book, The Lost Patrol.  The strip dealt with Australian soldiers fighting in New Guinea against the Japanese, for which he was able to call upon his own first-hand experience.  Amos went on to produce a further series of comics, including The Moon Mirror,[tpl]Cite book | title=A Climax All Australian Comic | publication-date=1947 | publisher=K.G.

Devil Doone was a soldier of fortune strip that had previously been handled for a brief period by June Mendoza and Carl Lyon. Amos took over the strip in April 1946 and continued to draw the monthly strip for 44 issues until the middle of 1969. Devil Doone was also reprinted in comic book form.[tpl]Cite book | author1=Gold, Ronald Carson | author2=Amos, Hart (Illustrator)| title=The Adventures of Devil Doone | publication-date=1900 | publisher=Murray Publishing Co. | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8460994 | accessdate=8 August 2013 [/tpl] Writing in Cartoonists in Australia (View Productions, 1983), Amos recalled: "During all this time...I had not taken a holiday and was slipping into the trap of work overload. And one morning the trap snapped shut...I hit a psychological block and found I couldn't draw a damn thing! Frightened stiff, I had to quit Murray magazines and ease off from the pressure of publishing deadlines."
After leaving K.G. Murray, Amos was persuaded to take on the illustration work for John Dixon's comic strip, Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors. His first pages for Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors appeared in March 1970 with his last one published in June 1977,[tpl]Cite book|title=Bonzer; Australian Comics 1900s - 1990s |author=Shiell, Annette (Editor)|publisher=Elgua Media|year=1998|place=Redhill, South Australia|isbn=1-876308-12-5[/tpl] when he decided to retire from comic strip illustrations.
