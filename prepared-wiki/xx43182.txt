[[Tillandsia]]

CATEGORIES: Tillandsia, Tillandsioideae, Epiphytes

Tillandsia is a genus of around 540 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of Central and South America, the southern United States and the West Indies.[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl] Common names for Tillandsia include air plant, Ball moss (T. recurvata) and Spanish moss, the latter referring to T. usneoides in particular.Flora of North America, v 22, genus Tillandsia
The thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought.   Tillandsia species are epiphytes (also called aerophytes or air plants) – i.e. they normally grow without soil while attached to other plants. Epiphytes are not parasitic, depending on the host only for support. Moisture and nutrients are gathered from the air (dust, decaying leaves and insect matter) through structures on the leaves called trichomes.

==Etymology==

The genus Tillandsia was named by Carolus Linnaeus after the Swedish physician and botanist Dr. Elias Tillandz (originally Tillander) (1640-1693).Linnaeus, Carl. 1753. Species Plantarum 286. 

==Description==

Tillandsia are epiphytes and need no soil because water and nutrients are absorbed through the leaves. The roots are used as anchors only. Reproduction is by seeds or by offsets called "pups". A single plant could have up to a dozen pups.
Although not normally cultivated for their flowers, some Tillandsia will bloom on a regular basis. In addition, it is quite common for some species to take on a different leaf colour (usually changing from green to red) when about to flower. This is an indication that the plant is monocarpic (flowers once before dying) but offsets around the flowering plant will continue to thrive.Gardner, C. S. 1982.

==Ecology==

Temperature is not critical, the range being from 32°C down to 10°C. They are sensitive to frost, except for the hardiest species, T. usneoides, which can tolerate night-time frosts down to about -10°C.  In some situations Tillandsia are often termed pioneer plants occupying environments, like rock cliffs, that few other plants can. They grow through a process called a CAM cycle, where they close the stomata during the day and open it at night to uptake carbon and release oxygen.

==Uses==

Tillandsia is a primary ingredient in an herbal supplement to treat pollen allergies.http://www.tropicalplantbook.com/garden_plants/bromelia_species/tillandsia/tillandsia.htm
