Nawaf Muhammed Salim al-Hazmi ([tpl]lang-ar|نواف الحازمي[/tpl], [tpl]transl|ar|Nawāf al-Ḥāzmī[/tpl]; also known as Rabia al-Makki)National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, 9/11 Commission, p. 166 (August 9, 1976 – September 11, 2001) was a Saudi citizen and one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, which they crashed into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks in the United States.
Hazmi and a longtime friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the Bosnian War. Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.
Already long time affiliates of Al-Qaeda with extensive fighting experience, Hazmi and Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airlines into designated targets in the United States. Hazmi and Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Hazmi trained in an Al-Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999. He traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al-Qaeda Summit.
Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles, California from Bangkok, Thailand, on January 15, 2000, with Khalid al-Mihdhar. The two settled in San Diego, staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by Anwar Al-Awlaki. The two took flying lessons during that month in San Diego. Due to Hazmi and Mihdhar's poor English skills, they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious.
Mihdhar left Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000, and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001.
The CIA reportedly received Hazmi's name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks.
On September 10, 2001, Hazmi, along with Mihdhar and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, Hazmi and four other terrorists, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hani Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Hazmi was initially dismissed as a "muscle hijacker" following the attacks, but was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed."Document links al Qaeda paymaster, 9/11 plotter", Los Angeles Times, 27 September 2002 His younger brother, Salem al-Hazmi, was another of the hijackers aboard the same flight.

==Background==

Nawaf was born in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He traveled to Afghanistan as a teenager in 1993.  CNN's preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed "He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm", and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in Jizan.
In 1995, he and his childhood friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, joined a group that went to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War.[tpl]cite book |title=9/11 Commission Report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm |chapter=Chapter 5.2 – The "Planes Operation" |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=September 30, 2008[/tpl]  Afterwards, Nawaf returned to Afghanistan along with his brother Salem, and Mihdhar.  In Afghanistan, they fought alongside the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance, and joined up with Al-Qaeda.  Nawaf al-Hazmi returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Selected for the 9/11 plot==

Osama bin Laden held Hazmi and Mihdhar in high respect, with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda later referred to Hazmi as Mihdhar's "Second-in-command".Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others  When Bin Laden committed to the "planes operation" plot in spring 1999, Bin Laden personally selected Hazmi and Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers.  In addition to Hazmi and Mihdhar, two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot, which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States.  Known as Rabi'ah al-Makki during the preparations, Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the United States, he already had a US visa when Bin Laden selected him.  Hazmi obtained a B-1/B-2 tourist visa on April 3, 1999 from the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier.  Hazmi's passport did have indicators of Al-Qaeda association, but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those.[tpl]cite web |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |format=PDF|title=9/11 and Terrorist Travel |work=Staff Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |year=2004 |accessdate=September 26, 2008[/tpl]
In the autumn of 1999, these four attended the Mes Aynak training camp in Afghanistan, which provided advanced training.  Hazmi went with the two Yemenis, Tawfiq bin Attash (Khallad) and Abu Bara al Yemeni, to Karachi, Pakistan where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the plot's coordinator, instructed him on western culture, travel, as well as taught some basic English phrases.  Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi, but instead left for Yemen.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting.  Before leaving for Malaysia, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored Hazmi's Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make it appear that Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via Dubai.
After the attacks, the Associated Press would re-publish a "bizarre" story by the Cody Enterprise that quoted witnesses stating that Nawaf entered the United States during the autumn of 1999, crossing along the Canadian border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local high school in Cody, Wyoming.  Leaving the city 45 minutes later with the remaining cardboard boxes, the men allegedly asked "how to get to Florida."One Sept. 11 Terrorist in Cody Two Years Ago, The Associated Press, October 23, 2001

===Malaysia summit===

Based on information uncovered by the FBI in the 1998 United States embassy bombings case, the National Security Agency (NSA) began tracking the communications of Mihdhar's father-in-law Ahmad Muhammad Ali al-Hada, who was facilitating al-Qaeda communications, in 1999. Authorities also became aware of Hazmi, as a friend and associate of Mihdhar.  Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with Al-Qaeda, and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997.  He also said that he revealed this to the CIA, saying "What we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al-Qaeda, in both the ." The CIA strongly denies having received any such warning.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/10/18/saudis/index_np.html |title=Did the Saudis Know About 9/11? |publisher=Salon.com |date=October 18, 2003 |accessdate=September 30, 2008[/tpl]

In late 1999 the NSA informed the CIA of an upcoming meeting in Malaysia, which Hada mentioned would involve "Khalid", "Nawaf", and "Salem".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all |author=Wright, Lawrence |title=Did the CIA Stop an FBI Detective from Preventing 9/11 |date=July 10, 2006 |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=September 30, 2008[/tpl]  On January 5, Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur, where he met up with Mihdhar, Attash, and Abu Bara.  The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit, during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged.  At this time, there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot, but Bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States.  Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also at the summit, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed possibly attended the summit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/could/ |title=The Man Who Knew  – What If...|work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |accessdate=September 29, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Fouda, Yosri and Nick Fielding |title=Masterminds of Terror |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=1-55970-708-9 |pages=129–130[/tpl]  In Malaysia, the group stayed with Yazid Sufaat, a local member of Jemaah Islamiyah, who provided accommodations at request of Hambali.  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities, who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA.  Malaysian authorities reported that Mihdhar spoke at length with Tawfiq bin Attash, one of the Yemenis, and others who were later involved in the USS Cole bombing.  Hazmi and Mihdhar also met with Fahd al-Quso, who was later involved in the USS Cole bombing.  After the meeting, Mihdhar and Hazmi traveled to Bangkok in Thailand on January 8, and left a week later on January 15 to travel to the United States.

==In the United States==

===Enters the United States with Mihdhar===

On January 15, 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived together at Los Angeles International Airport from Bangkok, and were admitted for a six-month period.  Immediately after entering the country, Nawaf and Mihdhar met Omar al-Bayoumi in an airport restaurant. Bayoumi claims he was merely being charitable in helping the two seemingly out-of-place Muslims to move to San Diego where he helped them find an apartment near his own, co-signed their lease, and gave them $1500 to help pay their rent.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/66665 |title=The Saudi Money Trail |date=December 2, 2002 |author=Iskioff, Michael and Evan Thomas |publisher=Newsweek[/tpl]
While in San Diego, witnesses told the FBI he and Mindhar had a close relationship with Anwar Al Awlaki, an imam who served as their spiritual advisor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/404461061.html?dids=404461061:404461061&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+11%2C+2003&author=Toby+Eckert+and+Marcus+Stern&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&desc=9%2F11+investigators+baffled+FBI+cleared+3+ex-San+Diegans&pqatl=google |title=Eckert, Toby, and Stern, Marcus, "9/11 investigators baffled FBI cleared 3 ex-San Diegans", The San Diego Union, September 11, 2003, November 30, 2009 |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2012-01-06[/tpl]  Authorities say the two regularly attended the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque Awlaki led in San Diego, and Awlaki had many closed-door meetings with them, which led investigators to believe Awlaki knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. Hazmi got a recommendation from the mosque  for a job at a nearby Texaco station and car wash, a business whose former owner, a Muslim, was known to help young men in need of work. For a month, Hazmi worked there two days a week, vacuuming and drying cars.Goldstein, Amy, Booth, William, "Hijackers Found Welcome Mat on West Coast; San Diego Islamic Community Unwittingly Aided 2 Who Crashed Into Pentagon," Washington Post, December 29, 2001, accessed December 9, 2009
In the beginning of February 2000, Mihdhar and Hazmi rented an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments, a 175-unit complex in the Clairemont Mesa section of San Diego, near the Balboa Drive Mosque.  In February, Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 Toyota Corolla.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Image:Hijackers_Timeline_OCR.pdf |title=Hijackers' Timeline |author=Federal Bureau of Investigation |publisher=9/11 Myths |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |format=PDF[/tpl]  While living at the Parkwood Apartments, neighbors thought that Mihdhar and Hazmi were odd.  Months passed without them getting any furniture for the apartment.  Instead, the men slept on mattresses on the floor, yet they carried briefcases, were frequently on their mobile phones, and were occasionally picked up by a limousine.[tpl]cite book |title=Inside 9-11 |author=Aust, Stefan and Der Spiegel |publisher=MacMillan |year=2002 |pages=17–18[/tpl]  After the attacks, their neighbors told the media that the pair constantly played flight simulator games.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/wplot.html |title=The New Breed of Terrorist |author=McGeary, Johanna and David Van Biema |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=September 24, 2001[/tpl]  Residents said a total of four men spent time together at Parkwood, playing in the pool like children.
On April 4, 2000, Hazmi took a one-hour introductory flight lesson at the National Air College in San Diego.  Both Mihdhar and Hazmi took flight lessons in May 2000 at the Sorbi Flying Club, located at Montgomery Field in San Diego.  On May 5, Hazmi and Mihdhar took a lesson for one hour, and additional lessons on May 10 at the Sorbi Flying Club, with Hazmi flying an aircraft for 30 minutes.  However, their English skills were very poor, and they did not do well with flight lessons.  The first day that they showed up, they told instructors that they wanted to learn how to fly Boeings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.10news.com/news/964031/detail.html |title=San Diego Man Arrested For Funding Hijackers |publisher=10 News (San Diego) |date=September 18, 2001 |accessdate=October 2, 2008[/tpl]  Mihdhar and Hazmi raised some suspicion when they offered extra money to their flight instructor, Richard Garza, if he would train them to fly jets.  Suspicious of the two men, Garza refused the offer but did not report them to authorities.  Garza described the two men as "impatient students" who "wanted to learn to fly jets, specifically Boeings."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/07/terrorism.afghanistan3 |title=Saudi hijacker 'was key link to bin Laden' |publisher=The Observer |author=Helmore, Edward and Ed Vulliamy |date=October 7, 2001 |location=London[/tpl]

At the end of May 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar moved out of Parkwood Apartments, and moved to nearby Lemon Grove, California.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]  At this time, Mihdhar transferred his vehicle's registration to Hazmi,[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] and he left San Diego on June 10, 2000.  Mihdhar returned to Yemen, which angered Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who did not want Hazmi to be left alone in California.
On July 12, 2000, Hazmi filed for an extension of his visa, which was due to expire.  His visa was extended until January 2001, though Hazmi never filed any further requests to extend it beyond that.
In September, Nawaf and Mihdhar both moved into the house of FBI informant Abdussattar Shaikh, although he did not report the pair as suspicious.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2003/07/25/news/top_stories/7_25_035_34_23.txt |title=Report: San Diego represented best chance to foil Sept. 11 plot : North County Times – Californian |publisher=Nctimes.com |date=July 25, 2003|accessdate=October 28, 2008[/tpl]Cooperativeresearch.org Mihdhar is believed to have left the apartment in early October, less than two weeks before the USS Cole Bombing.  Nawaf continued living with Shaikh until December.
Hani Hanjour arrived in San Diego in early December 2000, joining Hazmi, but on December 10, they were seen leaving their Mount Vernon address leaving for Phoenix, Arizona where Hanjour could take refresher flight training.  On December 12, they arrived at Mesa AZ and stayed with Mourad Jdaaini and Mike Khalaf. On December 22, Hanjour and Hazmi signed a lease for an apartment in the Indian Springs Village complex in Mesa, Arizona, moving in on January 9.

In March al-Hazmi received a shipment of VHS videos including videos about Boeing 747 and 777 flight decks and “how an airline captain should look and act" and later a road atlas, map of NYC and a World aeronautical chart.
On March 30, Al-Hazmi notified his utility company that he might be moving to another state or Saudi Arabia. He and Hanjour moved out before the apartment rental expired at the end of the month on their way to Virginia. 2 days later on April 1, 2001, Oklahoma police officer C. L. Parkins pulled Hazmi over for speeding in their Corolla along with an additional citation for failing to use a seatbelt together totaling $138. A routine inspection of his California drivers license turned up no warrants or alerts, although his name was known to both the NSA and the CIA as a suspected terrorist.[tpl]cite web|author=AlterNet / By |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/68268/ |title=Bad Intelligence: America's History of Bungled Spying |publisher=Alternet.org |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2012-01-06[/tpl]
