===Emina===

Emina was originally a poem written by Bosnian Serb poet Aleksa Šantić, first published in 1902.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-volto-di-Santic-140066|title=Il volto di Šantić|publisher=Balcancaucaso|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] It became a popular sevdalinka covered by many artists from the former Yugoslav republics over the course of the 20th century. The subject of the song is Šantić's teenage neighbor, a Bosniak girl named Emina Sefić. It is one of the most well-known sevdalinkas of all time.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.dw.de/bolje-da-ne-peva%C5%A1/a-16941264|title=Bolje da ne pevaš|publisher=dw.de|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Un-sentimento-bosniaco.html|title=Un sentimento bosniaco|publisher=Girodivite|date=31 October 2008|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://doznajemo.com/2012/11/22/zaboravljeni-junaci-jednog-vremena-20-himzo-polovina-niko-poput-njega-nije-pjevao-santicevu-eminu/|title=Zaboravljeni junaci jednog vremena|publisher=doznajemo|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
Many artists have covered the song, but the version by fellow Mostar native, Bosnian singer Himzo Polovina, remains the most popular. Upon hearing of the death of Emina Sefić, Polovina went to poetess Sevda Katica's home in the village of Donja Mahala. He found her in the yard of the family home, informed her of Emina's death and she shuddered with grief and spoke the verses:
Polovina recorded the song and added Sevda's new verses.
