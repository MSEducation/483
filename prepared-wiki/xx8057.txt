Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|k|əm|_|ˈ|ɛ|k|s[/tpl]; May[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]19, 1925[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]21, 1965), born Malcolm Little and also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz[tpl]efn-ua|This name includes the honorific El-Hajj, given on completion of the Hajj to Mecca. [tpl]cite book |title=Islam: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Malise Ruthven |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-285389-9 |page=147 [/tpl] [/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|الحاجّ مالك الشباز[/tpl]), was an African-American Muslim minister and a human rights activist. To his admirers he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans; detractors accused him of preaching racism and violence. He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was effectively orphaned early in life. His father was killed when he was six
and his mother was placed in a mental hospital when he was thirteen, after which he lived in a series of foster homes.
In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for larceny and breaking and entering. While in prison he became a member of the Nation of Islam, and after his parole in 1952 quickly rose to become one of its leaders. For a dozen years he was the public face of the controversial group; in keeping with the Nation's teachings he espoused black supremacy, advocated the separation of black and white Americans and scoffed at the civil rights movement's emphasis on integration.
By March 1964 Malcolm X had grown disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its head Elijah Muhammad, and ultimately repudiated the Nation and its teachings. He embraced Sunni Islam and, after a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, returned to the United States to found Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. While continuing to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense, he disavowed racism, saying, "I did many things as a Black Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]... pointed in a certain direction and told to march".
In February 1965, shortly after repudiating the Nation of Islam, he was assassinated by three of its members. The Autobiography of Malcolm X, published shortly after his death, is considered one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.

==Early years==

Malcolm Little was born May[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of seven children of Grenada-born Louise Little (née Norton) and Georgia-born Earl Little. Earl was an outspoken Baptist lay speaker, admirer of Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey, and local leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) who inculcated self-reliance and black pride in his children.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]7.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2–3.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X later said that violence by whites killed three of his father's brothers.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]3–4.
Because of Ku Klux Klan threats{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]Earl's UNIA activities were "spreading trouble"DeCaro, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]43–44.{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan,Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]3. where the family was frequently harassed by the Black Legion, a white racist group. When the family home burned in 1929, Earl accused the Black Legion.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]4.
When Little was six his father was killed in what was officially ruled a streetcar accident, though Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that white racists were responsible for his father's death were widely circulated, and were very disturbing to Malcolm X as a child. As an adult, he expressed conflicting beliefs on the question.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]29. After a dispute with creditors, a life insurance benefit
(nominally $1,000{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]about $[tpl]Inflation|US|1|1931|r=0[/tpl],000 in [tpl]#expr:[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]-1[/tpl] dollars[tpl]Inflation-fn|US|group=upper-alpha[/tpl]) was paid to Louise in payments of $18 per month;Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]32 the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming suicide.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]10. To make ends meet Louise rented out part of her garden, and her sons hunted game.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]32.
In 1937 a man Louise had been dating{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]marriage had seemed a possibility{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]vanished from her life when she became pregnant with his child.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]35. In late 1938 she had a nervous breakdown and was committed to Kalamazoo State Hospital. The children were separated and sent to foster homes. Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]35–36, 265Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]33–34, 331.
Malcolm Little excelled in junior high school but dropped out after a white teacher told him that practicing law, his aspiration at the time, was "no realistic goal for a  nigger".Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]42. Later Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X recalled feeling that the white world offered no place for a career-oriented black man, regardless of talent.
From age 14 to 21 Little held a variety of jobs while living with his half-sister Ella Little-Collins in Roxbury, a largely African-American neighborhood of Boston.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]21–29, 55–56.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]32–48, 58–61.
Then after a short time in Flint, Michigan he moved to Harlem, New York in 1943, where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, racketeering, robbery, and pimping;Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]62–81.
according to recent biographies, he also occasionally had sex with other men, usually for money.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]65–66.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]77, 82–83.
He was called "Detroit Red" because of the reddish hair he inherited from his Scottish maternal grandfather.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]37, 51–52.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2.
Little was declared "mentally disqualified for military service" after he told draft board officials he wanted to be sent down south to "organize them nigger  soldiers ... steal us some guns, and kill us some crackers".Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]124.Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]108.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/921123/archive_018698.htm |title=The Legacy of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X |last1=Lord |first1=Lewis |last2=Thornton |first2=Jeannye |last3=Bodipo-Memba |first3=Alejandro |date=November[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]15, 1992 |work=U.S. News & World Report |page=3 |accessdate=June[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2, 2010 [/tpl]
In late 1945, Little returned to Boston, where he and four accomplices committed a series of burglaries targeting wealthy white families.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]106–109. In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs,Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]99. and in February began serving an eight-to-ten year sentence at Charlestown State Prison for larceny and breaking and entering.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]67–68.

==Nation of Islam period==

===Prison===

During Little's imprisonment he met fellow convict John Bembry,Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]121. a self-educated man he would later describe as "the first man I had ever seen command total respect ... with words".Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]178; ellipsis in original. Under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]108–110, 118. It was during this period that Little later stated he damaged his vision and required eyeglasses, “I had come to prison with 20/20 vision…I had read so much by the lights-out glow in my room at the Norfolk Prison Colony that I had astigmatism and the first pair of the eyeglasses that I have worn ever since.”Malcolm X, Autobiography, (1992, thirty-third printing), pp. 189.
At this time, several of his siblings wrote to him about the Nation of Islam, a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the African diaspora to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]127–128, 132–138. He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison,"Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]128–129. he quit smoking and began to refuse pork.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]113. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little came to the conclusion that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]134–135. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname "Satan",Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]104–106. now became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]136.
In late 1948, Little wrote to Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad advised him to renounce his past, humbly bow in prayer to Allah, and promise never to engage in destructive behavior again.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]138–139.
Though he later recalled the inner struggle he experienced in bending his knees in prayer,Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]196. he soon became a member of the Nation of Islam. "Between Mr. Muhammad's teachings, my correspondence, my visitors{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]usually Ella and Reginald{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]and my reading of books," he later wrote, "months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I had never been so truly free in my life."Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]199 From that time he maintained a regular correspondence with Muhammad.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]116.
In 1950, the FBI opened a file on him after he wrote a letter from prison to President Truman expressing opposition to the Korean War and declaring himself a communist.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]95. That year, Little also began signing his name "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X".Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]96. He explained in his autobiography that the Muslim's 'X' symbolized the true African family name that he could never know. "For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears."Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]229.

===Early ministry===

After his parole in August 1952,Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]98 Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]142, 144–145. In June 1953 he was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]168.[tpl]efn-ua|Nation of Islam Temples were numbered according to the order in which they were established.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]141–142. [/tpl] Later that year he established Boston's Temple Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]11;Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]147. in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]12 in Philadelphia;Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]152. and two months later he was selected to lead Temple Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]7 in Harlem,Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]153. where he rapidly expanded its membership.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]161–164.
In 1953, the FBI began surveillance of him, turning its attention from Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]95.
During 1955, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X continued his successful recruitment efforts on behalf of the organization. He established temples in Springfield, Massachusetts (Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]13); Hartford, Connecticut (Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]14); and Atlanta, Georgia (Number[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]122–123.
Beside his skill as a speaker, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X had an impressive physical presence. He stood [tpl]convert|6|ft|3|in|m[/tpl] tall and weighed about [tpl]convert|180|lb|kg[/tpl].Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]301. One writer described him as "powerfully built",Lincoln, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]189. and another as "mesmerizingly handsome ... and always spotlessly well-groomed".

===Marriage and family===

In 1955, Betty Sanders met Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X after one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was regularly attending his lectures.
In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X.Rickford, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]36–45, 50–51. One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York's museums and libraries.Rickford, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]61–63.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X proposed on a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later.Shabazz, Betty, "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X as a Husband and Father", Clarke, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]132–134.Rickford, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]73–74. They had six daughters:
Attallah (b. 1958, named after Attila the Hun);Rickford, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]109–110.[tpl]efn-ua|In a 1992 interview, Attallah Shabazz said she was not named after Attila, rather her name was Arabic for "the gift of God".[tpl]cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30 |title=X Patriot |last=Miller |first=Russell |date=November 23, 1992 |work=New York |accessdate=November 17, 2011 [/tpl] [/tpl]
Qubilah (b. 1960, named ater Kublai Khan);Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]122. Ilyasah (b. 1962, named after Elijah Muhammad);Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]123. Gamilah Lumumba (b. 1964, named after Patrice Lumumba);Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]197. and twins Malikah and Malaak (b. 1965 after their father's death, and named after him).Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]286.

===Johnson Hinton incident===

Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X first came to the notice of the American public in 1957, after Johnson Hinton, a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]127.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]164.
On April[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]26, Hinton and two other passersby{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]also Nation of Islam members{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]saw the police officers beating an African-American man with nightsticks. They attempted to intervene, shouting "You're not in Alabama or Georgia. This is New York!" One of the officers turned on Hinton, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging. All four men were then arrested.
Alerted by a witness, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and a small group of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Hinton. Police initially denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred they allowed Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to speak with Hinton,Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]165. after which, at Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's insistence, an ambulance took Hinton to Harlem Hospital.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]128.
Hinton's injuries were treated and by the time he was returned to the police station, some four thousand people had gathered outside it. Inside the station, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Hinton was not bailed, and police said he could not go back to the hospital until his arraignment the following day. Considering the situation to be at an impasse, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X stepped outside the stationhouse and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed. One police officer told the New York Amsterdam News: "No one man should have that much power."Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]166. Within a month Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was under surveillance by the New York City Police Department, which also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]132.
A grand jury declined to indict the officers who beat Hinton, and in October, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon undercover officers were assigned to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]134–135.

===Increasing prominence===

By the late 1950s, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el-Shabazz, although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]135, 193. His comments on issues and events were now being reported in print, on radio, and on television,Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]174–179. and he was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, The Hate That Hate Produced.
In September 1960, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was invited to the official functions of several African nations. He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]231–233. Fidel Castro also attended the Assembly, and Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X met publicly with him as part of a welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]172. Castro was sufficiently impressed with Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking Castro invited Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to visit Cuba.Lincoln, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]18.

===Advocacy and teachings while with Nation===

From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X promoted the Nation's teachings. These included the beliefs:
Many whites and some blacks were alarmed by Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and the things he said during this period. He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being antisemitic.Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]172. One of the goals of the civil rights movement was to end disfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in the political process.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]260. Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]162.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]215–216.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811191-1,00.html |title=The Black Supremacists |work=TIME |date=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]10, 1959 |accessdate=July[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]28, 2009 [/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl]
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was equally critical of the civil rights movement.Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]79–80. He labeled Martin Luther King, Jr. a "chump" and other civil rights leaders "stooges" of the white establishment.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]203.[tpl]efn-ua|King expressed mixed feelings toward Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X. "He is very articulate... but I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views... I don't want to seem to sound self-righteous, ... or that I think I have the only truth, the only way. Maybe he does have some of the answer... I have often wished that he would talk less of violence, because violence is not going to solve our problem. And in his litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative, I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice... Urging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief." [tpl]cite news |title=The Playboy Interview: Martin Luther King |last=Haley |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Haley |date=January 1965 |work=Playboy [/tpl] [/tpl] He called the 1963 March on Washington "the farce on Washington",Cone, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]113. and said he did not know why so many black people were excited about a demonstration "run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/timeline/timeline2.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=July[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]27, 2008 |date=May[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]19, 2005 |work=Malcolm X: Make It Plain, American Experience |publisher=PBS [/tpl] 
While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X advocated the complete separation of African Americans from whites. He proposed that African Americans should return to Africa, and that a separate country for black people in America should be created as an interim measure.Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]149–152.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, End of White World Supremacy, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]78. He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of nonviolence, expressing the opinion that black people should defend and advance themselves by any means necessary.Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]173–174. His speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, who were generally African Americans in northern and western cities. Many of them{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]tired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality and respectNatambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]182.{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]felt that he articulated their complaints better than did the civil rights movement.Cone, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]99–100.[tpl]cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |authorlink1=Cornel West |editor1-last=Sayres |editor1-first=Sohnya |editor2-last=Stephanson |editor2-first=Anders |editor3-last=Aronowitz |editor3-first=Stanley |editor3-link=Stanley Aronowitz |editor4-last=Jameson |editor4-first=Fredric |editor4-link=Fredric Jameson |display-editors=4 |title=The 60s Without Apology |year=1984 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1336-6 |page=51 |chapter=The Paradox of the Afro-American Rebellion [/tpl]

===Impact on Nation membership===

Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader the Nation of Islam has had, after Elijah Muhammad.Cone, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]91. He was largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate;[tpl]efn-ua|Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]15–16. "Estimates of the Black Muslim membership vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty thousand. Available evidence indicates that about one hundred thousand Negroes have joined the movement at one time or another, but few objective observers believe that the Black Muslims can muster more than twenty or twenty-five thousand active temple people."[/tpl] from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another).Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]123.[tpl]efn-ua|Clegg, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]115. "The common response of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to questions about numbers{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]'Those who know aren't saying, and those who say don't know'{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]was typical of the attitude of the leadership."[/tpl] He inspired the boxer Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali) to join the NationNatambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]296–297 (though like Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X himself, Ali later left the group to become a Sunni Muslim).[tpl]cite book |last=Ali |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad Ali |editor= |others=with Hana Yasmeen Ali |title=The Soul of a Butterfly: Reflections on Life's Journey |year=2004 |publisher=Simon[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]& Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7432-5569-1|page=61 [/tpl]

==Leaving the Nation of Islam==

On December[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]1, 1963, when he was asked for a comment about the assassination of President Kennedy, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said that it was a case of "chickens coming home to roost". He added that "chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad."[tpl]cite web |title=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Scores U.S. and Kennedy |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0812FE35541A7B93C0A91789D95F478685F9 |work=The New York Times |page=21 |date=December[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2, 1963 |accessdate=July[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]28, 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl] The New York Times wrote, "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba, Congo leader, of Medgar Evers, civil rights leader, and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'." The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]288–290. Although Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X retained his post and rank as minister, he was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]242.
Another source of tension had appeared between Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and Elijah Muhammad. There were rumors that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretaries{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]which would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad's son Wallace and with the women making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]230–234
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members were seeing him as a threat to Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown interest in Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the Word Is Given, he used a photograph of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X on the cover and reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad's{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]all of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.
On March[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]8, 1964, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. He was still a Muslim, he said, but felt that the Nation had "gone as far as it can" because of its rigid teachings. He planned to organize a black nationalist organization to "heighten the political consciousness" of African Americans; he also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.[tpl]cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D17FB395415738DDDA00894DB405B848AF1D3 |title=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M.

==Activities after leaving the Nation==

===Organizations founded and views expressed===

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X founded Muslim Mosque, Inc., a religious organization,Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]251–252.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]18–22. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular group that advocated Pan-Africanism.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]294–296.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, By Any Means Necessary, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]33–67. On March[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]26, 1964 he met Martin Luther King, Jr. for the first and only time{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]and only long enough for photographs to be taken{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]in Washington, D.C. as both men attended the Senate's debate on the Civil Rights bill.[tpl]efn-ua|"There was no time for substantive discussions between the two. They were photographed greeting each other warmly, smiling and shaking hands."Cone, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2[/tpl]Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]255. "Camera shutters clicked. The next day, the Chicago Sun-Times, the New York World Telegram and Sun, and other dailies carried a picture of Malcolm and Martin shaking hands." In April, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X gave a speech titled "The Ballot or the Bullet", in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely but cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]257–259.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]23–44.

===Becoming a Sunni Muslim===

At this time, several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to learn about their faith, and soon he became a convert to Sunni Islam.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]261.

===Pilgrimage to Mecca===

In April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as the start of his Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so. However, he was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]262–263.DeCaro, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]204. He contacted Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, whose book The Eternal Message of Muhammad he had received with his visa approval. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning he learned that Prince Faisal had designated him a state guest,Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]263–265. and several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X had an audience with the prince.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]267.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X later said that seeing Muslims of "all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans" interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]388–393; quote from pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]390–391.

===Africa===

Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X had already visited the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad,Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]62. and after his journey to Mecca he visited Africa a second time. He returned to the United States in late MayNatambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]303. and flew to Africa again in July.Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]305. During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]304–305. In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity as a representative of the Organization of Afro-American Unity.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]360–362. By the end of this third visit he had met with essentially all of Africa's prominent leaders, and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria had all invited Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X to serve in their governments.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]308. After he spoke at the University of Ibadan, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary Yoruba name Omowale ("the son who has come home").Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]269. He later called this his most treasured honor.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]403.

===France and United Kingdom===

On November[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X stopped in Paris, where he spoke at the Salle de la Mutualité.Bethune, Lebert, "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X in Europe", Clarke, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]226–231.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, By Any Means Necessary, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]113–126. A week later, on November[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]30, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X flew to the United Kingdom, and on December 3 took part in a debate at the Oxford Union Society. The motion was: "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue". Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X argued for the affirmative, and interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the BBC.Bethune, "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X in Europe", Clarke, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]231–233.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brothermalcolm.net/2003/mx_oxford/index.html |title=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Oxford Debate |accessdate=July[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]30, 2008 |author=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X |date=December[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]3, 1964 |publisher=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X: A Research Site [/tpl]
On February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]5, 1965, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X flew to Britain again,Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]349. and on February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]8 he addressed the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]351. The next day he tried to travel to France, but was refused entry.Natambu, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]312.
On February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]12, he visited Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election. The town had become a byword for racial division when Conservative supporters used the slogan "If you want a nigger for your neighbour, vote Labour." In Smethwick he compared the treatment of colored residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: "I would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick to erect gas ovens."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/news/black-british-history-remembering-malcolms-visit-to-smethwick/ |title=Black British History: Remembering Malcolm's Visit to Smethwick |accessdate=May[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]30, 2012 |last=Kundnani |first=Arun |date=February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]10, 2005 |work=Independent Race and Refugee News Network |publisher=Institute of Race Relations [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/27/race.world2 |title=A New Language of Racism in Politics |first=Derek |last=Brown |date=April[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]27, 2001 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=December[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]16, 2013[/tpl]

===Return to United States===

After leaving the Nation of Islam and traveling internationally, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X addressed a wide variety of audiences in the United States. He spoke regularly at meetings held by Muslim Mosque, Inc., and the Organization of Afro-American Unity, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses.Terrill, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]9. One of his top aides later wrote that he "welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students."Karim, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]128. He also addressed public meetings of the Socialist Workers Party, speaking at their Militant Labor Forum.Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]277–278.

==Death threats and intimidation from Nation of Islam==

Throughout 1964, as conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was repeatedly threatened.
In February a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's car.Karim, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]159–160. In March, Muhammad told Boston minister Louis[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X (later known as Louis Farrakhan) that "hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off";Kondo, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]170. the April[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]10 edition of Muhammad Speaks featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's bouncing, severed head.Friedly, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]169.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/images/sourcebook_img_111.jpg |title=On My Own |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]1, 2008 |last=Majied |first=Eugene |date=April[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]10, 1964 |work=Muhammad Speaks |publisher=Nation of Islam [/tpl]
On June[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]8, FBI surveillance recorded a telephone call in which Betty Shabazz was told that her husband was "as good as dead."Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]473. Four days later, an FBI informant received a tip that "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X is going to be bumped off."Carson, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]324. (That same month the Nation sued to reclaim Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's residence in Queens, New York. His family was ordered to vacatePerry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]290–292. but on February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]14, 1965{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]the night before a hearing on postponing the eviction{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]the house was destroyed by fire.)Perry, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]352–356.
On July[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]9 Muhammad aide John Ali (later exposed as an undercover FBI agent)Lomax, To Kill a Black Man, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]198 referred to Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X by saying, "Anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy."Evanzz, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]248. In the December[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]4 issue of Muhammad Speaks, Louis[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X wrote that "such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death."Evanzz, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]264.
The September 1964 issue of Ebony dramatized Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's defiance of these threats by photographing him holding a rifle while peering out a window.[tpl]cite news |last=Massaquoi |first=Hans J. |title=Mystery of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X |work=Ebony |date=September 1964 [/tpl]

As Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and his bodyguards tried to quell the disturbance,[tpl]efn-ua|In his Epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Haley wrote that Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said, "Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited. Let's cool it, brothers." (p. 499.) According to a transcript of an audio recording, Malcolm's only words were, "Hold it!", repeated ten times. (DeCaro, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]274.)[/tpl] a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun;Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]436–437.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]366. two other men charged the stage firing semi-automatic handguns. Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was pronounced dead at 3:30[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.Marable, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]450.

===Funeral===

The public viewing, February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]23{–}26 at Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, was attended by some 14,000 to 30,000 mourners.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]374. Alex Haley, in his Epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, says 22,000 (p. 519).
For the funeral on February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]27, loudspeakers were set up for the overflow crowd outside Harlem's thousand-seat Faith Temple of the Church of God in Christ,Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]252.DeCaro, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]291 and a local television station carried the service live.[tpl]cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60615FD38591B7A93CAAB1789D85F418685F9 |title=Harlem Is Quiet as Crowds Watch Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Rites |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2, 2008 |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]28, 1965 |work=The New York Times [/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl]
Among the civil rights leaders attending were John Lewis, Bayard Rustin, James Forman, James Farmer, Jesse Gray, and Andrew Young.DeCaro, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]290. Actor and activist Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy, describing Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X as "our shining black prince":
 There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]and we will smile. Many will say turn away{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]a fanatic, a racist{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him.

===Reactions to assassination===

Reactions to Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's assassination were varied.
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s telegram to Betty Shabazz expressed his sadness at "the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband."
 While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/telegram_from_martin_luther_king_jr_to_betty_al_shabazz/ |title=Telegram from Martin Luther King, Jr. to Betty al-Shabazz |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute |date=February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]26, 1965 |accessdate=March[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]21, 2010 [/tpl] 
Elijah Muhammad told the annual Savior's Day convention on February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]26, "Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X got just what he preached", but denied any involvement with the murder.Evanzz, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]301. "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him", Muhammad said. "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end."Clegg, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]232.
The New York Post wrote that "even his sharpest critics recognized his brilliance{–}[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]often wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized."Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]247. The New York Times wrote that Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X was "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turned many true gifts to evil purpose" and that his life was "strangely and pitifully wasted".[tpl]cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E13F63F5812738DDDAB0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2, 2008 |date=February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]22, 1965 |work=The New York Times [/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl] TIME called him "an unashamed demagogue" whose "creed was violence."[tpl]cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839291,00.html |title=Death and Transfiguration |date=March[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]5, 1965 |work=TIME |accessdate=January[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]23, 2014 [/tpl]
Outside of the U.S., and particularly in Africa, the press was sympathetic.Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]248. The Daily Times of Nigeria wrote that Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X "will have a place in the palace of martyrs."Evanzz, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]305. The Ghanaian Times likened him to John Brown and Patrice Lumumba, and counted him among "a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause".[tpl]cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D15F73F5812738DDDAF0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm Called a Martyr Abroad |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]2, 2008 |last=Kenworthy |first=E.

===Allegations of conspiracy===

Within days, the question of who bore ultimate responsibility for the assassination was being publicly debated. On February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]23, James Farmer, the leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]371. Others accused the NYPD, the FBI, or the CIA, citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene.Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]305–306.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]372.
In the 1970s, the public learned about COINTELPRO and other secret FBI programs established to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s.Kondo, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]7–39. John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was identified as an FBI undercover agent.Lomax, To Kill a Black Man, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]198. Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X had confided to a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad, and that he considered Ali his "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership. Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, the night before the assassination.Evanzz, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]294.
Some, including the Shabazz family, have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's assassination,Rickford, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]437, 492–495.Evanzz, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]298–299.Friedly, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]253.Kondo, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]182–183, 193–194.Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]305. and in a 1993 speech Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible:
 Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.Rickford, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]492.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/brotherministerthemartyrdomofmalcolmx_c0098f.htm |title='Brother Minister: The Martyrdom of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X' |accessdate=August[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]1, 2008 |last=Wartofsky |first=Alona |date=February[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]17, 1995 |work=The Washington Post [/tpl] 
In a 60 Minutes interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X. "I may have been complicit in words that I spoke", he said.

No consensus on who was responsible has been reached.Natambu, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]315–316.

==Philosophy==

Except for his autobiography, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X left no published writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the many speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Kelley |first=Robin D. G. |authorlink=Robin D.G.

===Beliefs of the Nation of Islam===

Before he left the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X taught its beliefs. His speeches were peppered with the phrase "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that...".Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]80–81. It is virtually impossible to discern whether Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X's personal beliefs diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam.Terrill, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]184.[tpl]efn-ua|Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]91. "'I'll be honest with you,' Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said to me. 'Everybody is talking about differences between the Messenger and me. It is absolutely impossible for us to differ.[tpl]'"[/tpl] [/tpl] He later compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X taught that black people were the original people of the world, and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. The Nation of Islam believed that black people were superior to white people, and that the demise of the white race was imminent. When questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said: "history proves the white man is a devil."Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]67. "Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil."Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]171.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and that Christianity was "the white man's religion" that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters.Lomax, When the Word Is Given, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]24, 137–138. He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the "uniquely pitiful" condition of black people in America.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Speeches at Harvard, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]119. He taught that Wallace Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation, was Allah incarnate,DeCaro, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]166–167. and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or Prophet.[tpl]efn-ua|Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X told Lewis Lomax that "The Messenger is the Prophet of Allah" (Lomax, When the Word Is Given, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]80). On another occasion, he said "We never refer to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as a prophet" (Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Last Speeches, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]46).[/tpl]
While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United StatesLincoln, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]95. as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors.Lincoln, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]96. He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of nonviolence, instead advocating that black people should defend themselves.

===Independent views===

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]33–35.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X argued that if the government was unwilling or unable to protect black people, they should protect themselves, and said that he and the other members of the Organization of Afro-American Unity were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality "by whatever means necessary".Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, By Any Means Necessary, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]43, 47.
Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the "direct connection" between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the independence struggles of Third World nations.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]90. He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; globally, black people were the majority.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]117.
In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the Socialist Workers Party, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X criticized capitalism. After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he didn't know, but that it was no coincidence the newly independent countries in the Third World were turning toward socialism.Cone, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]284. When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X asked whether it was good for black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X told him, "Then I'm for it."Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]277.
Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]38–41. In the last months of his life, however, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X began to reconsider his support for black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X Speaks, pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]212–213.
After his Hajj, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to "rearrange" his thinking about race and "toss aside some of his previous conclusions".Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X, Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]391. In a conversation with Gordon Parks, two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:
Up until one week before his death, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X continued to publicly advocate that black people should achieve advancement "by any means necessary".

One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration, Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X "made clear the price that white America would have to pay if it did not accede to black America's legitimate demands."Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]380.
In the late 1960s, increasingly radical black activists based their movements largely on Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X and his teachings.

In 1963 Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X began a collaboration with Alex Haley on his life story, The Autobiography of Malcolm X.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]214. He told Haley, "If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle",Haley, "Epilogue", Autobiography, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]471. and indeed, Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination.Perry, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]375.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in his life among young people. Hip-hop groups such as Public Enemy adopted Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X as an icon,Sales, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]5. and his image was displayed in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools,Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", pp.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]301–302. as well as on T-shirts and jackets.Sales, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]3. This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film Malcolm[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]X,Sales, p.[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]4 an adaptation of The Autobiography of Malcolm X.
