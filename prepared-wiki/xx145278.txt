==Controversy==

In what the Los Angeles Times called an epic "Blog Fight!",Blog fight! 'Cheers' writer trades barbs with Roseanne Barr, Los Angeles Times, May 31, 2011 Levine responded to an assertion in New York Magazine by Roseanne Barr that her sitcom Roseanne was doomed due to sexism and her lack of creative control.New York Magazine article, "And I Should Know," May 15, 2011 Levine said "...Roseanne is a monster. No amount of spinning on her part is going to change that. No amount of 'woe is me', 'no one understands me', 'I’m the only one who cares' laments are going to change the fact that she treated people like shit. Routinely. Constantly. Knowingly."http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/05/roseannes-latest-insane-rant.html
Barr responded with an obscenity-laced rejoinder which included this challenge: "I am pretty sure that women who have worked for you in the past (if indeed there were ANY) worked in a hostile work environment.  Let me know, women writers out there–how were you treated on Ken Levine’s staff?"http://www.roseanneworld.com/blog/2011/05/the-grotesque-sexism-that-i-wr/ Levin posted an answer from Almost Perfect co-creator Robin Schiff: "There are many sexist guys in the business, but Ken Levine is not one of them. The most sexist thing he ever did was blather on about baseball with the other men in the room despite the fact that I was visibly bored. Hardly grounds for a lynching."http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-response-to-roseanne.html
But Schiff did offer, "I totally agree with Roseanne that there is rampant sexism in the industry. A couple of weeks ago, the WGAw released its executive summary finding that (in addition to dismal stats for ethnically diverse or older writers), women comprise only 28% of working writers. We still make less money than men. All you have to do is look at the writers onstage accepting Emmys for late night talk shows and sitcoms to see that women comedy writers are on the endangered list."
