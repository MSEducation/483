[[Ascending and descending (diving)]]

CATEGORIES: Underwater diving procedures, Diving decompression

In underwater diving, ascending and descending is done using strict protocols to avoid problems caused by the changes in ambient pressure and the hazards of obstacles near the surface or collision with vessels. Diver certification and accreditation organisations place importance on these protocols early in their diver training programmes.
The procedures vary depending on whether the diver is using scuba or surface supplied equipment. Scuba divers control their own descent and ascent rate, while surface supplied divers may control their own ascents and descents, or be lowered and lifted by the surface team, either by their umbilical, or on a diving stage or in a diving bell.

===Controlled descent===

When not descending along a shot line or anchor cable, the following steps are performed:

===Controlled ascent===

When not ascending along a shot line or anchor cable, the following steps should be taken when ascending in open water:
When above the surface, the BCD is inflated and a signal is made, if a safety boat is waiting.

===Emergency ascent===

In emergencies when a diver runs out of air in the cylinder in current use, and when there is no buddy around to donate air, the use of a redundant air supply (such as independent twins or a pony bottle), allows a diver to perform an ascent in a controlled manner, breathing as normal.
When no redundant air supply is available, the diver can make a controlled emergency swimming ascent. The diver starts to swim up exhaling steadily along the ascent unless trying to inhale. The mouthpiece is kept in as the cylinder still contains some air and it will become available as the ambient pressure decreases. It is important not to hold the breath, to avoid over-expansion of the air in the lungs due to pressure decrease as the depth decreases, which could cause the lung tissues to tear. The speed of ascent has to be a compromise between too slow (and running out of oxygen before reaching the surface) and too fast (risking decompression sickness). Lung barotrauma is unlikely in a heathy diver who allows the air to escape freely from the lungs.

==Surface supplied diving==

===Surface oriented dives (Bounce dives)===

Surface supplied divers frequently work heavily weighted, to give them a firm footing while working on the bottom. This makes it difficult or impossible to achieve neutral buoyancy. However, as they are connected to the surface control point by the [tpl]diving term|umbilical[/tpl], they can be lowered to the bottom by the umbilical. For greater depths, they can be lowered on a platform known as a [tpl]diving term|diving stage[/tpl], or in a wet bell. These are lowered from a diving support vessel or shore installation using a man-rated winch, which allows good control of depth and speed of descent and ascent, and allows these procedures to be controlled by the surface team.

===Saturation dives===

Saturation divers are lowered to the working depth and raised back to the surface in closed diving bells, which are pressurized to the same pressure as the dive depth. The diver is transferred to and from the hyperbaric accommodation after adjusting the bell pressure to match the storage pressure.
