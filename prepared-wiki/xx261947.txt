It is one Bristol's more prominent landmarks, set on Purdown, a hill above the M32 motorway on the main approach into the city, and painted yellow.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/standing-strong/story-11237656-detail/story.html |title=Still standing strong |newspaper=This is Bristol |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2012[/tpl]
The house was built in 1553 by Sir Richard Berkeley. Rebuilt by Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt circa 1760, it eventually became used as a dower house by the Dukes of Beaufort at nearby Badminton House.
It was used as part of Stoke Park Hospital, previously Stoke Park Colony, from 1909. The house closed as a hospital building about 1988, and was converted into apartments in 2004.[tpl]cite news |title=Luxury flats for landmark house |newspaper=Bristol Evening Post |date=8 January 2004 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |quote=plans for one of Bristol's most famous landmarks to become part of the university of the West of England have fallen through.
