The Japanese Bobtail is a breed of domestic cat with an unusual "bobbed" tail more closely resembling the tail of a rabbit than that of other cats. The variety is native to Japan and Southeast Asia, though it is now found throughout the world. The breed has been known in Japan for centuries, and it frequently appears in traditional folklore and art.
As in most other breeds, Japanese Bobtails may have almost any color (or colors, arranged in any number of patterns). Predominantly-white [tpl]nihongo|calicoes|三毛|mi-ke|literally 'triple-[tpl]sic|hide=y|hair|reason=No, it doesn't mean "fur", it means "hair"; see talk page.[/tpl]'[/tpl] are especially favored by the Japanese and by cat fanciers,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and strongly represented in folklore, though other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.

==History==

One theory of short-tailed cats in Japan indicates that they arrived from the Asian continent at least 1,000 years ago.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the Cat |at="Japanese Bobtail" entry |date=October 1, 1997 |first=Bruce |last=Fogle |isbn=0-7894-1970-X[/tpl] In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats should be set free to help deal with rodents threatening the silk worms. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, bobtailed cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese Bobtails thus became the "street cats" of Japan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Around 1701, in Kaempfer's Japan, the first book written by a Westerner about the flora, fauna, and landscape of Japan, German doctor Engelbert Kaempfer wrote: "there is only one breed of cat that is kept. It has large patches of yellow, black and white fur; its short tail looks like it has been bent and broken. It has no mind to hunt for rats and mice but just wants to be carried and stroked by women."
In 1968, Elizabeth Freret is the first known person to have imported the Japanese Bobtail to the Western Hemisphere from Japan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] The short hair Japanese Bobtail was accepted for Championship status in the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1976. Recognition for the long hair variety followed in 1993.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Cat Fancier's Association |title=Breed Profile: Japanese Bobtail |author= |url= http://www.cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsCJ/JapaneseBobtail.aspx|work=CFAInc.org |accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl] As of 2013, there are a number of Japanese Bobtail breeders, most of which are based in North America with a few in Europe and at least one in Japan; yet the breed remains rare.

==Breed standard==

The Japanese Bobtail is a recognised breed by all major registering bodies, with the exception of the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF, the domestic registry of the United Kingdom.
While calicoes, including van patterns (color on the crown of the head and the tail only), are favored by many, any coat color or pattern of colors is permissible.

==Breeding and genetics==

===Mutation===

The short tail is a cat body-type mutation caused by the expression of a recessive gene.Japanese Bobtail FAQ Generally, all kittens born to two bobtail parents will have bobtails as well, but progeny of only one bobtailed parent are much less likely to possess the trait. Unlike the dominant Manx gene, the Bobtail gene is not associated with skeletal disorders. The Bobtail gene only affects the number of tail vertabrae present.

===Health===

Recent scientific studies on cat genetics led by researchers has indicated that the Japanese Bobtail breed ranks amongst one of the most genetically diverse of pedigree breeds.http://www.pandecats.com/x/tracking-the-cat.shtml Compared with other breeds, Japanese Bobtails tend to have smaller litters with the kittens being proportionally larger at birth and developing at a faster rate. Kitten mortality rates are reported to be comparatively low.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

===Odd-eyed specimens===

Rarely, a Japanese Bobtail, especially a predominantly white specimen, may have heterochromia, or eyes of different colors. Regardless of breed, cats with this trait are known as odd-eyed cats. In this breed, one iris is blue ("silver" in Japanese breeding terms) while the other is yellow ("gold"). This trait is more common in this breed than in most others, with the notable exception of the Turkish Van. In the Japanese Bobtail, this trait is popular and kittens displaying it usually are more expensive.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Generally speaking, members of the breed are active, intelligent cats, with a strongly human-oriented nature, are easier to train to perform tricks than most breeds, and are more likely to enjoy learning human-mediated activities like walking on a harness and leash, and playing fetch. They are very attentive, alert felines that notice a lot. Considered an unusually "talkative" breed, they often interact vocally with people. Their soft voices are capable of nearly a whole scale of tones, leading to a folk belief that they can sing. Many owners also report a fondness for water, although this is not considered a breed-specific trait. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Folklore and legend==

Cats feature prominently in Japanese folklore. As in many other traditions around the world, cats are frequently objects of fear and mistrust, with various supernatural abilities ascribed to them. But in some Japanese stories, the length of their tails is an important plot point, with the Japanese Bobtail seen as auspicious, while long-tailed cats may be suspected of being nekomata, a type of evil spirit.
The maneki neko ("beckoning cat" or "inviting cat"), an image of a Japanese Bobtail seated with one paw raised, is considered a good-luck charm among the Japanese around the world, who often keep a statue of this figure in the front of stores or homes (most often a stylized calico, though gold and black variants are also common). This stems from a legend that tells how a man (usually either a priest or member of the royal family) who owned one of these cats looked up one day to see his cat beckoning to him. Thinking the cat might have a message from the gods, he arose and went to it; no sooner had he done so than a branch large enough to kill a man fell where he had been sitting just moments before. Japanese Bobtails also feature prominently in traditional Japanese painting.
One legend of the origin of the breed's short tail, tells of a sleeping cat whose long tail caught fire; it then ran through town, spreading flames everywhere. With the capital in ashes, the Emperor decreed that all cats should have their tails cut short as a preventative measure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
While legends and superstitions may have favored the short-tailed breed, it seems likely that the Bobtail simply has a longer history in Japan than other recognizable breeds. It is also likely to have carried much prestige, having originated on the continent and arrived via Korea in the Asuka period (6th century CE), along with other prized articles of Chinese culture.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

The manga character Hello Kitty is a Japanese Bobtail, and is an exemplar of contemporary kawaii ("cute") pop culture. The character Muta from The Cat Returns was based upon a stray Japanese Bobtail that would often visit Studio Ghibli. They also tend to appear in other anime shows that are produced in Japan.
