[[Singlewell or Ifield]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Kent

Singlewell or Ifield is the name given to the area south of Gravesend in Kent, England. 
Originally two separate settlements on either side of Watling Street, it is now separated by the A2 road and bears little resemblance to its past. Singlewell Road leads from the town southwards to the A2. 
The name Singlewell, originally Shinglewell - and not therefore referring to it having the only well in the district -
and its eponymous ancient well with ancient origins has now come to mean the area now part of the built-up area of Gravesend. The well was filled in during World War I. The original Watling Street is now Hever Court Road and the nearby estate named after it was built in 1957. Hever Court itself was the original home of the medieval family who moved to Hever, Kent in 1331. Hever Court eventually became derelict and was demolished in 1952.
Ifield, once a large rural parish, is now a few houses south of the main road, and the tiny church of St Margaret, with Norman architecture included in its walls.A History of Gravesend, James Benson, revised by Robert H.

The George Inn is also located in Hever Court Road: it was a favourite establishment of Gravesend residents in the 19th century, it being within walking distance from the town; not too different from today, although there is also a Best Western hotel (the Manor); and the Gravesend South Premier Inn, both serving traffic on the A2 road.
