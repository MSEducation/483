The Radogoszcz station ([tpl]lang-de|Bahnhof Radegast[/tpl]) built originally between 1926 and 1937, is a small historic railway station in Łódź, Poland; also referred to as the loading platform in Marysin, a neighbourhood in the Bałuty district of the city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lodz-ghetto.com/the_radegast_station.html,38 | title=The Radogoszcz (Radegast) Station, or the loading platform at Marysin |publisher=Litzmannstadt Ghetto |work=The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto, July 11, 1942, Vol. 2 by Lucjan Dobroszycki |date=2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013 |author=Michal Latosinski[/tpl]  During World War II the station was situated just beyond the boundary of the Łódź Ghetto – one of the biggest Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe. Radegast was the main railway link of the Ghetto to the outside world, used predominantly for the Holocaust transports.[tpl]cite book |title=Ghettostadt: Łódź and the Making of a Nazi City |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JL-ujgqHlEcC&pg=PA117 |page=117 |last=Horwitz |first=Gordon J |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2008 |isbn=0-674-02799-X[/tpl] 
In the course of the Holocaust in Poland, the Umschlagplatz of the Radegast station was the place where predominantly Jewish inhabitants of Łódź including thousands of expelees from across occupied Poland were gathered for deportations directly to Chełmno (Kulmhof) and Auschwitz extermination camps.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=d1-U17adWKIC&pg=PA514&lpg=PA514&dq=Radogoszcz+Station&source=bl&ots=8TNsnL1Bdq&sig=VFro_5ciOmOWSqK1aBqJ8bJwmRA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gnicUrziM4GnigKEwICwBg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Radogoszcz%20Station&f=false |title=The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto, 1941-1944 |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1984 |accessdate=2 December 2013 |author=Lucjan Dobroszycki |pages=514–515 |isbn=0300039247[/tpl] Approximately 200,000 Polish, Austrian, German, Luxemburg and Czech Jews passed through the station on the way to their deaths in the period from January 16, 1942, to August 29, 1944.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centrumdialogu.com/en/memorial/radegast-station |title=Memorial Radegast station |publisher=Centrum Dialogu im. Marka Edelmana w Łodzi |date=2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] The collection point had the same significance for Łódź as the better known Umschlagplatz had for the Warsaw Ghetto. 

==Commemoration==

In 2004, the commemoration ceremonies on the sixtieth anniversary of the destruction of the Łódź Ghetto in 1944 and the departure of the last transport from Radegast spurred efforts to transform the former station into a Holocaust memorial.[tpl]cite book |title=Lonely Planet guide to Poland |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qe3UzP5I2vsC&pg=PA126 |page=126 |last=Bedford |first=Neal |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |isbn=1-74104-479-0[/tpl] On August 28, 2005, a monument commemorating the Jewish victims who passed through the station was unveiled, based on design by Czesław Bielecki, and featurnig the [tpl]convert|140|m[/tpl] Tunnel of the Deported.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.muzeumtradycji.pl/katalogi-wystaw-stalych/1/399,stacja-radegast-litzmanntastadt-getto-1940-1944.html |title=Stacja Radegast Litzmanntastadt Getto 1940-1944 |publisher=Muzeum Tradycji Niepodległościowych w Łodzi |year=2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl] The renovated station building serves as one of the divisions of the Łódź Museum of Independence.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.muzeumtradycji.pl/3-historia/ |title=Historia Stacji Radegast |publisher=Muzeum Tradycji Niepodległościowych w Łodzi |accessdate=2 December 2013[/tpl]
