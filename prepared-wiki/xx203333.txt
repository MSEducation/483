Axia operates the Alberta SuperNet and is half owner of Covage networks, developing high speed networks in France. It as also been awarded the tender for the Singapore fibre network as part of the OpenNet consortium with Singapore Telecom, and has placed a bond to allow it to submit a proposal for Australia's National Broadband Network.
Axia had a market cap of just under $200M in May 2008. 

==Alberta Supernet, Canada==

Axia operates the "SuperNet" for the Alberta government. Owned and funded by the government, it connects government, learning, health, library and municipality sites across the Province. Axia also developed packages for monitoring, managing and maintaining the connection, provision of electronics, Quality of Service, Service Level Agreements and VPN memberships anywhere in the province.
To facilitate the connection of non-government customers, Axia operates Axia Broadband Connection Services. Non-government customers represented 20 percent of the total used bandwidth in May 2008. 

==France - Covage joint venture==

Covage is a French joint venture between Axia NetMedia and Cube Infrastructure Fund (a €1.1 million Private Equity fund), with direct involvement in 19 regional networks in France and a national backbone (over 9,000 km of fiber deployed). Covage is the leading neutral and independent player in the optic fiber concession business in France.

==Singapore - SingTel joint venture in OpenNet==

The OpenNet consortium (consisting of Axia NetMedia (30%), Singapore Telecommunications/SingTel (30%), Singapore Press Holdings (25%) and Singapore Power Telemedia (15%)) were awarded Singapore's National Broadband Network passive network tender on September 26 2008. OpenNet will directly own the fibre links of the proposal, which will reach 60% of the population by 2010 and 95% by 2012, and OpenNet will assume universal service obligations after 2013.http://www.commsday.com/node/270
Their proposal creates an open access network with 4 distinct layers of ownership, to separate competitive interests from monopoly aspects of the network. SingTel (the national incumbent) will transfer existing ducts, manholes and exchanges to be used for the NBN into an independent asset company by mid-2011 and sell down its stake in that entity by 2014. The fibre will belong to OpenNet. The electronics will be offered to “operating companies” (Opco licensees) who will operate the electronics—Layers 2 and 3— of the network - and the operating companies will resell to retail providers.
