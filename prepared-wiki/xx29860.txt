==Plot==

Set in Paris during the 1700s, the Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) appears to be virtuous and upstanding but is, in fact, a sexually ravenous, immoral schemer who plays games with men out of bitterness at the constricted station of women in her society. She decides to exact revenge on a recent lover (Bastide)  by having his young new virgin fiancée, Cécile de Volanges (Uma Thurman), the daughter of Merteuil's cousin Madame de Volanges (Swoosie Kurtz), seduced and ruined before his return from Corsica. Despite of having had many previous lovers, Merteuil is vowed to take revenge for Bastide leaving her as no man has done so in the past.
Merteuil calls on her sometime partner, the rakish and similarly amoral Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich), to do the deed at the reasoning of revenge as Valmont's previous mistress also cheated with Bastide at some time prior. At first, Valmont refuses her proposition due to the easiness of seducing a virgin; the concern over his prestigious reputation; and that he is busy trying to seduce the virtuous and religious Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is spending time at his aunt's (Madame du Rosemonde) manor house while her husband Dijon is away in Burgundy.
Valmont is led by Azolan to an impoverished family being expelled by the French monarchy for not paying taxes, which Valmont donates 56 livres to satisfy the debt as a superficially virtuous impression to Tourvel. Valmont instructs his page Azolan to seduce Tourvel's maid Julie and pressures her to surrender any letters between Tourvel and Volange.  Upon discovering that the uptight and superficial Madame de Volanges had been secretly writing to Madame de Tourvel to warn her against his evil nature, Valmont changes his mind and decides to follow Merteuil's scheme.  They take advantage of the fact that young Cécile is secretly in love with her music teacher, the Chevalier Raphael Danceny (Keanu Reeves), whom Merteuil ulteriorly introduced to Cécile in hopes of provoking arousal; while knowing that Danceny is poor and therefore does not qualify in the eyes of her mother as a potential suitor.
At his aunt's manor, Valmont tricks Cécile into providing access to her bedchamber so that he can deliver Danceny's love letters unobserved, but instead shows up and rapes her as she pleads with him to leave. Over breakfast the next morning, he taunts a visibly distressed Cécile, and she runs from the room in tears. Later that night, he attempts to enter her room again, but she has barred her door and is seen sobbing within her chamber. 
Madame de Tourvel further feels uncomfortable at the presence of Valmont, and demands that he leave his aunt's manor. Frustrated, he agrees, and visits Merteuil, now willing to seduce Cécile to exact revenge on Volanges. Merteuil tells Valmont her story and motive of becoming the superficial character; in the end resisting Valmont's sexual attempt without the written proof needed.
Madame de Volanges, distraught by her daughter's sudden state of illness, calls upon Merteuil to speak to Cécile. Merteuil advises Cécile to consensually continue an affair with Valmont, telling her she should take advantage of all the lovers she can acquire in a life so constricted by her sex. Cécile takes her advice and continues her affair with Valmont. In the meantime, Madame du Merteuil discreetly seduces Danceny and engages a sexual affair with him.
Valmont meanwhile steadily targets his main prey, Madame de Tourvel, who, despite suspecting his base motives, eventually gives in to his tireless advances. However, Valmont, the lifelong womanizer, has unexpectedly fallen in love with Tourvel.
Merteuil had promised Valmont a night in her company should he be successful in his scheme to seduce Madame de Tourvel and provide written proof (i.e. love letter) of his conquest. Nevertheless, Merteuil becomes secretly jealous of Tourvel due to suspicion that Valmont has fell in love with her.  
Cécile later becomes pregnant with Valmont's child, but suffers a miscarriage, thus avoiding a scandal. When Valmont succeeds in entering an affair with Tourvel, she refuses to grant Valmont his prize due to the lack of a love letter; and unless he breaks off with Tourvel completely; Merteuil threatens to ruin his proud reputation as a debaucher. Valmont, his ego damaged, heeds her request and coldly leaves Tourvel, repeating a phrase Merteuil suggests: "It is beyond my control." Tourvel emotionally endures a nervous breakdown and begins to become desperately ill. Valmont goes back to Merteuil to collect his reward, who in the meantime discovers through a secret door that she has taken Chevalier Danceny as her lover. Valmont arranges for Danceny to leave Merteuil for Cécile, which leads to him once again demanding the immediate fulfillment of her promise. The Marquise refuses further insulting Valmont of falling in love with Tourvel. Valmont eventually slaps Merteuil, who rejects Valmont's claim to his prize as they declare war upon each other.
The Marquise reveals to Danceny that Valmont had seduced Cécile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel. Guilty and despairing, Valmont allows Danceny to fatally wound him. Before he dies, he asks Danceny to visit Tourvel and assure her of his true love; Valmont also hands him a collection of letters from Merteuil that detail her scheming. After hearing Valmont's message from Danceny, Madame de Tourvel dies by depression and blood letting by the convent nuns at the supervision of Madame de Volanges (whom assumingly has also returned Cécile back into the cloister). 
Upon discovery of Valmont's death, Merteuil goes through a nervous breakdown in her chateau. Danceny publishes Merteuil's letters, which become a scandal, and she is booed and disgraced by the audience at the opera. The movie closes as she suffers a breakdown while removing her make-up.

Pauline Kael in The New Yorker described it as "heaven – alive in a way that movies rarely are." Hal Hinson in the Washington Post wrote that the film's "wit and immediacy is extraordinarily rare in a period film. Instead of making the action seem far off, the filmmakers put the audience in the room with their characters."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/dangerousliaisonsrhinson_a0a8d4.htm |first=Hal |last=Hinson |title='Dangerous Liaisons' |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=January 13, 1989[/tpl] Roger Ebert called it "an absorbing and seductive movie."[tpl]cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890113/REVIEWS/901130302/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=Dangerous Liaisons :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=January 13, 1989[/tpl] Variety considered it an "incisive study of sex as an arena for manipulative power games."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790228?refcatid=31 |title=Dangerous Liaisons Review |publisher=variety.com |accessdate=2009-11-08 | date=1988-01-01[/tpl] Vincent Canby in The New York Times hailed it as a "kind of lethal drawing-room comedy."[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE5DE103DF932A15751C1A96E948260 |first=Vincent |last=Canby | authorlink= Vincent Canby| title= Passion in the Ancien Régime |publisher=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1988[/tpl]
Christopher Hampton received critical acclaim for his screenplay, with Time Out writing that "one of the film's enormous strengths is scriptwriter Christopher Hampton's decision to go back to the novel, and save only the best from his play."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64930/dangerous_liaisons.html |title=Dangerous Liaisons |publisher=Time Out London |accessdate=2009-11-08[/tpl] James Acheson and Stuart Craig were also praised for their work, with Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times stating that "the film's details of costuming (by The Last Emperor's James Acheson) and production design (by Stuart Craig of Gandhi and The Mission) are ravishing." All three would go on to win Academy Awards for their work on this film.
Glenn Close received considerable praise for her performance; she was lauded by The New York Times for her "richness and comic delicacy," while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, once she "finally lets loose and gives way to complete animal despair, Close is horrifying." Roger Ebert thought the two lead roles were "played to perfection by Close and Malkovich... their arch dialogues together turn into exhausting conversational games, tennis matches of the soul."
Michelle Pfeiffer was also widely acclaimed for her portrayal, despite playing, in the opinion of the Washington Post, "the least obvious and the most difficult" role. "Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it." The New York Times called her performance a "happy surprise." Roger Ebert, considering the trajectory of her career, wrote that "in a year that has seen her in varied assignments such as Married to the Mob and Tequila Sunrise, the movie is more evidence of her versatility. She is good when she is innocent and superb when she is guilty." Pfeiffer would later win a British Academy Film Award for her performance.
The casting of John Malkovich proved to be a controversial decision that divided critics. The New York Times, while admitting there was the "shock of seeing him in powdered wigs", concluded that he was "unexpectedly fine. The intelligence and strength of the actor shape the audience's response to him." The Washington Post was similarly impressed with Malkovich's performance: "There's a sublime perversity in Frears' casting, especially that of Malkovich... he brings a fascinating dimension to his character that would be missing with a more conventionally handsome leading man." Variety was less impressed, stating that while the "sly actor conveys the character's snaky, premeditated Don Juanism... he lacks the devilish charm and seductiveness one senses Valmont would need to carry off all his conquests."
