CATEGORIES: Bamboo, Engineered wood

Engineered bamboo is a low cost product manufactured from bamboo. It is designed to be a replacement for wood[tpl]cite book|title=Modern bamboo structures: proceedings of First International Conference on Modern Bamboo Structures|author=Yan Xiao, Masafumi Inoue, Shyam K. Paudel|year=2008|isbn=041547597X|publisher=CRC Press[/tpl] or engineered wood, but is used only when high load bearing strength is not required[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/civil-engineering/short-term/computation/finite-mod/numerical-analysis-of-bamboo.pdf|author=Wan Tarmeze Wan Ariffin|publisher=University of Birmingham|title=Numerical Analysis of Bamboo and Laminated Bamboo Strip Lumber (PhD paper)|date=March 2005|accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl] because building standards for this type of use have not been agreed by regulatory bodies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inbar.int/Board.asp?BoardID=147|title=Sustainable building: Building Codes|publisher=International Network for Bamboo and Rattan|accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl] Engineered bamboo comes in several different forms, including lamboo, which has three times the structural capacity as normal timber[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.architerials.com/2010/03/my-boo-lamboo/ |author=Wu Xing |accessdate=May 28, 2013 |date=March 31, 2010 |publisher=Architerials |title=My Boo (Lamboo)[/tpl] and is defined and regulated by the ASTM International Standards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-trends-press-releases/Lamboo-Inc-Recognized-Within-ASTM-International-Standards-191449271.html?view=all#sthash.0Nn2aAt2.dpbs |title=Lamboo Inc.

Engineered bamboo has been used as paneling, vehicle beds, concrete formworks, lightweight building construction[tpl]cite book|title=Structural Adequacy of Traditional Bamboo Housing in Latin America|author=Jorge A. Gutiérrez|publisher=National Laboratory for Materials and Structural Models, Civil Engineering Department,University of Costa Rica|year=2000|isbn=8186247440[/tpl] and even for shelters after the 2004 tsunami.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4527640.stm|publisher=BBC|date=18 December 2005|author=Subir Bhaumik|title=Andaman tsunami victims still homeless|accessdate=2012-04-03[/tpl] In comparison to the woods that have been traditionally used a number of benefits and drawbacks have been identified. Lower cost, especially when replacing wood that would otherwise have been imported, is a key advantage.[tpl]cite book|title=Silvicultural management of bamboo in the Philippines and Australia for shoots and timber|publisher=Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research|author=Merlyn Carmelita N. Rivera|page=11[/tpl] Further benefits include greater hardness and shape retention, especially in high temperatures.[tpl]cite journal|title=Bamboo composites: Material of the future|author=Bansal, Arun K. and Zoolagud, S.S.|volume=1|number=2|year=2002|pages=119–130|journal=Journal of Bamboo and Rattan[/tpl]
However, bamboo is not as resilient as most woods and will decay more rapidly than other woods if not treated with preservatives.[tpl]cite journal|title=Preservation of bamboo structures|journal=Ghana Journal of Forestry|volume=15|page=156|year=2004|author=W Liese[/tpl]
New building methods have had to be developed for engineered bamboo as its properties are sufficiently different, and make normal wood-working methods used with (non-engineered) bamboo unsuitable.[tpl]cite web|title=Work in Progress – Pushover Test of Bamboo Portal Frame Structure|url=http://www.asee-ncsection.org/papers/185.pdf|author=Bhavna Sharma, Kent A. Harries and Khosrow Ghavami|publisher=University of Pittsburgh[/tpl]
In order to overcome the typical loss of strength bamboo incurs when bending takes place post-harvest, an alternative method to overcome this has been developed.
Pre-harvest bending of the bamboo stems in zig-zags, allows the bamboo to later form a Warren truss.[ref]

Alexander Vittouris has proposed a much simpler 2D S-bend shape, which — after harvesting, and in sufficient quantities — could be assembled into a variety of 3D shapes. The arboriculture technique used to make both shapes is similar to tree shaping, and result in parts similar to knee (construction).[ref]
