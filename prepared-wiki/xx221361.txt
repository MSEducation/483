Baptism for the dead, vicarious baptism or proxy baptism today commonly refers to the religious practice of baptizing a person on behalf of one who is dead—a living person receiving the ordinance on behalf of a deceased person.
Baptism for the dead is best known as a doctrine of the Latter Day Saint movement, which has practiced it since 1840.  It is currently practiced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), where it is performed only in dedicated temples, as well as in several other current factions of the Latter-day Saint movement.  Those who practice this rite view baptism as an indispensable requirement to enter the Kingdom of God, and thus practice baptism for the dead to offer it by proxy to those who died without the opportunity to receive it. The LDS Church teaches that those who have died may choose to accept or reject the baptism done on their behalf.
The modern term itself is derived from a phrase "baptised for the dead" occurring in one verse of the New Testament ([tpl]sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29[/tpl]), though the meaning of that phrase is an open question among scholars. Early heresiologists Epiphanius of Salamis (Panarion 28) and Chrysostom (Homilies 40) attributed the practice respectively to the Cerinthians and to the Marcionites, whom they identified as heretical "Gnostic" groups.Everett Ferguson Baptism in the early church: history, theology, and liturgy   2009 p299 "Tertullian twice in an antiheretical context comments on 1 Corinthians 15:29, “ baptism for the dead.”4 Later writers say the Marcionites practiced baptism on behalf of the dead.5 It was also said that they ..." For that reason, the practice was forbidden by the Catholic Church, and is not practiced in modern mainstream Christianity, whether Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant.

==Practice==

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

In the practice of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or "Mormons"), a living person, acting as proxy, is baptized by immersion on behalf of a deceased person of the same sex. After giving a short prayer that includes the name of the deceased individual, the proxy is immersed briefly in the water, then brought up again. Baptism for the dead is a distinctive ordinance of the church and is based on the belief that baptism is a required ordinance for entry into the Kingdom of God.

===Community of Christ===

Some members of the early Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now known as the Community of Christ) also believed in baptism for the dead,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/bap4dead.htm |title=Baptism For The Dead |publisher=Centerplace.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23[/tpl] but it was never officially sanctioned by that organization, and was considered highly controversial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.centerplace.org/library/books/DifferencesThatPersist.pdf |title=Differences That Persist between the RLDS and LDS Churches |format=PDF |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23[/tpl]
A revelation and two letters written by Joseph Smith, Jr. appertaining to baptism for the dead were removed from the RLDS Doctrine and Covenants by a church general conference in 1970. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] 

===Other Latter Day Saint churches===

In the Restoration Branches movement, which broke from the RLDS Church in the 1980s, the question of baptism for the dead is at best unsettled, reflecting their RLDS origin. Many adherents reject the validity of this ordinance completely.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.centerplace.org/rlds/AResponseToPaulTrask.htm |title= A Response to Paul Trask, Part Way To Utah |first=  B.

Other Latter Day Saint denominations that accept baptism for the dead include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) and The Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite). The Strangite Church performed baptisms for the dead during the 1840s in Voree, Wisconsin and later during the 1850s on Beaver Island, Michigan. In each case, the practice was authorized by revelation given by James J. Strang. The question of whether the Strangite Church still practices proxy baptism is an open one, but belief is considered orthodox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strangite.org/BaptismDead.htm |title=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints – Mormons – Baptism for the Dead |publisher=Strangite.org |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-23[/tpl]
Cutlerite practice permits baptisms for the dead to be performed in baptismal fonts in Cutlerite meetinghouses (of which only two exist today, one in Clitherall, Minnesota and the other in Independence, Missouri). Though Cutlerites believe in the concept of temples, it is not required that baptisms for the dead be performed in one. The meetinghouse baptismal fonts are used for baptism of the living and for the dead. Cutlerites have practiced baptisms for the dead sporadically throughout their history (including during the early 1990s), but it is not known if they still do so. As with the LDS Church and the Strangite Church, belief in this doctrine is considered orthodox.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]

===Other Christian Churches===

As part of their Sacraments, the New Apostolic Church and Old Apostolic Church also practice baptism for the dead, as well as Communion and Sealing to the Departed. In this practice a proxy or substitute is baptised in the place of an unknown number of deceased persons. According to NAC and OAC doctrine the deceased do not enter the body of the substitute.
In the Reformed Old Apostolic Church it is believed that all deceased persons that are baptised reside within the body of the substitute.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

===Outside of Christianity===

Outside of Christianity, proxy baptisms were practiced by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran.

==Early Christianity==

Tertullian attributes the practice of 1 Corinthians "baptised for the dead" to the Marcionites.[tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Epiphanius of Salamis (between 310–320 – 403) reported that he had heard it said that, among followers of Cerinthus, if one of them died before baptism, another was baptized in that person's name.Panarion 28, 6.4
John Chrysostom (c. 347–407) mockingly attributes to the Marcionites of the late 4th century a similar practice: if one of their followers who was being prepared for baptism died before receiving baptism, the dead person's corpse was addressed with the question whether he wished to be baptized, whereupon another answered affirmatively and was baptized for the dead person.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf112.iv.xli.html#fna_iv.xli-p6.2 |title=John Chrysostom, Homily XL on 1 Corinthians |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27[/tpl]

[tpl]Quote|That baptism for the dead was indeed practiced in some orthodox Christian circles is indicated by the decisions of two late fourth century councils. The fourth canon of the Synod of Hippo, held in 393, declares, "The Eucharist shall not be given to dead bodies, nor baptism conferred upon them." The ruling was confirmed four years later in the sixth canon of the Third Council of Carthage.[tpl]harvnb|Tvedtnes|1989[/tpl][/tpl]

===1 Corinthians 15:29===

In the context of insisting that "in Christ shall all be made alive .. Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's",[tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:22–23[/tpl] Paul wrote in [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29|KJV[/tpl]: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?" Different views have been expressed on the meaning of the phrase "baptized for the dead", and on whether Paul gave his approval to the practice.

====Meanings of the verb baptizein====

The Greek verb in Paul's phrase "baptized for the dead" is baptizein, which in Jewish Greek has a wider reference than "baptism", applying primarily to the masculine noun baptismos "ritual washing"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G909&t=KJV |title=masculine noun baptismos 4x NT uses |publisher=Blueletterbible.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl] The verb occurs four times in the Septuagint in the context of ritual washing, baptismos: Judith cleansing herself from menstrual impurity, Naaman washing seven times to be cleansed from leprosy, etc.Philippe Wolff Baptism: The Covenant and the Family 2009 p45 "This word occurs but four times in the Septuagint, and in no case with the Baptist meaning. 1st. "Judith baptized herself in a fountain of water, by the camp." (Judith xii. 7.) She was then purifying herself from her uncleanness." In the New Testament only, the verb baptizein can also relate to the neuter noun baptisma "baptism", a neologism unknown in the Septuagint and other pre-Christian Jewish texts.Jonathan David Lawrence Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006), p294 This broadness in the meaning of baptizein is reflected in English Bibles rendering "wash," where Jewish ritual washing is meant, for example in Mark 7:4, which states that the Pharisees "except they wash (Greek "baptize"), they do not eat",ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν.` and "baptize" where baptisma, the new Christian rite, is intended. The older ritual washing use of baptizein is relevant in the context of funerals since any Jew coming into contact with the dead body must undertake ritual washing.Geoffrey Wigoder The Encyclopedia of Judaism 1989 p768 "The dead body renders the house in which it is situated and anyone coming in contact with the body ritually impure, tame met. ... (ritual washing of the body). Any person touching a corpse must wash his hands as soon as possible" During the Second Temple and early Rabbinical period the regulations on "ritual washing" (Greek masculine noun baptismos) expanded and multiplied. This is documented in the Halakhah Tractate YadayimJacob Neusner The Halakhah: An Encyclopaedia of the Law of Judaism  2000 "TRACTATE YADAYIM I. AN OUTLINE OF THE HALAKHAH OF YADAYIM The hands are deemed perpetually unclean, a realm of uncleanness — fingertips to wrist — distinct from the rest of the body. and Dead Sea ScrollsLawrence.Washing in Water: Trajectories of Ritual Bathing in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2006) chapter Dead Sea Scrolls Peter Leithart (2007) suggests that Paul's comment "why do they.." is an analogy between baptism (i.e. neuter concept noun baptisma) with Jewish ritual washing (i.e. masculine concrete noun baptismos) for contact with the dead following the Mosaic regulations in Numbers 19.Peter J. Leithart The Baptized Body 2007 p136 "Paul uses a distancing third person—“they” baptize for the dead. Why not “we”? Paul might well be referring to Jewish practices. Under the ceremonial laws of Torah, every washing was a washing “for the dead” (cf. Num. 19). Uncleanness was a ceremonial form of death, and through washings of various sorts the unclean dead were restored to life in fellowship with.." The phrase "ritually washed for the dead" does not occur in intertestamental literature, but a possibly related idea of prayer for the dead occurs in 2 Maccabees. Since the New Testament idea of "baptism" (Greek baptisma), the rite of baptism, is not mentioned in the verse, it is open to interpretation whether the verb baptizein refers to "ritual washing" (Greek baptismos) or "the rite of baptism" (Greek baptisma) or is an analogy between both.Alan C. Mitchell, Daniel J. Harrington (2007) Hebrews , p. 119. "2. instruction about cleansings, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment: The word for "cleansings," baptismos, is not exclusively used for Christian baptism, as is baptisma" (BDAG, 165)

====Meaning of the phrase====

In his book Against Marcion, Tertullian, said that the vain practice ("whatever it may have been") to which Paul alluded in [tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:29|ËSV[/tpl] witnessed to belief in bodily resurrection, something that Marcion denied, and that, in fact, "baptized for the dead" means baptized for the body destined to die and rise again.(Marcion'' 5, 10 Somewhat similarly, John Chrysostom explained Paul's mention of people being "baptized for the dead" as a reference to the profession of faith they made in their own future resurrection before being baptized.
Some interpret "baptized for the dead" as a metaphor for martyrdom, as in [tpl]bibleverse||Mark|10:38[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Luke|12:50[/tpl] baptism is a metaphor for suffering or martyrdom; accordingly they would translate it as "being baptized with a view to death".Tyndale Bible Dictionary, 2001, ISBN 978-0-8423-7089-9, article Baptism for the dead In this interpretation, the phrase is closely linked with what Paul says immediately afterwards[tpl]bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:30–32[/tpl] of the suffering that he himself faces and is enabled to endure precisely because of his faith in his resurrection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-r001.html |title=What does the Bible mean when it refers to the "Baptism of the dead?" |publisher=Christiananswers.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visualbiblealive.com/resources.php?encyc_id=877&img_id=88150&action=encyclopedia&frame=divEncyc |title=Baptism for the Dead |publisher=Visual Bible Alive |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl] This interpretation is similar to that of John Chrysostom.
Others interpret the phrase as referring to simple baptism of an individual.  For Martin Luther it regarded a practice of being baptized above (the first of the meanings of the preposition ὑπέρ, generally translated in this passage as for)[tpl]cite web|url=http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.74:7:143.lsj |title=Liddell and Scott: ὑπέρ |publisher=Artfl.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl] the tombs of the dead. John Calvin saw it as a reference to being baptized when close to death.
Yet another interpretation sees the phrase as referring to vicarious baptism on behalf of dead people performed in the belief that the dead were thereby benefitted in some way. This belief is put forward as the reason why, when Paul compares the Corinthians' experience to that of the Israelites in crossing the Red Sea and being fed on manna, he insists that the Israelites were not thereby prevented from sinning.

====Approved by Paul?====

The Tyndale Bible Dictionary concludes that Paul probably did not approve the practice of baptism for the dead. He refers to its practitioners as "they", not as "you" (the Corinthian Christians to whom he wrote).Tyndale Bible Dictionary (Tyndale House 2001 ISBN 978-0-8423-7089-9), P. 146 The note in the Catholic New American Bible is more cautious: "Baptized for the dead: this practice is not further explained here, nor is it necessarily mentioned with approval, but Paul cites it as something in their experience that attests in one more way to belief in the resurrection."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/1corinthians/1corinthians15.htm |title=New American Bible, note on 1 Corinthians 15:29 |publisher=Usccb.org |date=2011-03-13 |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl] In this, it stays close to what Tertullian wrote in the year 207 or 208, when he said that Paul's only aim in alluding to the practice of baptism for the dead, "whatever it may have been", was "that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such a resurrection."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03125.htm |title=Tertullian, Against Marcion, book V, chapter 10 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17[/tpl]

====Other views====

Elaine Pagels (1992) seeks to explain 1 Corinthians as having reference to the Valentinian sect later numbered among the "Gnostic" heresies.Elaine H. Pagels The gnostic Paul: gnostic exegesis of the Pauline letters 1992 p83 "Paul now argues his case for the resurrection from the practice of baptism for the dead. ... According to their own sacramental practice, the pneumatic elect receive baptism for "the dead" that is, for the psychics." However Pagels view of Paul's epistles is not supported by other scholars.
Mainstream Christian denominations generally do not accept the Latter-day Saint interpretation of "baptism for the dead", mentioned in [tpl]sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29[/tpl], though a few contemporary Christian churches do practice such an ordinance.e.g. Coptic Christians; see: [tpl]harvnb|Tvedtnes|1989[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2012|reason=the source admits not finding evidence of the claimed contemporary Coptic practice, and even as evidence of past Coptic baptism for the dead cites imaginative pseudepigraphic accounts of baptism of the dead[/tpl]

==LDS Church doctrine==

Members of the LDS Church believe that baptism is a prerequisite for entry into the kingdom of God as stated by Jesus in [tpl]sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=John|chapter=3|verse=5[/tpl]: "Except that a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (KJV).
The LDS Church teaches that performing baptisms for the dead allows this saving ordinance to be offered on behalf of those who have died without accepting or knowing Jesus Christ or his teachings during their mortal lives. It is taught that this is the method by which all who have lived upon the earth will have the opportunity to receive baptism and to thereby enter the Kingdom of God. 
Among other Biblical references, Latter-day Saints cite Peter's statements that Jesus preached to the spirits of the dead (KJV 1 Peter 3:19; 4:6) as evidence that God in his justice provides an opportunity for the deceased to hear and accept the gospel, if they don't receive that chance in mortality. As Peter affirmed in Acts 2:37-38, the next step after acceptance of the gospel is baptism for the remission of sins, which "doth also now save us" (KJV 1 Peter 3:21).
The LDS Church teaches that those in the afterlife who have been baptized by proxy are free to accept or reject the ordinance done on their behalf. Baptism on behalf of a deceased individual is not binding if that individual chooses to reject it in the afterlife.[tpl]Cite document |url= http://lds.org/study/topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng |contribution= Baptisms for the Dead |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2011-09-19 |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last= Condie |first= Spencer J. |author-link= Spencer J.

Any member of the LDS Church, male or female, who is at least 12 years old and holds a current temple recommend may act as a proxy in this ordinance. Men must also hold the Aaronic Priesthood prior to entering the temple. Men act as proxy for deceased men, and women as proxy for deceased women. The concept of a spiritual proxy is compared by some in the LDS Church to the belief that Jesus acted as proxy for every human when he atoned for the sins of the world.[tpl]cite book |last= Hinckley |first= Gordon B. |author-link= Gordon B.

===Modern origin===

According to the LDS Church, the practice of baptism for the dead is based on a revelation received by the prophet Joseph Smith. He first taught the doctrine at the funeral sermon of a deceased member of the church, Seymour Brunson.[tpl]cite book| last=Cook| first=Lyndon|author2=Andrew F. Ehat| title=The Words of Joseph Smith |date=June 1991| publisher=Grandin Book Co.| isbn=0-910523-39-8 | page=49[/tpl] In a letter written on October 19, 1840, to the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (who were on a mission in the United Kingdom at the time), Smith refers to the passage in [tpl]sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=15|verse=29[/tpl] (KJV):
LDS Church scripture expands further upon this doctrine and states that such baptisms are to be performed in temples.Doctrine and Covenants [tpl]sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 124|verse=29[/tpl], [tpl]sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 127|verse=5|range=-10[/tpl] and [tpl]sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 128[/tpl] Vicarious baptism is performed in connection with other vicarious ordinances in temples of the LDS Church, such as the Endowment and celestial marriage.
Initially, women could be baptized for dead men, and vice versa; this, however, was changed in order to ensure that the person being baptized for a dead man could also be ordained on their behalf to the priesthood.Brigham Young (Aug. 31, 1873), Journal of Discourses 16:160.

===Genealogy and baptism===

The LDS Church holds that deceased persons who have not accepted, or had the opportunity to accept, the gospel of Christ in this life will have such opportunity in the afterlife. The belief is that as all must follow Jesus Christ, they must also receive all the ordinances that a living person is expected to receive, including baptism. For this reason, members of the LDS Church are encouraged to research their genealogy. This research is then used as the basis for church performing temple ordinances for as many deceased persons as possible. As a part of these efforts, Mormons have performed temple ordinances on behalf of a number of high profile people. Of particular interest are: the Founding Fathers of the U.S., Presidents of the U.S., Pope John Paul II, John Wesley, Christopher Columbus, Adolf Hitler,[tpl]cite news |first= Mark |last= Thiessen |date= April 9, 2005 |title= Jews, Mormons to meet over baptism for the dead |url= http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2646929&itype=ngpsid |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |agency= Associated Press [/tpl] and others.[tpl]Citation needed |date= October 2010[/tpl]
While members of the LDS Church consider vicarious ordinances for the deceased a great service, some non-members have taken offense. Sensitive to the issue of proxy baptizing for non-Mormons not related to church members, the church in recent years has published a general policy of performing temple ordinances only for ancestors of church members. For example, the church is in the process of removing sensitive names (such as Jewish Holocaust victims) from its International Genealogical Index (IGI). D. Todd Christofferson of the church's Presidency of the Seventy stated that removing the names is an "ongoing, labor intensive process requiring name-by-name research ... When the Church is made aware of documented concerns, action is taken ... Plans are underway to refine this process." The LDS Church keeps records of the temple ordinances performed for deceased persons, however the new FamilySearch, a web application for accessing the church's genealogical databases, shows information on temple ordinances only to registered LDS Church members and not to non-members.[tpl]Citation | last = | first = | year = | title = Finding Ordinance Dates on the International Genealogical Index (IGI) | url = https://help.familysearch.org/kb/Local_Support/en/Consultants/memos/en/13%20Finding%20Ordinance%20Dates%20on%20the%20International%20Genealogical%20Index.pdf | accessdate = 27 February 2012 | quote = To see ordinance information in the IGI, members must be registered in FamilySearch.org as a Church member.

In 2008, a directive from the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy directed Catholic dioceses to prevent the LDS Church from "microfilming and digitizing information" contained in Catholic sacramental registers so that those whose names were contained therein would not be subjected to vicarious Mormon baptism.[tpl]citation |url= http://genealogy.about.com/b/2008/05/05/vatican-orders-catholic-parish-registers-off-limits-to-lds-church.htm |title= Vatican Orders Catholic Parish Registers Off-Limits to LDS Church |first= Kimberly |last= Powell |date= May 5, 2008 |work= Genealogy.About.com |publisher= About.com |accessdate= 2014-03-26[/tpl][tpl]citation |url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0802443.htm |title= Vatican letter directs bishops to keep parish records from Mormons |first= Chaz |last= Muth |work= Catholicnews.com |publisher= Catholic News Service/United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |date= May 2, 2008 |accessdate= 2014-03-26[/tpl] The Vatican had previously declared that Mormon baptism was invalid.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html |title= Response to a 'dubium' on the validity of baptism conferred by «The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints», called «Mormons» |author= Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith |publisher= Vatican.va |date= 2001-06-05 |accessdate= 2014-03-26 [/tpl]

===Baptisms for the dead by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

====Jewish Holocaust victims====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performs vicarious baptisms for individuals regardless of their race, sex, creed, religion, or morality.

These records, including many carefully kept genealogies, are priceless records of the human family and have a tie to great events in the history of the world. The officials had learned all they wanted to know about the Church storage procedures and were impressed. They insisted however that someone be sent to talk to them about the doctrine relating to our desire for their records. They wanted to know why we wanted their records. In 1977 I received the assignment to go to Israel and meet with their official archivists and scholars on the matter ... I explained to them our great interest in the Old Testament and our kinship with Israel. We talked of family, of patriarchal lineage and blessings. We talked of the doctrine of agency. But all of these things were not central to the point. It might seem that in order to obtain a favorable decision we would have to be "diplomatic" and not mention ordinances—especially baptism. But we were on the Lord's errand, and so I told them—plainly, bluntly—that we desired their records in order to provide baptism, Christian baptism, for their forebears and for ours. The reaction was immediate and intense. The meeting thereafter was most interesting! We came away uncertain as to the outcome. But we were on the Lord's errand. We were serving the work of redemption for the dead. We had told the truth without any shade of misrepresentation. In due time the answer came. We received approval to microfilm and preserve those records which were sanctified by the suffering of our brethren of the house of Israel. |postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl]
Despite the guidelines, some members of the church have submitted names without adequate permission. In December 2002, independent researcher Helen Radkey published a report showing that, following a 1995 promise from the church to remove Jewish Holocaust victims from its International Genealogical Index, the church's database included the names of about 19,000 who had a 40 to 50 percent chance "to be Holocaust victims ... in Russia, Poland, France, and Austria."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/ldsagree.html|title= The Issue of The Mormon Baptisms of Jewish Holocaust Victims and Other Jewish Dead: Mormons Hijack Dead or Alive Jewish Souls |accessdate=2009-01-27 |author = Bernard I.

Church official D. Todd Christofferson told the New York Times that the church expends massive amounts of resources attempting to purge improperly submitted names, but that it is not feasible to expect the church to find each and every last one, and that the agreement in 1995 did not place this type of responsibility on the centralized church leadership.[tpl]cite news| last=Urbina| first=Ian| title=Again, Jews Fault Mormons Over Posthumous Baptisms |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/nyregion/again-jews-fault-mormons-over-posthumous-baptisms.html | work=New York Times| date=2003-12-21[/tpl]
Jewish groups such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center spoke out against the vicarious baptism of Holocaust perpetrators and victims in the mid-1990s and again in the 2000s when they discovered the practice, which they consider insensitive to the living and the dead, was continuing.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/West/12/10/baptizing.the.dead.ap/ |title= Mormons meet with Jews over baptizing Holocaust victims |publisher= CNN.com |date= December 11, 2002 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20041012121102/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/West/12/10/baptizing.the.dead.ap/ |archivedate= 2004-10-12 |quote= Vicarious baptism had even been performed for Simon Wiesenthal himself after his death. The Center found the practice insulting and an affront to Jews who died because of their religion. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the center said: 'If these people did not contact the Mormons themselves, the adage should be: Don't call me, I'll call you.

In 2008, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors announced that, since church members had repeatedly violated previous agreements, it would no longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to "implement a mechanism to undo what they have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to the court of public opinion for justice.[tpl]cite news |first= Deepti|last= Hajela|author2=Jennifer Dobner |title= Jewish group wants Mormons to stop proxy baptisms|agency= Associated Press|page= |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2008|quote= |url= http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9l-R1TIM_X5myzSoEzLN7QnqdSwD94C9QH80[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl] Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will they be able to guarantee that my mother and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?"
Church officials, in response, stated that the church does not teach that vicarious baptisms coerce deceased persons to become Mormons, nor does the church add those names to its list of church members.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/background-explanation-of-temple-baptism |contribution= Background Explanation of Temple Baptism |title= Newsroom |work= mormonnewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church [/tpl][tpl]citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/religious-freedom-allows-both-mormons-and-jews-to-honor-their-ancestors |contribution= Religious Freedom Allows Both Mormons and Jews to Honor Their Ancestors |title= Newsroom |work= mormonnewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church [/tpl] Church officials have also stated that, in accordance with the 1995 agreement, it has removed more than 300,000 names of Jewish Holocaust victims from its databases, as well as subsequently removing names later identified by Jewish groups. Church officials have also stated that a new version of the database, New FamilySearch, has been developed and is currently being implemented that would help prevent the submission of Holocaust victim names for temple ordinances.[tpl]cite news|first=Buddy |last=Blankenfeld|title=Jewish group at odds with LDS Church over temple work for ancestors|work=ABC 4 News|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=11 November 2008|url=http://www.abc4.com/content/about_4/links_numbers/story.aspx?content_id=d1c20f95-896e-4cc0-a5d3-52dd7d9f5467[/tpl]
