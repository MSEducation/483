Jean Machine was a chain of British retail stores selling jeans. It was founded in 1971 by Tony Lonsdale, nicknamed the 'Blue Jean King'. He brought jeans over from California and after initial resistance from wholesalers, set up shop on the King's Road. Tony originally set up The Pant House in Hornton Street, Kensington before adding The Rag Machine and The Jean Machine next door to each other at 161 and 163 King's Road, Chelsea. Shortly after The Pant House opened nearby in King's Road. The Jean Machine became successful across the UK,  where it  had more than 100 stores, and, at one point, eight in Oxford Street, London.
Jean Machine was relaunched in London in December 2011 as a brand of men's jeans.
