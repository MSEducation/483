The Belgo-British Conference is an annual conference organised by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Belgian Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, the British Council and EGMONT - Royal Institute for International Relations.Belgo-British Conference Programme 2012
The aim of the Conference is to enrich bilateral relations by bringing together around 100 politicians, business people, academics, journalists, and other opinion-formers to debate themes of common and crucial importance to Belgium and the United Kingdom. In recent years themes have included ‘Natural resources: challenges and opportunities,’ 'Employment and Growth,' and ‘Two countries, how many Europes? A Belgo-British dialogue.' The 2013 Conference will focus on 'History and Reconciliation: Engaging a New Generation,' and comes at a time when states involved in the First World War are preparing to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its outbreak.
The Conference is currently chaired by Sir Stephen Wall (former UK Permanent Representative to the European Union) and Ambassador (Hon) Lode Willems (Director External and Government Affairs, BNP Parisbas-Fortis), who preside over an independent Board which agrees the theme of the conference. Previous chairs include Andre Villeneuve, Count George Jacobs, Baron Paul Buysse and Lord Simon of Highbury. The patrons of the Conference are HRH The Prince of Wales and HRH Prince Laurent of Belgium. The location of the conference alternates annually between the United Kingdom and Belgium and takes place under the Chatham House Rule.Belgo-British Conference Programme 2012
