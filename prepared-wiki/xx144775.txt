==Doping controversy==

In 1997, the French Football Federation moved to suspend Guérin after he failed a drugs test administered after a PSG game on 5 October.[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202101717/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_264.pdf|publisher=EC Sport and Law Commission|author=Estelle de La Rochefoucauld|title=Collection of sports-related case-law[/tpl] Guérin appealed unsuccessfully to the FFF's doping appeals commission, who awarded him an 18-month ban, 12 months of which were suspended. Guérin subsequently appealed to the French federal Administrative Court at Versaille, contesting the FFF's decision on several counts. The court at Versaille upheld one of Guérin's contentions, that the drugs test was improperly administered, and thus decreed that the entire process should be deemed void. Resultantly, the FFF-imposed suspension was annulled.
