Ciprofloxacin (INN) is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is a second-generation fluoroquinolone.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ball P |title=Quinolone generations: natural history or natural selection? |journal=J. Antimicrob.

Ciprofloxacin has 12 FDA-approved human uses and other veterinary uses, but it is often used for unapproved uses (off-label).
Overall, the safety of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones appears to be similar to that of other antibiotics, but serious side effects occur on occasion. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding whether fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse events at a higher rate than other broad-spectrum antibiotics.[tpl]cite journal |author=Heidelbaugh JJ, Holmstrom H |title=The perils of prescribing fluoroquinolones |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=191–7 |date=April 2013 |pmid=23570031 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Brown KA, Khanafer N, Daneman N, Fisman DN |title=Meta-analysis of antibiotics and the risk of community-associated Clostridium difficile infection |journal=Antimicrob.

==Medical uses==

Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints, endocarditis, gastroenteritis, malignant otitis externa, respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, and chancroid.[tpl]cite web|title=Ciprofloxacin-Hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/ciprofloxacin-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011[/tpl]
Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold. Although for certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin is not considered a first line agent.
Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be cause by Gram-(negative) bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole is one of several first line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for the treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/133.full |title=Diagnosis and Management of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infection in Adults and Children: Guidelines by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] Ciprofloxacin also features prominently in treatment guidelines for acute pyelonephritis, complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, acute or chronic prostatitis,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/18_Urological%20infections_LR.pdf |title=www.uroweb.org |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] certain types of endocarditis,[tpl]cite web |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/111/23/e394.full |title=Infective Endocarditis |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] certain skin infections,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/10/1373.full |title=Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]  and prosthetic joint infections.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/11/29/cid.cis803.abstract.html?papetoc |title=Diagnosis and Management of Prosthetic Joint Infection: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]
In other cases treatment guidelines  are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older, narrower spectrum drugs be used as first line therapy for less severe infections in order to minimize fluoroquinolone resistance development.  For example, the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends that the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower spectrum drugs such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/e103.full?ijkey=Evn1QGFzwH8Xrj3&keytype=ref |title=International Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis and Pyelonephritis in Women: A 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] The European Association for Urology recommends ciprofloxacin as an alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but cautions that the potential for “adverse events have to be considered”.
Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections, ciprofloxacin is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/drug_policy/pages/dur_board/reviews/articles/dur_review_2002_05_02_fluroquinolone.pdf |title=pharmacy.oregonstate.edu |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Zuger A |date=3 November 1998 |title=Ciprofloxacin for Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis |journal=Journal Watch (General) |url=http://general-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/citation/1998/1103/4 |quote=Because of its unpredictable activity against the pneumococcus, ciprofloxacin is not usually considered a first-line treatment for respiratory infections... |volume=1998 |issue=1103 |page=4 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Vardakas | first1 = KZ | last2 = Siempos | first2 = II | last3 = Grammatikos | first3 = A | last4 = Athanassa | first4 = Z | last5 = Korbila | first5 = IP | last6 = Falagas | first6 = ME |title = Respiratory fluoroquinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = CMAJ | volume = 179 | issue = 12 | pages = 1269–77 |date=December 2008 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.080358 | pmid = 19047608 | pmc = 2585120 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = PM | last2 = Pallett | first2 = AP | last3 = Carroll | first3 = MP | title = Ciprofloxacin in general practice | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 308 | issue = 6941 | page = 1437 |date=May 1994 | pmid = 8019264 | pmc = 2540361 | issn = 0959-8138 [/tpl]  "Respiratory quiniolones" such as levofloxacin, having greater activity against this pathogen, are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with important co-morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007).

===Available forms===

Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate release tablets, as extended release tablets, as an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. It is also available for local administration as eye drops and ear drops.

===Pregnancy===

The U.S. FDA categorizes ciprofloxacin in Pregnancy Category C.FDA-approved drug label  This category includes drugs for which there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in human pregnancy, and for which animal studies have suggested the potential for harm to the fetus, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women
despite potential risks. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during 
pregnancy by TERIS – the Teratogen Information System – concluded that therapeutic doses during 
pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Friedman | first1 = J. | last2 = Polifka | first2 = J. | title = Teratogenic effects of drugs: a resource for clinicians (TERIS) | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2000 | location = Baltimore, Maryland | pages = 149–195[/tpl]
Two small post-marketing epidemiology studies of mostly short-term, first trimester exposure found that flouroquinolones did not increase risk of major malformations, spontaneous abortions, prematurity or low birth weight.[tpl]cite journal| author=Loebstein R, Addis A, Ho E, Andreou R, Sage S, Donnenfeld AE et al.| title=Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to fluoroquinolones: a multicenter prospective controlled study. | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year= 1998 | volume= 42 | issue= 6 | pages= 1336–9 | pmid=9624471 | doi= | pmc=105599 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Schaefer C, Amoura-Elefant E, Vial T, Ornoy A, Garbis H, Robert E et al.| title=Pregnancy outcome after prenatal quinolone exposure.

===Breast feeding===

The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

===Children===

Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system:
1) Inhalational anthrax (postexposure)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2000/20780S08ltr.pdf |title=Cipro Labeling Revision Letter 08/30/2000 Supplement 008 New or Modified Indication |author=Dianne Murphy |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date = 30 August 2000 [/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Overall, the safety of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones appears to be similar to that of other antibiotics, but serious side effects occur on occasion. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding whether fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse events at a higher rate than other broad-spectrum antibiotics.
49,038 patients received courses of ciprofloxacin in pre-approval clinical trials.FDA-approved package insert  Most of the adverse events reported were described as only mild or moderate in severity, abated soon after the drug was discontinued, and required no treatment. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued because of an adverse event in 1% of orally treated patients. The most frequently reported drug-related events, from clinical trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications of ciprofloxacin therapy, were nausea (2.5%), diarrhea (1.6%), abnormal liver function tests (1.3%), vomiting (1%), and rash (1%). Other adverse events occurred at rates of The black box warning on the U.S. FDA-approved ciprofloxacin label warns of an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, especially in patients who are older than 60 years, patients who also use corticosteroids, and patients with kidney, lung, or heart transplants. Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the drug.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=10970974 |date=September 2000 |last1=Saint |first1=F |last2=Gueguen |last3=Biserte |last4=Fontaine |last5=Mazeman |title=Rupture of the patellar ligament one month after treatment with fluoroquinolone |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=495–7 |issn=0035-1040 |journal=Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur [/tpl] A case control study[tpl]cite journal |author=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HG, Stricker BH |title=Fluoroquinolones and risk of Achilles tendon disorders: case-control study |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7349 |pages=1306–7 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12039823 |pmc=113766 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.324.7349.1306|url=[/tpl] performed using a UK medical care database found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in tendon problems.

The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin like other flouroquinolones are known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system side effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in post-approval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS side effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses. Ciprofloxacin like other flouroquinolones are also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling, or numbness.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm365050.htm |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA requires label changes to warn of risk for possibly permanent nerve damage from antibacterial fluoroquinolone drugs taken by mouth or by injection |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]

Ciprofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population (except for the indications outlined above), pregnancy, nursing mothers, and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.

Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight in vitro assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in in vivo assays of genotoxicity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/019537s074,020780s032lbl.pdf |title=CIPRO® (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) TABLETS CIPRO® (ciprofloxacin*) ORAL SUSPENSION  |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750 mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m2). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control.

===Interactions===

Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs.
Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs (sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate, sucralfate, didanosine), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. Ciprofloxacin should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, ciprofloxacin should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rodvold KA, Piscitelli SC |title=New oral macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics: an overview of pharmacokinetics, interactions, and safety |journal=Clin.

Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2 and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include tizanidine, theophylline, caffeine, methylxanthines, clozapine, olanzapine, and ropinirole. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting.[tpl]cite journal |author=Janknegt R |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=J.

===Overdose===

Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity. Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or gastric lavage as well as administration of magnesium-, aluminum-, or calcium-containing antacids to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can only remove less than 10% of ciprofloxacin.[tpl]cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 04/06/2009 Supplement 073 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009[/tpl] Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.R.

==Chemical Properties==

Ciprofloxacin is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3 and its molecular weight is 331.4 g/mol. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance.
Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (USP) is the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of ciprofloxacin. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance with a molecular weight of 385.8 g/mol. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3HCl•H2O.

==Mechanism of action==

Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV,[tpl]cite journal |author=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 |date= 1 September 1997 |first1=K |first2=X |issn=1092-2172[/tpl] enzymes Pommier, Y., Leo, E., Zhang, H., Marchand, C. 2010. DNA topoisomerases and their poisoning by anticancer and antibacterial drugs" Chem. Biol 17: 421-433. necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate release tablets, extended release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration.  
When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/019847s054lbl.pdf |title=Cipro IV Prescribing Information |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum.  Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations.  The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4–6 hours, with 50-70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites.  Urinary excretion is virtually complete by 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment.
Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins (20-40%) but is an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2, which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme.
Ciprofloxacin is about 70% orally available when administered orally, so a slightly higher dose is needed to achieve the same exposure when switching from I.V. to oral administration.  A 750 mg immediate release oral tablet given every 12 hours produces about the same area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) and peak serum concentration (Cmax) as a 400 mg dose given every 8 hours I.V.  
The extended release oral tablets[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21554_ciproXR_lbl.pdf |title=Cipro XR Prescribing Information |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] allow once daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an immediate release form and 65% in a slow release matrix.  Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours post-administration. Compared to the 250 and 500 mg immediate release tablets, the 500 mg and 1000 mg XR tablets provide higher Cmax but the 24 hour AUCs are equivalent.
Ciprofloxacin immediate release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt as the free base.

==History==

The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mayrer AR, Andriole VT |title=Urinary tract antiseptics |journal=Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=199–208 |date=January 1982 |pmid=7038329 |doi= |url=[/tpl]  In 1979 the publication of a patent[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4146719?dq=4146719&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LHXJUoboI4PtoAT6kYDoDw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA |title=Patent US4146719 - Piperazinyl derivatives of quinoline carboxylic acids - Google Patents |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.[tpl]cite web |url=http://aac.asm.org/content/21/5/848.full.pdf+ |title=aac.asm.org |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]  In the aftermath of this disclosure, several other pharmaceutical companies initiated research and development programs with the goal of discovering additional antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone class.
The fluoroquinolone program at Bayer focused on examining the effects of very minor changes to the norfloxacin structure.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4547503?dq=US+4547503&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lbTJUqiWCMzZoASMwIGwBg&ved=0CDoQ6wEwAA |title=Patent US4547503 - 1-Cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-[4-(oxo-alkyl)-1-piperazinyl ... - Google Patents |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4544658?pg=PA1&dq=US+4544658&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F7TJUoO6JNfBoASMkICQAQ&ved=0CDgQ6wEwAA |title=Patent US4544658 - 1-Cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(alkyl-1-piperazinyl)quinoline-3 ... - Google Patents |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]  In 1983, the company published in vitro potency data for ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial having a chemical structure that differs from that of norfloxacin by the presence of a single carbon atom.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wise R, Andrews JM, Edwards LJ |title=In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=559–64 |date=April 1983 |pmid=6222695 |pmc=184701 |doi= |url=[/tpl]  This small change led to a 2 to 10-fold increase in potency against most strains of Gram-(-) bacteria.  Importantly, this structural change led to a four-fold improvement in activity against the important Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making ciprofloxacin one of the most potent known drugs for the treatment of this intrinsically antibiotic-resistant pathogen.
The oral tablet form of ciprofloxacin was approved in October 1987,http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=019537&TABLE1=OB_Rx just one year after the approval of norfloxacin[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=019384&TABLE1=OB_Rx |title=Orange Book Detail Record Search |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] In 1991, the intravenous formulation was introduced. Ciprofloxacin sales reached 1.52 million Euros in 1999, representing 30% of Bayer’s total pharmaceutical revenues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144145/000115697302000306/f00360e20vf.txt |title=www.sec.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Cipro |url=http://www.prescriptionaccess.org/lawsuitssettlements/past_lawsuits?id=0010 |publisher=Prescription Access |location=USA |accessdate=4 September 2009[/tpl] Following the anthrax scare of 2001, the US government purchased from Bayer Pharmaceuticals 100 million tablets of ciprofloxacin at a reduced price of $0.95 per pill.

==Society and Culture==

===Generic equivalents===

On 24 October 2001, The Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced generic versions of drugs (Barr Laboratories, Rugby Laboratories, and Hoechst-Marion-Roussel) that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating its price and supply. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law,[tpl]cite web |author=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |location=USA |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors.

===Litigation===

A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington, D.C., and workers at the US Capitol, along with employees of American Media, Inc. in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged they suffered serious adverse effects from taking ciprofloxacin (Cipro) in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in 2001. The action alleged Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug, thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws. According to the allegations within the complaint, exposed individuals were not informed of the true safety profile of ciprofloxacin, the high rate of adverse events associated with its use, or the availability of safer and equally effective alternative drugs.
