Moose Mountain (elev. [tpl]convert|2437|m|ft|0[/tpl]) is a mountain located [tpl]convert|19|km|mi|0[/tpl] west of Bragg Creek, Alberta in Kananaskis Country. 
The peak is a popular hiking objective for many within this area. This is due to the relatively easy maintained trail that makes its way to the summit and its close proximately to the major urban area of Calgary. It is not uncommon for a dozen or more people to reach the summit on weekends within the summer months.  
Resembling a resting moose on the horizon, the peak was named Moose Mountain in 1949. A Forestry Service fire lookout exists upon the summit, the third building to have occupied the site for this purpose since the first was built in 1929.
Some scenes in the movie Brokeback Mountain were shot on and around Moose Mountain.[tpl]fact|date=April 2011[/tpl]
Members of the public who summit are requested to respect the privacy of the fire lookout staff. As many as 8000 visitors, local and international, are recorded each season. The lookout staff are responsible for over 5000 square kilometres of forest. The lookout staff detects, maps and reports forest fires to a central location, initiating fire suppression. In consideration of the quantity of visitors and the importance of attentiveness of the staff, it is critical that they not be distracted from their duties.
Members of the public are requested to be conscious of inclement weather, and act accordingly. It is NOT recommended to be above the tree line during pending or active lightning storms. Precaution must be taken in view of the active helicopter landing pad, located on the west side of the summit. (Submitted by a former Moose Mountain Lookout Employee)
