Athens International Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos" ([tpl]lang-el|Διεθνής Αερολιμένας Αθηνών "Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος", Diethnís Aeroliménas Athinón "Elefthérios Venizélos"[/tpl]; [tpl]airport codes|ATH|LGAV[/tpl], began operation on 29 March 2001 and is the primary civilian airport that serves the city of Athens and the region of Attica. The airport is the major hub and base of Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air. The airport serves just under 13 million passengers annually and its name honors the Greek statesman Eleftherios Venizelos. As of late 2011, the airport is the thirtieth busiest airport in Europe.

==Description==

The airport was opened in March 2001 to replace the now-closed Athens (Ellinikon) International Airport. The airport is located between the towns of Markopoulo, Koropi, Spata and Loutsa, about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the east of central Athens ([tpl]convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] by road, due to intervening hills). The airport is named after Elefthérios Venizélos, the prominent Cretan political figure and Prime Minister of Greece, who made an outstanding contribution to the development of Greek aviation and the Hellenic Air Force in the 1930s.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The airport currently has two terminals: the Main Terminal, and the Satellite Terminal accessible by a foot-tunnel from the Main Terminal. As of 2009, a new above ground link to the midfield satellite terminal is under construction with a completion date by the end of 2010.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bates|first=Joe|title=Positive Thinking|journal=Airport World|publisher=Airports Council International - www.aci.aero|volume=14|issue=1|format=PDF|url=http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/Press/ClippingsEn/2009/Airport_World_CEO_Y_Paraschis_Positive_Thinking.pdf[/tpl] Once completed, the complex will be used as a Schengen facility. It has two runways that are each approximately [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long. The airport was developed by public-private partnership with Greece holding 55% of the shares.
The airport is designed to be upgraded over the ensuing years in order to accommodate the increase in air travel, and its upgrades are planned in a six-phase framework. The first (current) phase initially allowed the airport to accommodate 16 million passengers a year, but was upgraded to 21 million passengers a year without progressing to the next phase thanks primarily to IT advances. The sixth phase will allow the airport to accommodate as many as 50 million passengers a year. The current runways are designed to accommodate 50 million passengers a year with the completion of the sixth phase.
The airport has received approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency[tpl]cite press release |title=Athens International Airport: Diversion airport for A380 flight |publisher=Athens International Airport |date=17 October 2007 |url=http://www.aia.gr/entry.asp?pageid=741&tablepageid=12&langid=2&entryID=207 |language= |accessdate=6 February 2008 |quote=On the occasion of the delivery of the first Airbus A380 for commercial services, Athens International Airport (AIA) announces that Airbus, Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas have identified AIA as an en-route alternate airport for an A380 diversion.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219231559/http://www.aia.gr/entry.asp?pageid=741&tablepageid=12&langid=2&entryID=207| archivedate= 19 February 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and the Federal Aviation Administration for take-offs and landings of the biggest passenger jet worldwide, the Airbus A380. The first Airbus A380 to visit 'Eleftherios Venizelos' Athens International Airport made an emergency landing on 13 April 2011 as a passenger suffered a heart attack. The first scheduled A380 flight took place on October 26 from Emirates Airlines.
The Financial crisis of 2007–08 severely reduced traffic at the airport. United Airlines, Thai Airways, Gulf Air, Czech Airlines and Singapore Airlines are among the foreign airlines that ended their services to Athens. Delta Airlines terminated its winter scheduled service to New York City in 2012, leaving Greece without a direct connection to the United States for the first time in almost 70 years.Athens airport: A Greek island. The Economist (2013-06-10). Retrieved on 2013-08-20. In 2013, the airport handled 12,536,038 passengers, 3.2% fewer than in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aia.gr/userfiles/675393df-ab1a-4b77-826c-f3096a3d7f12/Pax_Traffic_DEC2013_EN.pdf |title=Traffic Statistics |publisher=AIA |date= |accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl]
However, 2014 seems to signal a recovery for the airport's passenger traffic. More than ten new airlines started, or are scheduled to start, new flights to and from Athens. AEGEAN Airlines strengthened its destination network by 30% within the last six months and Ryanair established a new base in the Athens Airport. Starting April 1st, Ryanair serves six new destinations and will increase passenger mobility by 25%. Already for the first three months the airport recorded an increase in passenger mobility by 8.4%. Singapore Airlines returns to Athens on June 9th. Similarly, Gulf Air resumes flights on June 16th.http://airlineroute.net/2014/04/11/gf-ath-jun14/http://airlineroute.net/2013/10/02/sq-ath-s14/ Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways increased flights to Athens starting from March.http://airlineroute.net/2014/03/28/ey-ath-jul14/http://airlineroute.net/2014/02/04/qr-ath-s14/http://airlineroute.net/2014/03/03/ek-s14update7/
