Robert J. Woodhead is an entrepreneur, software engineer and former game programmer.  He claims that a common thread in his career is "doing weird things with computers".  Along with Andrew C. Greenberg, he created the Apple II game Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, one of the first role-playing video games written for a personal computer, as well as several of its sequels.[tpl]cite book|last1=DeMaria|first1=Rusel|last2=Wilson|first2=Johnny L.|title=High score!: the illustrated history of electronic games|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC&pg=PA154|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=2003-12-18|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-223172-4|pages=154–155[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nhgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3KUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1754,3384958&dq=robert-woodhead+wizardry&hl=en|title=Small firms find big-time markets|last=Buckler|first=Grant|date=9 March 1985|work=Montral Gazette|accessdate=8 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o0ZWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E-sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4370,6146833&dq=robert-woodhead+wizardry&hl=en|title=Small U.S. game maker caters to global audience|date=24 September 1995|work=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=8 March 2011[/tpl]

Woodhead made a cameo appearance in the 1982 video game Ultima II as an NPC; when the player talked to him he would scream "Copy Protect!", a sarcastic reference to the extensive copy protection methods used in video games of the time.  He also has a screen credit in the film Real Genius as their "Hacking Consultant".
