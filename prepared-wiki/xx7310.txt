Like his father, Downey pursued a career in music, recording in both pop and country styles. He sang on a few records and then began to write songs, several of which were popular in the 1950s and 1960s. He joined ASCAP as a result. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] In 1958, he recorded "Boulevard Of Broken Dreams", which he sang on national television on a set that resembled a dark street with one street light. In 1981, "Green Eyed Girl" charted on the Billboard Magazine country chart, peaking at #95.

He was replaced on KFBK by Rush Limbaugh, who has held the time slot ever since, later via his national syndication. Downey also had a stint on WMAQ-AM in Chicago where he unsuccessfully tried to get other on air radio personalities to submit to drug testing. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Downey's largest effect on American culture came from his popular, yet short-lived, syndicated late 1980s television talk show, The Morton Downey Jr. Show.

On January 22, 1980, Downey, a dedicated anti-abortion activist, hosted the California State Rally for Life at the invitation of the California Pro-Life Council and United Students for Life. At that time, he was also running for President of the United States, as a Democrat.

===Television===

Downey headed to Secaucus, New Jersey, where his highly controversial television program The Morton Downey Jr. Show was taped. Starting as a local program on New York-New Jersey superstation WWOR-TV in the fall of 1987, it expanded into national syndication in early 1988. The program featured screaming matches among Downey, his guests, and audience members. Using a large silver bowl for an ashtray, he would chainsmoke during the show and blow smoke in his guests' faces. Downey's fans became known as "Loudmouths," patterned after the studio lecterns decorated with gaping cartoon mouths, from which Downey's guests would go head-to-head against each other on their respective issues. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Downey's signature phrases "pablum puking liberal" (in reference to left-liberals) and "zip it!" briefly enjoyed some popularity in the contemporary vernacular. He particularly enjoyed making his guests angry with each other, which on a few occasions resulted in physical confrontations. One that occurred on a 1988 show taped at the Apollo Theater, involving Al Sharpton and CORE National Chairman Roy Innis. The exchange between the two men culminated in Innis shoving Sharpton into his chair, knocking him to the floor and Downey intervening to separate the pair. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Because of the controversial format and content of the show, distributor MCA Television had problems selling the show to a number of stations and advertisers. Even Downey's affiliates, many of which were low-rated independent television stations in small to medium markets, were so fearful of advertiser and viewer backlash that they would air one or even two local disclaimers during the broadcast. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
During one controversial episode Downey introduced his gay brother, Tony Downey, to his studio audience and informed them Tony was HIV positive. During the episode Downey stated he was afraid his audience would abandon him if they knew he had a gay brother, but then said he did not care.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099240,00.html|title=His Love for a Brother Brings Morton Downey's Compassion Out of the Closet|publisher=People|date=June 20, 1988|accessdate=2009-10-01[/tpl]
The Washington Post wrote about him, "Suppose a maniac got hold of a talk show. Or need we suppose?" David Letterman said, "I'm always amazed at what people will fall for. We see this every ten or twelve years, an attempt at this, and I guess from that standpoint I don't quite understand why everybody's falling over backwards over the guy.""Shriek! Chic!

===Celebrity, cancellation, and bankruptcy===

The success of the show made Downey a pop culture celebrity, leading to an appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1988,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] WrestleMania V in 1989 in which he traded insults with Roddy Piper and Brother Love on Piper's Pit, and later roles in movies such as Predator 2 and Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation. He was also cast in several television roles, often playing tabloid TV hosts or other obnoxious media types.
In 1988, Downey recorded an album of songs based on his show, entitled Morton Downey Jr. Sings (released in 1989).[tpl]cite web|title=Morton Downey Jr. Sings|url=http://www.amazon.com/Morton-Downey-Jr-Sings/dp/B0007Z2SKS|work=Amazon.com Music Listings|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=23 August 2011[/tpl] The album's only single, "Zip It!" (a catch-phrase from the TV show, used to quiet an irate guest), became a surprise hit on some college radio stations. Over the course of the 1988–89 television season, his TV show suffered a decline in viewership, resulting from many markets downgrading its time slot; even flagship station WWOR moved Downey's program from its original 9:00 PM slot to 11:30 PM in the fall of 1988. Beginning in January 1989, the time slot immediately following Downey's program was given to the then-new Arsenio Hall Show. However, following Hall's strong early ratings, the two series swapped time slots several weeks later, thus relegating Downey to 12:30 AM in the number-one television market. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In late April 1989, he was involved in an incident in a San Francisco International Airport restroom in which he claimed to have been attacked by neo-Nazis who painted a swastika on his face and attempted to shave his head.[tpl]cite news|title=TV Host Takes a Beating|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/43987/TV-HOST-TAKES-A-BEATING.html|accessdate=23 August 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=26 April 1989[/tpl] Some inconsistencies in Downey's account (e.g., the swastika was painted in reverse, suggesting that Downey had drawn it himself in a mirror), and the failure of the police to find supportive evidence,[tpl]cite news|title=Attacked or Not?|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/45045/ATTACKED-OR-NOT.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Deseret news|date=May 3, 1989[/tpl] led many to suspect the incident was a hoax and a plea for attention.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-412459.html|title='Mort the Mouth' Downey Jr. Dies; 'Trash TV' Talk-Show Host's Draw Was Shocking, Mocking|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March   14, 2001|accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl] In July 1989, his show was cancelled, with the owners of the show announcing that the last show had been taped on June 30, and that no new shows would air after September 15, 1989.[tpl]cite web|title=Morton Downey Jr. Show is History|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/56373/MORTON-DOWNEY-JR-SHOW-IS-HISTORY.html|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News|accessdate=August 23, 2011|date=July 23, 1989[/tpl] 
At the time of its cancellation, the show was airing on a total of 30 stations across the country (including WPHL in Philadelphia), and its advertisers had been reduced primarily to "direct-response" ads (such as 900 chat line and phone sex numbers).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/20/arts/downey-show-canceled.html|work=The New York Times|first=Jeremy|last=Gerard|title=Downey Show Canceled|date=July 20, 1989[/tpl] In February 1990, Downey filed for bankruptcy in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.[tpl]cite news|title=Downey Wants Protection from Creditors|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/88157/DOWNEY-WANTS-PROTECTION-FROM-CREDITORS.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=February 22, 1989[/tpl]
