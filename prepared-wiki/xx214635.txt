Garry's Mod (often abbreviated as GMod) is a sandbox physics game using a modified Source engine, created by Garry Newman. Garry's Mod has been available on Valve's content delivery service  Steam since November 29, 2006.[tpl]cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/ | title = Garry's Mod | accessdate = 2010-06-24 | work = Steam | publisher = Valve Corporation[/tpl] Purchase of Garry's Mod requires the user to own at least one game on Steam based on the Source engine, such as Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Portal, or Team Fortress 2. It is also commonly used for the creation and publishing of videos[tpl]cite web|url=http://garrysmod.com/post/11950913377/garrys-mod-on-youtube|title=Garrys Mod on youtube|accessdate=2012-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moddb.com/games/garrys-mod-10/videos|title=Garrys Mod|accessdate=2008-06-16|publisher=ModDB[/tpl] on YouTube, mainly from Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. Garry's Mod was originally a modification for Valve's Half-Life 2, but was later made into a standalone Steam game that was officially released on November 29, 2006 dubbed Garry's Mod 10. The current version, Garry's Mod 13, was released October 24, 2012. In February 2014 it was revealed on Twitter by Newman that the game had "just broke" US$ 30 million.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/436914610340646912|title=Just broke|last=Newman|first=Garry|date=21 February 2014|publisher=twitter.com|accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl] As of November 2013 the game has sold 3.5 million copies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/11/25/garry-on-garrys-mods-endlessly-rising-sales-figures/|title=Garry On Garry’s Mod’s Endlessly Rising Sales Figures|last=Smith|first=Graham|date=25 November 2013|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=25 November 2013[/tpl]

==Gameplay==

Although Garry's Mod is usually considered to be a full game, it has no game objective and players can use the game's set of tools for any purpose whatsoever, although sometimes when playing on a multiplayer server it may have role-play or other types of game modes. Garry's Mod allows players to manipulate items, furniture and "props" – various objects that players can place in-game. Props can be selected from any installed Source engine game or from a community created collection. The game features two "guns" – Physics Gun and Tool Gun for manipulating objects. The Physics Gun allows objects to be picked up, adjusted, and frozen in place. The Tool Gun is a multi-purpose tool for performing various tasks, such as combining props, attaching them via ropes, and creating controllable winches and wheels. The Tool Gun is also used to control add-ons created by the community.
Another popular Garry's Mod concept is ragdoll posing. The player can instantiate a ragdoll model from a Source game and pose it using a variety of tools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.garrysmod.com/?title=Ragdoll_Posing|title=Ragdoll Posing – GMod Wiki|accessdate=2010-05-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] This is a popular tool for making fan-made videos and machinimas.
Garry's Mod takes advantage of the Source engine's modified version of the Havok Physics Engine,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.havok.com/index.php?page=available-games|title=List of Available Games|accessdate=2010-05-05[/tpl] which allows players to build contraptions that follow the laws of physics.

===Multiplayer===

Garry's Mod supports multiplayer gameplay on dedicated game servers. These servers are operated by the community and some servers earn a profit from having additional VIP features. Players can build contraptions together and communicate via text or voice.
Garry's Mod servers run many game modes, most of which are user-created modifications.  Some of the more popular modes include: Roleplay (RP) where players take on a specific role in the server's society, where players role-play in a city-like society and Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), which involves a group of terrorists (Innocents) (this can also include a group of detectives, who have special tools aid in finding traitors) with another, smaller group of traitors within them, whose goal is to kill all of the Innocents; as well as several zombie survival mods. There are also Deathrun servers where the "Death" players trigger traps to try and kill the other players that are trying to get to the end of the level, which is usually an obstacle course, of sorts.

==User-created content==

Garry's Mod features a wide range of mods and addons that can be created using Garry's Mod[tpl]'[/tpl]s implementation of the Lua scripting language, which allows users to create their own weapons, entities, game modes, and other modifications.
There are many examples of features created by Garry's Mod[tpl]'[/tpl]s addons. Game rules and features can also be modified to suit a particular game mode or genre. Players can create their own weapons, ranging from melee weapons, to firearms, to indirect weapons, such as airstrikes. Weapon models and skins can be reused from either existing Source engine games or from the community created list. Players can create "scripted entities" and "scripted tools" that can interact with the player directly in-game or allow manipulating objects from in-game menu, respectively. Players can also create scripts for non-player characters in Lua.
Different models, skins, and maps can be added to the game. Multiplayer game servers will automatically attempt to send any custom content to the client when they connect.[tpl]cite web | url = http://wiki.garrysmod.com/?title=Resource.AddFile  | title = Garry's  Mod Lua Wiki –  Resource.AddFile | publisher = Team Garry | date = October 2008 |  accessdate = 2008-10-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Fretta contest===

In winter 2009/2010, a contest was held for Garry's Mod by the game's developers to create the best new game mode using a programming framework called "Fretta".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.halflife2.net/2009/12/01/garry's-mod-fretta-gamemode-contest/|title=Garry’s Mod – Fretta Game mode Contest|accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Fretta, Italian for "hurry", allows developers to quickly and easily create new game modes for Garry's Mod with commonly required functionality already implemented so the developers can focus on unique aspects of their game modes. Fretta was inspired by a similar fan created framework "Rambo_6's Simple Gamemode Base". However, for inclusion in Garry's Mod, Newman decided to rewrite it with input and contributions from the original author and other developers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garrysmod.com/?dont_buff_my_pylon=1394|title=Fretta Gamemode Base|accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl] The winners of the contest range from a recreation of the Mafia party game to an aerial combat game mode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://frettacontest.facepunchstudios.com/|title=Fretta Contest Winners (2)|accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] The contest winners have been included in Garry's Mod with their own Steam Achievements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garry.tv/?p=1773|title=Fretta Contest Winners|accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Three of the winning games have been shipped, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Dogfight Arcade, and Prop Hunt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garrysmod.com/news/?p=11779|title=Two of the game modes are being shipped.|accessdate=2010-08-03[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Toybox===

On September 7, 2010, Newman added a feature called the "Toybox" to Garry's Mod.[tpl]cite web|url=http://garrysmod.com/history|title=History of Garry’s Mod|accessdate=2012-02-26[/tpl] It utilizes the Amazon S3 service to download third party content, such as weapons, props, maps, game modes or models, directly to the users' machine while in game. In an interview with GMod news, Garry Newman said that "One of GMod's biggest draws is the amount of third party content. I want to make it easier for people to utilize that. I really want to move away from having to download files from websites and drag them to folders, that’s old school. So that’s what I’m heading towards. Maps, models, saved games etc., all saved on the cloud and accessible with a click. Everything should be accessible from in-game. If it isn’t, I’ve failed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://gmodnews.com/?p=200|title=Interview with Garry Newman – Information about the future of ToyBox, GMod and more|accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The Toybox was shortly removed, and has been replaced with the Steam Workshop in versions 13 and up. As of February 2014 there are now over 245,000 mods on the Steam Workshop for Garry's Mod and counting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop|title=Steam Workshop|accessdate=2014-02-22[/tpl]
