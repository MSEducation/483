Hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure, sometimes called arterial hypertension, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. Blood pressure is summarised by two measurements, systolic and diastolic, which depend on whether the heart muscle is contracting (systole) or relaxed between beats (diastole). This equals the maximum and minimum pressure, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140mmHg systolic (top reading) and 60–90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said to be present if it is often at or above 140/90 mmHg.
Hypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; about 90–95% of cases are categorized as "primary hypertension" which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical cause.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carretero OA, Oparil S |title=Essential hypertension. Part I: definition and etiology |journal=Circulation |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=329–35 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10645931 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/3/329.long |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.101.3.329[/tpl] The remaining 5–10% of cases (secondary hypertension) are caused by other conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system.
Hypertension puts strain on the heart, leading to hypertensive heart disease and coronary artery disease if not treated. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for stroke, aneurysms of the arteries (e.g. aortic aneurysm), peripheral arterial disease and is a cause of chronic kidney disease. A moderately high arterial blood pressure is associated with a shortened life expectancy while mild elevation is not. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure control and decrease the risk of health complications, although drug treatment is still often necessary in people for whom lifestyle changes are not enough or not effective.

==Signs and symptoms==

Hypertension is rarely accompanied by any symptoms, and its identification is usually through screening, or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem. A proportion of people with high blood pressure report headaches (particularly at the back of the head and in the morning), as well as lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or fainting episodes.[tpl]cite book |author=Fisher ND, Williams GH |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, et al. |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=1463–81 |chapter=Hypertensive vascular disease[/tpl] These symptoms, however, might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself.
On physical examination, hypertension may be suspected on the basis of the presence of hypertensive retinopathy detected by examination of the optic fundus found in the back of the eye using ophthalmoscopy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wong T, Mitchell P |title=The eye in hypertension |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=425–35 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17276782 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60198-6[/tpl] Classically, the severity of the hypertensive retinopathy changes is graded from grade I–IV, although the milder types may be difficult to distinguish from each other. Ophthalmoscopy findings may also give some indication as to how long a person has been hypertensive.

===Secondary hypertension===

Some additional signs and symptoms may suggest secondary hypertension, i.e. hypertension due to an identifiable cause such as kidney diseases or endocrine diseases. For example, truncal obesity, glucose intolerance, moon face, a "buffalo hump" and purple stretch marks suggest Cushing's syndrome.[tpl]cite book |author=O'Brien, Eoin; Beevers, D. G.; Lip, Gregory Y. H. |title=ABC of hypertension |publisher=BMJ Books |location=London |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4051-3061-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] Thyroid disease and acromegaly can also cause hypertension and have characteristic symptoms and signs. An abdominal bruit may be an indicator of renal artery stenosis (a narrowing of the arteries supplying the kidneys), while decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities and/or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses may indicate aortic coarctation (a narrowing of the aorta shortly after it leaves the heart). Labile or paroxysmal hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pallor, and perspiration should prompt suspicions of pheochromocytoma.

===Hypertensive crisis===

Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110—sometimes termed malignant or accelerated hypertension) is referred to as a "hypertensive crisis", as blood pressure at this level confers a high risk of complications. People with blood pressures in this range may have no symptoms, but are more likely to report headaches (22% of cases)[tpl]cite journal |author=Papadopoulos DP, Mourouzis I, Thomopoulos C, Makris T, Papademetriou V |title=Hypertension crisis |journal=Blood Press. |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=328–36 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20504242 |doi=10.3109/08037051.2010.488052 |url=[/tpl] and dizziness than the general population. Other symptoms accompanying a hypertensive crisis may include visual deterioration or breathlessness due to heart failure or a general feeling of malaise due to renal failure. Most people with a hypertensive crisis are known to have elevated blood pressure, but additional triggers may have led to a sudden rise.[tpl]cite journal |author=Marik PE, Varon J |title=Hypertensive crises: challenges and management |journal=Chest |volume=131 |issue=6 |pages=1949–62 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17565029 |doi=10.1378/chest.06-2490 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/131/6/1949.long[/tpl]
A "hypertensive emergency", previously "malignant hypertension", is diagnosed when there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs as a result of the severely elevated blood pressure. This may include hypertensive encephalopathy, caused by brain swelling and dysfunction, and characterized by headaches and an altered level of consciousness (confusion or drowsiness). Retinal papilloedema and/or fundal hemorrhages and exudates are another sign of target organ damage. Chest pain may indicate heart muscle damage (which may progress to myocardial infarction) or sometimes aortic dissection, the tearing of the inner wall of the aorta. Breathlessness, cough, and the expectoration of blood-stained sputum are characteristic signs of pulmonary edema, the swelling of lung tissue due to left ventricular failure an inability of the left ventricle of the heart to adequately pump blood from the lungs into the arterial system. Rapid deterioration of kidney function (acute kidney injury) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of blood cells) may also occur. In these situations, rapid reduction of the blood pressure is mandated to stop ongoing organ damage. In contrast there is no evidence that blood pressure needs to be lowered rapidly in hypertensive urgencies where there is no evidence of target organ damage and over aggressive reduction of blood pressure is not without risks. Use of oral medications to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48h is advocated in hypertensive urgencies.

===Pregnancy===

Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies. Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy.[tpl]cite book|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071748896|year=2o11|pages=55–61|edition=18th[/tpl] Most women with hypertension in pregnancy have pre-existing primary hypertension, but high blood pressure in pregnancy may be the first sign of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and puerperium. Pre-eclampsia is characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal deaths globally. Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of perinatal mortality. Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often "flashing lights"), vomiting, epigastric pain, and edema. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss, cerebral edema, seizures or convulsions, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a blood clotting disorder).[tpl]cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/261435-overview |title=Hypertension and Pregnancy |author=Gibson, Paul |coauthors= |date=July 30, 2009 |work=eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |publisher=Medscape |pages= |accessdate=16 June 2009[/tpl]

===Children===

Failure to thrive, seizures, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty breathing[tpl]cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/889877-overview |title=Hypertension |author=Rodriguez-Cruz, Edwin |coauthors=Ettinger, Leigh M |date=April 6, 2010 |work=eMedicine Pediatrics: Cardiac Disease and Critical Care Medicine |publisher=Medscape |pages= |accessdate=16 June 2009[/tpl] can be associated with hypertension in neonates and young infants. In older infants and children, hypertension can cause headache, unexplained irritability, fatigue, failure to thrive, blurred vision, nosebleeds, and facial paralysis.

==Cause==

===Primary hypertension===

Primary (essential) hypertension is the most common form of hypertension, accounting for 90–95% of all cases of hypertension. In almost all contemporary societies, blood pressure rises with aging and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is considerable.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vasan|first=RS|coauthors=Beiser, A, Seshadri, S, Larson, MG, Kannel, WB, D'Agostino, RB, Levy, D|title=Residual lifetime risk for developing hypertension in middle-aged women and men: The Framingham Heart Study|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2002-02-27|volume=287|issue=8|pages=1003–10|pmid=11866648|doi=10.1001/jama.287.8.1003[/tpl] Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors.

===Secondary hypertension===

Secondary hypertension results from an identifiable cause. Renal disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension. Hypertension can also be caused by endocrine conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, Conn's syndrome or hyperaldosteronism, hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma.[tpl]cite book|author=Dluhy RG, Williams GH eds|title=Williams textbook of endocrinology|year=1998|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia ; Montreal|isbn=0721661521|edition=9th|chapter=Endocrine hypertension|editor=Wilson JD, Foster DW, Kronenberg HM|pages=729–49[/tpl] Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta, excessive liquorice consumption and certain prescription medicines, herbal remedies and illegal drugs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Grossman E, Messerli FH |title=Drug-induced Hypertension: An Unappreciated Cause of Secondary Hypertension |journal=Am.

==Pathophysiology==

In most people with established essential (primary) hypertension, increased resistance to blood flow (total peripheral resistance) accounts for the high pressure while cardiac output remains normal.[tpl]cite journal |author=Conway J |title=Hemodynamic aspects of essential hypertension in humans |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=617–60 |date=April 1984 |pmid=6369352 |doi= |url=[/tpl] There is evidence that some younger people with prehypertension or 'borderline hypertension' have high cardiac output, an elevated heart rate and normal peripheral resistance, termed hyperkinetic borderline hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |author=Palatini P, Julius S |title=The role of cardiac autonomic function in hypertension and cardiovascular disease |journal=Curr. Hypertens. Rep. |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=199–205 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19442329 |doi= 10.1007/s11906-009-0035-4|url=[/tpl] These individuals develop the typical features of established essential hypertension in later life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance rises with age. Whether this pattern is typical of all people who ultimately develop hypertension is disputed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Andersson OK, Lingman M, Himmelmann A, Sivertsson R, Widgren BR |title=Prediction of future hypertension by casual blood pressure or invasive hemodynamics?

Rev. |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=347–504 |date=April 1982 |pmid=6461865 |doi= |url=[/tpl] although a reduction in the number or density of capillaries may also contribute.[tpl]cite journal |author=Struijker Boudier HA, le Noble JL, Messing MW, Huijberts MS, le Noble FA, van Essen H |title=The microcirculation and hypertension |journal=J Hypertens Suppl |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=S147–56 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1291649 |doi= |url=[/tpl] Hypertension is also associated with decreased peripheral venous compliance[tpl]cite journal |author=Safar ME, London GM |title=Arterial and venous compliance in sustained essential hypertension |journal=Hypertension |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=133–9 |date=August 1987 |pmid=3301662 |doi= 10.1161/01.HYP.10.2.133|url=[/tpl] which may increase venous return, increase cardiac preload and, ultimately, cause diastolic dysfunction. Whether increased active vasoconstriction plays a role in established essential hypertension is unclear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Schiffrin EL |title=Reactivity of small blood vessels in hypertension: relation with structural changes.

Pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) is frequently increased in older people with hypertension. This can mean that systolic pressure is abnormally high, but diastolic pressure may be normal or low — a condition termed isolated systolic hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chobanian AV |title=Clinical practice. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly |journal=N. Engl. J.

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rise in peripheral resistance in hypertension. Most evidence implicates either disturbances in renal salt and water handling (particularly abnormalities in the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system)[tpl]cite journal |author=Navar LG |title=Counterpoint: Activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is the dominant contributor to systemic hypertension |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=1998–2000; discussion 2015 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21148349 |pmc=3006411 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00182.2010a |url=[/tpl] and/or abnormalities of the sympathetic nervous system.[tpl]cite journal |author=Esler M, Lambert E, Schlaich M |title=Point: Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system is the dominant contributor to systemic hypertension |journal=J.

It has also been suggested that endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation may also contribute to increased peripheral resistance and vascular damage in hypertension.[tpl]cite journal |author=Versari D, Daghini E, Virdis A, Ghiadoni L, Taddei S |title=Endothelium-dependent contractions and endothelial dysfunction in human hypertension |journal=Br.

==Diagnosis==

Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of a persistent high blood pressure. Traditionally, this requires three separate sphygmomanometer measurements at one monthly intervals.[tpl]cite book| author=North of England Hypertension Guideline Development Group |chapter=Frequency of measurements |page=53| title=Essential hypertension (NICE CG18) |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |date=1 August 2004 |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/index.jsp?action=download&o=48384 |accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] Initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete history and physical examination. With the availability of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitors and home blood pressure machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have white coat hypertension has led to a change in protocols. In the United Kingdom, current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or less ideally with home blood pressure monitoring over the course of 7 days.[tpl]cite book |author=National Clinical Guideline Centre |title=Hypertension (NICE CG 127) |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |chapter=7 Diagnosis of Hypertension, 7.5 Link from evidence to recommendations |page=102 |date=August 2011|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf |accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] Pseudohypertension in the elderly or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration. This condition is believed to be due to calcification of the arteries resulting in abnormally high blood pressure readings with a blood pressure cuff while intra arterial measurements of blood pressure are normal.[tpl]cite journal|last=Franklin|first=SS|coauthors=Wilkinson, IB; McEniery, CM|title=Unusual hypertensive phenotypes: what is their significance?|journal=Hypertension|date=February 2012|volume=59|issue=2|pages=173–8|pmid=22184330|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.182956[/tpl]
Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, physicians will attempt to identify the underlying cause based on risk factors and other symptoms, if present. Secondary hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by renal disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.[tpl]cite journal | author = Luma GB, Spiotta RT | title = Hypertension in children and adolescents | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 1558–68 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16719248[/tpl] Laboratory tests can also be performed to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and to determine whether hypertension has caused damage to the heart, eyes, and kidneys. Additional tests for diabetes and high cholesterol levels are usually performed because these conditions are additional risk factors for the development of heart disease and may require treatment.
Serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension. Serum creatinine alone may overestimate glomerular filtration rate and recent guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). eGFR can also provides a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain antihypertensive drugs on kidney function. Additionally, testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure. It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricular hypertrophy) or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack. A chest X-ray or an echocardiogram may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart.

In people aged 18 years or older hypertension is defined as a systolic and/or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value (currently 139 mmHg systolic, 89 mmHg diastolic: see table —Classification (JNC7)). Lower thresholds are used (135 mmHg systolic or 85 mmHg diastolic) if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring.[tpl]cite book |author=National Clinical Guidance Centre |title=Hypertension (NICE CG 127) |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |chapter=7 Diagnosis of Hypertension, 7.5 Link from evidence to recommendations |page=102 |date=August 2011|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56007/56007.pdf |accessdate=22 December 2011[/tpl] Recent international hypertension guidelines have also created categories below the hypertensive range to indicate a continuum of risk with higher blood pressures in the normal range. JNC7 (2003) uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120-139 mmHg systolic and/or 80-89 mmHg diastolic, while ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007)[tpl]cite journal |author=Mancia G |title=2007 ESH-ESC Practice Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension: ESH-ESC Task Force on the Management of Arterial Hypertension |journal=J.

Hypertension is also sub-classified: JNC7 distinguishes hypertension stage I, hypertension stage II, and isolated systolic hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension refers to elevated systolic pressure with normal diastolic pressure and is common in the elderly. The ESH-ESC Guidelines (2007) and BHS IV (2004), additionally define a third stage (stage III hypertension) for people with systolic blood pressure exceeding 179 mmHg or a diastolic pressure over 109 mmHg.
Hypertension is classified as "resistant" if medications do not reduce blood pressure to normal levels.

===Children===

Hypertension in neonates is rare, occurring in around 0.2 to 3% of neonates, and blood pressure is not measured routinely in the healthy newborn.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dionne JM, Abitbol CL, Flynn JT|title=Hypertension in infancy: diagnosis, management and outcome |journal=Pediatr. Nephrol. |volume=27 |issue=1|pages=17–32 |date=January 2012 |pmid=21258818 |doi=10.1007/s00467-010-1755-z |url=[/tpl] Hypertension is more common in high risk newborns. A variety of factors, such as gestational age, postconceptional age and birth weight needs to be taken into account when deciding if a blood pressure is normal in a neonate.
Hypertension occurs quite commonly in children over the age of 3 years and adolescents (2-9% depending on age, sex and ethnicity)[tpl]cite journal |author=Din-Dzietham R, Liu Y, Bielo MV, Shamsa F |title=High blood pressure trends in children and adolescents in national surveys, 1963 to 2002 |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=13 |pages=1488–96 |date=September 2007|pmid=17846287 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.683243 |url=[/tpl] and is associated with long term risks of ill-health.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=The fourth report on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in children and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=2 Suppl 4th Report |pages=555–76|date=August 2004 |pmid=15286277 |doi= 10.1542/peds.114.2.S2.555|url= |author1= National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents[/tpl] Blood pressure rises with age in childhood and, in children, hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure on three or more occasions equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child. High blood pressure must be confirmed on repeated visits however before characterizing a child as having hypertension. Prehypertension in children has been defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure that is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile. In adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults.
The value of routine screening for hypertension in children over the age of 3 years is debated.[tpl]cite journal|last=Chiolero|first=A|coauthors=Bovet, P; Paradis, G|title=Screening for elevated blood pressure in children and adolescents: a critical appraisal.|journal=JAMA pediatrics|date=2013 Mar 1|volume=167|issue=3|pages=266-73|pmid=23303490[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Daniels |first1=SR. |last2=Gidding |first2=SS. |title=Blood pressure screening in children and adolescents: is the glass half empty or more than half full? |journal=JAMA Pediatr |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=302–4 |date=Mar 2013 | doi = 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.439 |pmid=23303514[/tpl] In 2004 the National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommended that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at

==Prevention==

Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labelled as hypertensive. Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive drug therapy. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure, before starting drug therapy. The 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines proposed the following lifestyle changes consistent with those outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002[tpl]cite journal | author = Whelton PK | year = 2002 | title = Primary prevention of hypertension. Clinical and public health advisory from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 288 | issue = 15| pages = 1882–1888 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.15.1882 | pmid = 12377087 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = He | first2 = J | last3 = Appel | first3 = LJ | last4 = Cutler | first4 = JA | last5 = Havas | first5 = S | last6 = Kotchen | first6 = TA | last7 = Roccella | first7 = EJ | last8 = Stout | first8 = R | last9 = Vallbona | first9 = C | first10 = MC | first11 = J [/tpl] for the primary prevention of hypertension:
Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much an individual antihypertensive drug. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.

==Management==

===Lifestyle modifications===

The first line of treatment for hypertension is identical to the recommended preventive lifestyle changes[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/prescribing_practice_review/current/prescribing_practice_review_52 |title=NPS Prescribing Practice Review 52: Treating hypertension |date=September 1, 2010 |publisher=NPS Medicines Wise |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] and includes dietary changes,[tpl]cite journal|last=Siebenhofer|first=A|coauthors=Jeitler, K, Berghold, A, Waltering, A, Hemkens, LG, Semlitsch, T, Pachler, C, Strametz, R, Horvath, K|title=Long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in hypertensive patients|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2011-09-07|volume=9|pages=CD008274|pmid=21901719|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008274.pub2|editor1-last=Siebenhofer|editor1-first=Andrea|issue=9[/tpl] physical exercise, and weight loss. These have all been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension. Their potential effectiveness is similar to using a single medication. If hypertension is high enough to justify immediate use of medications, lifestyle changes are still recommended in conjunction with medication.
Dietary change such as a low sodium diet is beneficial. A long term (more than 4 weeks) low sodium diet is effective in reducing blood pressure, both in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal|last=He|first=FJ|coauthors=MacGregor, GA|title=Effect of longer-term modest salt reduction on blood pressure|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2004|issue=3|pages=CD004937|pmid=15266549|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004937/frame.html|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004937|editor1-last=MacGregor|editor1-first=Graham A[/tpl] Also, the DASH diet, a diet rich in nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits and vegetables lowers blood pressure. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium, although the diet is also rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, as well as protein.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf|title=Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH|format=PDF|accessdate=8 June 2009[/tpl] Some programs aimed to reduce psychological stress such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be reasonable add-ons to other treatment to reduce hypertension. However several techniques such as yoga, relaxation and other forms of meditation do not appear to reduce blood pressure,[tpl]cite journal|last=Brook|first=RD|coauthors=Appel, LJ; Rubenfire, M; Ogedegbe, G; Bisognano, JD; Elliott, WJ; Fuchs, FD; Hughes, JW; Lackland, DT; Staffileno, BA; Townsend, RR; Rajagopalan, S; American Heart Association Professional Education Committee of the Council for High Blood Pressure Research, Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and Council on Nutrition, Physical, Activity|title=Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association.|journal=Hypertension|date=Jun 2013|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1360–83|pmid=23608661|doi=10.1161/HYP.0b013e318293645f[/tpl] and, of the techniques with supportive evidence, there is limited information on whether the modest reduction in blood pressure results in prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Several exercise regimes—including isometric resistance exercise, dynamic aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance exercise and device-guided breathing—may be useful in reducing blood pressure.

===Medications===

Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive drugs, are currently available for treating hypertension. Use should take into account the person's cardiovascular risk (including risk of myocardial infarction and stroke) as well as blood pressure readings, in order to gain a more accurate picture of the person's cardiovascular profile.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/108/12 |title=Drug treatment of elevated blood pressure |author=Nelson, Mark |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=108–112 |accessdate=11 August 2010[/tpl] Evidence in those with mild hypertension (SBP less than 160 mmHg and /or DBP less than 100 mmHg) and no other health problems does not support a reduction in the risk of death or rate of health complications from medication treatment.[tpl]cite journal | last = Diao | first = Diana | coauthors = Wright JM, Cundiff DK, Gueyffier F | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | title = Pharmacotherapy for mild hypertension | year = 2012 | id = CD006742 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006742.pub2 | issue = 8 [/tpl] Medications are not recommended for people with prehypertension or high normal blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Giuseppe|first=Mancia|title=2013 ESH/ESC Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)|journal=European heart journal|date=July 2013|volume=34|issue=28|pages=2159–219|pmid=23771844|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/eht151|first2=R|last3=Narkiewicz|first3=K|last4=Redon|first4=J|last5=Zanchetti|first5=A|last6=Bohm|first6=M|last7=Christiaens|first7=T|last8=Cifkova|first8=R|last9=De Backer|first9=G|last10=Dominiczak|first10=A|last11=Galderisi|first11=M|last12=Grobbee|first12=DE|last13=Jaarsma|first13=T|last14=Kirchhof|first14=P|last15=Kjeldsen|first15=SE|last16=Laurent|first16=S|last17=Manolis|first17=AJ|last18=Nilsson|first18=PM|last19=Ruilope|first19=LM|last20=Schmieder|first20=RE|last21=Sirnes|first21=PA|last22=Sleight|first22=P|last23=Viigimaa|first23=M|last24=Waeber|first24=B|last25=Zannad|first25=F|last26=Redon|first26=J|last27=Dominiczak|first27=A|last28=Narkiewicz|first28=K|last29=Nilsson|first29=PM|last30=Burnier|first30=M|last2=Fagard|display-authors=29[/tpl]
If drug treatment is initiated the Joint National Committee on High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) recommends that the physician not only monitor for response to treatment but should also assess for any side effects resulting from the medication. Reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischaemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Law M, Wald N, Morris J |title=Lowering blood pressure to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke: a new preventive strategy |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=7 |issue=31 |pages=1–94 |year=2003 |pmid=14604498 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon731.pdf[/tpl] For most people, recommendations are to reduce blood pressure to less than or equal to somewhere between 140/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg.

In Japan starting with any one of six classes of medications including: CCB, ACEI/ARB, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, and alpha-blockers is deemed reasonable, while in Canada and Europe all of these but alpha-blockers are recommended as options.

====Drug combinations====

The majority of people require more than one drug to control their hypertension. In those with a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg the American Heart Association recommends starting both a thiazide and an ACEI, ARB or CCB. An ACEI and CCB combination can be used as well.
Unacceptable combinations are non-dihydropyridine calcium blockers (such as verapamil or diltiazem) and beta-blockers, dual renin–angiotensin system blockade (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor + angiotensin receptor blocker), renin–angiotensin system blockers and beta-blockers, beta-blockers and centrally acting agents.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sever PS, Messerli FH |title=Hypertension management 2011: optimal combination therapy |journal=Eur.
