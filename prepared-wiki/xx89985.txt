[[Epicycloid]]

CATEGORIES: Curves, Algebraic curves

In geometry, an epicycloid is a plane curve produced by tracing the path of a chosen point of a circle — called an epicycle — which rolls without slipping around a fixed circle. It is a particular kind of roulette.
If the smaller circle has radius r, and the larger circle has radius R = kr, then the
parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:
or:
If k is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has k cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not
differentiable).
If k is a rational number, say k=p/q expressed in simplest terms, then the curve has p cusps.
If k is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and forms a dense subset of the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius R + 2r.

The epicycloid is a special kind of epitrochoid.
An epicycle with one cusp is a cardioid.
An epicycloid and its evolute are similar.http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EpicycloidEvolute.html

==Proof==

Since there is no sliding between the two cycles, then we have that
By the definition of radian (which is the rate arc over radius), then we have that
From these two conditions, we get the identity
