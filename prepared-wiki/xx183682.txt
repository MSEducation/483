Mafia is the debut studio album by Romanian hip hop group B.U.G. Mafia, released September 20, 1995 on local Bucharest-based label Amma Sound. Production for the album was handled by group member and founder Tataee, with various composers and keyboardists giving co-production.  Heavily influenced by N.W.A. and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, the album has been viewed as the pioneering record of gangsta rap in Romania. With its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics, it helped to give birth to this then-new genre of music in Romania. As hip hop music was quite new in Romania at the time, the album attracted many rock fans, who appreciated the group's aggressive approach towards music.

In spite of poor sound quality and practically no professional promotion, Mafia achieved moderate success and quite favorable reviews. The album is still known for being the third hip hop album to be released in Romania by a record label. It had 15 tracks and featured guest performances from M&G, Marijuana, Coco, Vlad "Ben" Bl√¢ndu and actress Rona Hartner. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bugmafiaoficial.ro/discografie|title=B.U.G.
