[[Atlanta annexations and wards]]

CATEGORIES: History of Atlanta, Georgia, Government of Atlanta, Georgia, Geography of Atlanta, Georgia

From its incorporation in 1847, the municipal boundaries Atlanta, Georgia were extended repeatedly from a small area around its railroad station to today's city covering [tpl]Convert|131.7|mi2|km2[/tpl]. 
Prior to 1954, Atlanta was divided into political divisions called wards. The number of wards grew as the city grew.

==List of annexations==

==1847==

City is incorporated — city limits are a [tpl]convert|1|mi|adj=on[/tpl] radius from the zero mile marker of the Western & Atlantic Railroad. City covers [tpl]convert|3.14|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|2010.6|acre[/tpl].

==1854==

The 1848 charter only specified election of six city-wide councilmembers, but on January 9, 1854, an ordinance was adopted that divided the town into five wards and two councilmen from each ward would be elected to coincide with the completion of the first official city hall.
The next election with the new rules on January 15, 1855, decided those first Ward bosses who would serve with the short-term mayor, Allison Nelson.
The boundaries were as follows:

==1866==

On March 12, city limits expand to a one-and-a-half mile radius from Union Depot.City of Atlanta GIS, Map of Annexations"March 12", This Day in Georgia History, Digital Library of Georgia

==1871==

During a huge boom of post-war building, two new wards were added from parts of the First, Fourth and Fifth to reflect the changing look of the city. 

==1874==

A new city charter was approved by Governor Smith on February 28, 1874, which reduced the number of wards back to five and created a bi-cameral council of two councilmen from each ward and a second body of three at-large aldermen was established.
Each year one of the aldermen would be up for election and during his last year in office would serve as president of the other body.
They acted separately on finances but together for all other business.
The new ward layout was as follows:

==1883==

On November 5, 1883 a Sixth Ward (beige) was carved out of the Fourth and Fifth Wards.
Its boundaries started at Butler and the GRR (today's Grady Hospital) north to North Ave at Myrtle St, then up Myrtle to the city limit at 3rd St.
Follow the arc of the city limit to Williams, south to Cain (International) then James (Church) to Forsyth south to the tracks then east on the tracks to origin.
This separated the wealthy Peachtree corridor from the other parts of north Atlanta. (Garrett Vol II, p. 53–54)

==1889==

Expansion of city limits to one and three-quarters radius from union depot.

==1894==

When West End was annexed into the city in 1894, it became a new Seventh Ward.

==1904==

[tpl]convert|822|acre|ha[/tpl] annexed - the southern part of what is now Midtown was already within the 1889 limits, but in 1904 the city annexes most of the rest of what is now Midtown: this is an area bounded by the 1889 circular city limits on the south, and West Peachtree St. on the west, stretching north up to but not including Ansley Park (roughly 6th to 16th Streets), Piedmont Park, the remainder of Historic Midtown east to what is now the BeltLine. this includes a strip of what is now the Old Fourth Ward between the 1889 limits and the BeltLine.City of Atlanta annexation database, Case ANX-1904-001

==1905==

Further expansion of the city limits was part of a long effort.
In October 1897 Frank P. Rice drove a failed proposal to annex Pittsburgh, Reynoldstown, Bellwood, and what was then called "north Atlanta".will not be annexed now: The Rice measure tabled by Council yesterday afternoon", Atlanta Constitution, October 27, 1897John R. Hornady, "Atlanta yesterday, today and tomorrow", 1922
"North Atlanta" was defined at the time roughly as today's Midtown, Georgia Tech, and English Avenue:Folks Hot After Rice", Atlanta Constitution, October 24, 1897
In 1902 a special committee made a new proposal to annex those areas as well as "Bonnie Brae", Copenhill, and the "St. Charles Avenue" area (in today's Virginia Highland). By then, "north Atlanta" was being referred to as "Peachtree".Limits Outlined for Greater Atlanta", Atlanta Constitution, Apr. 30, 1902
In 1905, the Eighth Ward was added. An act of the Georgia General Assembly was enacted on August 3, 1904 which designated the area from then current city limits (at 6th St and West Peachtree), north to 15th St, then east to Piedmont Ave, then northeast to Southern Railway (basically follow Piedmont to the Ansley Park area), then southwardly along the railway the limits. The act also took part of the Sixth Ward north of North Ave. into the new Eighth Ward.

==1909==

On January 1, 1909, a Ninth Ward was formed out of just annexed Copenhill, part of Druid Hills, Edgewood, Reynoldstown and East Atlanta. Edgewood alone had had its own city government before the annexation.Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, 1880s-1930s, Franklin M. Garrett, p.539

===New Tenth Ward===

A new Tenth Ward was created. The eastern boundary was McDaniel Street. The southwestern boundary was Whitehall Street to the Central of Georgia Railroad, and from there along the railroad to a point just south of the BeltLine. From there, the boundary ran due west to a prolongation of Holderness Street south of the BeltLine, and from there southwest to the junction of Campbellton and Utoy roads. Then due east along the north boundary of Fort McPherson to the Central of Georgia Railroad. Then south along that railway line to a point between Osborne and Astor avenues, then east to Sylvan Road, then north to the BeltLine, then east to McDaniel Street.Atlanta and Environs: A Chronicle of Its People and Events, 1880s-1930s, Franklin M. Garrett p.558
This included:

==1919==

Eleventh Ward created from part of the Ninth Ward (area south of the Georgia railroad line) and from part of the Third Ward. The new ward corresponds to East Atlanta, Ormewood Park, and other adjacent areas.Acts passed by the General Assembly of Georgia, 1919, p.834

==1922==

==1923==

In June 1923 there was a failed movement to annex College Park, East Point, and Hapeville."Steps are taken for annexation of three suburbs", Atlanta Constitution, June 30, 1923, p.1

==1928==

==1929==

A Thirteenth Ward was created as the section of the Ninth Ward north of St. Charles and east of the Belt Line to the west side of Briarcliff and north the corporate limits. (most of today's Virginia-Highland)

==1937==

On March 14, 1935, the legislature reduced the number of wards from 13 to 6 and the thirty-nine member city council is cut to eighteen members effective January 1, 1937. The wards were combined as such:

==1952==

In 1951, after a failed 1947 referendum and two other failed attempts, the state legislature passed a "Plan of Improvement" by which on Jan. 1, 1952, the city annexed [tpl]convert|51470|acre|ha sqmi|1|lk=on[/tpl] in  Buckhead, Adams Park, Southwest Atlanta & Lakewood.City of Atlanta Annexation database, Case ANX-1952-005 This was by far the largest expansion in Atlanta's history, tripling the size of the city to [tpl]convert|118|mi2|km2[/tpl] and adding 100,000 residents. This helped spread the burden of providing public services by adding to the base a large group of mostly more affluent residents. The annexation was viewed as a triumph of Mayor Hartsfield.http://books.google.com/books?id=_WuW4GAUg9EC&lpg=PA71&dq=buckhead%20annexed%20square%20miles&pg=PA86
Atlanta would in the 1970s again try, but without success, to repeat the process by state legislation to annex what is now Sandy Springs to Atlanta.City of Sandy Springs, "History"

==1953==

Annexation of Ben Hill, Greenbriar and other adjacent areas in far southwestern AtlantaCity of Atlanta annexation database Case ID ANX-1953-001

==1954==

The ward system is ended. No longer a bicameral body, only a board of six aldermen with a Vice-Mayor serving as president of the board. All positions were elected city-wide. (For post-ward setup, see Political structure of Atlanta).

==Annexations since 1953==

Since 1953, multiple small annexations (and deannexations) to the City of Atlanta have occurred, in two periods from 1954-1979 and 2003-2010. No annexations took place from 1979 to 2003.2, 3, 4, 5 City of Atlanta GIS Annexations database
Multiple small areas adjacent to southwestern Atlanta were annexed including Midwest Cascade, Cascade Glen, and the Horseshoe Community.City of Atlanta GIS Annexations database Sandtown's 2007 petition for annexation was put on hold.Atlanta annexations database, case ANX-2006-006
These annexations added a few thousand residents, and approximately three square miles, including areas mostly in the southwest of the city, but also small parcels in the east and north of the city.
