==Career==

On his return from London in the early 1960s, he became the first person to be appointed to the chair of the School of Zoology and Biological Sciences at Auckland University, a position he held from 1959 to 1988. He was considered at this time one of New Zealand’s most talented up-and-coming academics,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mikelee.co.nz/2011/03/tribute-to-a-great-new-zealander-farewell-prof-john-morton/ |title=Tribute to a great New Zealander – farewell Prof John Morton |last=Lee |first=Mike |date=14 March 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] and was later regarded by many as one of New Zealand’s greatest marine biologists.[tpl]cite news |title=John Morton |journal=New Zealand Geographic |url=http://www.nzgeographic.co.nz/issue-69/john-morton |issue=69 |date=Sep–Oct 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
His teaching style and influence have been well-documented in A History of Biology at Auckland University 1883-1983.[tpl]Citation |title=A History of Biology at Auckland University 1883-1983 |format=Research Report |publisher=Department of Biology, University of Auckland |year=1983 |first1=Brian |last1=Foster |first2=Jack |last2=Rattenbury |first3=John |last3=Marbrook[/tpl] He believed in “humanising” complex scientific issues, and presenting them in laymen’s language.
Morton was also regarded as one of New Zealand’s leading Christian academics and believed in a unified view of science and religion.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=183940 |title=Let's thank God for the wonder that is science |last=Watkin |first=Tim |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=21 April 2001 |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] He told the New Zealand Herald upon his retirement in 1988 that “I find that my scientific work has confirmed my Christian convictions. To me biology and theology complement each other.” In his 1984 book Redeeming Creation[tpl]Cite book |title=Redeeming Creation |publisher=Zealandia |year=1984 |location=Auckland[/tpl] he acknowledged the influence of the French palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin in forming the teleological view he expounded in his academic life.
Morton did much for conservation in New Zealand. He was a leader in the establishment in 1975 of New Zealand’s first marine reserve, Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine Reserve (which is near Cape Rodney and Leigh and includes Goat Island). He led the conservation movement to a series of victories in the 1970s and 80’s which saved the last of New Zealand’s mainland native forests, Pureora, Whirinaki, Waitututu and South Westland from logging.
He served on the Auckland Regional Authority from 1971 to 1974, losing his reelection bid after switching his party affiliation to Labour.[tpl]cite news |title=Auckland's eco warriors come in many guises |author=John Roughan |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |date=12 March 2011 |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10711778[/tpl] In 1989 he became a founding member of the New Labour Party, which in 1991 formed a coalition with other parties called the Alliance.
