Not to be confused with a calorimeter.
A colorimeter is a device used in colorimetry. In scientific fields the word generally refers to the device that measures the absorbance of particular wavelengths of light by a specific solution.Nuffield Advanced Chemistry 2003 This device is most commonly used to determine the concentration of a known solute in a given solution by the application of the Beer-Lambert law, which states that the concentration of a solute is proportional to the absorbance.

==Construction==

The essential parts of a colorimeter are:
In addition, there may be:
There are many commercialized colorimeters as well as open source versions with construction documentation for education and for research.Anzalone GC, Glover AG, Pearce JM. Open-Source Colorimeter. Sensors. 2013; 13(4):5338-5346. http://www.academia.edu/3333921/Open-Source_Colorimeter

===Filters===

Changeable optics filters are used in the colorimeter to select the wavelength of light which the solute absorbs the most, in order to maximize accuracy.  The usual wavelength range is from 400 to 700 nanometers (nm).  If it is necessary to operate in the ultraviolet range (below 400Â nm) then some modifications to the colorimeter are needed.  In modern colorimeters the filament lamp and filters may be replaced by several light-emitting diodes of different colors.The Measurement of Colour

===Cuvettes===

In a manual colorimeter the cuvettes are inserted and removed by hand.  An automated colorimeter (as used in an AutoAnalyzer) is fitted with a flowcell through which solution flows continuously.

===Output===

The output from a colorimeter may be displayed by an analogue or digital meter and may be shown as transmittance (a linear scale from 0-100%) or as absorbance (a logarithmic scale from zero to infinity).  The useful range of the absorbance scale is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light.
In addition, the output may be sent to a chart recorder, data logger, or computer.
