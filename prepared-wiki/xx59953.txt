It is [tpl]convert|15|NM|lk=on[/tpl] northwest of the city of Fayetteville and [tpl]convert|10|NM[/tpl] northwest of the city of Springdale.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=36%B010%2753%22N+94%B08%2745%22W-XNA&MS=wls&DU=nm | title = Distance and heading from Springdale (36°10'53"N 94°08'45"W) to XNA (36°16'54"N 94°18'28"W) | publisher = Great Circle Mapper | accessdate = July 28, 2012[/tpl] The airport, located in Highfill, Arkansas, is also near the cities of Bentonville, Rogers, and Siloam Springs, Arkansas.  It is commonly referred to by its IATA code, which is incorporated in the airport's logo as "Fly XNA".
XNA opened in November 1998 as a replacement airport for commercial traffic previously served by Fayetteville's aging and inadequate Drake Field, which was undersized to serve the rapidly growing Northwest Arkansas region. It is perhaps the smallest airport to see year-round, nonstop daily service to major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, largely due to the presence of one of the world's largest companies, Wal-Mart, in nearby Bentonville. Envoy Air (the regional carrier for American Airlines) is the major carrier, formerly serving 6 cities, and currently 4 from XNA: Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, New York's LaGuardia, and Los Angeles. 
As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 547,871 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 530,087 enplanements in 2009, and 549,195 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

==Expansion==

Due to rapid growth in Northwest Arkansas, in 2007 airport officials announced the construction of a new concourse costing between $20–$25 million.  The new concourse is east of the upper concourse, allowing the airport to park eight additional planes for boarding.  The airport previously had 12 airplane parking positions.  It took over three years to complete."XNA Opens New Concourse". KNWA. August 24, 2011.
The airport recently completed a ticket counter expansion, and is planning two large warehouse additions.  The airport has completed a $21 million expansion to the upper-level concourse that includes the state's first moving walkway. With the walkway it will only take about three minutes to get from security to the last gate. The addition adds [tpl]convert|51000|sqft|m2[/tpl] and 12 upper level gates to the east side of the airport."XNA Expands Terminal, Runway Facilities". 4029tv.com. June 30, 2010.
