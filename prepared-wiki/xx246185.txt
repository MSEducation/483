Alexandre Chan, described as "one of Brazil's leading architects"[tpl]cite news|last=Phillips|first=Tom|coauthors=|title=Brazil's Bridge of Knowledge marks seaside city's rebirth|work=The Guardian (London)|date=February 26, 2012|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/26/brazil-bridge-knowledge-worldcup-olympics|accessdate=2012-03-23[/tpl] is an architect who designed the President Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge in Brasilia with structural engineer Mario Vila Verde. 
Chan's idea for the President Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge was to create a landmark for the enjoyment of the community as much as to simply traverse a body of water.[tpl]cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Bridging Brasilia|work=Architecture Week|date=July 7, 2004|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2004/0707/design_2-2.html|accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] The bridge includes large arches that cross over the roadway midspan and drop on the opposite side of the roadway while radial cable stays "between the roadway and the underside of each arch form a sort of tunnel for travelers." The road itself is three lanes in each direction with a sidewalk on each side. The bridge won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal at the International Bridge Conference in 2003.
