Adiexodo ([tpl]lang-el|Αδιέξοδο[/tpl]; Greek for "Dead End") was a Greek punk band from Athens formed in 1983 by Dimitris Spyropoulos, Sotiris Theocharis, Stathis Papandreou, and Mimis Alimprantis. It was one of the first Greek punk bands, along with Genia Tou Chaous, and its raw low fidelity sound along with its nihilistic lyrics were very influential to the early regional punk scene and subculture.
The band members broke up in 1986 and Spyropoulos went on to form Deus ex Machina.
