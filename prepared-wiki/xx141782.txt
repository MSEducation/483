==Biography==

Ma Sugar Mercado is the youngest of four siblings who along with her family lived in Cavite. They lived in a temporary house on top of a hog shed which was built in a tract of land owned by her grandfather. Sugar recounted that during her childhood, her family would sleep on strips of wood and that the roof over their heads would be constantly blown away during a typhoon. But things would eventually look up for her.
During Sugar's junior year in high school, she toured with the Gen. Mariano Alvarez Technical High School Band as a majorette. Later, she would join television beauty contests particularly Eat Bulaga's "TV Babe" segment in 2001. Sugar lost. Nevertheless she was signed on to join the SexBomb Girls, an association that lasted less than a year. Sugar decided to finish her studies and three years later, she served a six-month stint with the ABS-CBN noontime variety show MTB: Ang Saya Saya 2002 edition. Six months later, Sugar rejoined the SexBomb Girls and Eat Bulaga.
It was during the segment Laban o Bawi that Sugar figured in a freak mishap causing her to fall down and accidentally destroy the stage props inside the studio. Mercado's rising popularity reportedly caused a rift between the Eat Bulaga management and the SexBomb Girls and amid much controversy, the two parted ways. Sugar remained and is now one of the very popular member of the show. After Eat Bulaga was renewed for a new format, she did not come back as host of the show. She has now earned enough money to build a two-story house for her family in Cavite. She left Eat Bulaga! again, though, after some time.
