The Cosmic Geoids and One Other is a collection of two science fiction novellas by author John Taine (pseudonym of Eric Temple Bell). It was first published in 1949 by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. in an edition of 1,200 copies.  The title novella is a loose sequel to Taine's novel, The Time Stream, and was later serialized in the magazine Spaceway, in three parts beginning in December 1954.  The other novella, "Black Goldfish", was first serialized in the magazine  Fantasy Book, in two parts beginning in 1948.

==Reception==

Reviewing the volume in Astounding, Forrest J Ackerman found the two stories wildly disparate: the title piece was "truly ''Stapledonian, but "Black Goldfish" was "the weakest thing Taine has ever done.""Book Reviews", Astounding Science Fiction, January 1951, pp.74-75
