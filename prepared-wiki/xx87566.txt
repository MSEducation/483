The station was built to service Sandown Racecourse. In addition to the two main lines, there was a signal box and booking office, and two sidings each over 600 metres long on the eastern side of the tracks, for the stabling of special race trains. The station had no platform on the up track, instead having an island platform on the down track, the other face serving one of the sidings on the eastern side.Victorian Railways signalling diagram - [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.signaldiagramsandphotos.com/mywebpages/vr/Metropolitan/743%2709.htm|title=Sandown Park 743'09|publisher=www.signaldiagramsandphotos.com|accessdate=2009-07-12[/tpl]
The station was only used for racecourse traffic and closed in May 1955. In June 1965 it reopened for general passenger traffic as an island platform. The station once had a second exit and subway at the up end of the platform but that has since been closed and filled in.
