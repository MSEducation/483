H2O is the eleventh studio album from Daryl Hall and John Oates, released in 1982. A hit, it featured three top 10 US singles, one being "Maneater", which was the biggest hit of their career, spending four weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The album title is a play on the chemical formula for water, where "H" is for Hall, and "O" is for Oates.
H2O is certified double platinum by the RIAA with sales of over two million copies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=H%202%20O&artist=Hall%20&%20Oates&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |date=1985-04-01 |accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl]
