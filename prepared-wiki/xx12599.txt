The Serbia and Montenegro Forces (1992–2006) ([tpl]lang-sr|Vojska Srbije i Crna Gore[/tpl], VSCG; Војска Србије и Црне Горе, ВСЦГ) were the armed forces of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The military included ground forces with internal and border troops, naval forces, air and air defense forces, and civil defense.
Preceding the VSCG was the Yugoslavian Forces ([tpl]lang-sr|Војска Југославије[/tpl], ВЈ, Vojska Jugoslavije, VJ) from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the military of SFR Yugoslavia. The state, then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, participated in the Yugoslav Wars with limited direct intervention of its own armed forces. Following the end of the Wars and the constitutional reforms of 2003 by which the state was renamed "Serbia and Montenegro", the military accordingly changed its name to "Military of Serbia and Montenegro". The military was heavily involved in combating the terrorist groups of the Kosovo Liberation Army and Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac during the Kosovo War and Preševo Valley conflict, and also engaged NATO airplanes during the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Upon the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro with the Montenegrin independence referendum of 2006, a fraction of the joint military was given to Montenegro, with the bulk of the force remaining in Serbia. Montenegro inherited the navy as Serbia is landlocked.
