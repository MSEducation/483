M-94 is a state trunkline in the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It runs for [tpl]convert|86.983|mi|km|3[/tpl] from K. I. Sawyer to Manistique. The highway is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour during a concurrency with M-28. M-94 crosses the Siphon Bridge in Manistique, unique for the fact that the bridge roadway is below water level.
M-94 has been realigned several times. It has had its own roadway between the M-28 junctions in Munising and Shingleton. Other changes have flip-flopped M-94 with M-28 between Harvey and Munising and extended it across the former K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base.

==Route description==

M-94 begins at an intersection with M-553 and crosses the former K. I. Sawyer AFB. Then it overlaps US 41 for a little over a mile near Skandia. East of Skandia, M-94 runs through forest lands and serves the communities of Sundell and Rumely before entering Eben Junction. There M-94 intersects the southern section of H-01. Further east is Chatham where there are junctions with the northern section of H-01 and M-67. M-94 turns southerly briefly  before returning to an east–west direction to head to the community of Forest Lake and ultimately Munising. There M-94 joins  a concurrency with M-28 and the Lake Superior Circle Tour from Munising to Shingleton. Until the turn at Shingleton, the route is more decidedly east–west than north–south. Between Shingleton and Manistique, M-94 is more north–south.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official 2008 Department of Transportation Map |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9622_11033_11151---,00.html |year=2008|scale=1 in:15 mi/1 cm:9 km |section=  |accessdate=August 4, 2008 [/tpl]
South of Shingleton, M-94 runs through forest lands as a part of the Great Manistique Swamp. Along the way are national forest campgrounds located near Steuben. South of Crooked Lake, M-94 curves to the east before turning almost due south to the Manistique area. In Manistique, M-94 enters town on North 5th St before turning to follow Deer Street and River Street. On River Street, the trunkline uses the Siphon Bridge to cross the Manistique River and then uses Elk and Maple streets before terminating at US 2 at Lakeshore Drive.[tpl]Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=manistique,+mi&ie=UTF8&z=13 |title= Overview Map of M-94|accessdate=August 4, 2008[/tpl]

===Siphon Bridge===

In Manistique, M-94 crosses the Manistique River on the "Siphon Bridge". Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river, the water level actually used to be higher than the road surface. This produced a siphon effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill. This dam would have needed to flood a large section of the city. The shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction. Instead of expensive dikes, a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed. The sides of this tank provided man-made banks higher than the natural banks. The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having, "concrete bulkheads, formed by the side spans of the bridge, that  allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed."[tpl]cite book |last1= Hunt |first1= Mary |last2= Hunt |first2= Don |lastauthoramp= yes |chapter=Manistique: Siphon Bridge and Water Tower |year=2007 |title=Hunt's Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |publisher= Midwestern Guides |location=Albion, MI |url=http://hunts-upguide.com/ |chapterurl= http://hunts-upguide.com/manistique_siphon_bridge_and_water_tower.html |accessdate=September 15, 2006[/tpl] The bridge acted as a siphon because the water level was above the roadway,[tpl]cite book |last= Hyde |first= Charles K. |year= 1993 |title= Historic Highway Bridges of Michigan |location= Detroit |publisher= Wayne State University Press |page= 132 |isbn= 0-8143-2448-7[/tpl] and the structure has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not![tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154-129683--,00.html |title= Road & Highway Facts |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=February 13, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2008[/tpl]
