==Early life==

Gordon was born in Rochester, New York, but raised in Los Angeles, California, where her father, Wayne C. Gordon, was a sociology and education professor at the University of California,[tpl]cite web|url=http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/WayneC.Gordon.htm|work=University of California|title=Wayne C. Gordon|accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl] and her mother was "a homemaker with creative tendencies." Gordon attended a progressive elementary school that was attached to UCLA, which she described as: "“It was learn by doing. So we were always making African spears and going down to the river and making mud huts, or skinning a cowhide and drying it and throwing it off the cliff at Dana Point.”
After high school, Gordon attended the Otis Art Institute of Los Angeles County and was briefly a student at York University in Toronto, Canada, where she played in her first band.[tpl]cite web|title=Sonic Youth Time Takes Its Crazy Toll|url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/sonic_youth-time_takes_its_crazy_toll-2|work=Exclaim.ca|publisher=Ontario Media Development Corporations|accessdate=29 April 2013|author=Michael Barclay|date=July 2002[/tpl] She briefly worked for Larry Gagosian during her study as a side-job.Kim Gordon works with Larry Gagosian, Huffington Post, September 3, 2013.

==Musical career==

===Sonic Youth (1981–2011)===

After graduating from art school, Gordon moved to New York City and became fascinated by "no-wave" bands: When I came to New York, I’d go and see bands downtown playing no-wave music. It was expressionistic and it was also nihilistic. Punk rock was tongue-in-cheek, saying, ‘Yeah, we’re destroying rock.’ No-wave music is more like, ‘NO, we’re really destroying rock.’ It was very dissonant. I just felt like, Wow, this is really free. I could do that. 
In New York City, she joined the short-lived band CKM, with Christine Hahn and Stanton Miranda, and met her future Sonic Youth bandmates Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore through Miranda. Gordon began dating Moore and, together with Ranaldo, the couple then formed Sonic Youth in 1981. Originally the band released their first two albums, Confusion is Sex (1983) and  Bad Moon Rising (1985) on Neutral and Homestead Records, respectively, before signing with SST to release EVOL (1986) and Sister (1987).
In 1989, the band signed onto DGC Records, a subsidiary of Geffen, and released Goo (1990), which became the group's first commercial hit. The band toured extensively for the album between 1990 and 1991, and a documentary titled 1991: The Year Punk Broke documented the band's tour with Nirvana, Babes in Toyland, Dinosaur Jr., Mudhoney, and Hole. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Gordon is known for a fascination with Karen Carpenter and Sonic Youth wrote the song "Tunic" about the musician. Gordon provided insight into the song in a 2010 interview:
 I was trying to put myself into Karen's body. It was like she had so little control over her life, like a teenager—they have so little control over what’s happening to them that one way they can get it is through what they eat or don’t. Also I think she lost her identity, it got smaller and smaller. And there have been times when I feel I’ve lost mine. When people come and ask me about being famous or whatever and I don’t feel that, it’s not me. But it makes me think about it. The music is definitely about the darker side. But I also wanted to liberate Karen into heaven. . . . You know there’s all these families out there trying so hard to do everything right and be perfect.[tpl]cite web|title=AN INTERVIEW WITH KIM GORDON|url=http://incongruousquarterly.com/2010/07/an-interview-with-kim-gordon/|work=The Incongruous Quarterly|publisher=The Incongruous Quarterly|accessdate=29 April 2013|author=Mary Gaitskill|date=31 July 2010[/tpl] 
The band popularly covered the song "Superstar", which had been covered by The Carpenters in 1971. Between 1983 and 2009, Gordon, with Sonic Youth, released a total of sixteen studio albums, their last release being The Eternal (2009) before their official disbandment in 2011. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Other projects (1989–present)===

In 1989, Gordon, Sadie May, and Lydia Lunch formed Harry Crews and released the album Naked in Garden Hills. In 1991, Courtney Love, who had been an influenced by Sonic Youth and the no wave scene, sent Gordon a letter asking her to produce her band Hole's debut record, Pretty on the Inside. Gordon, along with assistance from Don Fleming, produced the album in March 1991, which later received critical acclaim and cult status.[tpl]cite web|title=Kim Gordon Sounds Off|url=http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/celebrities/kim-gordon-sonic-youth-profile|work=Elle.com|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=2013-09-20|author=Lizzy Goodman|date=2013-04-22[/tpl]
Gordon collaborated with Cafritz to form the band Free Kitten that also recorded with Mark Ibold and Yoshimi P-We. Free Kitten released three albums on the Kill Rock Stars record label and a fourth album on Moore's Ecstatic Peace label.
The Supreme Indifference was a musical collaboration that involved Gordon, Jim O'Rourke and Alan Licht.

==Non-musical endeavors==

===Art career===

Gordon is an established visual artist and curator, and her work has been exhibited across the U.S., Japan, and Europe. She graduated from the Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles. In the early 1980s, Gordon wrote for Artforum and worked for several Soho art galleries. She curated an exhibition at White Columns gallery in 1982 that involved contributions from Mike Kelley and Tony Oursler, among others.
In 1996, Gordon was involved in an exhibition entitled Baby Generation at Parco gallery in Tokyo. Gordon's exhibition Kim's Bedroom was shown at MU in the Netherlands, and included drawing and paintings alongside live music and special guests. A limited-edition book and CD of the exhibition were published by Purple Books.
In 2003, Gordon was featured in the Gothenburg Biennale and exhibited Club In The Shadow, a collaboration with artist Jutta Koether, at Kenny Schachter's Contemporary Gallery in New York City, U.S. In 2005, she submitted another collaboration with Koethe for the Her Noise exhibition in London, United Kingdom (UK).[tpl]cite web|title=Reverse Karaoke|url=http://www.electra-productions.com/projects/2005/reverse_karaoke/overview.shtml|work=Electra|publisher=Electra|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=November–December 2005[/tpl] In the same year, an artist's book Kim Gordon Chronicles Vol. 1 was published and featured photos of Gordon throughout her life.[tpl]cite web|title=Kim Gordon: Chronicles Vol.1|url=http://www.artbook.com/3905714019.html|work=Artbook|publisher=Artbook LLC|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=15 August 2005[/tpl] The following year, Kim Gordon Chronicles Vol. 2 was released and featured her drawings, collages, and paintings.[tpl]cite web|title=Chronicles Vol.2 Kim Gordon (Northampton, USA)|url=http://www.nieves.ch/catalogue/kimgordon2about.html|work=Nieves|publisher=Nieves|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2006[/tpl]
In 2013, Gordon explained the significance of her art in relation to the conclusion of Sonic Youth: "When you’re in a group, you’re always sharing everything. It’s protected. Your own ego is not there for criticism, but you also never quite feel the full power of its glory, either. A few years ago I started to feel like I owed it to myself to really focus on doing art.” 
Recent exhibitions include “The Show Is Over,” at Gagosian Gallery in London (2013) and the major survey “Design Office with Kim Gordon–Since 1980,” at White Columns, New York in 2013. In 2014, she presented newly created Wreath Paintings throughout Rudolf Schindler's iconic Fitzpatrick-Leland House under the byname of Design Office.Kim Gordon: Design Office "Coming Soon", April 5 - 26, 2014 Gagosian Gallery, Los Angeles.

==Personal life==

Gordon married Moore in 1984 and gave birth to their daughter Coco Hayley Gordon Moore on July 1, 1994. Gordon and Coco reside in Northampton, Massachusetts, U.S., where Coco attended the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter Public School in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The pair were frequently seen in the area and Sonic Youth played a benefit concert with Cat Power for the Greenfield Center School in 2005. The band played a second benefit for the school in 2007. As of 2013, Coco is a student at School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
An announcement in October 2011 confirmed that Gordon and Moore had separated.[tpl]cite web|last=Tartar |first=Andre |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/10/sonic_youths_moore_and_gordon.html |title=Sonic Youth’s Moore and Gordon Separating – Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl] Gordon revealed details about the decision in April 2013, after a divorce was finalized: she first confronted Moore about a text message that she discovered from an unnamed woman; this was followed by counseling sessions, and the separation then occurred as a result of Moore's inability to cease his extra-marital relationship. Gordon explained that her ex-husband was "like a lost soul."  Gordon also revealed that she had been diagnosed with DCIS breast cancer during her divorce, which was successfully treated with surgery.

==Legacy and influence==

Film director Sofia Coppola and musician Kathleen Hanna have praised Gordon for the influence that she has exerted on their own art. Hanna explained in 2013:
 
 She was a forerunner, musically. Just knowing a woman was in a band trading lead vocals, playing bass, and being a visual artist at the same time made me feel less alone. As a radical feminist singer, I wasn’t particularly well liked. I was in a punk underground scene dominated by hardcore dudes who yelled mean shit at me every night, and journalists routinely called my voice shrill, unlistenable. Kim made me feel accepted in a way I hadn’t before. Fucking Kim Gordon thought I was on the right track, haters be damned. It made the bullshit easier to take, knowing she was in my corner.
