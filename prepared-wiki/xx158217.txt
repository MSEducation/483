Halocarpus biformis, known commonly as yellow pine or pink pine, is a coniferous tree endemic to New Zealand. The tree can attain heights of 10m, but in open areas is usually a low spreading bush. It is found at higher elevations in the volcanic plateau of the North Island and at lower elevations on the South Island and Stewart Island. The species was formerly known as Dacrydium biforme.
