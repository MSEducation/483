==Etymology==

The name of the city is of pre-Russian, probably Baltic, origin.Е. М. Поспелов. "Географические названия мира". Москва: Русские словари, 1998, p. 423: "The earliest etymologies derived the place name from Russian dialectal tulá 'hidden, unreachable place'... The pre-Russian origin of the name of the river and town is no longer doubted 1985.... Since the name of the river Upa is certainly Baltic..., its tributary *Tula presumed earlier form of Tulitsa may also be of Baltic origin, which is supported by a series of parallels in Lithuanian toponymy: the river Tule, the Tulis swamp, the Tulyte field, the meadow Tulejos, the valley Tulija, etc. 1981; the meaning of these toponyms is not entirely clear...."

==History==

Tula was first mentioned in the Nikon Chronicle in relation to a military operation conducted in 1146.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] As the chronicle was written in the 16th century, the date is disputed. The first confirmed mention of Tula dates to 1382.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
In the Middle Ages, Tula was a minor fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. As soon as it passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, a brick citadel, or kremlin, was constructed in 1514–1521.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|location = Moscow|title=Тула[/tpl] It was a key fortress of the Great Abatis Belt and successfully resisted a siege by the Tatars in 1552. In 1607, Ivan Bolotnikov and his supporters seized the citadel and withstood a four-months siege by the Tsar's army. In the 18th century, some parts of the kremlin walls were demolished. Despite its archaic appearance, the five-domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin was built as late as 1764.
In 1712, Tula was visited by Peter the Great, who commissioned the Demidov blacksmiths to build the first armament factory in Russia. Several decades later, Tula was turned by the Demidovs into the greatest ironworking center of Eastern Europe. The oldest museum in the city, showcasing the history of weapons, was inaugurated by the Demidovs in 1724, and Nicholas-Zaretsky Church in the city houses their family vault. The first factory to produce samovars industrially was also established there in the course of the 18th century. After the Demidovs moved the center of their manufacture to the Urals, Tula continued as a center of heavy industry, particularly in the manufacture of matériel.
In the 1890s, Ivan Savelyev, a medical orderly, became the founder of Social Democracy in Tula, and set up a workers' study circle[tpl]Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Biggart |first=John |year=1989 |title=Alexander Bogdanov, Left-Bolshevism and the Proletkult 1904–1932 |publisher=University of East Anglia |oclc=556500696[/tpl]
The city grew rapidly in the early 20th century as a result of arms production during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Tula's factories also manufactured weapons for the Red Army during the Russian Civil War of 1918–1921.
During the Great Patriotic War (World War II) of 1941–1945, the city was important in the production of armaments. Tula became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between October 24 and December 5, 1941. The heavily fortified city held out, however, and Guderian's Second Panzer Army was stopped near Tula. The city secured the southern flank during the Battle of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976. It is home to the Klokovo air base and the Tula Arms Plant.
