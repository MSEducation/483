"School Days", also known as "School Days (When We Were a Couple of Kids)", is an American popular song written in 1907 by Will Cobb and Gus Edwards. Its subject is mature man and woman (husband and wife?) looking back sentimentally on their childhood together in primary school.

==Recordings==

"School Days" has been recorded many times over the years. Byron G. Harlan was an early recording star who made it a hit. Billy Murray and Ada Jones also sang it as memorable duet, referenced decades later by Tiny Tim on one of his albums, in which he sang both parts, invoking his famous falsetto voice. 
Louis Jordan recorded a jump blues version of "School Days" in 1949 under the title "School Days (When We Were Kids)". Although it credited the original songwriters, Jordan's record had little in common with earlier versions of the song other than the words of the chorus. The original melody was replaced with a twelve bar blues and the lyrics of most of the verses were replaced with nursery rhymes.
