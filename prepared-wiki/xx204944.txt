Tim Ryan (born Cork, 6 June 1984) is an Irish rugby union player for Coventry. His position of choice is at tighthead prop. Ryan has played for Ireland U-19's,http://www.munsterrugby.ie/news/1447.php while his brother Dave Ryan is also a prop and formerly played for Munster.
Ryan started his underage rugby at Woodleigh Park for Highfield RFC playing in the second row and won an All-Ireland U-16 title. After his successful stint in the second row he also played in the back row and then found his ideal position in the front row where he still makes good use of his pace and good handling skills. With time he was easily spotted and recruited by Munster Rugby and brought into their academy and also moved on to play with University College Cork RFC and then played in the AIL league with Cork Constitution,http://www.irishrugby.ie/6855_11875.php with whom he won the title in 2008.http://www.irishrugby.ie/6855_12176.php He moved to Toulon at the start of the 2009â€“10 Top 14 season on a 2-year contract.http://blog.limerickpost.ie/sport/?p=1113http://www.irishrugby.ie/6855_17063.php The incoming Toulon coach, Philippe Saint-Andre, was sufficiently impressed with Ryan's first half performance against the All Blacks at Thomond Park in November 2008 to recruit him. The All Blacks narrowly won the game in a tour they were undefeated against national sides.http://www.irishrugby.ie/6855_15083.phphttp://www.munsterrugby.ie/news/391.phphttp://frenchrugbyclub.com/Top-14/Top-14-Ryan-Signs-For-Toulon-000426.html
