"It Might As Well Rain Until September" is a 1962 song originally written for Bobby Vee by Carole King and Gerry Goffin. King recorded the demo version of the song and it became a hit for her. However, Vee's management baulked at releasing the song as a single, instead using it only as an album track. Bobby Vee recorded the song the same year for his 1963 Liberty album The Night Has A Thousand Eyes.

==Background==

The song was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and intended for Bobby Vee, for whom they had already written the song "Take Good Care of My Baby", a number one hit in the United States in 1961 and which remains Vee's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100. King recorded the demo version of the songhttp://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/lyrics/i/it_might_as_well_rain_until_september.txt and this version was released as a double A-side single with "Nobody's Perfect". Although she had recorded earlier for ABC-Paramount and Alpine Records, '.....September' was Carole King's first commercial success as a singer, having already had a number of hits as a songwriter. The recording was only ever intended as a demo, and as such there is no master tape, only an acetate. This is the reason why all digital releases of this recording are of inferior quality compared to other songs of this era. However, Don Kirshner liked Carole King's version of "September" so much that even after hearing Bobby Vee's version, he decided to release King's version as a single on the Dimension label. But due to the fact that Carole King had two small children and did not have any interest in traveling the country, she had no desire to promote the record. Despite this, Carole King was ultimately persuaded by Don Kirshner and Gerry Goffin to appear on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, where King lip-synched to the record (as was almost always done on the show) and, unlike many other performers who were given good ratings, was given a terrible rating of a 42 out of 100 by the Bandstand kids. While King was devastated by the terribly-rated performance, the song still became popular.
The song later appeared on the album More American Graffiti.Track 13, LP2, More American Graffiti, 1975, MCA 2-8007, (Introduced by Wolf man Jack). However, due to the conversations between Wolfman jack and a phone listener, on the track, as well as the fact that the song fades out earlier, King was very unhappy, and sued both Wolfman jack and MCA Records for the treatment of the song.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]   Both paid the damages in a settlement to King.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]  It is also included on Carole Kings 2005 live album The Living Room Tour, where it is performed as part of a medley along with other songs she wrote with Gerry Goffin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caroleking.com/index.php?id=3496&p=discography&subp=ckalbums_detail |title=Official Website of Carole King - Songwriter, Performer, Author |publisher=Carole King |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl]
