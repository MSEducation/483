==History and ownership==

Haaretz was first published in 1918 as a newspaper sponsored by the British military government in Palestine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/institutes/bronfman/contents.html |title=TAU – Institute of Jewish Press and Communications – The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Center |publisher=Tau.ac.il |accessdate=10 February 2013[/tpl] In 1919, it was taken over by a group of socialist-oriented Zionists, mainly from Russia.[tpl]cite web|last=Marmari |first=Hanoch |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-fine-and-fragile-balance-1.119759 |title=A fine and fragile balance |work=Haaretz |date=16 April 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2013[/tpl] Initially, it was called Hadashot Ha'aretz ("News of the Land"). Later, the name was shortened to "Ha'aretz". The literary section of the paper attracted the leading Hebrew writers of the time.Encyclopedia Judaica, Newspapers, Hebrew, vol. 12, Keter Books, Jerusalem, 1978
The newspaper was initially published in Jerusalem. From 1919 to 1922, the paper was headed by a succession of editors, among them Leib Yaffe. It was shut down briefly due to a budgetary shortfall and reopened in Tel Aviv at the beginning of 1923 under the editorship of Moshe Glickson, who held the post for 15 years. The Tel Aviv municipality granted the paper financial support by paying in advance for future advertisements.Haaretz history, Tom Segev
Salman Schocken, a wealthy German Jewish Zionist who owned a chain of department stores in Germany, bought the paper in 1937. His son, Gershom Schocken, became the chief editor in 1939 and held that position until his death in 1990.A newspaper's mission – Haaretz
Until August 2006, the Schocken family owned 100% of the Haaretz Group, but then the German publisher M. DuMont Schauberg acquired 25 percent of the shares.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dumont.eu/dumont/dir/?101798 |title=M. DuMont Schauberg.

On 12 June 2011, it was announced that Russian-Israeli businessman Leonid Nevzlin had purchased a 20% stake in the Haaretz Group, buying 15% from the family and 5% from M. DuMont Schauberg. This means that the Schocken family now owns 60% and M. DuMont Schauberg and Leonid Nevzlin have 20% each.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000653184&fid=1725 |title=Russian immigrant billionaire buys 20% of "Haaretz" |publisher=Globes |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2013[/tpl]
In October 2012, a union strike mobilized to protest planned layoffs by the Haaretz management. As a consequence, both the Haaretz newspaper and its TheMarker business supplement were not printed for one day. According to Israel Radio, it was the first time since 1965 that a newspaper did not go to press on account of a strike.[tpl]cite news|last=Koopmans|first=Ofira|title=Journalists at Israel's Haaretz newspaper strike over job cuts|url=http://en.europeonline-magazine.eu/journalists-at-israels-haaretz-newspaper-strike-over-job-cuts_241385.html|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=Europe Online|date=4 October 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title='Haaretz' daily not printed today|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000787939|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=Globes|date=4 October 2012[/tpl]

==Management==

The newspaper's editorial policy was defined by Gershom Schocken, who was editor-in-chief from 1939 to 1990. Schocken was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Hanoch Marmari.  In 2004 David Landau replaced Marmari and was succeeded by Dov Alfon in 2008. The current editor-in-chief of the newspaper is Aluf Benn, who replaced Alfon in August 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/aluf-benn-named-new-editor-in-chief-of-haaretz-1.376311|title=Aluf Benn named new editor-in-chief of Haaretz|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=13 February 2014|date=1 August 2011[/tpl]  Charlotte Halle became editor of the English Print Edition in February 2008.

==Editorial policy and viewpoints==

Haaretz describes itself as having "a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs."[tpl]cite web|work=Haaretz|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=51345&contrassID=61&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=0|title=About|accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl] Others describe it alternatively as liberal,[ref]
In 2006 the BBC said that Haaretz takes a moderate stance on foreign policy and security.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4969714.stm|title=The press in Israel|publisher=BBC|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl] David Remnick in The New Yorker described Haaretz as "easily the most liberal newspaper in Israel", its ideology as left-wing and its temper as "insistently oppositional."[tpl]cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|title=The Dissenters|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/28/110228fa_fact_remnick|accessdate=12 October 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date= 28 February 2011|authorlink=David Remnick[/tpl] According to Ira Sharkansky, Haaretz's op-ed pages are open to a variety of opinions.[tpl]cite book|last=Sharkansky|first=Ira|authorlink=Ira Sharkansky|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dlhmWNcqlrAC&pg=PA43|title=Governing Israel: Chosen People, Promised Land, & Prophetic Tradition|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|year=2005|page=43|isbn=978-0-7658-0277-4[/tpl] J. J. Goldberg, the editor of the American The Jewish Daily Forward, describes Haaretz as "Israel's most vehemently anti-settlement daily paper".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/104263/|title=Are Religious Soldiers To Blame for Alleged Abuse?|first=J. J.|last=Goldberg|publisher=The Forward|date=3 April 2009|accessdate=13 February 2014[/tpl] Stephen Glain of The Nation described Haaretz as "Israel's liberal beacon," citing its editorials voicing opposition to the occupation, the purportedly discriminatory treatment of Arab citizens, and the mindset that led to the Second Lebanon War. A 2003 study in The International Journal of Press/Politics concluded that Haaretz's reporting of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians.[tpl]cite journal|title=Attempted Objectivity: An Analysis of the New York Times and Ha'aretz and their Portrayals of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=September 2003|volume=8|issue=4|pages=114–120|doi=10.1177/1081180X03256999|author=Matt Viser|quote=This study explores the biases, pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian, by looking at quantitative indicators of news coverage in the New York Times and Ha'aretz. Several time periods were examined (1987-88, 2000-01, and post-September 11, 2001), using multiple indicators. By these measures, the New York Times is more favorable toward the Israelis than the Palestinians, and the partiality has become more pronounced with time. Ha'aretz is also more favorable toward the Israelis, but less so than the Times.[/tpl]

===Formatting, circulation and reputation===

Compared to other mass circulation papers in Israel, Haaretz uses smaller headlines and print. Less space is devoted to pictures, and more to political analysis. Opinion columns are generally written by regular commentators rather than guest writers. Its editorial pages are considered influential among government leaders.[tpl]cite journal|last=Beckerman|first=Gal|date=September–October 2005|title=Disengaged|journal=Columbia Journalism Review|url=http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2005/5/beckerman.asp|accessdate=21 June 2007[/tpl] Apart from the news, Haaretz publishes feature articles on social and environmental issues, as well as book reviews, investigative reporting, and political commentary. In 2008 the newspaper itself reported a paid subscribership of 65,000, daily sales of 72,000 copies, and 100,000 on weekends.Haaretz service. Dov Alfon named as new Haaretz editor-in-chief.

Andrea Levin, executive director of the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting accused the newspaper of doing "damage to the truth" and sometimes making serious factual errors but not often correcting them.[tpl]cite news|last=Ross|first=Oakland|title=News and views that inspire love or kindle hatred|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/512004--news-and-views-that-inspire-love-or-kindle-hatred|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=5 October 2008|archiveurl=http://archive.is/20130204064540/http://www.thestar.com/article/512004--news-and-views-that-inspire-love-or-kindle-hatred|archivedate=13 September 2012|authorlink=Andrea Levin[/tpl] Earlier, in 2001, Levin criticized Haaretz correspondent Amira Hass for inaccurate reporting and charged Haaretz with fueling anti-Israel bias.[tpl]cite web|last=Levin|first=Andrea |url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&x_outlet=55&x_article=171|title=Ha'aretz Fuels Anti-Israel Bias|publisher=CAMERA|date=6 August 2001|accessdate=5 May 2010|authorlink=Andrea Levin[/tpl]
According to its competitor The Jerusalem Post, Haaretz editor-in-chief David Landau said at the 2007 Limmud conference in Moscow that he had told his staff not to report about criminal investigations against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in order to promote Sharon's 2004–2005 Gaza disengagement plan.[ref]
In 2010, several columnists at The Jerusalem Post, including deputy managing editor Caroline Glick, criticized Haaretz for its role in the Anat Kamm affair.Michael Freund, Fundamentally Freund: Awakening the Left", The Jerusalem Post, 14 April 2010.Caroline Glick, "The Haaretz spy scandal: Haaretz provides Israeli affirmation for anti-Israel attitudes", The Jerusalem Post, 16 April 2010.Ben-Dror Yemini, "Haaretz could not be more wrong – or misleading", The Jerusalem Post, 20 April 2010.
