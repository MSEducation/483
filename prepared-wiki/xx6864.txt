John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, OM, PRS ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|i[/tpl]; 12 November 1842 – 30 June 1919) was an English physicist who, with William Ramsay, discovered argon, an achievement for which he earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1904. He also discovered the phenomenon now called Rayleigh scattering, which can be used to explain why the sky is blue, and predicted the existence of the surface waves now known as Rayleigh waves. Rayleigh's textbook, The Theory of Sound, is still referred to by acoustic engineers today.

==Biography==

John William Strutt, of Terling Place Essex, suffered from frailty and poor health in his early years.[tpl]cite journal |journal=The Popular Science Monthly |title=Sketch of Lord Rayleigh |pages=840 ff |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fiwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA840 |date=October 1884 |volume=25 |issue=46 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation[/tpl]   He attended Harrow School, before going on to the University of Cambridge in 1861 where he studied mathematics at Trinity College. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree (Senior Wrangler and 1st Smith's prize) in 1865, and a Master of Arts in 1868. He was subsequently elected to a Fellowship of Trinity. He held the post until his marriage to Evelyn Balfour, daughter of James Maitland Balfour, in 1871. He had three sons with her. In 1873, on the death of his father, John Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh, he inherited the Barony of Rayleigh.
He was the second Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge (following James Clerk Maxwell), from 1879 to 1884. He first described dynamic soaring by seabirds in 1883, in the British journal Nature. From 1887 to 1905 he was Professor of Natural Philosophy at Cambridge.
Around the year 1900 Lord Rayleigh developed the duplex (combination of two) theory  of human sound localization using two binaural cues, interaural phase difference (IPD) and interaural level difference (ILD) (based on analysis of a spherical head with no external pinnae). The theory posits that we use two primary cues for sound lateralization, using the difference in the phases of sinusoidal components of the sound and the difference in amplitude (level) between the two ears.
The rayl unit of acoustic impedance is named after him.
As an advocate that simplicity and theory be part of the scientific method, Lord Rayleigh argued for the principle of similitude.
Lord Rayleigh was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 12 June 1873, and served as president of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. From time to time Lord Rayleigh participated in the House of Lords; however, he spoke up only if politics attempted to become involved in science. He died on 30 June 1919, in Witham, Essex.  He was succeeded, as the 4th Lord Rayleigh, by his son Robert John Strutt, another well-known physicist.

==Religious views==

Lord Rayleigh was an Anglican. Though he did not write about the relationship of science and religion, he retained a personal interest in spiritual matters.Peter J. Bowler (2014). "Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain", University of Chicago Press. p. 35 When his scientific papers were to be published in a collection by the Cambridge University Press, Strutt wanted to include a religious quote from The Bible, but he was discouraged to do so, as he later reported:
Still, he kept his wish and the quote was printed in the five-volume collection of scientific papers.Richard Duncan (2008). "Elements of Faith", New Leaf Publishing Group., p. 77
In a letter to a family member, he also wrote about his rejection of materialism and spoke of Jesus Christ as a moral teacher:

==Honours and awards==

Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour as well as a type of surface wave known as a Rayleigh wave. The asteroid 22740 Rayleigh was named in his honour on 1 June 2007. The rayl, a unit of acoustic impedance, is named for him.
