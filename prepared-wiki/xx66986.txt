==Posthumous controversy==

In 1998, 11 years after de Mello's death, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under the leadership of its Cardinal-Prefect Joseph Ratzingerhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-j-reid-jr/the-last-20th-century-pope_b_2669582.html (who later became Pope Benedict XVI), conducted a review of de Mello's work and released a lengthy comment expressing their theological concerns.  While the group showed appreciation for many of de Mello's writings, some positions were found to be 'incompatible with the Catholic faith'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19980624_demello_en.html|title=Vatican: the Holy See - Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - NOTIFICATION CONCERNING THE WRITINGS OF FR. ANTHONY DE MELLO, SJ|accessdate=29 December 2010.  The Specific quote being, "With the present Notification, in order to protect the good of the Christian faithful, this Congregation declares that the above-mentioned positions are incompatible with the Catholic faith and can cause grave harm."[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFDEMEL.HTM|title=EWTN Global Catholic Network|accessdate=24 November 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061115051847/http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfdemel.htm| archivedate= 15 November 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It was seen by some as an attempt by Rome to undermine the clergy in Asia and indicative of widening fissures between Rome and the Eastern Church.http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?206551
