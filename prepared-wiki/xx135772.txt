The Wil Tower is a wooden observation tower which was built in the forest of Wil in Switzerland.[tpl]cite news  | title = Höchster Punkt von Wil feiert Eröffnung | publisher = 20 minuten | date =4 July 2006|url=http://www.20min.ch/news/stgallen/story/28926901 | accessdate =26 January 2008[/tpl] (German language)  The tower site is located some 747 meters above sea level.  It was opened for public use on 8 July 2006.

==Construction==

The tower is an open structure, rising on 6 slanted columns from three equidistant ground support points.  A circular stairway (189 steps) rises in the center of the columns, opening onto a roofed observation deck.  Although the structure rises some 34 meters above the ground, the deck is barely above the surrounding trees.A picture of the tower may be found at http://wiler.turm.ch, the Official Website of the installation  
The structure is entirely of wood, all obtained from the surrounding forest.  The columns are Douglas-fir and the stairway is of Silver fir.  The wood was harvested in the early months of 2005 and allowed to dry naturally for a year before construction began.
