[tpl]About |the city in Australia||Gold Coast (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Gold Coast[/tpl]

The Gold Coast is a coastal city in southeastern Queensland on the east coast of Australia. The city is [tpl]convert|94|km|mi[/tpl] south of the state capital Brisbane. It is the second most populous city in the state, the sixth most populous city in the country, and the most populous non-capital city in Australia. The Gold Coast has the largest cross-state metropolitan area population in Australia, due to the inclusion of Tweed Heads, New South Wales in its metropolitan area. The Gold Coast's metropolitan area converges with that of Greater Brisbane, forming part of an urban conurbation of over 3 million people.http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Products/3218.0~2008-09~Main+Features~Queensland?OpenDocument#PARALINK5 Preliminary population estimates for local government areas, 2009. Local government areas included in the calculation of the South East Queensland population are: Shire of Beaudesert, Shire of Boonah, City of Brisbane, Shire of Caboolture, City of Caloundra, Shire of Esk, Shire of Gatton, Gold Coast City, City of Ipswich, Shire of Kilcoy, Shire of Laidley, Logan City, Shire of Maroochy, Shire of Noosa, Shire of Pine Rivers, Redcliffe City, and Redland City.
While the origin of the city's name is debatable, the name "Gold Coast" was bestowed upon the city by real estate investors. The first settlement in what is now South East Queensland was as a penal colony at Redcliffe. The Gold Coast region remained largely uninhabited by Europeans until 1823 when explorer John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach. The hinterland's red cedar supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century. Later in 1875, Southport was surveyed and established and grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for upper class Brisbane residents.
The Gold Coast region grew significantly after the establishment of the Surfers Paradise hotel in the late 1920s. The area boomed in the 1980s as a leading tourist destination and in 1994, the Gold Coast City local government area was expanded to encompass the majority of the Gold Coast's metropolitan area, becoming the second most populous local government area in Australia after the City of Brisbane. The Gold Coast is today a major tourist destination with its sunny subtropical climate, surfing beaches, canal and waterway systems, its high-rise dominated skyline, theme parks, nightlife, and rainforest hinterland, making tourism one of its most significant industries.

==History==

Lieutenant James Cook became the first European to note the region when he sailed along the coast on 16 May 1770 in the HM Bark Endeavour. Captain Matthew Flinders, an explorer charting the continent north from the colony of New South Wales, sailed past in 1802. Escaped convicts from the Moreton Bay penal settlement hid in the region. The region remained largely uninhabited by Europeans until 1823 when explorer John Oxley landed at Mermaid Beach, which was named after seeing a cutter named Mermaid. The hinterland's red cedar supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century. The western suburb of Nerang was surveyed and established as a base for the industry. Later in 1875, Southport was surveyed and established and quickly grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for the upper class Brisbane residents.
In 2007, the Gold Coast overtook the population of Newcastle, New South Wales to become the sixth largest city in Australia and the largest non-capital city.Gold Coast sixth largest city John McCarthy and Greg Stolz From: The Courier-Mail 11 November 2007

==Geography==

Gold Coast City lies in the southeast corner of Queensland, to the south of Brisbane, the state capital. The Albert River separates Gold Coast from Logan City, a suburban area of Brisbane.
Gold Coast City stretches from Beenleigh and Russell Island to the border with New South Wales (NSW) approximately [tpl]convert|56|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south, and extends from the coast west to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range in World Heritage listed Lamington National Park.
The southernmost town of Gold Coast City, Coolangatta, includes Point Danger and its lighthouse. Coolangatta is a twin city with Tweed Heads located directly across the NSW border. At [tpl]Coord|28.1667|S|153.55|E|region:AU-QLD[/tpl], this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of North Stradbroke is slightly further east). From Coolangatta, approximately forty kilometres of holiday resorts and surfing beaches stretch north to the suburb of Main Beach, and then further on Stradbroke Island. The suburbs of Southport and Surfers Paradise form Gold Coast's commercial centre. The major river in the area is the Nerang River. Much of the land between the coastal strip and the hinterland was once wetlands drained by this river, but the swamps have been converted into man-made waterways (over [tpl]convert|260|km|mi[/tpl] in length[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/boating-969.html |title=Gold Coast City Council – Boating |publisher=Goldcoastcity.com.au |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]
[/ref] or over 9 times the length of the canals of Venice, Italy) and artificial islands covered in upmarket homes. The heavily developed coastal strip sits on a narrow barrier sandbar between these waterways and the sea.
To the west, the city borders a part of the Great Dividing Range commonly referred to as the Gold Coast hinterland. A [tpl]convert|206|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] section of the mountain range is protected by Lamington National Park and has been listed as a World Heritage area in recognition of its "outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species".UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves The area attracts bushwalkers and day-trippers.

===Urban structure===

Gold Coast includes suburbs, localities, towns and rural districts.

===Waterways===

Waterfront canal living is a feature of the Gold Coast, and most canal frontage homes have pontoons. The Gold Coast Seaway, between The Spit and South Stradbroke Island, allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from The Broadwater and many of the city's canal estates. Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent longshore drift and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.
Residential canals were first built on the Gold Coast in 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek and to the north along the Gold Coast Broadwater, South Stradbroke Island, Coomera River and southern Moreton Bay. Early canals included Florida Gardens, Isle of Capri which were under construction at the time of the 1954 flood. Recently constructed canals include Harbour Quays and Riverlinks completed in 2007. There is over [tpl]convert|890|km|mi[/tpl] of constructed residential waterfront land within the city that is home to over 80,000 residents.

===Beaches===

The city consists of [tpl]convert|57|km|mi[/tpl] of coastline with some of the most popular surf breaks in Australia and the world including, South Stradbroke Island, The Spit, Main Beach, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Nobby Beach, Miami, Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Heads, Tallebudgera Beach, Palm Beach, Currumbin Beach, Tugun, Bilinga, Kirra, Coolangatta, Greenmount, Rainbow Bay, Snapper Rocks and Froggies Beach. Duranbah Beach is one of the world's best known surfing beaches and is often thought of as being part of Gold Coast City, but is actually just across the New South Wales state border in Tweed Shire.
There are also beaches along many of the Gold Coast's [tpl]convert|860|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of navigable tidal waterways. Popular inland beaches include Southport, Budds Beach, Marine Stadium, Currumbin Alley, Tallebudgera Estuary, Jacobs Well, Jabiru Island, Paradise Point, Harley Park Labrador, Santa Barbara, Boykambil and Evandale Lake.

====Beach safety and management====

Gold Coast has Australia’s largest[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_standard2.aspx?PID=50 |title=Gold Coast Lifeguard Services |publisher=Goldcoast.qld.gov.au |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl] professional surf lifesaving service to protect people on the beaches and to promote surf safety throughout the community. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries carries out the Queensland Shark Control Program (SCP) to protect swimmers from sharks.Queensland Shark Control Program Sharks are caught by using nets and baited drumlines off the major swimming beaches. Even with the SCP, sharks do range within sight of the patrolled beaches. Lifeguards will clear swimmers from the water if it is considered that there is a safety risk.
Gold Coast beaches have experienced periods of severe beach erosion. In 1967, a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise what to do about the beach erosion. The Delft Report[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.qld.gov.au/1972cabdocs/beach.asp |title=Delft Report |publisher=Archives.qld.gov.au |date=20 May 2004 |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]  was published in 1971 and outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches including Gold Coast Seaway,Gold Coast Seaway[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] works at Narrowneck that resulted in the Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy[tpl]cite web|url=http://coastalmanagement.com.au/projects/NGCBPS/ |title=Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy |publisher=Coastalmanagement.com.au |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]  and works at the Tweed River that became the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tweedsandbypass.nsw.gov.au/ |title=Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project |publisher=Tweedsandbypass.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]
By 2005 most of the recommendations of the 1971 Delft Report had been implemented. Gold Coast City commenced implementation of the Palm Beach Protection StrategyPalm Beach Protection Strategy[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] but ran into considerable opposition from the community participating in a NO REEF protest campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sargesdailysurf.com/archives/news/2004/0104/240104b.html |title=No Reef Campaign |publisher=Sargesdailysurf.com |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] The Gold Coast City Council then committed to completing a review of beach management practices to update the Delft Report. The Gold Coast Shoreline Management PlanGold Coast Shoreline Management Plan[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] will be delivered by organisations including the Environmental Protection Agency, Gold Coast City and the Griffith Centre for Coastal Management. Gold Coast City is also investing into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway that provides sustainable transport along Gold Coast beaches. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]

==Climate==

Gold Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), with mild winters and warm and humid summers. The city experiences substantial summer precipitation mostly concentrated in thunderstorms and heavy showers with rain events occasionally lasting up to a few weeks at time giving residents "the Summer blues", while winter is pleasant and warm with little rain. In fact, it is this pleasant winter weather that both the city and the Sunshine Coast—the coastal region north of Brisbane—are named after and internationally renowned for. Extreme temperatures recorded have ranged from [tpl]convert|2.5|°C|°F|sigfig=2[/tpl] on 19 July 2007 to [tpl]convert|40.5|°C|°F|sigfig=3[/tpl] on 22 February 2005, although the city rarely experiences temperatures above [tpl]convert|35|°C|°F|sigfig=2[/tpl] in summer or below [tpl]convert|5|°C|°F[/tpl] in winter.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=23 January 2014|title=Climate statistics for Australian locations: Gold Coast Seaway|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_040764_All.shtml[/tpl]

==Governance==

The city is governed at the local level by the Gold Coast City Council, the second largest local government in the country behind Brisbane City. Its origins lie in two local governments established at the 10 June 1949 elections: Town of the South Coast, which merged the Town of Coolangatta, Town of Southport and part of the Shire of Nerang; and the Shire of Albert, which took in a large surrounding region. On 23 October 1959, South Coast was renamed Gold Coast and on 16 May 1959 it was proclaimed as a City. The modern Gold Coast City was created in 1995 when the existing City and the Shire of Albert merged. In 2008, the Gold Coast shrank slightly as part of Queensland government's reorganisation of local government boundaries, losing the Beenleigh and Eagleby areas north of the Albert River to Logan City Council. The Gold Coast City Council has 14 councillors, each representing a division of the City. Businessman Tom Tate was elected Mayor of the Gold Coast in 2012. Former mayors include Ron Clake, Gary Baildon, Lex Bell, Ray Stevens, Ern Harley and Sir Bruce Small, who was responsible for the development of many of the canal estates that are now home to thousands of Gold Coast residents.
The Gold Coast area is represented at the state level by ten members in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The seats they hold are: Albert, Broadwater, Burleigh, Coomera, Currumbin, Gaven, Mudgeeraba, Robina, Southport and Surfers Paradise. Federally, the Gold Coast area is represented by three members in the House of Representatives, whose seats are Fadden (northern), Moncrieff (central) and McPherson (southern). Some western areas are part of the Forde, which is centred in the Scenic Rim Region.
Historically, Gold Coast has tilted conservative.  The three Gold Coast federal divisions have returned only Liberal Party representatives since 1986, and Labor has historically only done well around Labrador and Coolangatta.  At the state level, Labor has been fairly competitive in the Gold Coast for most of the early part of the 21st century.  However, as part of its massive landslide in the 2012 state election, the Liberal National Party now holds every seat there.
Southport Courthouse is the city's major courthouse and has jurisdiction to hear petty criminal offences and civil matters up to A$250,000. Indictable offences, criminal sentencing and civil matters above A$250,000 are heard in the higher Supreme Court of Queensland which is located in Brisbane. There are subsidiary Magistrates Courts, also located at the northern and southern suburbs of Beenleigh and Coolangatta.

==Economy==

In fifty years, Gold Coast City has grown from a small beachside holiday destination to Australia's sixth largest city (and the country's most populous non-capital city). Situated within South East Queensland’s growth corridor, the city is now considered Australia’s fastest growing large city, with a 5-year annual average population growth rate of 3.4%, compared to 1.2% for Australia.Australian Bureau of Statistics, June 2008 Cat No. 3218.0 – Population estimates by Statistical Local Area 2001–2008 Gross Regional Product has risen from A$9.7 billion in 2001, to A$15.6 billion in 2008, a rise of 61 percent.National Institute of Economic and Industry Research (NIEIR) November 2007 Tourism remains fundamental to Gold Coast City’s economy, with almost 10 million visitors a year to the area.Tourism Research Australia Domestic and International Visitor Surveys In the past the economy was driven by the population derived industries of construction, tourism and retail. Some diversification has taken place, with the city now having an industrial base formed of marine, education, information communication and technology, food, tourism, creative, environment and sports industries. These nine industries have been identified as the key industries by the Gold Coast City Council to deliver the city’s economic prosperity. Gold Coast City’s unemployment rate (5.6 per cent) is below the national level (5.9 per cent).ABS Regional Labour Force Survey February 2009

Since the opening of what was then the world's highest residential tower in 2005 (it is now the fifth highest), the Q1 building has been a destination for tourists and locals alike. It is the second highest public vantage point in the southern hemisphere after the Eureka Tower in Melbourne. The observation deck at level 77 is the highest of its kind in Queensland and offers views in all directions, from Brisbane to Byron Bay. It towers over the Surfers Paradise skyline, with the observation deck 230 metres (755 feet) high, and the spire extending nearly another hundred metres up. In total, the Q1 is 322.5 metres (1058 feet) high.
Another famous tourist attraction are the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the Meter Maids dispense coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle. The Maids are still a part of the Surfers Paradise culture but the scheme is now run by private enterprise.

The car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using the car as their sole mode of travelling to work.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=LGA33460&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=LGA33460&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=LPTD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Method%20of%20Travel%20to%20Work%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Transport%20Access%20&%20Use& |title=Method of Travel to Work by Sex — Gold Coast (Local Government Area) |accessdate=12 April 2008 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|authorlink=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=27 June 2007 |format=Excel Spreadsheet |quote=Consists of people who solely either drove or travelled as a passenger in a car to work.[/tpl] A number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The Pacific Motorway (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the Logan Motorway (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the Pacific Highway at the New South Wales/Queensland border near Tweed Heads. Before the Tugun Bypass was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at Tugun. The Gold Coast Highway services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at Helensvale. Other arterial roads include the Smith St Motorway, Reedy Creek Road, Nerang-Broadbeach Road and Bermuda St.
The Gold Coast's main provider of public bus services is Surfside Buslines.Surfside Bus Services[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] It is a part of the TransLink initiative by the Queensland Government, designed to coordinate the public transport providers in Brisbane and the surrounding areas. The majority of the bus routes that Surfside operates run along the Gold Coast Highway. Services are frequent during the day, with intervals being as little as 5 minutes between Southport and Burleigh Heads. Queensland Rail operates rail services from Brisbane to the Gold Coast along the Gold Coast railway line. The line follows the same route as the Beenleigh railway line, continuing on after reaching Beenleigh. It then follows a route similar to that of the Pacific Motorway, passing stations at Ormeau, Coomera, Helensvale, Nerang and Robina before terminating at Varsity Lakes. An extension to Coolangatta and the Gold Coast Airport is proposed.
Gold Coast Airport is located at Coolangatta, approximately [tpl]convert|22|km|mi[/tpl] south of Surfers Paradise. Services are provided to interstate capitals and major cities as well as to major New Zealand cities, Malaysia, Japan and Singapore.
The increasing population has resulted in an increase in traffic congestion.[tpl]Cite book |author=Gold Coast City Council |authorlink= Gold Coast City Council |title= Gold Coast City Transport Plan |url= http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_standard.aspx?PID=7644 |accessdate=26 September 2009 |date= 2 September 2009 |page= 26 |chapter= 2.3 |chapterurl= http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/attachment/publications/strategy/transport_strategy_2.pdf |postscript= [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] This has led to the Queensland State Government and Gold Coast City placing more effort into investing into sustainable transport. Examples include public transport including a new ferry service, community bike hire[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/tendersweb/Tender.aspx?TenderID=435 |title=Gold Coast Community Bike Hire |publisher=Goldcoast.qld.gov.au |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] and a rapid transit system and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists such as the Gold Coast Oceanway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://goldcoastrapidtransit.qld.gov.au/ |title=Gold Coast Rapid Transit |publisher=TransLink.com.au |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]

===Utilities===

Electricity
Electricity for the Gold Coast is sourced from Powerlink Queensland at bulk supply substations which is provided via the National Electricity Market from an interconnected multi-State power system. The Government-owned electricity corporation Energex distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland.
Water supply
The Hinze Dam [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Nerang is the population's main water supply. The Little Nerang Dam which feeds into Hinze Dam can supplement part of the city area's water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate Gold Coast Water. Reforms of the way in which the water industry is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008–09. Gold Coast City also sources water from Wivenhoe Dam, west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe's capacity, becomes low.
Water shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/t_gcw.asp?PID=5909 |title=Gold Coast City Council – Pimpama Coomera Master Plan Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Goldcoast.qld.gov.au |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Gold Coast Water has also been recognised for its world leading HACCP water quality management system by the World Health Organisation which published Gold Coast Water's system as a good model for managing water quality and safety from catchment to tap.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsp0506/en/ |title=WHO | Water safety plans: Managing drinking-water quality from catchment to consumer |publisher=Who.int |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]  The Gold Coast desalination plant, which opened in February 2009,[tpl]cite news |first=Charmaine |last=Kaine |title= Smooth start for Tugun Desalination Plant |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/27/2502850.htm  |publisher=ABC News |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009 [/tpl] has the capacity to supply up to 133 megalitres of desalinated water per day.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.watersecure.com.au/GoldCoastDesalinationPlant.htm |title=WaterSecure – a new source of pure water |accessdate=26 July 2009 |author=WaterSecure [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
