[[Anacardiaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Anacardiaceae, Rosid families

The Anacardiaceae (the cashew or sumac family) are a family of flowering plants bearing fruits that are drupes and in some cases producing urushiol, an irritant. The Anacardiaceae include numerous genera with several of economic importance.  Notable plants in this family include cashew (in the type genus Anacardium), mango, poison ivy, sumac, smoke tree, marula, yellow mombin, and cuachalalate.  The genus Pistacia (which includes the pistachio and mastic tree) usually is now included, but has sometimes been placed in its own family, Pistaciaceae.[tpl]Cite journal| journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2008 | volume = 95 | pages = 241–251 | title = Phylogenetics and reticulate evolution in Pistacia (Anacardiaceae) | author = Tingshuang Yi, Jun Wen, Avi Golan-Goldhirsh and Dan E.

==Description==

Trees or shrubs each with inconspicuous flowers, highly poisonous, sometimes foul smelling resinous or milky sap.Natural System of Botany (1831), pages 125-127
Resin-canals located in the inner fibrous bark of plants fibrovascular system found in the stems, roots and leaves is characteristic of all members of this family; resin-canals located in the pith is a characteristic of many of the cashew family species and several species have them located in the primary cortex or the regular bark.  Tannin sacs are also widespread among the family.Systematic Anatomy, (1908), page 244-248
The wood of Anacardiaceae has the frequent occurrence of simple small holes in the vessels, occasionally  in some species side by side with scalariform holes (in Campnosperma, Micronychia and Anaphrenium argenteum).  The simple pits are located along the vessel wall and in contact with the parenchyma.(see Vessel element) 
Leaves are alternate or rarely oppositeNorthern United States (1897), page 25
and without stipule.
Flowers grow at the end of a branch or stem or at an angle from where the leaf joins the stem and have bracts.
Often with this family bisexual and male flowers on some plants, and bisexual and female flowers on others or flowers  having both stamens and pistils (perfect).  Calyx with 3 to 7 cleft sepals and the same number of petals, occasionally no petals, overlapping each other in the bud.  Stamens twice as many or equal to the number of petals, inserted at the base of the
fleshy ring or cup-shaped disk, and inserted below the pistil(s).
stamen stalks separate, anthers able to move.
Flowers have the ovary free, but the petals and stamen are borne on the calyx.
In the stamenate flowers, ovaries are 1-celled.  In the pistillate flowers, ovaries are 1-celled or sometimes 4-5-celled.  1-3 styles and 1 ovule in each cavity.
Fruits rarely opening at maturity
and are most often drupes.
Seed coats are very thin or are crust like. Little or no endosperm.  Fleshy cotyledons.
Solitary seeds with no albumen around the embryo.

==Taxonomy==

In 1759, Bernard de Jussieu arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme. That classification included a description of an order called Terebintaceæ which contained a suborder that included Cassuvium (Anacardium), Anacardium (Semecarpus), Mangifera, Connarus, Rhus and Rourea.  In 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, nephew of Bernard de Jussieu, published that classification scheme.Genera plantarum (1789) pages 368-369
Robert Brown described a subset of Terebintaceae called Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ in 1818, using the herbarium that was collected by Christen Smith during a fated expedition headed by James Kingston Tuckey to explore the River Congo.  The name and genera were based on the order with the same name that had been described by Bernard de Jussieu in 1759.  The herbarium from that expedition contained only one genus from the family, Rhus.Expedition... (1818) Appendix V, pages 430-431
Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1824, used Robert Browns name Cassuvlæ or Anacardeæ, wrote another description of the group and filled it with the genera Anacardium, Semecarpus, Holigarna, Mangifera, Buchanania, Pistacia, Astronium, Comocladia and Picramnia.Prodromus Systematis Naturalis (1824), pages 62-66
John Lindley described the "Essential character" of Anacardiaceæ, the "Cashew Tribe" in 1831, adopting the order that was described by Jussieu but abandoning the name Terebintaceæ.  He includes the genera which were found in de Candolle's Anacardieæ and Sumachineæ: Anacardium, Holigarna, Mangifera, Rhus and Mauria.
The genus Pistacia has sometimes been separated into its own family, Pistaciaceae, based on the reduced flower structure, differences in pollen, and the feathery style of the flowers. However, the nature of the ovary does suggest it belongs in the Anacardiaceae, a position which is supported by morphological and molecular studies, and recent classifications have included Pistacia in the Anacardiaceae.Pistaciaceae Martinov, GRIN Taxonomy for Plants, accessed 28 March 2010James L.

==Ecology==

The cashew family is more abundant in warm or tropical regions with only a few species living in the temperate zones. Mostly native to tropical Americas, Africa and India.  Pistacias and some species of Rhus can be found in southern Europe,  Rhus species can be found in much of North America and Schinus inhabit South America exclusively.

==Uses==

Members of this family produce cashew and pistacia nuts and others produce mango and marula fruits.
Some members produce a viscous or adhesive fluid which turns black and is used as a varnish or for tanning and even as a mordant for red dyes.
Medicinally the edible nuts from this family have a reputation for being good for the brain.
