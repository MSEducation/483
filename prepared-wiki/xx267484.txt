[[CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso]]

CATEGORIES: CERN

The CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) project is a physics project of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The aim of the project is to analyse the hypothesis of neutrino oscillation by directing a beam of neutrinos from CERN's facilities to the detector of the OPERA experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), located in the Gran Sasso mountain in Italy. The CNGS facility is housed at the Meyrin site of CERN, at the Francoâ€“Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://proj-cngs.web.cern.ch/proj-cngs/Download/CNGSDGVE/cngsdgve.pdf|title=General Description of the CERN Project for a Neutrino Beam[/tpl] It uses the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator as a source of high-energy protons.

==History==

Approval for the CNGS project was signed by the CERN Council in December 1999,[tpl]cite web |url=http://proj-cngs.web.cern.ch/proj-cngs/ProjetOverview/projetoverview2002.htm |title=CNGS project Overview[/tpl] with civil engineering on the project starting the following September.[tpl]cite web |url=http://proj-cngs.web.cern.ch/proj-cngs/PDF_files/IEEE06_CNGS.pdf |title=CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS): First Beam[/tpl] Construction of the tunnels and service caverns was completed in mid-2004, with equipment installation completed in summer 2005 and commissioning being carried out throughout spring 2006. The first proton beam was sent to the target on 11 July 2006, with the CNGS facility being approved for physics operations on 18 August 2006.

==Function==

A proton beam is taken from the SPS at [tpl]val|400|ul=GeV[/tpl] and is made to collide with a graphite target within the CNGS tunnel. The resulting particles, most importantly kaons and pions among many other particles, are then focused by magnetic lensing and travel [tpl]convert|1|km[/tpl] down the CNGS tunnel in a vacuum tube. These particles are naturally unstable and as they travel along the tunnel they decay into muons and muon neutrinos. This beam of particles then collides into an iron graphite target. The final target stops the remaining protons, pions and kaons, but the neutrinos continue their flight unaffected, as they rarely interact with matter. The number of muons is measured at this point, which gives an indication of the beam's profile and intensity. This beam then passes [tpl]convert|732|km[/tpl] through the crust of the Earth and it is expected that during flight some of the muon neutrinos convert into other neutrino types such as tau neutrinos. Once the beam arrives at Gran Sasso, the OPERA and ICARUS experiments are used to detect the neutrinos.

==Results==

The first candidates for neutrino oscillation were announced in May 2010 by the OPERA experiment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lngs.infn.it/lngs_infn/contents/lngs_en/public/educational/physics/NEWS_docs/OPERA_press_rel_May_2010.pdf|title=Tau Neutrino embargo[/tpl]
On 22 September 2011, the OPERA collaboration garnered international attention when they released a preprint[tpl]cite arxiv|eprint=1109.4897|title=Measurement of the neutrino velocity with the OPERA detector in the CNGS beam|date=22 September 2011|author=T.
