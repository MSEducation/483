Considered to be a "miracle village," the village of Shimojō has defied the declining birthrate noted in Japan as well increasing capital revenue by increasing worker efficiency. In 2003-2005, the village birthrate, "was 2.12...against the national average of 1.25 in 2005" while, "...personal expenses were cut by ¥450 million".Kohei, Yano. "'Another Road' Shown by Small Villages - Ooshika & Shimojo in Nagano Pref." Japan Spotlight: Economy, Culture & History. (2007). Reforms have thus allowed the village to grow without government subsidies due to its sufficient capital which has allowed the village, as village head Ito Kihei remarks, to offer, "places to enjoy...such facilities as a mobile library, a swimming pool and a culture hall while enriching the child-raising environment and assistance by making medical expenses free for children through junior high school."
As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 4,169 and a density of 110.70 persons per km². The total area is 37.66 km².
