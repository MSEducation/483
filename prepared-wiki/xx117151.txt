==Books and accomplishments==

Snyder has written five and co-edited two books, one of them, Thinking the Twentieth Century (2012), with the late distinguished historian Tony Judt, written while the latter was dying of ALS disease. The numerous publications in which Snyder's essays have appeared include: the International Herald Tribune,  The Nation, New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, The New Republic, Eurozine, Tygodnik Powszechny, the Chicago Tribune, and the Christian Science Monitor.
Snyder states that he has a reading and/or speaking knowledge of eleven European languages. This enabled him to make good use of primary and archival sources in Germany and Central Europe in researching his book, Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, which was published in 2010 to considerable acclaim. Reviewer Igor Lukes noted:  A word about sources. Snyder introduces his Bibliography with an impressive list of seventeen archival collections located in six countries. Yet a closer look at the text and endnotes reveals that evidence drawn from archives represents but a small fraction of this book’s evidentiary apparatus. This is a project built on secondary sources. The point is that many of Snyder’s secondary sources are of the kind that even many specialists are unlikely to have seen, which is hardly surprising because Snyder can do research in ten languages, some pretty exotic. Bloodlands takes nuggets from each source, then assembles them into an original mosaic. Almost every paragraph of the book’s eleven chapters is supported by one or several previously underutilized secondary sources.Igor Lukes, Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin," Republic of Letters'', May 2011.  
Snyder himself calls the question of languages very important: "If you don't know Russian, you don't really know what you're missing. . . . We can only see as much, and we can only go as far as our languages take us. I wrote this book in English, but there are very important conversations that are happening in German, Russian, Polish and so on among those historians, and the book is addressed to all of them."Timothy Snyder, interviewed by "Prospero", The Economist (Books), June 2011. Bloodlands has been  translated into twenty languages.Best-selling author, historian Timothy Snyder to deliver W.
