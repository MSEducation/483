Safwan ibn Umayyah ([tpl]lang-ar|صفوان بن أمية[/tpl]) (died 661) was a sahaba (companion) of Muhammad from the Banu Jumah clan of the Quraish tribe. He is the son of Umayah ibn Khalaf, one of the leaders of Quraish.
He was married to Najiyah bint al-Walid ibn al-Mughira, the daughter of Walid ibn Mughira
Abu Fakih was a slave of Safwan ibn Umayya. Abu Fakih accepted Islam, and when Safwan came to know that Abu Fakih had become a Muslim, he subjected him to great torture. When Abu Bakr came to know of the pitiable condition of Abu Fakih, he purchased him from his master and set him free.
Safwan ibn Umayyah also participated in the battle of Badr where his father died and he fled.
He conspired with Umayr ibn Wahb to kill Muhammad.
Safwan's paternal cousin was Wahb ibn Umayr, the son of Umayr ibn Wahb.
Safwan's wife, Najiyah, converted to Islam before her husband, after the conquest of Makka. Safwan ibn Umayya fled, but Muhammed sent Wahb ibn Umayr after him, with Muhammed's cloak as token of safe-conduct. Safwan returned and became friends with Muhammed, although he did not convert to Islam until after the battles of Hunayn and at-Ta'if. (Al Muwatta Hadith 28.44)
