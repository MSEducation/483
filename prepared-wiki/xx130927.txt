[[Covert hypnosis]]

CATEGORIES: Neuro-linguistic programming, Hypnosis, Mind control

Covert hypnosis refers to an attempt to communicate with another person's unconscious mind without that person noticing. As it often takes place in the course of a seemingly regular conversation, it is also known as conversational hypnosis or sleight of mouth. The objective is to change the personâ€™s behavior subconsciously so that the target believes that they changed their mind of their own volition. When performed successfully, the target is unaware that they have been hypnotized or that anything unusual has occurred.

Covert hypnosis is a phenomenon not too different from indirect hypnosis, as derived from Milton H. Erickson and popularized as "The Milton Model"[tpl]cite web|title=776  MiltonModel|url=http://nlpuniversitypress.com/html2/Mi-My08.html|work=Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding|publisher=NLP University Press|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Robert B.

but the defining feature is that the hypnotized individual subsequently engages in hypnotic phenomena without conscious effort or choice. Covert hypnosis, like "Ericksonian Hypnosis",[tpl]clarify|date=June 2012[/tpl] "operates through covert and subtle means... to reach deeper levels of consciousness than are touched by the surface structure of language".[ref]

It is the concept that an individual, 'the hypnotist,' can control another individual's behavior via gaining rapport.

During hypnosis, the operator (hypnotist) makes suggestions. The subject is intended to not be completely aware, on a conscious level, of the manipulation.

As the subject listens while feeling a psychological connection with the hypnotist and the hypnotist displaying behaviors such as confidence and understanding, the hypnotist then presents linguistic data in the form of metaphor:

In other words, this process builds most likely unconscious states within the listener, and then associates those states through covert conditioning, also known as covert anchoring, thereby forming unconsciously controlled behaviors and thoughts. Often methods of tricking the listener to believe that the hypnotist is talking about something else other than the subject are employed, for instance, by shifting use of time and use of identity in language. One famous example is employed by Milton H. Erickson "and a tomato can be happy".

===An example===

A state of forgetfulness can be elicited by talking about what it feels like to be in that state in a manner that implies the other person is currently experiencing it. Once this state is at a heightened peak the hypnotist can then talk about that state relating to a concept like the unsuspecting subject's name (a phenomenon called name amnesia), and the subject will suddenly be unaware of his/her name on questioning (provided the suggestions implied immediate effect and the reader is suggestible enough to be influenced in this way). The purpose of covert hypnosis is to shut down or at least reduce the use of analytical mind in a person. This can be achieved fairly quickly by someone with practice.
