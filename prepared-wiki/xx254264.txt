Norepinephrine and dopamine disinhibitors (NDDIs) are a class of drugs which act at specific sites to disinhibit downstream norepinephrine and dopamine release in the brain.[tpl]cite book | author = Ian P.

Agomelatine, an antidepressant which disinhibits norepinephrine and dopamine release in the frontal cortex by antagonizing 5-HT2C receptors,[tpl]cite journal | author = Millan MJ, Gobert A, Lejeune F, et al. | title = The novel melatonin agonist agomelatine (S20098) is an antagonist at 5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptors, blockade of which enhances the activity of frontocortical dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 306 | issue = 3 | pages = 954–64 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12750432 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.103.051797 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12750432[/tpl] was the first drug to be described as an NDDI.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stahl SM | title = Novel mechanism of antidepressant action: norepinephrine and dopamine disinhibition (NDDI) plus melatonergic agonism | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology / Official Scientific Journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP) | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 575–8 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17681087 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145707008000 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1461145707008000[/tpl] While many other drugs also antagonize 5-HT2C receptors to some degree or another, they tend to be very non-specific in their actions, and as a result, the term "NDDI" has generally, though not always (for instance, fluoxetine has been called an NDDI in addition to SSRI due to its blockade of 5-HT2C),[tpl]cite book | author = Stephen M.

Another drug that has been referred to as an NDDI in the medical literature is flibanserin,[tpl]cite book | author1 = Stephen M. Stahl | author2 = S. M.

Aside from agomelatine, fluoxetine, and flibanserin, as of present, no other drugs have been described as NDDIs in the medical literature, despite the fact that many other existing drugs possess effects consistent with those of the definition of an NDDI. In any case, more drugs labeled specifically as NDDIs may be seen in the future.
