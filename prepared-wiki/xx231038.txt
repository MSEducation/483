Africa in Motion (AiM) is an annual African film festival which takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, in late October/early November. The primary aim of the festival is to offer audiences in Scotland the opportunity to view the best of African cinema from across the continent. AiM 2013 will be the 8th edition showcasing African cinema, the main hosting venue being Edinburgh's Filmhouse Cinema. The festival was founded in 2006 by Lizelle Bisschoff, a South African researcher based in the UK.

AiM’s programme includes both contemporary and classic African cinema. Numerous film categories are covered including features, shorts, documentaries, animation, Nollywood, horror and experimental work. Many of the films screened at AiM have never before been shown in Scotland, and the festival thus provides opportunities for the Scottish audience to view African films. AiM 2008 toured a number of cities across the UK, including Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Derby, Dundee, Glasgow, Inverness, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Stirling. Since 2009 the festival has also toured to rural venues in the Scottish Highlands and Islands in November following the main festival.  
AiM hostes a short-film competition showcasing the work of young and emerging African filmmakers, with the winner receiving a cash prize. Film screenings are accompanied by a range of events including panel discussions, symposiums, workshops, African music performances, exhibitions, storytelling sessions and others.
Directors invited to the festival have included Jean-Marie Teno from Cameroon, Gaston Kaboré from Burkina Faso, and South African Richard Stanley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Director-to-guest-at-African.4494839.jp |title=Director to guest at African film festival |work=Edinburgh Evening News |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019201837/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Director-to-guest-at-African.4494839.jp| archivedate= 19 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
