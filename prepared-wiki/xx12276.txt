Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Weather. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.  Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere,Glossary of Meteorology. Hydrosphere. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.Glossary of Meteorology. Troposphere. Retrieved on 27 June 2008. just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = American Meteorological Society | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate =14 May 2008 [/tpl]  When used without qualification, "weather", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.
Weather is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another.  These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow.  Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year.  On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually.  Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate and global climate change.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.  Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating.  Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.  The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.  Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has modified weather patterns.
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.  A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.  However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies.  A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System.  The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.

==Cause==

On Earth, common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011018windsurface.html|title=Weather Forecasters May Look Sky-high For Answers|last=O'Carroll|first=Cynthia M.|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA)|date=18 October 2001[/tpl]
Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics.  In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the indirect sunlight.NASA.

Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.
Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate).Windows to the Universe. Earth's Tilt Is the Reason for the Seasons! Retrieved on 28 June 2008. This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.Ron W.

Donald Ahrens|title=Meteorology Today|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing|edition=8th|year=2006|isbn=0-495-01162-2|oclc=224863929[/tpl]  On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface heats the air above it and the air expands, lowering the air pressure and its density.Michel Moncuquet. Relation between density and temperature. Retrieved on 28 June 2008. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient accelerates the air from high to low pressure, creating wind, and Earth's rotation then causes curvature of the flow via the Coriolis effect.Encyclopedia of Earth. Wind. Retrieved on 28 June 2008. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.
The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.Spencer Weart. The Discovery of Global Warming. Retrieved on 28 June 2008. This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, though weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through the scientific study of weather, meteorology. It is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.http://okdk.kishou.go.jp/library/training/Seasonal%20Forecasts%20and%20Predictability.doc

==Shaping the planet Earth==

Weather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances.NASA. NASA Mission Finds New Clues to Guide Search for Life on Mars. Retrieved on 28 June 2008. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface.West Gulf River Forecast Center.

===Effects on populations===

Weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events.

Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.Klaus Weickmann, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith.

==Modification==

The aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail.American Meteorological Society A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.[tpl]cite news   | last = Huanet | first = Xin| title = Beijing disperses rain to dry Olympic night| publisher = Chinaview| date = 9 August 2008| url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/09/content_9079637.htm| accessdate =24 August 2008 [/tpl]
Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:
The effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources, food and fiber production, economic development, and human health.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

==Microscale meteorology==

Microscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale, about 1 km or less. These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as "mesoscale and microscale meteorology" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud "puffs" and other small cloud features.[tpl]cite book | last = Rogers | first = R. | title = A Short Course in Cloud Physics | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-7506-3215-1 | pages = 61–62[/tpl]
