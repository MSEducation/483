Thomas Dam (May 15, 1915 - November 12, 1989) was a Danish woodworker and fisherman who designed and invented the original troll doll also Known  as the "Good Luck Troll". He created the toy during a period of financial distress,and carved it from wood. Soon, the family had started up a new business and Dam earned enough to buy himself a small factory where the dolls were produced in plastic. Dam created many different trolls as well as plastic baby dolls. Dam formed "Dam Things" to market the dolls. Dam trolls are now considered collectors' items.[tpl]cite book|last=Walsh|first=Tim|title=Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&pg=PA187|accessdate=20 September 2012|date=2005-10-01|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740755712|pages=187â€“[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10D4F936376B1A70&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Trolling around town|last=UEBELHERR|first=JAN|date=October 17, 2005|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=20 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F86CF6F42050171&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=American company can continue making troll dolls|date=May 17, 2002|work=Associated Press|accessdate=20 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/04/arts/04trol.html?_r=0|title=New Babes in Toyland: Trollz|last=Sheff|first=David|date=January 4, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 September 2012[/tpl]
