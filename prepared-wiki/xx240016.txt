==Critical reception==

Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating:
 
 To put it mildly, life's changed a bit for Ben Hudson since he and his folky crossover group The Library just missed the top 40 with 'Too Late, Too Late' in 2007. The Library are no more, while Hudson himself has been taken under the wing of none other than Kanye West – producer of Jay-Z, critic of Taylor Swift and a bona fide pop superstar in his own right.
 
 Following the number two smash 'Supernova' comes 'White Lies', which like the rest of upcoming album Straight No Chaser has been "executive produced" by West. A shameless admission of being economical with the truth in pursuit of love, it doesn't quite have the explosive pull of its predecessor. Despite that, it's still a diverting enough synth-driven track that succeeds in fusing Hudson's melodic strengths and ear for a hook with the downbeat feel of West's 808s & Heartbreak album. 
The song was awarded a 3 star.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a180215/mr-hudson-white-lies.html|work=Digital Spy|author=Mayer Nissim|title=Mr Hudson – 'White Lies'|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl]
