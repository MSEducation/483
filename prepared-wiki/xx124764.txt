Girl's Own Paper was a British story paper catering for girls and young women, published from 1880 until 1956.

==Publishing history==

The first weekly number of the Girl's Own Paper appeared on January 3, 1880. As with its male counterpart the Boy's Own Paper, the magazine was published by the Religious Tract Society (which subsequently became Lutterworth Press). In October 1929, the title became Girl's Own Paper and Woman's Magazine but in 1930 the Woman's Magazine  became a separate publication. In December 1947 the name was changed to Girl's Own Paper and Heiress. By 1951 it was called  Heiress incorporating the Girl's Own Paper. In 1956 Heiress closed down, and the name "Girl's Own Paper" ceased to exist. Facsimile reprints of volume 1 to 4 were published by Eureka Press, Japan, in 2006.

==Contents==

The G.O.P. provided a mix of stories and educational and improving articles, with 'Answers to Correspondents' and occasional coloured plates, poetry and music. The paper serialised the exploits of the explorer Kate Marsden in the 1890s when she was lauded by the Royal Geographical Society.[tpl]cite book|last=Anderson|first=Monica|title=Women and the Politics of Travel, 1870-1914|date=2006|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=0838640915|page=164-169|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0838640915[/tpl]
From 1908, the weekly magazines were dropped and the paper included more information on serious careers for girls and advice on style and dress. Long serials became less common, being replaced by shorter stories. From the 1930s, a greater proportion of its material was directed at younger readers. There were school stories, stories of kidnapped princesses and articles about film stars, although the contents became more serious during World War II.
Volumes 39 & 40 of 1917-18 were entitled; The Girls Own Paper and Woman's Magazine; presumably the two publications were merged for economy purposes as a result of World War I.

==Famous contributors==

Many contributors are unknown outside the G.O.P. pages, but they include Noel Streatfeild, Rosa Nouchette Carey, Sarah Doudney (1841-1926), Angela Brazil, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Richmal Crompton and Baroness Orczy.

==Role in popular culture==

In her history of the G.O.P., E Honor Ward writes: "The G.O.P. was an important and positive influence on generations of girls and women, and a vital outlet for women's writing and ideas, for more than three-quarters of a century".
