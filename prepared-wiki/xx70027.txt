==History==

The bank was originally established in 1924 under Sun Yat-sen's administration in Guangzhou. Following the success of the Northern Expedition, the Central Bank took over the role of central bank for China from the Bank of China in 1928, with its headquarters in Shanghai. Before 1949, it was one of China's "Big Four" national banks, along with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China.
After the loss of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War by the Kuomintang (KMT) and its subsequent retreat to Taiwan in 1949, the Central Bank of China also moved along with the government to Taiwan. Until it was re-established as central bank in 1961, the Bank of Taiwan acted as the de facto central bank in Taiwan. The Bank of Taiwan issued the New Taiwan dollar until 2000, when the Central Bank of China finally took over the task. In 2000 the English name of the Central Bank of China was renamed "Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)" along with a host of other renamings under the Chen Shui-bian administration of state-owned corporations with "China" in their name, such as the Chunghwa Post.
