It is the tenth-largest city in the Balkans after Istanbul, Athens, Belgrade, Bucharest, Sofia, Thessaloniki, Zagreb, Skopje and Tirana.
Plovdiv's history spans 6,000 years, with traces of a Neolithic settlement dating to roughly 4000 BC,[tpl]Cite book | last =Rodwell | first =Dennis | title =Conservation and Sustainability in Historic Cities | publisher= Blackwell Publishing| year =2007 | isbn =1-4051-2656-6 | page =19 [/tpl] ranking it among the world's oldest cities. Plovdiv was known in the West for most of its recorded history by the Greek name Philippopolis (Φιλιππούπολις), which was introduced in 340 BC.[tpl]cite book |last=Bilinis |first=Alex |title=The Eagle has two Faces |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=1-4567-7870-6 |page=73 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jrjjTX2WWCkC&pg=PA73&dq=known+plovdiv+greek&hl=el&ei=NPEmTqCRDsiCOs6Q9K8K&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22Plovdiv%20through%20most%20of%20its%20history%20was%20known%20as%20Philippoupolis%22&f=false[/tpl] Plovdiv was originally a Thracian city before later becoming a Greek and a major Roman one. In the Middle Ages, it retained its strategic regional importance, changing hands between the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires. It came under Ottoman rule in the 14th century. In 4 January 1878, Plovdiv was liberated from Ottoman rule by the Russian army and was within the borders of Bulgaria until July, the same year, when it became the capital of an autonomous Ottoman region of Eastern Rumelia. In 1885, it and Eastern Rumelia itself became part of Bulgaria.
Plovdiv is situated in south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the Maritsa River. The city has historically developed on seven syenite hills, some of which are [tpl]convert|250|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as "The City of the Seven Hills".
Plòvdiv is host to cultural events such as the International Fair Plovdiv, the international theatrical festival "A stage on a crossroad", the TV festival "The golden chest". There are many remains preserved from antiquity such as the ancient Plovdiv Roman amphitheatre, Roman odeon, Roman Stadium, the archaeological complex Eirene and others.
The oldest American educational institution outside the United States was founded in Plovdiv in 1860, which was later moved to Sofia – today's American College of Sofia.

==Name==

Plovdiv was given various names throughout its long history. It was originally a Thracian settlement by the name of Eumolpias (Εὐμολπιάς), named after the mythical Thracian king Eumolpos, son of Poseidon.[tpl]cite book|last=Alicia Morales Ortiz, Cristóbal Pagán Cánovas, Carmen Martínez Campillo (eds.)|title=The Teaching of modern greek in Europe |publisher=EDITUM |isbn=84-8371-938-X |page=64 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ktd7tk5pqisC&pg=PA64&dq=plovdiv+thracian+greek&hl=el&ei=7D4sTtz2DtDCtAaR1o2KDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzgo#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20the%20second%20of%20macedonia%20conquered%20the%20village%2C%20founded%20by%20the%20Thracian%20king%20eumolpus%20about%20the%20year%201200%20Bc%22&f=false[/tpl] Philip II of Macedon conquered the area in 342–341 BC and renamed the city Philippoupolis ([tpl]lang-el|Φιλιππούπολις[/tpl]); the later Thracian name for the city, Pulpudeva, is a translation.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eUjV1Fd3W8oC&pg=PT333&dq=plovdiv+thracian++neolithic&hl=bg&ei=MUcsTt7IB43CswbHz9ycDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=plovdiv%20thracian%20%20neolithic&f=false |title=Between Two Motherlands: Nationality and Emigration Among the Greeks of Bulgaria, 1900–1949, Theodora Dragostinova, Cornell University Press, 2011, ISBN 0-8014-4945-6,underline remark # 47 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 14 April 2011 |accessdate= 10 August 2011[/tpl] After the Romans took control of the area, the city was named [tpl]lang-la|Trimontium[/tpl], meaning the Three Hills. The Slavic name occurred in different variants, Pəldin (Пълдин), Pləpdiv (Плъпдив) and Ploudin (Плоудин), based on the city's later Thracian name Pulpudeva, while the current variant Plovdiv was documented (as Пло(в)дївь) for the first time in a Bulgarian apocryphal chronicle of the 11th century. The city was known as Philippopolis in Western Europe well into the early 20th century. The city was known as Filibe in Turkish during the Ottoman Empire.
The asteroid (minor planet) 3860 Plovdiv is named after the city. It was discovered by the Bulgarian astronomer Violeta G. Ivanova on 8 August 1986. Plovdiv Peak ([tpl]convert|1040|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is also named after Plovdiv.

==Geography==

Plovdiv is on the banks of the Maritsa river, approximately [tpl]convert|152|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The city is in the southern part of the Plain of Plovdiv, an alluvial plain forming the western portion of the Upper Thracian Plain. The heights of Sredna Gora rise to the northwest, to the east are the Chirpan Heights and the Rhodope mountains surround the plain from the south.[tpl]Cite book |last=|first= |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=145 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ... et al. [/tpl] The city had originally developed to the south of Maritsa, and expanded across the river only within the last 100 years. Modern Plovdiv covers an area of [tpl]convert|101|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], which is less than 0.1% of Bulgaria's total area. This makes the city the most densely populated in the country with 3,769 inhabitants per km².
Inside the city proper are six syenite hills, called tepeta. In the beginning of the 20th century there used to be seven of them, but one (Markovo tepe) was destroyed. Traditionally the citizens have called them Dzhendem tepe, Bunardzhik, Sahat tepe, Nebet tepe, Dzhambaz tepe and Taksim tepe. The last three form the area of the Three Hills ([tpl]lang-bg|Трихълмие[/tpl]), a lively section of the city centre.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.milarodino.com/bg/13_centuries/city/plovdiv/ |title=Седемте чудеса на България – Пловдив |publisher=Milarodino.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Antiquity===

Plovdiv has settlement traces dating from the Neolithic, roughly 6000 BC. Archaeologists have discovered fine potteryPre-historic Art Archaeological Museum Plovdiv.[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl]"Plovdiv: New ventures for Europe's oldest inhabited city". The Courier. January–February 2010.
and other objects of everyday life from as early as the Neolithic Age, showing that in the end of the 4th millennium BC. there already was an established settlement there.Детев, П.

According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Plovdiv's written post-Bronze Age history lists it as a Thracian fortified settlement named Eumolpias. In 4th century BC the city was a centre of a trade fair (called panegyreis).История на България, Том 1, Издателство на БАН, София, 1979, p. 142. In 342 BC, it was conquered by Philip II of Macedon,История на България, Том 1, Издателство на БАН, София, 1979, p. 206. the father of Alexander the Great, who renamed it "Φιλιππόπολις", Philippopolis or "the city of Philip" in his own honour. Later, it was reconquered by the Thracians who called it Pulpudeva (a reconstructed translation of Philipopolis)История на Пловдив[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]
In 72 BC it was seized by the Roman general Marcus Lucullus but was soon restored to Thracian control. In AD 46 the city was finally incorporated into the Roman Empire by emperor Claudius,[tpl]Cite book |last=Dimitrov |first=B. |title=The Bulgarians – the first Europeans |publisher=University press "St Climent of Ohrid" |location=Sofia |page=17 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-07-1757-4 |year=2002 [/tpl] it was called Trimontium (City of Three Hills) and served as metropolis (capital) of the province of Thrace. It gained a city status in late 1st century.История на България, Том 1, Издателство на БАН, София, 1979, p. 307. Trimontium was an important crossroad for the Roman Empire and was called "The largest and most beautiful of all cities" by Lucian. Although it was not the capital of the Province of Thrace, the city was the largest and most important centre in the province.Lenk, B. – RE, 6 A, 1936 col. 454 sq. In those times, the Via Militaris (or Via Diagonalis), the most important military road in the Balkans, passed through the city.Николов, Д. Нови данни за пътя Филипопол-Ескус, София, 1958, p. 285

The city had an advanced water system and sewerage. It was defended with a double wall. Many of those are still preserved and can be seen by tourists. Today only a small part of the ancient city has been excavated.PlovdivCity.net, посетен на 10 ноември 2007 г.

===Middle Ages===

The Slavs had fully settled in the area by the middle of the 6th century and changed the ethnic proportions of the region.[tpl]Cite book |last=Dimitrov |first=B. |title=The Bulgarians – the first Europeans |publisher=University press "St Climent of Ohrid" |location=Sofia |page=25 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-07-1757-4 |year=2002 [/tpl] With the establishment of Bulgaria in 681 Philipopolis became an important border fortress of the Byzantine Empire. It was captured by Khan Krum in 812 but the region was fully incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire in 834 during the reign of Khan Malamir.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 66 ISBN 954-427-216-X. It remained in Bulgarian hands for a relatively short time until it was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 855–856.Gjuzelev, p. 130 (Gjuzelev, V., (1988) Medieval Bulgaria, Byzantine Empire, Black Sea, Venice, Genoa (Centre Culturel du Monde Byzantin). Published by Verlag Baier).Bulgarian Historical Review, p. 9 (Bulgarian Historical Review (2005), United Center for Research and Training in History, published by Publishing House of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, v.33:no.1-4). Under Byzantine control the city became the centre of Paulician heretics transported from the eastern borders of the empire to serve as military settlers on the European frontier with Bulgaria. From Philippopolis the influence of dualistic doctrines spread to Bulgaria forming the basis of the Bogomil heresy. Under tsar Simeon the Great (893–927) the city and most of the Byzantine possessions in the Balkans were conquered by the Bulgarian Empire. The city possibly remained in Bulgarian hands under Simeon's son, Peter I (927–969).Делев, "Българската държава и общество при управлението на цар Петър", История и цивилизация за 11. клас, 2006. However, the city is described at the time of Constantine VII in the 10th century as being within the Byzantine eparchía of Thrake, within the théma (province) of  Thrakoon. Around the year 1000 Philippopolis gave its name to a newly created théma of which it was the seat of administration."Philippopolis." Brill’s New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and , Helmuth Schneider. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. The University of Manchester Library. 02 October 2013 http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/philippopolis-e920140 The historian John Fine describes Philippopolis as being a Byzantine possession at the time it was sacked by the Russian ruler Sviatoslav I of Kiev in 969.Fine, pp. 160–161, 186: John V.A. Fine Jr., The Early Medieval Balkans, Ann Arbor, 1983.
The city again came to be known as Philippopolis and became Byzantine in character. Aime de Varennes in 1180 encountered the singing of Byzantine songs in the city that recounted the deeds of Alexander the great and his predecessors, over 1300 years before.Vacalopoulos, Apostolos E. Origins of the Greek Nation. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1970) p. 22.
Byzantine rule was succeeded by that of the Latin Empire in 1204, and there were two short interregnum periods as the city was twice occupied by Kaloyan of Bulgaria before his death in 1207.Агенция Фокус – Цар Калоян получава корона, скиптър и знаме от кардинал Лъв, посетен на 17 ноември 2007 г. In 1208 Kaloyan's successor Boril was defeated by the Latins in the Battle of Philippopolis.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 180 ISBN 954-427-216-X. Under Latin rule, Plovdiv was the capital of the Duchy of Philippopolis governed by Renier de Trit, and later on by Gerard de Strem. Bulgarian rule was re established during the reign of Ivan Asen II between 1225 and 1229. In 1263 Plovdiv was conquered by the restored Byzantine Empire and remained in Byzantine hands until it was re-conquered by George Terter II of Bulgaria in 1322.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 253 ISBN 954-427-216-X. Byzantine rule was restored once again in 1323, but in 1344 the city and eight other cities were surrendered to Bulgaria by the regency for John V Palaiologos as the price for Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's support in the Byzantine civil war.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 272 ISBN 954-427-216-X.

===Ottoman Rule===

In 1364, the Ottoman Turks under Lala Shakhin Pasha seized Plovdiv.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 274 ISBN 954-427-216-X.[tpl]Cite book |last= |first= |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=139 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ... et al. [/tpl] The Turks called the city Filibe which comes from "Fhilip". It was the capital of Rumelia until 1382 when the Ottomans captured Sofia which became the main city of the province. Plovdiv survived as one of the major cultural centers for Bulgarian culture and tradition.

====National revival====

Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Plovdiv was a focal point for the Bulgarian national movement in the Eastern Rumelia province of the Empire. During that period Plovdiv was a major economic center along with Constantinople, Odrin and Solun. The richer citizens constructed beautiful houses many of which can still be seen in the Architectural reserve Old Plovdiv. Plovdiv was a sanjak centre of Rumelia Province between 1364–1864 and was the sanjak centre of Edirne Vilayet between 1864–1878 during Ottoman Rule.
Plovdiv had an important role in the struggle for Church independence which was according to some historians a peaceful bourgeois revolution. Plovdiv became the center of that struggle with leaders such as Nayden Gerov, Dr Valkovich, Joakim Gruev and whole families. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated and in 1850 modern secular education began when the "St Cyrill and Metodius" school was opened. On 11 May 1858 the day of Saints Cyril and Methodius was celebrated for the first time, this later became a National holiday which is still celebrated today. In 1858 in the Church of Virgin Mary the Christmas liturgy was served for the first time in the Bulgarian language since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. In 1868 the school expanded into the first grammar school. Some of the intellectuals, politicians and spiritual leaders of the nation graduated that school.
The city was liberated from the Ottomans during the Battle of Philippopolis in 1878.

===Eastern Rumelia===

According to the Treaty of San Stefano on 3 March 1878 the Principality of Bulgaria included the lands with predominantly Bulgarian population. Plovdiv which was the biggest and most vibrant Bulgarian city was selected as a capital of the restored country and for a seat of the Temporary Russian Government.Очерци из историята на Пловдив (стр. 80 – Космополитен град. Махали и квартали в ново време) Great Britain and Austria-Hungary, however, did not approve that treaty and the final result of the war was concluded in the Congress of Berlin which divided the newly liberated country into several parts. It separated the autonomous region of Eastern Rumelia from Bulgaria and Plovdiv became its capital. The Ottoman Empire created a constitution and appointed a governor.Ministry of Foreign Affairs, History and Geography[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] As of 1 January 1885, the city of Plovdiv had a population of 33,442, of which 16,752 were Bulgarians (50%), 7,144 Turks (21%), 5,497 Greeks (16%), 2,168 Jews (6%), 1,061 Armenians (3%), 151 Italians, 112 Germans, 112 Romani people, 80 French people, 61 Russians and 304 people of other nationalities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://historymuseumplovdiv.com/index.php?lang_id=1&prm=actions&subprm=%20Zfdghkl:|title=Източна Румелия между Европа и Ориента|publisher=Регионален исторически музей Пловдив|language= Bulgarian|accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]
In the spring of 1885 Zahari Stoyanov formed the Secret Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in the city which actively conducted propaganda for the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On 5 September several hundred armed rebels from Golyamo Konare (now Saedinenie) marched to Plovdiv. In the night of 5–6 September these men led by Danail Nikolaev took control of the city and removed from office the General-Governor Gavril Krastevich. A provisional government was formed led by Georgi Stranski and universal mobilization was announced.Аndreev, J. The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars (Balgarskite hanove i tsare, Българските ханове и царе), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 322 ISBN 954-427-216-X. After the Serbs were defeated in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, Bulgaria and Turkey reached an agreement according to which the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia had a common government, Parliament, administration and army. Today 6 September is celebrated as the Unification Day and the Day of Plovdiv.

===Recent history===

After the unification, Plovdiv remained the second city in Bulgaria in population and significance after the capital Sofia. The first railway in the city was built in 1874, and in 1888 it was linked with Sofia. Plovdiv was on the early route of the Orient Express. In 1892 Plovdiv became host of the First Bulgarian Fair with international participation which was succeeded by the International Fair Plovdiv. After the liberation the first brewery was inaugurated in the city.
In the beginning of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. German, French and Belgian capital was invested in the city in development of modern trade, banking and industry. In 1939 there were 16,000 craftsmen and 17,000 workers in manufacturing factories, mainly for food and tobacco processing. During the Second World War the tobacco industry expanded as well as the export of fruit and vegetables. In 1943 1,500 Jews were saved from deportation in concentration camps by the archbishop of Plovdiv, Cyril, who later became the Bulgarian Patriarch.
On 6 April 1956 the first trolleybus line was opened and in the 1950s the Trimontsium Hotel was constructed. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a construction boom and many of the modern neighborhoods took shape. In the 1970s and 1980s antique remains were excavated and the Old Town was fully restored. In 1990 the sports complex "Plovdiv" was finished. It included the largest stadium and rowing canal in the country. In that period Plovdiv became the birthplace of Bulgaria's movement for democratic reform, which by 1989 had garnered enough support to enter government.
Plovdiv has hosted specialized exhibitions of the World's Fair in 1981, 1985, and 1991.

Population of Plovdiv:

At the first census after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1880 with 24,053 citizenshttp://historymuseumplovdiv.com/index.php?lang_id=1&prm=actions&subprm=%20Zfdghkl: Plovdiv is the second largest city behind Ruse, which had 26 163 citizens then,[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] while the capital Sofia had 20 501 citizens then. As of the 1887 census Plovdiv was the largest city in the country for several years with 33,032 inhabitants compared to 30,428 for Sofia. According to the 1946 census Plovdiv was the second largest city with 126,563 inhabitants compared to 487,000 for the capital.

===Ethnicity and religion===

According to records provided by Bulgarian scholars, although the city had an ethnic Bulgarian majority in the fist half of the 19th century, a major part of it was fully or partly hellenized, described under the name "Gudilas". Thus, the city could be considered of Greek or Bulgarian majority in 1830, on whether the Gudilas were considered part of the one or the other community. This process of hellenization declined from the 1830s, as Bulgarians became more assertive and socially mobile.[tpl]cite book|last=Detrez|first=Raymon|title=Relations between Greeks and Bulgarians: The Gudilas of Plovid|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=9780754609988|page=34|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=RjGidYC9pUYC&pg=PA35&dq=gudilas+plovdiv&hl=el&sa=X&ei=jxKMUbiELOTb7AaA2oDgBg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22deciding%20whether%20Plovdiv%20had%20a%20Bulgarian%20or%20Greek%20majority%22&f=false[/tpl]

In its ethnic character Plovdiv is the second or the third largest cosmopolitan city inhabited by Bulgarians after Sofia and possibly Varna. According to the 2001 census from population of 338 224 inhabitants the Bulgarians were 302 858 (90%). Stolipinovo in Plovdiv is the largest Gypsy neighbourhood in the Balkans, having a population of around 20,000 alone, further Gypsy ghettos are Hadji Hassan Mahala and Sheker Mahala. Therefore the census number is a deflation of the number of the Gypsies and they are most likely the second largest group after the Bulgarians, most of all because the Muslim Gypsies in Plovdiv claim to be of Turkish ethnicity and Turkish-speaking at the census ("Xoraxane Roma")."The Relations of Ethnic and Confessional Consciousness of Gypsies in Bulgaria", Elena Marushiakova, Vesselin Popov For further information see the article The Gypsies in Plovdiv.

In their honour the royal mint of Philippopolis coined money featuring the face of the ruling emperor as well as the types of athletic events held in the stadium. Only a small part of the northern section with 14 seat rows can be seen today; the larger part lies under the main street and a number of buildings.
The Roman forum dates from the reign of Vespasian in 1st century and was finished in the 2nd century. It is near the modern post office next to the Odeon. It has an area of 11 hectares and was surrounded by shops and public buildings. The forum was a focal point of the streets of the ancient city.

==Economy==

Located in the middle of a rich agricultural region, since the beginning of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as an industrial center. Food processing, tobacco, brewing and textiles were the main pillars of the industry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bg.bgp.bg/BGP_articles_191/%d0%9f%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b2 |title=Plovdiv – BGP |publisher=Bg.bgp.bg |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] During Communist rule the city's economy greatly expanded and was dominated by heavy industry; it still produces lead and zinc, machinery, electronics, motor trucks, chemicals and cosmetics. After the fall of Communism in 1989 and the collapse of Bulgaria's planned economy, a number of industrial complexes were closed.
Plovdiv has one of the country's fastest-growing economies with average GDP growth of 12%–13%. As of 2005, the total revenues were 9.4 billion leva (approximately 4.8 billion euro), which was 88% more than in 2001. The profits for the same period rose 4.5 times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.plovdiv24.com/31885.html |title=Plovdiv regains its business positions |publisher=News.plovdiv24.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] Unemployment is 6,5%[tpl]cite web |url=http://plovdiv.mconet.biz/index.php?action=fullnews&id=338825&category=1763&category_name=%E2%84%96%D0%82%E2%84%96%D0%9E%D1%91%20%E2%84%96%D0%98%D1%91 |title=Unemployment in Plovdiv|publisher=Plovdiv.mconet.biz |date=28 July 2007 |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] which is lower than the national average. One recent problem is the municipality's administrative borders, which almost completely coincide with the city limits. Due to the constant increase of investments which are $465,000,000 for 2005 some of the businesses have to be redirected to the Maritsa or Rodopi municipalities such as the industrial zone of Radinovo village.
Industry has been expanding again since the late 1990s, with manufacturing plants built in the city or in its outskirts, mainly the municipality of Maritsa. In this period, some €500,000,000 has been invested in construction of new factories. Some of the new plants include the Liebherr refrigerator plant with 1,850 employees and a capacity of 450,000 items per year, the Socotab tobacco processing plant (2,000 employees), a bicycle plant (500 workers, capacity 500,000 units),[tpl]cite web |url=http://big.bg/modules/news03/comment_new.php?com_itemid=13466 |title=Bicycle factory in Tsaratsovo |publisher=Big.bg |date= |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] а Schneider electronics factory,A new Schneider factory to be built in Radinovo near Plovdiv. a biodiesel plant, the Bulsaphil textile plant (790 workers), and several electronics and high-tech plants producing CD players and other electronic equipment.

Due to the demand for business office space Business Park Plovdiv was going to be constructed in the district of Trakiya, but the advance of the global financial crisis has put a halt on the project.
