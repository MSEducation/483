==Biography and career==

Mike Zambidis started training in martial arts before he was nine years old with his brother Spiros Zambidis and his best friend Lazaros Filipas. He has trained in Shotokan, Kickboxing, Boxing, Muay Thai  and  Pankration.BloodyKnux interview, 2007 He started competing professionally in 2000, scoring a string of victories over notable opponents. So far, the majority of his wins have been knock-outs. He has been technically knocked out twice himself early in his career due to cuts, but after 2002, his next technical knock-out defeat came in 2008 against Andy Souwer in an extra round.
From 2000 till 2002, Zambidis defeated notable kickboxer Jenk Behic twice, Gürkan Özkan twice, Baris Nezif, Wanlop Sosathopan, Bakari Tounkara, Matteo Sciacca and Petr Polak. In 2002, he knocked out the strong and experienced"IronLife""Fighting Master" Dutch-Moroccan Hassan Kassrioui. On November 26, 2002 he won the K-1 Oceania MAX 2002 title after defeating John Wayne Parr in the final.
In 2003, promoter Tarik Solak arranged Zambidis' debut fight in Japan against 2002 World K-1 Max Champion Albert Kraus, whom he knocked out in the 2nd round. In April 2005, Zambidis knocked out with a right hook the popular Norifumi "Kid" Yamamoto, in front of thousands of the Japanese kickboxer's fans. Zambidis' weakness seems to be receiving low kicks, as was seen in his 2006 defeat by Japanese Yoshihiro Sato, who, despite getting hurt by Zambidis' punches, managed to land many kicks and knees which racked up enough points to "secure a unanimous decision."Kid's Quick KO Headlines Hero's" Retrieved 22-Mar-2011 Zambidis is a 4 time national champion in kickboxing as well as holding a large number of international titles.
In addition to his many outstanding fights, the K-1 World MAX 2010 Final 16 match on October the 3rd, 2010 against Chahid Oulad El Hadj was notable as being one of the most exciting of his career. In addition, as stated by ring side commentators "Sugar" Ray Sefo and Michael "The Voice" Schiavello, this contest was one by which a standard was set for other K-1 fights. However, Zambidis did not make it to the final as he lost to Giorgio Petrosyan by unanimous decision, as the knock down he did to Petrosyan was not counted by the judges (and was controversially ruled a slip).K-1 Fight Video Against Oulad
Zambidis fought a rubber match (both having won 1 match apiece) with Australian Muay Thai champion John Wayne Parr in May 2011. He lost by TKO (three knockdowns) in round 1.
He defeated Reece McAllister by unanimous decision in the quarter-finals of the K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final in Athens, Greece on December 15, 2012.
