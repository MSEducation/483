Sellotape is a British brand of transparent, cellulose-based, pressure-sensitive adhesive tape, and is the leading brand in the United Kingdom. Sellotape is generally used for joining, sealing, attaching and mending. 
The term has become a genericised trademark in Britain, Ireland, Australia, Croatia, Greece,  India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,  Serbia,  Spain, Turkey, Macedonia, Zimbabwe, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia, and is used much in the same way that Scotch Tape came to be used in Canada and the United States, in referring to any brand of clear adhesive tape.

==History==

The name Sellotape was derived from Cellophane, at that time a trademarked name, with the "C" changed to "S" so that the new name could be trademarked.[tpl]cite book | last = Room | first = Adrian | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Trade Name Origins | publisher = Routledge | date = 1984 | location = | page = 156 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7102-0174-5[/tpl]
The tape was originally manufactured in 1937 by Colin Kinninmonth and George Gray, in Acton, West London.[tpl]cite book |title=Century Makers: One Hundred Clever Things We Take for Granted Which Have Changed Our Lives Over the Last One Hundred Years |first= David |last= Hillman |first2= David |last2= Gibbs|year= 1999|publisher=Welcome Rain |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Century_Makers.html?id=qWJFAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=[/tpl] From the 1960s to 1980s, the Sellotape company was part of Dickinson Robinson Group, a British packaging and paper conglomerate. In 2002, it was bought by Henkel Consumer Adhesives.
Sellotape Industrial was bought by Scapa Group plc in 1997, and their products continue to be to manufactured at its factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire.

==Products==

Sellotape Original is made using cellulose film derived from wood pulp. The cellulose film decomposes naturally in soil, and is naturally easy tear and non-static.
The Sellotape brand now covers a variety of tape products, and the word is frequently used to refer to other adhesive tapes in many countries due to its market exposure. As an example of a genericised trademark, it has an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary.

==Usage==

The tape can be used to repair tears in paper, or to attach pieces of paper or cardboard together for modelling. On fragile paper surfaces the tape can only be used once, as removing it will either tear the paper or remove the top layer of rough cardboard; on smooth painted surfaces it can generally be removed without leaving any trace.
