According to Albrecht Powell, the Pennsylvania Amish are not the largest group of U.S. Amish as is commonly thought. The Amish have settled in as many as twenty-four states, Canada, and Central America, though about 80% are located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. The greatest concentration of Amish is in Holmes and adjoining counties in northeast Ohio, about 100 miles from Pittsburgh. Next in size is a group of Amish people in Elkhart and surrounding counties in northeastern Indiana. Then comes the Amish settlement in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Amish population in the U.S. numbers more than 270,000 and is growing rapidly, due to large family size (seven children on average) and a church-member retention rate of approximately 80%."[tpl]cite web|last=Powell|first=Albrecht|title=Amish 101 - Amish Beliefs, Culture & Lifestyle, History of the Amish in America,|url=http://pittsburgh.about.com/cs/pennsylvania/a/amish.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=2012[/tpl]
