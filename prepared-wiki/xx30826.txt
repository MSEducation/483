==Plot==

Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is a lonely Atlanta surgeon obsessed with a woman named Helena (Sherilyn Fenn). After she is injured in a grievous hit-and-run motor vehicle accident in front of his home, he kidnaps and treats her in his house surreptitiously, amputating both of her legs.
Later, he amputates her healthy arms as well.
Though Helena is the victim of Nick's kidnapping and mutilation, she dominates the dialogue with her constant ridiculing of him for all of his shortcomings.
Eventually, Cavanaugh's actions are discovered by one of Helena's former co-workers. During a physical confrontation, Cavanaugh is killed, only to wake up and realize that the entire ordeal had been a dream he had at a hospital during Helena's surgery after the car accident.

The film performed poorly at the box office.
The exception was critic Gene Siskel who, on the TV show Siskel & Ebert, admitted "I went to the theater to see it expecting the worst", and called it, "a brave little movie that explored the provocative issue of how some frustrated men channel their inability to love a woman into cruelty."

==Music==

The music played during the scene where Helena showers in a fountain, while a party crowd watches was originally scored by the film's composer, Graeme Revell, based on the "Love Theme" used sparsely elsewhere in the film, with vocals by Bobbi Page. At the producers' request, "The Fountain Song" replaced Revell's score in the original release and the DVD. It was written and performed by Wendy Levy.
