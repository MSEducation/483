===Market top===

A market top (or market high) is usually not a dramatic event. The market has simply reached the highest point that it will, for some time (usually a few years). It is retroactively defined as market participants are not aware of it as it happens.
A decline then follows, usually gradually at first and later with more rapidity.
William J. O'Neil and company report that since the 1950s a market top is characterized by three to five distribution days in a major market index occurring within a relatively short period of time. Distribution is a decline in price with higher volume than the preceding session.

====Examples====

A recent peak for the broad U.S. market was October 9, 2007.  The S&P 500 index closed at 1,565 and the Nasdaq at 2861.50.

===Market bottom===

A market bottom is a trend reversal, the end of a market downturn, and precedes the beginning of an upward moving trend (bull market).
It is very difficult to identify a bottom (referred to by investors as "bottom picking") while it is occurring. The upturn following a decline is often short-lived and prices might resume their decline. This would bring a loss for the investor who purchased stock(s) during a misperceived or "false" market bottom.
Baron Rothschild is said to have advised that the best time to buy is when there is "blood in the streets", i.e., when the markets have fallen drastically and investor sentiment is extremely negative.http://www.fool.com/investing/small-cap/2007/05/02/buy-when-theres-blood-in-the-streets.aspx Buy When There's Blood in the Streets

==Secondary market trend==

Secondary trends are short-term changes in price direction within a primary trend.  The duration is a few weeks or a few months.
One type of secondary market trend is called a market correction. A correction is a short term price decline of 5% to 20% or so.Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee p. 479 A correction is a downward movement that is not large enough to be a bear market (ex post).
Another type of secondary trend is called a bear market rally (sometimes called "sucker's rally" or "dead cat bounce") which consist of a market price increase of only 10% or 20% and then the prevailing, bear market trend resumes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear-market-rally.asp|title=Bear Market Rally Definition|publisher=Investopedia[/tpl] Bear market rallies occurred in the Dow Jones index after the 1929 stock market crash leading down to the market bottom in 1932, and throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Japanese Nikkei 225 has been typified by a number of bear market rallies since the late 1980s while experiencing an overall long-term downward trend.

==Investor sentiment==

Investor sentiment is a contrarian stock market indicator.
By definition, the market balances buyers and sellers, so it's impossible to literally have 'more buyers than sellers' or vice versa, although that is a common expression. The market comprises investors and traders. The investors may own a stock for many years; traders put on a position for several weeks down to seconds.
Generally, the investors follow a buy low, sell high strategy.Bad Timing Eats Away at Investor Returns Traders attempt to "fade" the investors' actions (buy when they are selling, sell when they are buying). A surge in demand from investors lifts the traders' asks, while a surge in supply hits the traders' bids.
When a high proportion of investors express a bearish (negative) sentiment, some analysts consider it to be a strong signal that a market bottom may be near. The predictive capability of such a signal (see also market sentiment) is thought to be highest when investor sentiment reaches extreme values.Trying to Plumb a Bottom, By MARK HULBERT, http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122652105098621685.html Indicators that measure investor sentiment may include:[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
David Hirshleifer sees in the trend phenomenon a path starting with underreaction and ending in overreaction by investors / traders.

==Etymology==

The precise origin of the phrases "bull market" and "bear market" are obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary cites an 1891 use of the term "bull market". In French "bulle spéculative" refers to a speculative market bubble. The Online Etymology Dictionary relates the word "bull" to "inflate, swell", and dates its stock market connotation to 1714.[tpl]OEtymD|bull[/tpl]
The fighting styles of both animals may have a major impact on the names.Bull Market  When a bull fights it swipes its horns up; when a bear fights it swipes down on its opponents with its paws.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
One hypothetical etymology points to London bearskin "jobbers" (market makers),Bulls and bears who would sell bearskins before the bears had actually been caught in contradiction of the proverb ne vendez pas la peau de l'ours avant de l’avoir tué ("don't sell the bearskin before you've killed the bear")—an admonition against over-optimism.  By the time of the South Sea Bubble of 1721, the bear was also associated with short selling; jobbers would sell bearskins they did not own in anticipation of falling prices, which would enable them to buy them later for an additional profit.
Another plausible origin is from the word "bulla" which means bill, or contract.  When a market is rising, holders of contracts for future delivery of a commodity see the value of their contract increase.  However in a falling market, the counterparties—the "bearers" of the commodity to be delivered—win because they have locked in a future delivery price that is higher than the current price.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
