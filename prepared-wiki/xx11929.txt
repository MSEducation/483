===Critical reviews===

Reviews for When Harry Met Sally... were mostly positive. It has a rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 76 metascore on Metacritic. The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner "one of Hollywood's very best directors of comedy", and said that it was "most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations. But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan."[ref]
