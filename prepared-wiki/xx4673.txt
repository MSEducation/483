===Palanquin===

Palanquins, also known as palkis, were one of the luxurious methods used by the rich and noblemen for travelling. This was primarily used in the past to carry a deity or idol of a God, and many temples have sculptures of God being carried in a palki. Later on, it was primarily used by European noblemen and ladies from the upper classes of society prior to the advent of the railways in India.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Palanquin|title=Palanquin|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Ed., 1911|accessdate=18 June 2009[/tpl] Modern use of the palanquin is limited to Indian weddings and Pilgrimage.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Bullock cart and horse carriage===

Bullock carts have been traditionally used for transport, especially in rural India. The arrival of the British saw drastic improvements in the horse carriages which were used for transport since early days. Today, they are used in smaller towns and are referred as Tonga or buggies. Victorias of Mumbai are still used for tourist purposes, but horse carriages are now rarely found in the metro cities of India.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-01-18/delhi/27999341_1_tongas-turkman-gate-railway-stations|work=Online edition of the Times of India, dated 2009-01-18|title=Fading tongas on their last ride|author= Rumu Banerjee|accessdate=13 April 2009|date=18 January 2009[/tpl] In recent years large cities have banned the movement of bullock carts and other slow moving vehicles on the main roads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/04/08/stories/2002040800270100.htm|title=Imperial jhutka on an exit march|work=Online edition of The Hindu, dated 2002-04-08|author=Marianne De Nazareth|accessdate=18 June 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/12/19/stories/2002121900120300.htm|title=Road to nowhere|work=Online edition of The Hindu, dated 2002-12-19|author=Firoz Bakht Ahmed|accessdate=18 June 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=19 December 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=89693|title=Starting today, tourist buses, trucks can’t drive into city|work=Online edition of The Indian Express, dated 2004-07-01|accessdate=13 June 2009[/tpl]

===Bicycle===

Bicycles are a common mode of travel in much of India.  More people can now afford to own a cycle than ever before. In 2005, more than 40% of Indian households owned a bicycle, with ownership rates ranging from around 30% to 70% at the state level. Along with walking, cycling accounts for 50 to 75% of the commuter trips for those in the informal sector in urban areas.
Even though India is the second largest producer of bicycles in the world,[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060709/spectrum/main1.htm | title = The changing cycle | publisher = The Tribune, India | date = 9 July 2006 | accessdate = 18 June 2009[/tpl] a significant prejudice against bicycle riding for transport exists in some segments of the population, generally stemming from the status symbol aspect of the motor vehicle. In India, the word "bike" generally refers to motorcycle, and "cycle" refers to bicycle.
Pune was the first city in India to have dedicated lanes for cycles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-06-04/pune/27860685_1_cycle-lanes-chowk|title=Cycle track proposed on three city roads|date=4 June 2005|work=Abhijit Atre, TNN|publisher=ToI|language=Eng|accessdate=27 January 2010|location=Pune[/tpl] It was built for the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games. However, recent developments in Delhi suggest that bicycle riding is fast becoming popular in the metro cities of India. The Delhi government has decided to construct separate bicycle lanes on all major roads to combat pollution and ease traffic congestion.[tpl]cite web|last=Singh |first=Amit |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/jan/200110-cycle-lanes-Delhi-Cycling-Club.htm |title=Now, paddle your way across Delhi |publisher=Mid-day.com |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2010[/tpl]

===Hand-pulled rickshaw===

Hand-pulled rickshaw is still available in the city of Kolkata wherein a person pulls the rickshaw by hand. The Government of West Bengal proposed a ban on these rickshaws in 2005 describing them as "inhuman".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=52774 | title = Hand-pulled rickshaws to go off Kolkata roads | work=Online edition of The Indian Express, dated 2005-08-15 | accessdate = 23 April 2009[/tpl] Though a bill aiming to address this issue, termed as 'Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill', was passed by the West Bengal Assembly in 2006, it has not been implemented yet.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081031/jsp/calcutta/story_10035108.jsp | title = Rule review for rickshaw ban | work=Online edition of The Telegraph, dated 2008-10-31 | accessdate = 23 April 2009 | location=Calcutta, India | first=Our | last=Legal | date=31 October 2008[/tpl] The Government of West Bengal is working on an amendment of this bill to avoid the loopholes that got exposed when the Hand-pulled Rickshaw Owner's Association filed a petition against the bill.

===Cycle rickshaw===

Cycle rickshaws were introduced in India in the 1940s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/taj.htm|title=The Taj Mahal: Pollution and Tourism|last=Farrell|first=Sean|publisher=Trade and Environment Database (TED)(American University)|accessdate=29 November 2009[/tpl] They are bigger than a tricycle where two people sit on an elevated seat at the back and a person pedals from the front.

==Public road transport==

Public transport is the predominant mode of motorised local travel in cities. This is predominantly by road, since commuter rail services are available only in the seven metropolitan cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, while dedicated city bus services are known to operate in at least 25 cities with a population of over one million.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.nctr.usf.edu/jpt/pdf/JPT%208-1%20Singh.pdf|title=Review of Urban Transportation in India|author=Sanjay K. Singh|work=Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2005|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] Intermediate public transport modes like tempos and cycle rickshaws assume importance in medium size cities. However, the share of buses is negligible in most Indian cities as compared to personalized vehicles, and two-wheelers and cars account for more than 80 percent of the vehicle population in most large cities.
Traffic in Indian cities generally moves slowly, where traffic jams and accidents are very common.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enews20.com/news_Traffic_Accidents_Kill_At_Least_51_In_India_On_Monday_00221.html|title=Traffic Accidents Kill At Least 51 In India On Monday|publisher=ENews 2.0|author=Ted Moore|date=14 May 2007|accessdate=12 June 2009[/tpl] India has very poor records on road safely—around 90,000 people die from road accidents every year.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dorth.gov.in/writereaddata/sublinkimages/VMS9535399253.pdf | format = PDF | title = Report of Committee for study of the applicability of Variable Message Sign (VMS) on NHs inter-alia for finalization of Interim Guidelines. | publisher = Ministry of Road Transport and Highways | page = 2 | date = 24 October 2007 | accessdate = 6 June 2009[/tpl] At least 13 people die every hour in road accidents in the country,also in the year 2007 road accidents claimed more than 130,000 lives, overtaking China.[tpl]cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-17/india/28181973_1_road-accidents-road-fatalities-global-road-safety | title = India leads world in road deaths: WHO | publisher = TOI | date = 17 August 2009 [/tpl]

===Bus===

The oldest Indian state transport undertaking is North Bengal State Transport Corporation founded by the Raj Darbar of Koch Bihar Kingdom regime on 1 April 1945 with three buses and three trucks. It is still vibrant and running, providing service to commuters of North Bengal region. Buses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities,[tpl]cite web|url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/pucher/FINALarticleTransportPolicy.pdf|format=PDF|title=Urban transport crisis in India|author=John Pucher, Nisha Korattyswaropam, Neha Mittal, Neenu Ittyerah[/tpl] and serve as a cheap and convenient mode of transport for all classes of society. Services are mostly run by state government owned transport corporations. However, after the economic liberalisation, many state transport corporations have introduced various facilities like low-floor buses for the disabled and air-conditioned buses to attract private car owners to help decongest roads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bestundertaking.com/trans_land.asp|title=Landmarks in Transport|publisher=Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|accessdate=18 April 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090329223824/http://www.bestundertaking.com/trans_land.asp |archivedate=29 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmtcinfo.com/english/atpresent.htm|title=BMTC The Present|publisher=Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation|accessdate=18 April 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080517075730/http://www.bmtcinfo.com/english/atpresent.htm |archivedate = 17 May 2008[/tpl] Bengaluru was the first city in India to introduce Volvo B7RLE intra-city buses in India in January 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volvo.com/bus/india/en-in/news_and_events/press+releases/NewsItemPage.htm?channelId=1700&ItemID=1387&sl=en-gb|title=Volvo's first city buses in India operating|date=25 January 2006|publisher=Volvo Buses|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blnus/02091502.htm|title=Volvo to foray into city bus segment in India|date=9 January 2006|publisher=The Hindu Businessline|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Volvo-intra-city-buses-to-hit-B'lore-roads-on-Jan-17/152460/|title=Volvo intra-city buses to hit B'lore roads on Jan 17|date=11 January 2006 |publisher=The Financial Express|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl]

====Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS)====

New initiatives like Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems and air conditioned buses have been taken by the various state government to improve the bus public transport systems in cities. The idea of a BRT concept in India - based on the successful system in Curitiba, Brazil - was first introduced in the year 2000 in the form of a feasibility study for Bangalore carried out by Swedish consultants but was not implemented at the time. Today, however, the concept has caught on and Bus Rapid Transit systems already exist in Pune, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Jaipur with new ones coming up in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Bangalore and Hubli-Dharwad. High Capacity buses can be found in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Nagpur, Indore and Chennai.Urban transport in Nairobi, Kingston, Bangalore, Amman, Dakar

===Taxi===

Most of the traditional taxicabs in India are either Premier Padmini or Hindustan Ambassador cars.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/indias-amby-notches-up-half-century-411855.html | title = India's 'Amby' notches up half century | author = Chris Duggan | publisher = The Independent, UK | date = 15 August 2006 | accessdate = 23 June 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Depending on the city/state, taxis can either be hailed or hired from taxi-stands. In cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, taxis need to be hired over phone,[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2006/04/12/stories/2006041200610100.htm | title = When did you last call a taxi? | author = Anand Sankar | publisher = The Hindu | date = 12 April 2006 | accessdate = 23 June 2009 | location=Chennai, India[/tpl] whereas in cities like Kolkata and Mumbai, taxis can be hailed on the street. According to government of India regulations, all taxis are required to have a fare-meter installed.Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 : s. 74(2)(viii) There are additional surcharges for luggage, late-night rides and toll taxes are to be paid by the passenger. Since 2006, radio taxis have become increasingly popular with the public due to reasons of safety and convenience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/radio-taxis-in-india-to-go-up-to-174-000/233342/|work=Online edition of The Financial Express, dated 2007-10-28|title=Radio Taxis in India to go up to 174,000|accessdate=24 June 2009[/tpl] In cities and localities where taxis are expensive or do not ply as per the government or municipal regulated fares, people use share taxis. These are normal taxis which carry one or more passengers travelling to destinations either en route to the final destination, or near the final destination.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The passengers are charged according to the number of people with different destinations. A similar system exists for autorickshaws, known as share autos.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The city of Mumbai will soon be the first city in India, to have an "in-taxi" magazine, titled MumBaee, which will be issued to taxis which are part of the Mumbai Taximen's Union.

===Auto Rickshaw===

An auto rickshaw is a three-wheeler vehicle for hire that has both side doors and is generally characterised by a small cabin for the driver in the front and a seat for passengers in the rear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encarta.es/dictionary_1861587891_1861695788/nextpage.html|title=Autorickshaw|publisher=MSN Encarta|accessdate=18 June 2009[/tpl] Generally it is painted in yellow, green or black colour and has a black, yellow or green canopy on the top, but designs vary considerably from place to place. The color of the autorickshaw is also determined by the fuel that it is powered by, for example Ahmedabad and Delhi have green autos indicating the use of compressed natural gas, whereas the autos of Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore have green or black autos indicating the use of LPG.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In Mumbai and other metropolitan cities, 'autos' or 'ricks' as they are popularly known have regulated metered fares. A recent law prohibits auto rickshaw drivers from charging more than the specified fare, or charging night-fare before midnight, and also prohibits the driver from refusing to go to a particular location. Mumbai and Kolkata are also the only two cities which prohibit auto rickshaws from entering a certain part of the city, in these cases being South Mumbai and certain parts of Downtown Kolkata.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Mumbai/Getting_Around/By_auto-rickshaw|title=Getting around Mumbai|publisher=iGuide|accessdate=12 March 2009[/tpl] However, in cities like Chennai, it is common to see autorickshaw drivers demand more than the specified fare and refuse to use fare meter[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/11/stories/2006061115400300.htm | title = Auto fares must be based on meter readings | date = 30 March 2007 | publisher = The Hindu | accessdate = 6 July 2009 | location=Chennai, India[/tpl]

==Urban rail transport==

===Suburban railway===

The present suburban railway services in India are limited and are operational only in Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad . The Mumbai Suburban Railway is the first rail system in India which began services in Mumbai in 1867, transports 6.3 million passengers daily and has the highest passenger density in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm|title=Overview Of the existing Mumbai Suburban Railway|publisher=Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation|accessdate=31 March 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620033027/http://www.mrvc.indianrail.gov.in/overview.htm |archivedate = 20 June 2008[/tpl]

===Urban mass rapid transit===

The first modern rapid transit in India is the Kolkata Metro and started its operations in 1984,this is also the 17Th Zone of the Indian Railways.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28264643_1_metro-railway-kolkata-metro-foundation-stone | work=The Times Of India | title=Kolkata Metro is now the 17th zone of Indian Railways - The Times of India[/tpl] The Delhi Metro in New Delhi is the second conventional metro and began operations in 2002. The Namma Metro in Bengalore is India's third operational rapid transit and began operations in 2011. Currently, rapid transit systems have been deployed in these cities and more are under construction or in planning in several major cities of India.

===Monorail===

Monorail in India is generally considered as feeder system for the Metro train. Mumbai Monorail is the first operational monorail network in India[tpl]Cite news|title=Mumbai monorail to run in two years|publisher=The Times of India|date=27 September 2007|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-09-29/mumbai/27981519_1_mumbai-monorail-jacob-circle-mmrda-joint-commissioner|accessdate=19 March 2009[/tpl] (excluding the Skybus Metro Test Track in Goa) since the Patiala State Monorail Trainways closed in 1927.

===Light rail===

Like Monorails, Light rail is also considered as a feeder system for the Metro systems. Two Light rail projects have been proposed in Delhi and Kolkata.

===Tram===

The arrival of British rule in India saw trams in addition to trains, being introduced in many cities including Bombay and Kolkata. The Kolkata tram is currently the only tram system in the country and provides an emission-free means of transport in Kolkata while the other tram systems in India were phased out.

==Other local transport==

===Motorcycle and scooter===

Motorised two-wheel vehicles like scooters, motorcycles and mopeds are very popular mode of transport due to their fuel efficiency and ease of use in congested roads or streets. The number of two-wheelers sold is several times that of cars.

The Indian Railways runs a number of special types of services which are given higher priority. The Rajdhani trains introduced in 1969 provides connectivity between the national capital, Delhi and capitals of the states. On the other hand, Shatabdi Express provides connectivity between centres of tourism, pilgrimage or business. The Shatabdi Express trains run over short to medium distances and do not have sleepers while the Rajdhani Expresses run over longer distances and have only sleeping accommodation. Both series of trains have a regular speed of 110 to 140 km/h (81 to 87 mph) but average speed of less than 100 km/h.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The 12001 Bhopal Shatabdi express, however, runs at a peak speed of 150 km/h on small stretches which makes it the fastest train in India. The other specialised services operated by the Railways are the Duronto Express (without any commercial stop between the origin and the destination but with a few technical stops for crew change and food intake) and Garib Raths that provide cheap no-frill airconditioned rail travel. Besides, The Indian Railways also operates a number of luxury trains which cater to various tourist circuits. For instance, the Palace on Wheels serves the Rajasthan circuit and the The Golden Chariot serves the Karnataka and Goa circuits.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] There are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on IR – the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain railways of India.

As the railway tracks from Kandla, Pipavav, Mundra and other ports in Saurashtra to Ahmedabad and Palanpur and then to Rewari via Ringas are not electrified, freight trains (goods trains) with containers double-stacked ply on this route to Rewari junction and then take the containers further north from Rewari. Infringements like low road overbridges and foot overbridges that fouled with double-stacked containers were either dismantled or raised in years 2004-06 for running these freight trains. In India freight (goods) trains can carry standard containers double-stacked on flat-bed wagons with normal axle load of about 22 tonnes and do not require special low-bed wagons unlike in other countries that have (relatively narrow) [tpl]RailGauge|1435mm[/tpl] standard gauge. They carry almost 4000 tonnes per rake which is almost twice the load a normal goods train can haul. Some double-stacked container freight trains on this route through Rewari station also carry "high cube" containers that are 2896 mm (9 ft 6-inch) high (higher than standard containers that are generally 8 ft or 2.438 mm high) on special low-well wagons owned by private clients. Some private logistics operators have built container storage yards north of Rewari near Garhi Harsaru for this purpose.
