Charles Herman Olin (born 31 August 1867 in Västergötland, Sweden, died 1914) was a politician from Alberta, Canada.
Olin emigrated from his native country to the US in 1886 and moved to Alberta, Canada in 1892. He was first elected to the Alberta Legislature in the 1909 Alberta general election as the new Liberal member for Wetaskiwin after long serving incumbent member Anthony Rosenroll did not seek another term in office.
Olin was re-elected to a second term in the 1913 Alberta general election. But he died less than a year into his second term, vacating his seat in 1914.
