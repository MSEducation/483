==Disability advocacy==

Through his journalism, Tipping was a vocal advocate for people experiencing disadvantage, in particular for people with a disability and their families. In 1953 he described the plight facing the family of an intellectually disabled boy, 'Michael', whose parents tied him to a stake in the backyard rather than send him to the government's Kew Cottages.http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/5.2/mackinnon.pdf The story helped foster public sympathy and concern for people with a disability.
With support from the Herald and Dr Cunningham Dax, then chairman of Victoria's Mental Hygiene Authority, Tipping became a vigorous campaigner for disability rights.  He particularly highlighted the poor conditions at Kew Cottages,Manning, C, Bye-bye Charlie: Stories from the vanishing world of Kew Cottages, 2008, University of New South Wales Press  and through the Herald he helped raise substantial sums for their refurbishment and development.  He also helped raise awareness of the disadvantages of large institutions and the potential value of residential disability services in a community setting.

==Death and legacy==

Tipping died of cancer on 29 April 1970 in Melbourne and is buried in Burwood cemetery.  Shortly before his death a large public meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall in order to establish the EW Tipping Foundation to support people with a disability.
