Three Mantras is an extended play by English band Cabaret Voltaire. It was released in May 1980, through record label Rough Trade.

==Background==

The album was packaged in an intentionally confusing manner, with the 'Eastern' and 'Western' titles reversed on the cover, the same label on both sides and a sticker on early pressings apologizing for there only being two mantras (despite the title) and explaining that the album was being priced as a single to make up for it.
According to Trouser Press, Three Mantras is "the group's first explicit venture into non-Western musical forms". It further commented, "The record also marks a shift in technique, as musical demands take precedence over production to strange and beautiful effect."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=cabaret_voltaire |title=trouserpress.com :: Cabaret Voltaire |last1=Grant |first1=Stephen |last2=Sheridan |first2=David |work=trouserpress.com |accessdate=23 February 2013[/tpl]
