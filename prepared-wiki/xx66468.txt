Methotrexate (INN, AAN, BAN and USAN) [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɛ|θ|ɵ|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|k|s|eɪ|t[/tpl], abbreviated MTX and formerly known as amethopterin, is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug. It is used in treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, ectopic pregnancy, and  for the induction of medical abortions. It acts by inhibiting the metabolism of folic acid. Methotrexate began to replace the more toxic antifolate aminopterin starting in the 1950s. The drug was originally synthesised by the Indian biochemist, Yellapragada Subbarow and clinically developed by the American paediatrician, Sidney Farber.[tpl]cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=S|authorlink=Siddhartha Mukherjee|title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rF_31RVTnMC|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9[/tpl][ref]

==Medical uses==

===Chemotherapy===

Methotrexate was originally developed and continues to be used for chemotherapy either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of a number of cancers including: breast, head and neck, leukemia, lymphoma, lung, osteosarcoma, bladder, and trophoblastic neoplasms.[tpl]cite web|title=Methotrexate|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/methotrexate.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011[/tpl]

===Autoimmune disorders===

It is used as a treatment for some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Juvenile dermatomyositis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease (although a recent review has raised the point that it is fairly underused in Crohn's disease[tpl]cite journal | author = Herfarth HH, Long MD, Isaacs KL | title = Methotrexate: underused and ignored? | journal = Digestive Diseases | volume = 30 Suppl 3 | pages = 112–8 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23295701 | doi = 10.1159/000342735 [/tpl]), eczema and many forms of vasculitis.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | first1 =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | last3 =  | first3 =  | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | language =  | volume =  | year = 2013 | url =  | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | editor1-last =  | edition = 65 | editor1-first =  | oclc =  | editor2-link =  | location = London, UK | series =  | chapter =  | editor3-last =  | trans_title =  | quote =  | orig-year =  | coauthors =  | editor2-last =  | editor3-first =  | authorlink1 =  | authorlink2 =  | authorlink3 =  | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | editor3-link =  | work =  | editor2-first =  | editor1-link =  [/tpl] Although methotrexate was originally designed as a chemotherapy drug (in high doses), in low doses methotrexate is a generally safe and well tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Because of its effectiveness, low-dose methotrexate is now first-line therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although methotrexate for autoimmune diseases is taken in lower doses than it is for cancer, side effects such as hair loss, nausea, headaches, and skin pigmentation are still common.[tpl]cite book | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | year = 2013 | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | edition = 2013 | place = Adelaide | editor = Rossi, S [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Cronstein | first1 = B.

Not everybody is responsive to treatment with methotrexate but multiple studies and reviews showed that the majority of people receiving methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug.[tpl]cite journal|last=Weinblatt|first=ME|title=Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis: a quarter century of development.|journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|year=2013|volume=124|pages=16–25|pmid=23874006|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3715949/pdf/tacca124000016.pdf|format=PDF|pmc=3715949[/tpl] It has been found that those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have a lower risk of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marks JL, Edwards CJ | title = Protective effect of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular comorbidity | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–157 | date = 2 February 2012 | pmid = 22850632 | pmc = 3400102 | doi = 10.1177/1759720X11436239 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400102/pdf/10.1177_1759720X11436239.pdf | format = PDF [/tpl] It has also been used for multiple sclerosis but is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

===Abortion===

Methotrexate is commonly used (generally in combination with misoprostol) to terminate pregnancies during the early stages (i.e., as an abortifacient). It is also used to treat ectopic pregnancies.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Mol |first1=F. |last2=Mol |first2=B.W. |last3=Ankum |first3=W.M. |last4=Van Der Veen |first4=F. |last5=Hajenius |first5=P.J. |title=Current evidence on surgery, systemic methotrexate and expectant management in the treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=309–19 |year=2008 |pmid=18522946 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmn012[/tpl]

===Administration===

It can be taken orally or administered by injection (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous,  or intrathecal). Oral doses are taken weekly not daily. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every 2 months.

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effects include: ulcerative stomatitis, low white blood cell count and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute pneumonitis, rarely pulmonary fibrosis and kidney failure.
Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route which include myelopathies and leucoencephalopathies. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects,  particularly when administered in high doses.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Scheinfeld |first1=N |title=Three cases of toxic skin eruptions associated with methotrexate and a compilation of methotrexate-induced skin eruptions |journal=Dermatology online journal |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=15 |year=2006 |pmid=17459301[/tpl]

===Drug interactions===

Penicillins may decrease the elimination of methotrexate and thus increase the risk of toxicity. While they may be used together increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce GI absorption of methotrexate.[tpl]cite web|title=Methotrexate|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=6 January 2014|accessdate=12 April 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-9550-n.htm|editor=Brayfield, A[/tpl] Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole and the anticonvulsant, valproate, have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug, colestyramine and dantrolene. Caffeine may antagonise the effects methotrexate on rheumatoid arthritis by antagonising the receptors for adenosine.

==Mechanism of action==

Methotrexate is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways.  For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis.[tpl]cite journal |first1=P. T. Ravi |last1=Rajagopalan |first2=Zhiquan |last2=Zhang |first3=Lynn |last3=McCourt |first4=Mary |last4=Dwyer |first5=Stephen J. |last5=Benkovic |first6=Gordon G. |last6=Hammes |title=Interaction of dihydrofolate reductase with methotrexate: Ensemble and single-molecule kinetics |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=99 |issue=21 |pages=13481–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12359872 |pmc=129699 |doi=10.1073/pnas.172501499[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Goodsell DS | title = The Molecular Perspective: Methotrexate | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–341 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10476546 | pmc =  | doi =  | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/4/4/340.full [/tpl] The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about one thousand-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is needed for purine base synthesis, so all purine synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.
For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not thought to be the main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved including: the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule expression by T cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to (de)-activation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wessels|first=JA|coauthors=Huizinga, TW; Guchelaar, HJ|title=Recent insights in the pharmacological actions of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.|journal=Rheumatology|date=March 2008|volume=47|issue=3|pages=249–55|doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kem279|pmid=18045808|url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/3/249.full.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]

==History==

In 1947, a team of researchers led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time.[tpl]Cite book|author=Bertino JR |chapter=Methotrexate: historical aspects |title=Methotrexate |editors=Cronstein BN, Bertino JR |year=2000 |location=Basel |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-3-7643-5959-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=VCAFHzHAotsC |accessdate=November 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=Leo M. |last2=Miller |first2=Franklin R. |last3=Rowen |first3=Manuel J. |last4=Bock |first4=George |last5=Rutzky |first5=Julius |title=Treatment of Acute Leukemia with Amethopterin (4-amino, 10-methyl pteroyl glutamic acid) |journal=Acta Haematologica |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=157–67 |year=1950 |pmid=14777272 |doi=10.1159/000203749[/tpl] Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate.
In 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Jane C. |last2=Prigot |first2=A. |last3=Wright |first3=B.P.  |title=An evaluation of folic acid antagonists in adults with neoplastic diseases.
