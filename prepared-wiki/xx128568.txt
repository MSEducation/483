The Sandown Line is a short industrial railway line in the western suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It began life as the Bennett's Railway, opening on 17 November 1888.[tpl]cite journal| author=Singleton, C.C.| title=Railways and Tramways of the Parramatta Hills District - Clyde to Carlingford and Sandown Railways.| journal=Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin| date=May–June 1955| pages=pp. 50–54/57–62[/tpl] The line branches from the Carlingford line at Camellia Junction, just north of Rosehill station. It was electrified in 1959.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
In its final years the railway was used by occasional freight trains only, usually carrying empty containers to and from storage at Sandown; but, when electrified, it carried an infrequent electric suburban service to serve the surrounding industrial area, operated by single-deck 3-car trains (marshalled as Y-sets). The line had 3 simple stations: Sandown, Hardies and Goodyear (a platform called Cream of Tartar Works closed prior to electrification). The closure of Goodyear station preceded the closure of the remaining two. All stations were unattended by staff members.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The overhead wires were removed in December 2002. The line was officially booked "out of use" at the end of 2010.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
