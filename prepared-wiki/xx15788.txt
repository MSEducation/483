[[Hydra 70]]

The Hydra 70 rocket is a weapon derived from the 2.75 inch Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket developed by the United States Navy for use as a free-flight aerial rocket in the late 1940s.

==Overview==

The Hydra 70 family of WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket), based on the Mk 66 universal motor, was developed from the previous 2.75 inch Mk 40 motor-based folding fin aerial rocket. The propellant grain is longer and of a different formulation than that of the MK40/MK4, however, the stabilizing rod and igniter are essentially the same design. The MK66 motors have a substantially higher thrust, [tpl]Convert|1335|lbf[/tpl] (Mod 2/3) [tpl]Convert|1415|lbf[/tpl] (Mod 4), and a longer range than the older motors. To provide additional stability the four rocket nozzles are scarfed at an angle to impart a slight spin to the rocket during flight.  The Mk 40 was used during the Korean and Vietnam wars, being used to provide close air support to ground forces from about 20 different firing platforms, both fixed-wing and armed helicopters.  Today, the OH-58D(R) Kiowa Warrior and AH-64D Apache Longbow, as well as the Marine Corp's AH-1 Cobra, carry the Hydra rocket launcher standard on its weapon pylons.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/hydra-70.htm | publisher = Global Security | series = Military | title = Munitions | chapter = Hydra 70[/tpl].[tpl]citation | publisher = GDATP | url = http://www.gdatp.com/files/PDF/A064_Hydra-70.pdf | title = Hydra 70 | format = PDF[/tpl].

===Mk 66 rocket motor variants===

==Service==

The family of Hydra 70 (70 mm) 2.75 inch rockets perform a variety of functions. The war reserve unitary and cargo warheads are used for anti-materiel, anti-personnel, and suppression missions. The Hydra 70 family of folding-fin aerial rockets also includes smoke screening, illumination, and training warheads. Hydra 70 rockets are known mainly by either their warhead type or by the rocket motor designation, Mk 66 in US military service.

===USA===

In the U.S. Army, Hydra 70 rockets are fired from the AH-64A Apache and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters using M261 19-tube rocket launchers, and the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior using seven-tube M260 rocket launchers. In the U.S. Marine Corps, either the M260 or M261 launchers are employed on the AH-1 Cobra and future AH-1Z Viper, depending upon the mission. The M260 and M261 are used with the Mk 66 series of rocket motor, which replaced the Mk 40 series. The Mk 66 has a reduced system weight and provides a remote fuze setting interface. Hydra 70s have also been fired from UH-60 and H-6 series aircraft in US Army service.
The AH-1G Cobra and the UH-1B "Huey" used a variety of launchers including the M158 seven-tube and M200 19-tube rocket launchers designed for the Mk 40 rocket motor; however, these models have been replaced by upgraded variants in the U.S. Marine Corps because they were not compatible with the Mk 66 rocket motor. The Hydra 70 rocket system is also used by the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Air Force.

==Warheads==

Hydra 70 warheads fall into three categories:

===Common warheads===

NOTE: Though some of the warheads described were designed for the older Mk 40 rocket motor, but most likely could work with the Mk 66 motor if upgraded or modernized models were not available. However, this would not be necessary, as vast quantities of upgraded models exist today. [tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

==Precision guided Hydra 70==

The Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II is a program to provide a laser guidance to the existing Hydra 70 systems in service.  It was cancelled by the US Army in February 2007,[tpl]citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.asafm.army.mil/budget/fybm/fy08-09/rforms/vol2.pdf | publisher = US Army | title = R&D Budget Request | year = 2008 | page = 4[/tpl]. but was restarted by the US Navy in 2008. Similar programs are the US Navy Low-Cost Guided Imaging Rocket, Lockheed Martin Direct Attack Guided Rocket and the ATK/Elbit Guided Advanced Tactical Rocket – Laser.  APKWS has been fired successfully from the AH-64 Apache by BAE Systems in trials at Yuma Proving Grounds in early September, 2013; US Navy trials of the APKWS with the A-10 Thunderbolt II, the AV-8B Harrier and the F-16 Fighting Falcon led to US Central Command's approval of a modified version of APKWS to be fired from fast-moving jet aircraft.http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_10_23_2013_p02-01-629353.xml
