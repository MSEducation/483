Two rounds of North Korean missile tests were conducted on July 5, 2006. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) reportedly fired at least seven separate missiles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.northcom.mil/newsroom/news_release/2006/070506.htm|publisher=United States Department of Defense|date=July 5, 2006|title=U.S. Northern Command confirms 7th missile launch by DPRK| accessdate= 8 July 2006 [/tpl] These included one long-range Taepodong-2 missile and short-range Scud derived missiles including the enlarged Nodong missile. The Taepodong-2 was estimated by United States intelligence agencies as having a potential range reaching as far as Alaska, although this missile failed after about 42 seconds of flight.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/qx3t362441754305/?p=fb3c6488caba4c5798cae98b1af623f6&pi=9|publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=March–April 2003|title=How Terrible the Taepo?

North Korea made its first public acknowledgement of the tests on July 6, through its foreign ministry, describing them as "successful" and part of "regular military drills to strengthen self-defense," insisting that it had the legal right to do so. The country warned of "stronger physical actions" if it were put under pressure by the international community.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5152918.stm|title=N Korea vows more missile tests|date=July 6, 2006| accessdate= 9 July 2006 [/tpl] On July 8, CNN reported that the U.S. had deployed the USS Mustin, a guided missile destroyer, to the Japanese port of Yokosuka, home of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet. A spokeswoman said that the deployment was not related to the test-firings, and it had been previously planned.

==Overview==

The missiles were launched from the Musudan-ri Missile Test Facility, and all of the missiles reportedly landed in the Sea of Japan, 500–600 kilometers west of the northern  Japanese island of Hokkaidō, in international waters about 100 kilometers south of the Russian cities of Vladivostok and Nakhodka.Where did the North Korea missiles land? It was also reported that two missiles landed in Russian territorial waters.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fg-alaska7jul07,0,5738411.story?coll=la-home-headlines|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2006|title= With Few N.

The Scuds and Nodongs were launched from Gitdaeryung, Anbyun, and Kangwon-do. (Also spelled as Kitdaeryung, as in the table of launch in next section)
The United States State Department has said that the Taepodong-2 missile failed in mid-air after about 42 seconds of flight[tpl]cite news|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-07-05T143843Z_01_L04656181_RTRUKOC_0_UK-KOREA-NORTH-MISSILE.xml&pageNumber=3&imageid=&cap=&sz=13&WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage3|publisher=Reuters UK|date=July 5, 2006|title=Security Council meets on North Korea missile test| accessdate= 8 July 2006 [/tpl] and probably continued for 2 minutes in total.
The first missile was launched Wednesday, July 5 at 03:33 KST (= July 4 18:33 UTC) and the next two at 04:04 and 05:01 local time, respectively. The first launches came minutes before the successful launch of Space Shuttle Discovery in Florida (July 4, 14:37 EDT = 18:37 UTC). Some have speculated that the medium-range missile tests were used as decoys to divert attention from the Taepodong-2 missile.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/missiles-for-beginners/2006/07/05/1151778991373.html|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=July 5, 2006|title=Missiles for beginners | location=Melbourne | first=Vanessa | last=Burrow| accessdate= 8 July 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060706135448/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/missiles-for-beginners/2006/07/05/1151778991373.html| archivedate= 6 July 2006| deadurl= no[/tpl] The range of the missile was often estimated to be 6000 km, capable of reaching as far as Alaska. However, analysts in South Korea often put the range at no more than 2,400 miles (or less than 4000 km), which, as far as U.S. interests are concerned, means the missile could reach Guam or possibly the sparsely inhabited western tip of the Aleutian Islands.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fg-alaska7jul07,0,5738411.story?page=2&coll=la-home-headlines | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=With Few N.

East Asian stock markets were shaken by the launches, with investors expressing concerns that moves like this could lead to a future conflict in the Southeast and East Asian areas. Crude oil prices have also risen since the missile tests.[tpl]cite news|url=http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060705/3/2mqqm.html|publisher=Yahoo Asia|date=July 7, 2006|title=Emerging Asia FX-Weaker on North Korea missile news| accessdate= 8 July 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060708041128/http://asia.news.yahoo.com/060705/3/2mqqm.html| archivedate= 8 July 2006| deadurl= yes[/tpl]
Many experts believe that the timing, which was in the very early hours of July 5 in Korea, but midday of July 4 in the United States when space shuttle Discovery was about to lift off, was deliberate to get attention from the United States, and possibly an attempt for one on one talks rather than the six party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities.Financial Times – US fears North Korea missile test

==Details==

The table below shows the time for all the seven missiles launched. Of particular interest is the 4th launch, a Taepodong-2 rocket. Reports that the missile flew for only 42 seconds were contradicted by a confidential report by South Korea's National Intelligence Service. They contended, according to a Chosun-Ilbo article published July 6, that instead the missile flew for seven minutes before veering from its trajectory.[tpl]cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200607/200607060027.html|publisher=Chosun-Ilbo|date=July 6, 2006|title=N.Korea May Try Launching Another Long-Range Missile| accessdate= 8 July 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060709022611/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200607/200607060027.html| archivedate= 9 July 2006| deadurl= yes[/tpl] However, DoD officials indicated that the stable missile boost phase of 42 seconds and the subsequent tumbling out of control to impact into the Sea of Japan(East Sea)  was only airborne for close to two minutes.

==Background==

North Korea conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 2006, and is widely believed to have a substantial arsenal of chemical weapons, deliverable by artillery against South Korea.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.  Recently during "Six-party talks" North Korea agreed in principle to end its nuclear weapons program as part of a comprehensive package of measures to normalize relationships. Diplomatic efforts at resolving the North Korean situation are complicated by the different goals and interests of the nations of the region.  While none of the parties desires a North Korea with nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea are very concerned about North Korean counterstrikes in case of military action against North Korea. China and South Korea are also very worried about the economic and social consequences should this situation cause the DPRK government to collapse.
Valiant Shield was a large war game conducted by the United States military in the Pacific Ocean in June 2006.  The exercise began on June 19, 2006 and lasted for five days, concluding on June 24, 2006. According to the Navy, Valiant Shield focused on cooperation between military branches and on the detection, tracking, and engagement of units at sea, in the air, and on land in response to a wide range of missions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=24224 | title= Valiant Shield Provides Valuable Joint Training Among U.S. Military Forces |work=Navy Newstand |date=June 20, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2006[/tpl]  The exercise involved 22,000 personnel, 280 aircraft, and thirty ships, including the supercarriers [tpl]USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6[/tpl], and [tpl]USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6[/tpl]. It was the largest military exercise to be conducted by the United States in Pacific waters since the Vietnam War.  The exercise marked the first of what will become biennial exercises involving different branches of the U.S. military.
Observers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy were invited to attend, as were naval officers from Singapore, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, and  Malaysia. It was the first time observers from  China had ever been sent to observe U.S. war games.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/20/guam.wargames.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest |title= U.S. begins massive war games in Pacific |publisher=CNN |accessdate=June 20, 2006 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]  The PRC sent a ten-person delegation, including one high-ranking officer each from its navy, army, and air force, as well as officials from its foreign ministry.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/20/AR2006062000114.html |title=Chinese Observers Watch U.S. Wargames |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=June 27, 2006 | first=Christopher | last=Bodeen | date=June 20, 2006[/tpl]  According to USA Today, Chinese military observers said that observing the exercises gave them a better understanding of U.S. weapons and tactics. Rear Admiral Zhang Leiyu, leader of the delegation, called the visit to the war games near Guam "a positive step in China–U.S. military ties".
Military ties between the United States and China have not been close ever since a communist government came to power in China. Admiral William J. Fallon, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, said it was "a start" that China accepted his invitation to observe the large-scale exercises.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wtopnews.com/index.php?nid=116&sid=819748 | title=Commander says Chinese military more open |work=WTOPnews.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2006[/tpl] Fallon indicated before the exercises began that he expected China to reciprocate. However, neither Zhang, nor the Xinhua News report, gave any indication that such an invitation was forthcoming.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-06-22-china-wargames_x.htm?csp=34 |title=China pleased after watching U.S. wargames |work=USA Today |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2006[/tpl]
The exercise had implications for other world events as well, including acting as a show of force to possibly deter North Korea from test-firing its new Taepodong-2 missile.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1885100.php| title=Valiant Shield: a display of strength and numbers|work=Marine Corps Times |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060709194159/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1885100.php| archivedate= 9 July 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The North Korean missile test came after weeks of speculation that North Korea was poised to launch a missile, but neither their quantity nor their launch site were definitively anticipated. The U.S., Japan, and others warned North Korea prior to the incident that such a test would be construed by those nations as a provocative act. North Korea responded to such words by threatening an "annihilating" nuclear strike if the United States attacks or any other nation preemptively tried to destroy the missile before or after it launched.

==International response==

The test came on the heels of the Six-party talks between North Korea, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Asian stocks and currencies slid along with European and United States stocks, while gold, silver, and oil rose amid news of the North Korean missiles.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aCgelZIgkagI&refer=|publisher=Bloomberg|date=July 5, 2006|title=Asian Stocks, Currencies Slide on North Korean Missile Launches| accessdate= 8 July 2006 [/tpl]
No country proposed military action in response to the test fire.  All calls for action have been diplomatic or economic.
