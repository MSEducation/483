[[No. 1 Hit Weekend]]

CATEGORIES: Philippine radio programs, 2007 radio programme debuts

#1 Hit Weekend was a radio show of 99.5 Hit FM. It featured the best of the 90's every Saturday.

==History==

It started in the 2nd Saturday of September 2007, playing 90s hits. It targeted an increasingly younger audience. Since September 2007, its regular schedule was every Saturday, but it lasted until the 1st Saturday of November.

==The Replacement==

On November 9, 2007, the all new 24K Friday was replaced with #1 Hit Weekend, owing to allegedly flip-flopping management decisions and issues concerning the viability of having an oldies show while the station targeted an increasingly younger audience. It only lasted every Friday until March 14, 2008 before it switched to the Campus 99.5 brand.

==No. 1 Weekend on Mix FM==
