Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula [tpl]chem|TiO|2[/tpl]. When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or CI 77891. Generally it is sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase. It has a wide range of applications, from paint to sunscreen to food colouring. When used as a food colouring, it has E number E171.

==Occurrence==

Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as well-known minerals rutile, anatase and brookite, and additionally as two high pressure forms, a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form and an orthorhombic α-PbO2-like form, both found recently at the Ries crater in Bavaria.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1062342|year=2001|title=An ultradense polymorph of rutile with seven-coordinated titanium from the Ries crater.|volume=293|issue=5534|pages=1467–70|pmid=11520981|journal=Science|author1=El, Goresy|author2=Chen, M|author3=Dubrovinsky, L|author4=Gillet, P|author5=Graup, G[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00480-0|title=A natural shock-induced dense polymorph of rutile with α-PbO2 structure in the suevite from the Ries crater in Germany|year=2001|author=El Goresy, Ahmed|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=192|pages=485|last2=Chen|first2=Ming|last3=Gillet|first3=Philippe|last4=Dubrovinsky|first4=Leonid|last5=Graup|first5=GüNther|last6=Ahuja|first6=Rajeev|bibcode=2001E&PSL.192..485E|issue=4[/tpl] It is mainly sourced from ilmenite ore. This is the most wide spread form of titanium dioxide-bearing ore around the world. Rutile is the next most abundant and contains around 98% titanium dioxide in the ore. The metastable anatase and brookite phases convert irreversibly to the equilibrium rutile phase upon heating above temperatures in the range 600°-800 °C.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=1117–19[/tpl]
Titanium dioxide has eight modifications – in addition to rutile, anatase, and brookite, three metastable phases can be produced synthetically (monoclinic, tetragonal and orthorombic), and five high-pressure forms (α-PbO2-like, baddeleyite-like, cotunnite-like, orthorhombic OI, and cubic phases) also exist:
The cotunnite-type phase was claimed by L. Dubrovinsky and co-authors to be the hardest known oxide with the Vickers hardness of 38 GPa and the bulk modulus of 431 GPa (i.e. close to diamond's value of 446 GPa) at atmospheric pressure. However, later studies came to different conclusions with much lower values for both the hardness (7–20 GPa, which makes it softer than common oxides like corundum Al2O3 and rutile TiO2)[tpl]cite journal|author = Oganov A.R., Lyakhov A.O. |title = Towards the theory of hardness of materials |year = 2010|journal = J. of Superhard Materials |volume = 32|pages = 143–147|doi = 10.3103/S1063457610030019|issue = 3[/tpl] and bulk modulus (~300 GPa).[tpl]cite journal|author = Y.

The oxides are commercially important ores of titanium. The metal can also be mined from other minerals such as ilmenite or leucoxene ores, or one of the purest forms, rutile beach sand. Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism from rutile impurities present in them.[tpl]cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A–Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages= 451–53 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford[/tpl]
Titanium dioxide (B) is found as a mineral in magmatic rocks and hydrothermal veins, as well as weathering rims on perovskite. TiO2 also forms lamellae in other minerals.[tpl]cite journal| author= Banfield, J. F., Veblen, D. R., and Smith, D.

Spectral lines from titanium oxide are prominent in class M stars, which are cool enough to allow molecules of this chemical to form.

==Production==

The production method depends on the feedstock. The most common method for the production of titanium dioxide utilizes ilmenite. Ilmenite is mixed with sulfuric acid. This reacts to remove the iron oxide group in the ilmenite. The by-product iron(II) sulfate is crystallized and filtered-off to yield only the titanium salt in the digestion solution. This product is called synthetic rutile. This is further processed in a similar way to rutile to give the titanium dioxide product. Synthetic rutile and titanium slags are made especially for titanium dioxide production.[tpl]cite book |last=Winkler |first=Jochen |title=Titanium Dioxide |year=2003 |isbn=3-87870-148-9 |pages= 30–31 |publisher=Vincentz Network |location=Hannover[/tpl] The use of ilminite ore usually only produces pigment grade titanium dioxide. Another method for the production of synthetic rutile from ilmenite utilizes the Becher Process.
Rutile is the second most abundant mineral sand. Rutile found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing rutile sand can be mined meaning a reduced availability to the high concentration ore. Crude titanium dioxide (in the form of rutile or synthetic rutile) is purified via converting to titanium tetrachloride in the chloride process. In this process, the crude ore (containing at least 70% TiO2) is reduced with carbon, oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride; i.e., carbothermal chlorination. This titanium tetrachloride is distilled, and re-oxidized in a pure oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000 K to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine.[tpl]cite web|publisher = Millennium Inorganic Chemicals|title = Titanium Dioxide Manufacturing Processes|url = http://www.millenniumchem.com/Products+and+Services/Products+by+Type/Titanium+Dioxide+-+Paint+and+Coatings/r_TiO2+Fundamentals/Titanium+Dioxide+Manufacturing+Processes_EN.htm|accessdate = 5 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070814123315/http://www.millenniumchem.com/Products+and+Services/Products+by+Type/Titanium+Dioxide+-+Paint+and+Coatings/r_TiO2+Fundamentals/Titanium+Dioxide+Manufacturing+Processes_EN.htm |archivedate = 14 August 2007[/tpl] Aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a rutile promotor; the product is mostly anatase in its absence. The preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural rutile because of its high titanium dioxide content.[tpl]cite book |last=Winkler |first=Jochen |title=Titanium Dioxide |year=2003 |isbn=3-87870-148-9 |page=32 |publisher=Vincentz Network |location=Hannover[/tpl]
One method for the production of titanium dioxide with relevance to nanotechnology is solvothermal Synthesis of titanium dioxide.

===Nanotubes===

Anatase can be converted by hydrothermal synthesis to delaminated anatase inorganic nanotubes[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2008.06.063|title=The structure of multilayered titania nanotubes based on delaminated anatase|year=2008|last1=Mogilevsky|first1=Gregory|last2=Chen|first2=Qiang|last3=Kleinhammes|first3=Alfred|last4=Wu|first4=Yue|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=460|issue=4–6|pages=517–520|bibcode = 2008CPL...460..517M [/tpl] and titanate nanoribbons which are of potential interest as catalytic supports and photocatalysts. In the synthesis, anatase is mixed with 10 M sodium hydroxide and heated at 130 °C for 72 hours. The reaction product is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and heated at 400 °C for another 15 hours. The yield of nanotubes is quantitative and the tubes have an outer diameter of 10 to 20 nm and an inner diameter of 5 to 8 nm and have a length of 1 μm. A higher reaction temperature (170 °C) and less reaction volume gives the corresponding nanowires.[tpl]cite journal| doi =10.1039/B501883H| title =Nanotubes with the TiO2-B structure|author = Armstrong, Graham; Armstrong, A. Robert; Canales, Jesús and Bruce, Peter G. |journal = Chemical Communications| issue =19|year = 2005| pmid =15886768| pages =2454–6[/tpl]
Another process for synthesizing [tpl]chem|TiO|2[/tpl] is through anodization in an electrolytic solution. When anodized in a 0.5 weight percent HF solution for 20 minutes, well-aligned titanium oxide nanotube arrays can be fabricated an average tube diameter of 60 nm and length of 250 nm. Based on X-ray Diffraction, nanotubes grown through anodization are amorphous.[ref][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1557/JMR.2001.0457 | title = Titanium oxide nanotube arrays prepared by anodic oxidation | year = 2001 | last1 = Gong | first1 = Dawei | last2 = Grimes | first2 = Craig A. | last3 = Varghese | first3 = Oomman K. | last4 = Hu | first4 = Wenchong | last5 = Singh | first5 = R.

==Applications==

The most important application areas are paints and varnishes as well as paper and plastics, which account for about 80% of the world's titanium dioxide consumption. Other pigment applications such as printing inks, fibers, rubber, cosmetic products and foodstuffs account for another 8%. The rest is used in other applications, for instance the production of technical pure titanium, glass and glass ceramics, electrical ceramics, catalysts, electric conductors and chemical intermediates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/titanium-dioxide/ |title=Market Study: Titanium Dioxide |publisher=Ceresana |accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl] It also is in most red-coloured candy.

===Pigment===

Titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. Approximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as utilization continues to rise.[tpl]cite book |last=Winkler |first=Jochen |title=Titanium Dioxide |year=2003 |isbn=3-87870-148-9 |pages= 5 |publisher=Vincentz Network |location=Hannover[/tpl] When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as "the perfect white", "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles. 
Some grades of titanium based pigments as used in sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – in order to have glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers.[tpl]cite book|author=Koleske, J. V. |title=Paint and Coating Testing Manual|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ri6FkY2xvgcC&pg=PA232|year=1995|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2060-0|page=232[/tpl] In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800 °C[tpl]cite book|author=Koleske, J. V. |title=Paint and Coating Testing Manual|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ri6FkY2xvgcC&pg=PA229|year=1995|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2060-0|page=229[/tpl] or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical vapour deposition on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50 µm in diameter.Pearlescence with Iriodin. pearl-effect.com
The iridescent effect in these titanium oxide particles (which are only partly natural) is unlike the opaque effect obtained with usual ground titanium oxide pigment obtained by mining, in which case only a certain diameter of the particle is considered and the effect is due only to scattering.

====Sunscreen and UV blocking pigments in the industry====

In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. It is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes, oil and water dispersible, and in certain grades for the cosmetic industry.
Titanium dioxide is found in almost every sunscreen with a physical blocker because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing UV protection. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals.
This pigment is used extensively in plastics and other applications not only as a white pigment or an opacifier but also for its UV resistant properties where the powder disperses the light – unlike organic UV absorbers – and reduces UV damage, due mostly to the extremely high refractive index of the particles.Polymers, Light and the Science of TiO2, DuPont, pp. 1–2 Certain polymers used in coatings for concreteFibre Cement Coating. dowconstructionchemicals.com or those used to impregnate concrete as a reinforcement are sometimes charged with titanium white pigment for UV shielding in the construction industry, but it only delays the oxidative photodegradation of the polymer in question, which is said to "chalk" as it flakes off due to lowered impact strength and may crumble after years of exposure in direct sunlight if UV stabilizers have not been included .

===Photocatalyst===

Titanium dioxide, particularly in the anatase form, is a photocatalyst under ultraviolet (UV) light. It has been reported that titanium dioxide, when doped with nitrogen ions or doped with metal oxide like tungsten trioxide, is also a photocatalyst under either visible or UV light.[tpl]cite journal|author = Kurtoglu M. E., Longenbach T., Gogotsi Y.|year = 2011|title = Preventing Sodium Poisoning of Photocatalytic TiO2 Films on Glass by Metal Doping|url =|journal = International Journal of Applied Glass Science|volume = 2|issue =2|pages = 108–116|doi = 10.1111/j.2041-1294.2011.00040.x[/tpl] The strong oxidative potential of the positive holes oxidizes water to create hydroxyl radicals. It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing and anti-fouling properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).
The photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide were discovered by Akira Fujishima in 1967 and published in 1972.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1038/238037a0|title=Electrochemical Photolysis of Water at a Semiconductor Electrode|year=1972|journal=Nature|volume=238|pages=37–8|pmid=12635268|issue=5358|bibcode = 1972Natur.238...37F|last1=Fujishima|first1=Akira|last2=Honda|first2=Kenichi [/tpl] The process on the surface of the titanium dioxide was called the Honda-Fujishima effect."Discovery and applications of photocatalysis — Creating a comfortable future by making use of light energy". Japan Nanonet Bulletin Issue 44, 12 May 2005. Titanium dioxide, in thin film and nanoparticle form has potential for use in energy production: as a photocatalyst, it can carry out hydrolysis; i.e., break water into hydrogen and oxygen. With the hydrogen collected, it could be used as a fuel. The efficiency of this process can be greatly improved by doping the oxide with carbon.[tpl]cite news|work=Advanced Ceramics Report|date=1 December 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110587279.html|title=Carbon-doped titanium dioxide is an effective photocatalyst|quote=This carbon-doped titanium dioxide is highly efficient; under artificial visible light, it breaks down chlorophenol five times more efficiently than the nitrogen-doped version.[/tpl] Further efficiency and durability has been obtained by introducing disorder to the lattice structure of the surface layer of titanium dioxide nanocrystals, permitting infrared absorption.Cheap, Clean Ways to Produce Hydrogen for Use in Fuel Cells?

===Electronic data storage medium===

In 2010, researchers at the University of Tokyo, Japan have created a crystal form of titanium oxide with particles 5 to 20 nanometers that can be switched between two states with light.  Use of the 5 nm particles could theoretically lead to a 25 TB storage disc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1869698/new_disc_could_hold_a_thousand_times_more_data/ |title=Titanium Oxide for High-Density Data Storage |work=Research |accessdate=24 May 2010[/tpl]

==Health and safety==

Titanium dioxide is incompatible with strong reducing agents and strong acids. Violent or incandescent reactions occur with molten metals that are very electropositive, e.g. aluminium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and lithium.
Titanium dioxide accounts for 70% of the total production volume of pigments worldwide.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] It is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products, and it is present in almost every sunblock, where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light.

Titanium dioxide dust, when inhaled, has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is possibly carcinogenic to humans.[tpl]cite journal| publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer|year = 2006| volume = 93|title=Titanium dioxide|url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol93/mono93.pdf[/tpl] The findings of the IARC are based on the discovery that high concentrations of pigment-grade (powdered) and ultrafine titanium dioxide dust caused respiratory tract cancer in rats exposed by inhalation and intratracheal instillation.[tpl]cite book |author=Serpone, Nick; Kutal, Charles |title=Photosensitive metal-organic systems: mechanistic principles and applications |publisher=American Chemical Society |location=Columbus, OH |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-8412-2527-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] The series of biological events or steps that produce the rat lung cancers (e.g. particle deposition, impaired lung clearance, cell injury, fibrosis, mutations and ultimately cancer) have also been seen in people working in dusty environments. Therefore, the observations of cancer in animals were considered, by IARC, as relevant to people doing jobs with exposures to titanium dioxide dust. For example, titanium dioxide production workers may be exposed to high dust concentrations during packing, milling, site cleaning and maintenance, if there are insufficient dust control measures in place. However, the human studies conducted so far do not suggest an association between occupational exposure to titanium dioxide and an increased risk for cancer. The safety of the use of nano-particle sized titanium dioxide, which can penetrate the body and reach internal organs, has been criticized.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1208720/Suncream-linked-Alzheimers-disease-say-experts.html|title=Suncream may be linked to Alzheimer's disease, say experts|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=25 August 2009|location=London|work=Daily Mail[/tpl] Studies have also found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause inflammatory response and genetic damage in mice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091116165739.htm|title=Nanoparticles Used in Common Household Items Cause Genetic Damage in Mice|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=17 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Yazdi AS, Guarda G, Riteau N, et al. |title=Nanoparticles activate the NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome and cause pulmonary inflammation through release of IL-1α and IL-1β |journal=Proc.

The body of research regarding the carcinogenicity of different particle sizes of titanium dioxide has led the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to recommend two separate exposure limits. NIOSH recommends that fine [tpl]chem|Ti|O|2[/tpl] particles be set at an exposure limit of 2.4 mg/m3, while ultrafine [tpl]chem|Ti|O|2[/tpl] be set at an exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m3, as time-weighted average concentrations up to 10 hours a day for a 40 hour work week.[tpl]cite web | author = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health | title = Current Intelligence Bulletin 63: Occupational Exposure to Titanium Dioxide (NIOSH Publication No. 2011-160) | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health | url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-160/pdfs/2011-160.pdf[/tpl] These recommendations reflect the findings in the research literature that show smaller titanium dioxide particles are more likely to pose carcinogenic risk than the larger titanium dioxide particles.
