AEGIS, or the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey, is a multi-wavelength astronomical survey of a patch of the sky with low extinction and zodiacal scattering. The purpose of the survey is to study the physical processes and evolution of galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.  As of February 2011 more than 80 research papers have been published based on data from the survey.AEGIS Papers retrieved February 10, 2011
