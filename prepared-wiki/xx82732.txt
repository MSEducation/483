A nonce word is a lexeme created for a single occasion to solve an immediate problem of communication,Cambridge Dictionaries Online - Nonce Word 2011.

All nonce words are also neologisms (newly created words that have not entered the lexicon of a language).Malmkjaer, Kirsten. (Ed.) (2006) The Linguistics Encyclopedia. eBook edition.

==In advertising and literature==

Nonce words are often created as part of advertising campaigns[tpl]citation required|date=November 2013[/tpl] or in fiction. A poem by Seamus Heaney entitled "Nonce Words" is included in his collection District and Circle.

==In child development studies==

Nonce words are sometimes used to study the development of language in children because they allow researchers to test how children treat words of which they have no prior knowledge. This permits inferences about the default assumptions children make about new word meanings, syntactic structure, etc. Frequently used such words include "wug", "blicket", and "dax". Wug is among the earliest known nonce words used in language learning studies, and is best known for its use in Jean Berko's "Wug test", in which children were presented with a novel object, called a wug, and then shown multiple instances of the object and asked to complete a sentence that elicits a plural formâ€”e.g., "This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...?" The use of the plural form "wugs" by the child suggests that they have applied a plural rule to the form, and that this knowledge is not specific to prior experience with the word but applies to all nouns, whether familiar or novel.
Examples of nonce words previously used in child developmental studies include: wug, blicket, dax, toma, pimwit, zav, speff, tulver, gazzer, fem, fendle, and tupa.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
