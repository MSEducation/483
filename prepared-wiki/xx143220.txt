Robert Walter "Bob" Jones (December 2, 1889 â€“ August 30, 1964), nicknamed "Ducky",Bob Jones Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac was a Major League Baseball third baseman who played nine seasons with the Detroit Tigers from 1917 to 1925.
Born in Clayton, California, Jones made his major league debut at age 27 on April 11, 1917. A left-handed batter, he threw right-handed.  He played 853 major league games with a .265 batting average, 791 hits and 316 RBI. 
As the starting third baseman for the 1921 Detroit Tigers, Jones had his only .300 season, batting .303 for a Detroit team loaded with offensive talent (including Hall of Fame batting champions Ty Cobb and Harry Heilmann).  Despite hitting .303, Jones was one of the "weaker" hitters on a team remembered for its record-setting .316 team batting average, still the highest single season average in American League history.  Despite the impressive hitting, the 1921 Tigers finished in 6th place, 27 games behind the Yankees.
In nine seasons with the Tigers, Jones played 774 games at 3rd base, with the rest at 2nd base and as a pinch-hitter.  He held the second-best fielding percentage (.962) among starting third basemen in the 1922 season.  Jones also had a 3.60 range factor score in 1922, 0.36 points higher than the league average for 3rd basemen.  On May 7, 1923, Jones collected nine assists in a single game, which at the time tied him for the American League record for assists in a game by a 3rd baseman.  
In 1964, Jones died at age 74 in San Diego, California.
