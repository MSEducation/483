Milla's paternal family's estate was in Zlopek near Peć. Her paternal great-grandfather, Bogić Camić Jovović, was a flag-bearer of the Vasojevići clan and an officer in the guard of King Nicholas I of Montenegro; his wife was Milica, after whom Milla was named. Her paternal grandfather Bogdan Jovović was a commander in the Pristina military area. He investigated finances in Skopje and Sarajevo, where he uncovered massive gold embezzlement by the military. He was punished for refusing to testify against a friend charged in the crime. This resulted in the government briefly imprisoning Jovović in Goli otok. Fearing arrest again, he escaped to Albania and later moved to Kiev. (A different version of the story claims that he was the one who took the gold.) Milla's father Bogić and his sister later joined their father Bogdan in Kiev, where both siblings graduated in medicine.[tpl]cite web | title = arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |work= Mila Jovović peva zanimljive pesme | url = http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/07/18/srpski/F00071702.shtm | accessdate = March 25, 2006 [/tpl] Her mother Galina Loginova was born in Tuapse (now in Russia) but moved with her family in childhood to Dnipropetrovsk (now in Ukraine).[tpl]cite web |url=http://kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/w/ros/2533/bio/ |title=Логинова Галина Михайловна |language=Russian |date=March 30, 2013 |work=kino-teatr.ru |publisher= |accessdate=May 15, 2013[/tpl] Her mother acted in several films, including Vykrutasy (a.k.a.

==Acting career==

===Early work (1985–1993)===

Jovovich's mother had "raised her to be a movie star."[tpl]cite news | title = A Slav to love | work = The Daily Telegraph| date = 2007-08-04| url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3359871/A-Slav-to-love.html | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | location=London | first=Judy | last=Rumbold[/tpl] In 1985, Galina enrolled Jovovich in the Professional Actors school in California.[tpl]cite news | title = Lookout| magazine= People| date = June 1988| url= http://www.millaj.com/pics/people6688.jpg | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl][tpl]cite news | last= Lebowitz| first= Lisa| title= Milla| magazine= Model| date = September 1988| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/model88.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl]
In 1988, Jovovich appeared in her first professional role as Lily McLeod in the made-for-television film The Night Train to Kathmandu. Later that year, she made her debut in a feature film as Samantha Delongpre in the romantic thriller Two Moon Junction. She had several roles in television series Paradise (1988), Married... with Children (1989)  and Parker Lewis Can't Lose (1990).
At age 16, she was cast as the lead as Lilli Hargrave in Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991), opposite Brian Krause. Given her age and beauty, she was often compared to Brooke Shields, a child model-turned-actress who had starred in the original Blue Lagoon.[tpl]cite web | title = Milla Jovovich Biography | publisher = Yahoo! | url= http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022709/bio | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] The role was controversial, as Jovovich appeared nude in the film, as had Shields in The Blue Lagoon.. For this role, Jovovich was nominated both for "Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture" at the 1991 Young Artist Awards, and "Worst New Star" at the 1991 Golden Raspberry Awards.
In 1992, Milla Jovovich co-starred with Christian Slater in the comedy Kuffs. Later that year, she portrayed Mildred Harris in the Charlie Chaplin biographical film Chaplin. In 1993 she acted in Richard Linklater's film Dazed and Confused. She played Michelle Burroughs, on-screen girlfriend to Pickford (played by her then-boyfriend Shawn Andrews). Strongly featured in promotions for the film, Jovovich was upset to find her role much reduced in the released film. Discouraged, she took a hiatus from acting roles,[tpl]cite web | title = Dazed and Confused (1993) | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/film/dazed.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] moving to Europe. She started to work at music.

===Breakthrough (1997–2001)===

Jovovich returned to acting in 1997 with a lead role in the science fiction action film The Fifth Element, alongside Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman. This was directed by Luc Besson. She portrayed Leeloo, an alien who helps to save the planet. Jovovich said she "worked like hell: no band practice, no clubs, no pot, nothing"[tpl]cite news | last= Brill| first= Amy| title= Hollywoodland | magazine= Premiere| date = May 1997 | url = http://www.millaj.com/art/premiere597.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl] to acquire the role and impress Besson. They married on December 14, 1997, but later divorced.
Jovovich co-created and mastered an alien fictional language of over 400 words for her role. She wore a costume that came to be known as the "ACE-bandage" costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages.[tpl]cite web | title = Modeling/Picture Gallery | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/model/index.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million.[tpl]cite web | title = The Fifth Element | publisher = Box Office Mojo| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fifthelement.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and less to do with dialogue".[tpl]cite web | last= Berardinelli| first= James| title= The Fifth Element | publisher = reelreviews.com| year= 1997| url= http://www.reelviews.net/movies/f/fifth.html | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] Jovovich was nominated for "Favorite Female Newcomer" at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and "Best Fight" at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems.[tpl]cite web | title = The Fifth Element (1993) | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/film/fifth.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.[tpl]cite journal| last= Howell| first= Peter| title= Even zombie killers are insecure | magazine= Toronto Star | date = 2003-09-08| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/torontostar090803.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl]
In 1998, Jovovich appeared in Spike Lee's drama He Got Game, as abused prostitute Dakota Burns; she acted with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen. In 1999, she appeared in the music video for the song "If You Can't Say No" by Lenny Kravitz. That year she returned to the action genre playing the title role in The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, under direction of Besson. She cut her hair short and wore armor in several extensive battle scenes. Jovovich received generally good reviews for her performance, although she also received a Razzie Award nomination for "Worst Actress". The historical drama did moderately well at the box office, gaining $66 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web | title = The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc | publisher = Box Office Mojo| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=messenger.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] In 2000, Jovovich appeared as the troubled Eloise in The Million Dollar Hotel, a film based on a concept story by Bono of the band U2 and Nicholas Klein. Directed by Wim Wenders, Jovovich starred alongside Jeremy Davies and Mel Gibson; she provided vocals on the film's soundtrack. That year she also played bar owner Lucia, in the British western film The Claim (2000). This was followed by a cameo as the evil Katinka in the comedy Zoolander (2001).

===International success (2002–2006)===

In 2002, Jovovich starred in the horror/action film Resident Evil, released in the United States on March 15, 2002 and based on the CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise.[tpl]cite web | title = Resident Evil (2002) | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/film/resident.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous,Resident Evil DVD commentary (2002) and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training.[tpl]cite news | last= Bradberry| first= Grace| title= Modern Milla| magazine= InStyle (UK)| date = July 2002| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/instyleuk0702.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl] The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web | title = Resident Evil | publisher = Box Office Mojo| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevil.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.
In 2004, Jovovich reprised the role of Alice in the sequel to Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The role required her to do fight training for three hours a day, in addition to the three months prior to filming in which she had "gun training, martial arts, everything".[tpl]cite news | last= Grove| first= David| title= Alice Get Your Guns| magazine= Film Review (UK)| date = September 2004| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/filmreview0904.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl] Apocalypse received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film, but it was an even greater commercial success, ranking number one at the box office unlike the first film. Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the critical results and director Alexander Witt's effort. She noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in "independent little films that never come out" to appease her artistic side, and "It's a good balance". The following year, she was featured in Gore Vidal's faux trailer remake of Caligula, as Drusilla. In 2006, Jovovich's film, the science fiction/action thriller Ultraviolet, was released on March 3. She played the title role of Violet Song jat Shariff, a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned,[tpl]cite web | title = Ultraviolet | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10004504-ultraviolet/ | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] grossing $31 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web | title = Ultraviolet | publisher = Box Office Mojo| url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ultraviolet.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] That year, Jovovich also starred in .45, as Kat, the revenge driven girlfriend of an illegal gun and drug dealer with Scottish actor and DJ Angus Macfadyen.

==Music career==

Jovovich had begun working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by SBK Records after the company heard a demo she recorded.[tpl]cite web | title = Milla's Music | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/tdc.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] In August 1990, she asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be "a mix between Kate Bush, Sinéad O'Connor, This Mortal Coil, and the Cocteau Twins".[tpl]cite news | title = Milla| magazine= Rolling Stone (Australia) | date = August 1990| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/rs890.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl] After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a pop album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material. Jovovich had written the songs when she was fifteen, with the exception of a Ukrainian folk song, "In a Glade", that she covered. In April 1994, billed under her first name, she released The Divine Comedy, a title that was a reference to the epic poem by Dante Alighieri of the same name. Jovovich had chosen the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele's proposed cover artwork sketch for the then untitled album. Jovovich found that the sketch had "all the struggle that I'm singing about. It IS the divine comedy". The Divine Comedy was well received by critics, and featured pop-infused traditional Ukrainian folk songs that led to comparisons with musicians Tori Amos and Kate Bush. John McAlley of Rolling Stone called the album "remarkable", "strikingly mature and rich in invention", and as featuring "angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock".[tpl]Cite news | last = McAlley | first = John | title = The Divine Comedy | magazine = Rolling Stone | date = April 1994 | url= http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/rsreview.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | postscript =  [/tpl] Jovovich released the track "Gentleman Who Fell", with an accompanying music video, as the sole single from the album. The music video was originally directed by Lisa Bonet and featured Harry Dean Stanton, but Jovovich was unsatisfied with the results and decided to film another version. The second version of "Gentleman Who Fell", a homage to Maya Deren's short film Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), was subsequently played on MTV. Jovovich toured the United States during most of 1994 to promote the album, opening for Toad the Wet Sprocket and Crash Test Dummies, as well as playing smaller acoustic sets. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on Saturday Night Live. Milla has also been collaborating musically with longtime friend and musician Chris Brenner, who co-wrote with her on the Divine Comedy Album and who was the musical coordinator for the supporting tour. She and Brenner met in 1993 and have since worked together on several ventures.[tpl]cite news | last= Boardman| first= Mickey| title= Generation Oxymoron| magazine= Paper| date = Summer 1994| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/paper94.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= [/tpl] Following The Divine Comedy, she expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a Summer 1996 release. Despite the appearance of a lo-fi field recording The People Tree Sessions in 1998, Jovovich has yet to release a second album.
In May 1999, Jovovich along with Chris Brenner formed an experimental band called Plastic Has Memory, in which she wrote the songs, sang, and played electric guitar.[tpl]cite web | last= Lessing| first= Pieter| title= West Hollywood, California June 17, 1999 review | publisher = millaj.com|date=June 1999| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/luna61799.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] The band was "much heavier and darker than the vaguely Ukrainian folk-sounding elements of her first album" and had a similar sound to a grunge and trip hop Portishead.[tpl]cite web | last= Lewis| first= Richard| title= Review from Richard Lewis' Concert Calendar | publisher = millaj.com |date=June 1999 | url = http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/luna61799.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013 [/tpl] Plastic Has Memory played about a dozen shows in Los Angeles and New York City for a potential Virgin Records album release,[tpl]cite web | last = Ehrman | first = Mark | title = Milla goes Luna | publisher = Los Angeles Times Magazine | date = 1999-09-05 | url= http://www.millaj.com/pics/latimesmag9599.jpg | accessdate = May 15, 2013 [/tpl] one of which Mick Jagger had attended.[tpl]cite news | last= Manning| first= Kara| title= Milla Jovovich On The Bono-Mick Jagger Connection | publisher = MTV| date = 1999-11-11| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430715/19991111/story.jhtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] Though Plastic Has Memory was featured on Hollywood Goes Wild, a benefit celebrity compilation album, the group never formally released a record and is no longer together.[tpl]cite web | title = Plastic Has Memory | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/plastic.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl]
Jovovich has contributed tracks to several of her film soundtracks, including The Million Dollar Hotel (2000) and Dummy (2002), and has also provided songs for the soundtracks of films in which she has not acted such as Underworld (2003) produced by musician Danny Lohner who was the bass player in Nine Inch Nails for many years.  Her song "The Gentlemen Who Fell" was featured on the The Rules of Attraction soundtrack in 2002. In 2001, Jovovich was one of many celebrities whose vocals were featured in a cover of "We are Family" to raise money for the American Red Cross. She has appeared as guest vocalist on the song "Former Lover" on Deepak Chopra's album, A Gift of Love II: Oceans of Ecstasy (2002) and Legion of Boom (2004) by The Crystal Method.
Since 2003, Jovovich has worked with musician Maynard James Keenan, of Tool and A Perfect Circle, on his Industrial side project Puscifer,[tpl]cite web | title = James Maynard Keenan Cooks Up New Side Project Puscifer | publisher = Sony | url = http://www.sonybmg.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004347 | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080815005146/http://www.sonybmg.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004347 | archivedate=2008-08-15[/tpl] contributing vocals to the track "REV 22:20", which was featured on various film soundtracks in its original or a remixed form.[tpl]cite web | title = Rocket Collecting | publisher = millaj.com| url = http://www.millaj.com/music/index.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] As of January, 2009, she can be heard collaborating with Maynard and Danny Lohner on the Puscifer track called, "The Mission." She also performed the song at the first live Puscifer performance on February 13, 2009 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Danny Lohner, and longtime music collaborator Chris Brenner currently continue to record and perform with Jovovich who has made several highly praised appearances in recent years.
Jovovich continues to write songs which she refers to as "demos", and which are provided for free in MP3 format on her official website. She provides license to freely download and remix the tracks, but reserves the right to sell and issue them.[tpl]cite web | title = Current Demos | publisher = millaj.com | url = http://www.millaj.com/music/demos.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl]

However, she also commented that she was "...not sure how interested anyone would be in publishing it, or reading it, for that matter".[tpl]cite web | title = Jovovich to publish diaries | date = 2006-02-05 | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/jovovich%20to%20publish%20diaries_02_05_2006 | accessdate = May 15, 2013[/tpl] In 2010, Jovovich claimed that any autobiography publication plans were pure rumor, stating, "I have no idea where that came from.
