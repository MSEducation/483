==Banned Graduation Card==

In 2010, Hallmark pulled an astronomy-themed Hoops&Yoyo "talking" graduation card off shelves after members of the Los Angeles, California chapter of the NAACP claimed that it contained a racist message. The greeting card contained the words: "And you black holes -- you're so ominous! And you planets? Watch your back!" However, the Los Angeles NAACP members felt that the card was offensive because "black holes" sounded like "black whores" in the recording. Hallmark denied that the card was in any way racist, but pulled it from its stores nonetheless.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/card-251715-graduation-hallmark.html|title=Is this Hallmark graduation card racist?[/tpl]
