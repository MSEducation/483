Lipstick ([tpl]Lang-mn|Уруулын будаг[/tpl], Uruuliin budag) is a Mongolian all-female band. Lipstick's music varies between melodic pop songs, R&B, and pumping disco beats. They were formed on March 1, 1999. The next year they won the Pentatonic award, a national rock and pop music award, as the best debut band. Since then they have received several other prominent awards for their work and were very successful with the younger generation in Mongolia from 1999 to 2002. They all sing and play instruments such as keyboard, solo guitar, bass guitar and drums. They also used traditional instruments such as the Shanz (a 3-stringed plucked musical instrument) and the Yatga (a kind of zither) for their music, e.g. in the songs Khüree khüükhnüüd 'City ladies' and Sarnai tsetseg 'Rose'. As of 2007, the band is inactive, but still widely considered one of the representative Mongolian pop bands.
