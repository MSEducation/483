The Aristotelian Society for the Systematic Study of Philosophy, more generally known as the Aristotelian Society, was founded at a meeting on 19 April 1880, at 17 Bloomsbury SquareFive individuals attended this meeting: Mr. F. G. Fleay, Dr. Alfred Senier (1853-I918) (later Professor of Chemistry in the University of Galway), Mr. Herbert Burrows, Mr. Edward Clarkson, and Mr. Alfred Lowe (Carr, 1928-1929, pp.360). which resolved "to constitute a society of about twenty and to include ladies; the society to meet fortnightly, on Mondays at 8 o'clock, at the rooms of the Spelling Reform Associationâ€¦"Carr (1928-1929), pp.360.
Amongst other things, the rules of the Society stipulated:
According to H. Wildon Carr, in choosing a name for the society, it was:
The Society's first president was Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson. He was president for fourteen years from 1880 until 1894, when he proposed Dr. Bernard Bosanquet as his replacement.
Professor Alan Willard Brown http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/obituaries/dr-alan-w-brown.html noted in 1947 that 'Society's members were not all men of established intellectual position. It welcomed young minds just out of university as well as older amateur philosophers with serious interests and purposes. But many distinguished men were faithful members, and not the least virtue of the society has remained, even to the present day, the opportunity it affords for different intellectual generations to meet in an atmosphere of reasoned and responsible discussion.'."Brown (1947), p.249.
The Society continues to meet fortnightly at the University of London's Senate House to hear and discuss philosophical papers from all philosophical traditions. The current President is Sarah Broadie, a Professor of Philosophy at University of St Andrews.The Executive Committee, Aristotelian Society website
