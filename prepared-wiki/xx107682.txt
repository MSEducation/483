==The Cleveland Model==

Howard is the architect of the green jobs and wealth building strategy launched in Cleveland, OH known as the Evergreen Cooperatives, based in part on the Mondragon Cooperatives in the Basque Region of Spain. Characterized in many press accounts as "The Cleveland Model," Evergreen is an effort to create green jobs in low-income neighborhoods using the purchasing power of the City's anchor institutions (hospitals, universities, etc.) to create local worker cooperative businesses.http://www.utne.com/Politics/Cleveland-Worker-Owned-Cooperative-Model-6765.aspx The program has received international attention from media outlets including The Economist, Al Jazeera, BusinessWeek, and Time.http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/faultlines/2010/04/2010481251991166.html[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1947313,00.html | work=Time | first=Judith D. | last=Schwartz | title=In Cleveland, Worker Co-Ops Look to a Spanish Model | date=December 22, 2009[/tpl]
