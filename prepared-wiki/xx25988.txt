In 2010, he was voted Goal.com's "Player of the Decade" in an online poll, gathering 43.63 percent of all votes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2804/goalcom-player-of-the-decade/2010/01/01/1719502/ronaldo-is-goalcoms-player-of-the-decade|title=Ronaldo Is Goal.com's Player of the Decade|author=Goal.com team|date=1 January 2010|work=Goal.com|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl] and was also included as centre forward in the "Team of the Decade".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2804/goalcom-player-of-the-decade/2009/12/28/1713063/goalcom-player-of-the-decade-results-position-by-position|title=Goal.com Player of the Decade: Results – Position By Position & The Team of the Decade Revealed|author=Goal.com team|date=28 December 2009|work=Goal.com| publisher=Goal.com|title=ESPN-soccernews|accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl] In February 2010, Ronaldo announced that he would retire after the 2011 season, signing a two-year contract extension with Corinthians at the same time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=745706&sec=global&cc=5739|title=Ronaldo sets retirement date|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl]
Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches, scoring 62 goals, and is the second highest goalscorer for his national team. Aged 17, he was a part of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At the 1998 World Cup he helped Brazil reach the final and won the Golden Ball for player of the tournament. He won a second World Cup in 2002 where he received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo became the highest goalscorer in World Cup history with his fifteenth goal, surpassing Gerd Müller's previous record of fourteen. 
Having suffered a string of serious injuries throughout his career, Ronaldo retired on 14 February 2011, citing pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/noticia/2011/02/emocionado-ronaldo-revela-hipotiroidismo-e-da-adeus-ao-futebol.html |title=Emocionado, Ronaldo atribui adeus às dores e ao hipotireoidismo |accessdate=14 February 2011 |date=14 February 2011 |publisher=Globo.com[/tpl] In January 2013 he was named one of the six Ambassadors of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the others being Amarildo, Bebeto, Carlos Alberto Torres, Marta and Mario Zagallo.Brazil 2014 Ambassadors Named

==Club career==

===1993: Cruzeiro===

In 1993, Ronaldo began his football career playing for Cruzeiro which was already going on to become a successful club. In his first and only year with Cruzeiro, he amassed 12 goals in 14 appearances and led them to their first Copa do Brasil championship. Prior to this, he was turned down by his boyhood favourite team Flamengo, but Brazilian World Cup legend Jairzinho saw Ronaldo's potential and helped get him the move to Cruzeiro."The Global Art of Soccer" (2006). P. 174

===1994–1996: PSV Eindhoven===

Ronaldo chose to join PSV after the 1994 World Cup, for he was selected despite being just 17, but did not play. It was Romário who advised Ronaldo to start his European career at PSV; Romário being a former striker of the team from 1988 to 1993. Ronaldo scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands. His second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign, but he still averaged nearly a goal a game in the league, scoring 12 goal in 13 appearances. With PSV, Ronaldo won the Dutch Cup in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995."Ronaldo given route back by Corinthians". The Independent. Retrieved 16 November 2013 During his two seasons he scored 54 goals in 58 games."Ronaldo's record-breaking season". ESPN. Retrieved 16 November 2013

===1996–1997: Barcelona===

During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and FC Barcelona. It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then world record fee of $19.5 million. During the 1996–97 season, Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of Christ the Redeemer that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro. He led the Catalan side to UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph where he capped the season with the winning goal in the cup final, and to Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España wins. He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games. Until the 2008–09 season, Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga. 
Ronaldo was at his physical peak at Barcelona, and many of his 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. Probably his most memorable goal was scored at SD Compostela on October 11, 1996. Having received the ball inside his own half, he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back, before running away from another and ran towards goal where he went past two more defenders in the box with close ball control, and then slotted the ball into the bottom corner of the net. The camera then cut to Barcelona manager Bobby Robson who had got up off the bench and clasped his head in disbelief at what he had seen. The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking: "Imagine you asked God to be the best player in the world, and he listened to you". The day after the goal, the headline in the Spanish newspaper AS read: 'Pele returns'. Such was the manner Ronaldo seemed to single handedly trample through opposing defences, Real Madrid great Jorge Valdano commented;  "he's not a man, he's a herd". At the end of 1996, aged 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year.

===1997–2002: Inter Milan===

Ronaldo's time at Barcelona lasted one season, as there were problems with the renegotiation of his contract. Barcelona thought the talking was over having agreed a new long term contract with the best player in the world until 2006, as Barcelona president Josep Lluís Núñez declared; "He's ours for life". However when the parties reconvened to finalise the deal the following day, the agreement collapsed, with Núñez admitting: "It's all over, Ronaldo is going". Ronaldo's unhappiness had become evident and at the end of the season, by paying the buy out clause fee in his contract, Inter Milan signed him in the summer of 1997 for a then world record fee of $27 million. 
Ronaldo adapted to the Italian style of the game in his first season, finishing second on the league's scoring charts. Ronaldo started to develop into a complete forward. He began racking up assists, became first-choice penalty taker, taking and scoring freekicks, and captaining the team at the end of the season. During his time with Inter, he scored several goals against city rivals A.C. Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. He won FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time in 1997, and collected the Ballon d'Or the same year."Brazil legend Ronaldo retires from football" BBC. Retrieved 20 November 2013 The following year, Ronaldo scored Inter's third goal against Lazio in the 1998 UEFA Cup Final. After the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he finished second for FIFA Player of the Year, and third for European Footballer of the Year. At this point in his career, he was clearly and widely regarded as the best striker in the world.
On 21 November 1999, during a Serie A match against Lecce, Ronaldo felt his knee buckle and was forced to limp off the pitch. Medical exams after the match confirmed that the striker had ruptured a tendon in his knee and would require surgery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&Id=1044&b=true&pn=Lu%C3%ADz_Naz%C3%A1rio_de_Lima |title=Ronaldo (Luíz (Ronaldo) Nazário de Lima) – Milan and Brazil |publisher=Footballdatabase.com |accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl] During his first comeback on 12 April 2000, he played only seven minutes during the first leg of the Coppa Italia final against Lazio before injuring his knee for a second time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html |title=F.C. Internazionale Milano |publisher=Inter.it |accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl]
Ronaldo's recurring injury problems forced him to miss the entire 2000-01 season and much of the two seasons either side of it. After two operations and months of rehabilitation, Ronaldo came back for the 2002 World Cup, helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup title. Later in 2002, he won the World Player of the Year award for the third time, and transferred from Inter to Real Madrid. Ronaldo was given his most recognizable nickname, [tpl]lang|pt|Il Fenomeno[/tpl], by the Italian press while playing there. He was named the 20th top footballer of all time for Inter, according to Times Online, and only his injuries prevented a higher ranking. He played 99 games and scored 59 goals for Nerazzurri.

===2002–2006: Real Madrid===

Having signed for Real Madrid for €46 million, his jersey sales broke all records on the first day, such was the obsession and hype surrounding him. He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 but the fans kept on chanting his name. Ronaldo scored twice in his debut for Real Madrid. He received a standing ovation at the Stadium Bernabéu. That same reception was observed on the night of the final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao, where Ronaldo scored again to seal his first season with 23 league goals and the La Liga Championship title for 2003. With Madrid, he also won an Intercontinental Cup in 2002 and Spanish Super Cup in 2003.
In the second leg of Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford, knocking the English team out of the competition.[tpl]cite news |title=Ronaldo ends Man Utd dream |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/2965089.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 April 2003 |accessdate=25 May 2012 [/tpl] Ronaldo was substituted on 80 minutes and was given a standing ovation from both sets of fans.

That season, he finished as the league's top scorer with 24 goals and was awarded the Pichichi Trophy, despite Madrid losing the league title to Valencia CF. With the acquisition of Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2006, Ronaldo grew more and more out of favour with the manager Fabio Capello due to injuries and weight issues. In April 2013, Ronaldo was named by Marca as a member of the "Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/04/11/en/football/real_madrid/1365709938.html|title=The best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Marca.com[/tpl]

===2007–2008: AC Milan===

On 18 January 2007, it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with A.C. Milan for a transfer of €8.05 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=501832.html|title=Ronaldo unveiled by Rossoneri|date=30 January 2007|publisher=UEFA.com[/tpl] Ronaldo was forced to pay for the remaining period on his contract which tied him to Real Madrid, only because the latter did not agree to release him, while AC Milan were not ready to pay such a sum. On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan to watch the team play in a cup tie against Roma. Statements on the club's website said that Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged for Monday with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors, and the transfer completed on 30 January[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6271487.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Milan complete signing of Ronaldo | date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl] and got the squad number 99. He made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007, during the 2–1 victory over Livorno. The next game at Siena, on 17 February, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for AC Milan, as they won an exciting game 4–3. In his first season, Ronaldo scored seven goals in 14 appearances.
After his move to AC Milan, Ronaldo joined the list of the few players to have played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina, and is one of two players to have scored for both sides in the derby game (for Inter in the 1998–99 season and for AC Milan in the 2006–07 season), the other player being Zlatan Ibrahimović. Ronaldo is also one of the few players to have started for Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, which also boasts a heated rivalry. Ronaldo, however, has never transferred directly between rival clubs. Ronaldo only played 300-plus minutes in his single season at AC Milan due to recurring injury problems and weight issues. Ronaldo's only goals in the 2007–08 season, besides his goal against Lecce in pre-season, came in a 5–2 victory against Napoli at the San Siro, where he scored an emotional brace. It was also the first time AC Milan's much hyped attacking trio of Kaká, Alexandre Pato and Ronaldo, known as Ka-Pa-Ro, played together. In total, he scored nine goals in 20 appearances for AC Milan.
Despite tremendous success over the past decade, Ronaldo has never won the UEFA Champions League in his club career. During the 2006–07 season, though AC Milan won the 2006–07 title, Ronaldo was cup-tied with Madrid and ineligible to take part. The closest that he has been was in 2003 when he helped Real Madrid to the semi-finals, in which they lost to Juventus.
On 13 February 2008, Ronaldo suffered a severe season-ending knee injury while jumping for a cross in AC Milan 1–1 draw with Livorno, and was stretchered off and taken to a hospital. The club confirmed after the match that Ronaldo had ruptured the kneecap ligament in his left knee. It marked the third such occurrence of this injury, which he suffered twice to his right knee in 1998 and 2000.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7244079.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Milan fear for Ronaldo's career | date=14 February 2008[/tpl] He was released by AC Milan at the end of the season, as his contract expired and was not renewed.

===2009–2011: Corinthians===

Ronaldo trained with Flamengo during his recovery from knee surgery, and the club's board of directors said that the doors were open for him to join. On 9 December, however, Ronaldo signed a one-year deal with Flamengo's league rival Corinthians.Independent.co.uk Ronaldo agrees to join Corinthians The announcement received high publicity in the Brazilian press about his favouring Corinthians over Flamengo, since Ronaldo publicly declared himself a Flamengo lover and had promised to defend the club.Goal.com Ronaldo: No Milan?

He returned on 20 September in a match against Goiás. On 27 September 2009, he scored for Corinthians in the 1–1 draw against São Paulo FC. He finished the Brazilian Serie A 2009 with 12 goals in 20 matches.
In February 2010, Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with the club until the end of 2011, and said he would then retire.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/02/22/sports/sports-uk-soccer-latam-brazil-ronaldo.html|title=Ronaldo Renews Corinthians Contract, Will Retire In 2011|date=22 February |publisher=Reuters[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

==International career==

Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil in 1994, in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina. He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States as a 17-year-old, but did not play. He came to be known as Ronaldinho ("little Ronaldo" in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older teammate on the tournament, was also called Ronaldo and also nicknamed Ronaldão ("big Ronaldo") to further distinguish them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/mar/14/the-knowledge-most-games-played|title=WAS RONALDO ORIGINALLY CALLED RONALDINHO?|date=14 March 2012|author=Rob Bagchi and Rob Smyth|publisher=The Guardian[/tpl] Another Brazilian player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, who is widely known as Ronaldinho, would come to be called Ronaldinho Gaúcho when he joined the Brazilian main national team in 1999.
In the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ronaldo played with the name Ronaldinho on his shirt, since centre back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, was one of his teammates. Brazil went on to win the bronze medal.

===1998 FIFA World Cup===

He entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup and was billed by reporters and experts as the world's greatest footballer. He scored four goals and made three assists. The night before the final, he suffered a convulsive fit. At first, Ronaldo was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, but he requested to play and was later reinstated by coach Mario Zagallo. Ronaldo's performance was below par and he was injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Brazil lost the final to hosts France 3–0.
Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that "there is no way that he would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit."

===2002 FIFA World Cup===

During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo led the national team to their record fifth championship and won the Golden Shoe as top scorer with eight goals and was runner-up to the Golden Ball as most valuable player in the tournament. Dubbed the "three R's", Ronaldo starred alongside Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, and the trio were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team."Campbell makes All-Star team". BBC Sport. Retrieved 21 November 2013  Ronaldo scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against England. In the final match against Germany, Ronaldo scored his 11th and 12th goals to a round of applause and tied Pelé's Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===

On 2 June 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match.
At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, although Brazil won their first two group games against Croatia and Australia, respectively, Ronaldo was repeatedly jeered for being overweight and slow. Nonetheless, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira kept him in the starting lineup in face of calls to have Ronaldo replaced. With his two goals against Japan in the third match, he became the 20th player ever to score in three different FIFA World Cups and also equalled the all-time World Cup finals scoring record of 14, held by Gerd Müller (Ronaldo scored at France 98, Korea/Japan 2002 and Germany 2006). and then broke Müller's record in the Round of 16 match against Ghana by scoring his 15th World Cup goal. He also equalled a much-less-talked-about mark: with his third goal of the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo became only the second player ever, after Jürgen Klinsmann, to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups. Brazil, however, were knocked out by France 1–0 in the quarter-finals.
Ronaldo and Klinsmann's record of at least three goals in each of three World Cup finals has now been both equalled and bettered by the German Miroslav Klose, who now has a record of at least four goals in each of three tournaments, having netted five at both the 2002 and 2006 finals, and four at the 2010 tournament.

===Farewell match and sporadic appearances===

In February 2011 it was announced that Ronaldo will be given one very last match for Brazil, five years after his last match with the national team, a friendly against Romania was held in São Paulo on 7 June 2011. Despite it being almost unheard of in international football for players to be given farewell matches for their national side, CBF officials have stated that given the extraordinary career of Ronaldo, it is only fitting that his last hurrah should take place in Brazil while representing his nation.Ronaldo to receive Seleção swansong.
