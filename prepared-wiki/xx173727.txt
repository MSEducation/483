In 1998, Jaime Sigal, a native of Mexico formed TREXCO in Miami, Florida. Instead of accepting offers for partnerships at that time from two manufacturing professionals, he decided to go alone. In early 1999 he invited long time acquaintance Jorge Soto from Uruguay to join him. In the beginning they served just a handful of countries. Today, as a full service Export Management Company (EMC), TREXCO is active in 21 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.
