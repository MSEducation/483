Professor Hugo Lederer (November 16, 1871, Znaim - August 1, 1940, Berlin) was an Austro-Hungarian-born German sculptor.
Lederer studied in Dresden under sculptor John Schilling from 1890, then briefly under Christian Behrens.  His greatest success came in 1902 with the commission for a Bismarck tower in the center of Hamburg.  In 1919 Lederer went to the Academy of Arts in Berlin; among his students was Josef Thorak. Lederer's last major work was for the Krupp organization.
Lederer is buried in Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof in Stahnsdorf near Berlin.
