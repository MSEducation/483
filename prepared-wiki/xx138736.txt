[[Kerr baronets]]

CATEGORIES: Baronetcies, Extinct baronetcies

There have been two Kerr baronetcies.
The Kerr Baronetcy of Greenhead, Roxburgh, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1637 for Andrew Kerr. The first three baronets represented Roxburghshire in the Scottish parliament, and the third was sent as one of the Scottish representatives to the first Parliament of Great Britain in 1707. The baronetcy became dormant on the death of the seventh baronet in 1776.
The Kerr Baronetcy, of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1957 for Hamilton William Kerr, the Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Cambridge. It became extinct on his death in 1974.
