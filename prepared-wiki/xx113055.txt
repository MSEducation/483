"Stronger Every Minute" was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, written by Mike Connaris and performed in English by Lisa Andreas. The song was finished 5th in the final.
As Cyprus had not finished in the top ten at the 2003 Contest, the song was performed for the first time in the semi-final. Here, it was performed fourteenth (following Albania's Anjeza Shahini with "The Image Of You" and preceding Macedonia's To≈°e Proeski with "Life"). It received 149 points to place 5th in the 22-song semi-final and qualify for the final.
In the final, it was performed twenty-first (following the United Kingdom's James Fox with "Hold On To Our Love" and preceding Turkey's Athena with "For Real"). At the close of voting, it had received 170 points, also placing equal 5th (this time in a field of 24) and qualifying Cyprus for the final in the next Contest.
The song is a love ballad, in contrast to the pyrotechnics and dance routines typical of the Contest at the time of its performance. Andreas performed it on stage unaccompanied by any other singers or musicians, earning a comparison to Barbra Streisand by one broadcaster.
Lyrically, it is a confession to her lover that "my love grows stronger every minute".
It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2005 Contest by Constantinos Christoforou with "Ela Ela (Come Baby)".
