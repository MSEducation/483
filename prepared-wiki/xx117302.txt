"I've Been Losing You" is a song by Norwegian band A-ha. It was the first single from their 1986 Scoundrel Days album. It reached number one in Norway, and number eight in the UK. It achieved world-wide sales of over 1.1 million copies.
"This Alone Is Love" was the B-side, in an earlier, rawer form than the one that was re-recorded for Stay on These Roads. It is derived from a song by Waaktaar and Furuholmen's previous band Bridges.
