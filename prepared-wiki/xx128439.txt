Nanosolar was a developer of solar power technology. Based in San Jose, CA, Nanosolar developed and briefly commercialized a low-cost printable solar cell manufacturing process. The company started selling panels mid-December 2007, and planned to sell them at around $1 per watt. When first announced that was just one fifth the price of the silicon cells, but in 2012 brand name assembled solar panels sell from around $1.30 reducing Nanosolar's cost advantage significantly.http://www.affordable-solar.com/store/solar-panels-by-the-pallet[tpl]cite news |first=John  |last=Vidal |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Solar energy 'revolution' brings green power closer |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/dec/29/solarpower.renewableenergy |work= |publisher=The Guardian |date=December 29, 2007  |accessdate=2007-12-31 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= John|last= Markoff|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nanosolar |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/technology/18solar.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin |work= |publisher=New York Times |date= 2007-12-18|accessdate=2007-12-31 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nanosolar  |url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/12/nanosolar_ships_its_first_1_per_watt_panel.html |work= |publisher=ubergizmo |date= |accessdate=2007-12-31 [/tpl] By February of 2013 Nanosolar had laid-off 75% of its work force.http://www.siliconbeat.com/2013/07/15/the-growing-cigs-graveyard-nanosolar-liquidation-auction/ Nanosolar began auctioning off its equipment in August of 2013.http://gigaom.com/2013/08/13/get-yer-cheap-next-gen-solar-tech-courtesy-of-the-nanosolar-auction Co-Founder of Nanosolar Martin Roscheisen stated on his personal blog that nanosolar "ultimately failed commercially." and that he would not enter this industry again because of slow-development cycle, complex production problems and the impact of cheap Chinese solar power production.http://blog.rmartinr.com/ Nanosolar ultimately produced less than 50 MW of solar power capacity despite having raised more than $400 million in investment.http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Nanosolar-Thin-Film-Solar-Hype-Firm-Officially-Dead

The company's technology gained early industry recognition with the presentation of a Small Times Magazine award at a leading nanotech business event in 2005.[tpl]cite news|title=Small Times Magazine announces Best of Small Tech Awards at leading nanotech business event|url=http://www.nanotechnology.com/~nanotech/news/?id=7491|publisher=Small Times Magazine|date=2005-02-11[/tpl] Technical details of Nanosolar's manufacturing techniques have been disclosed in patent applications.Nano-architected/assembled solar electricity cell US Patent 6,852,920, Nanosolar Inc, February 8, 2005  Some information about their process has become available in a Scientific American article (in German). These details involve a semiconductor ink that it claims will enable it to produce solar cells with a basic printing process, rather than using slow and expensive high-vacuum based thin-film deposition processes. The ink is deposited on a flexible substrate (the “paper”), and then nanocomponents in the ink align themselves properly via molecular self-assembly.
Nanosolar's solar cells have been verified by NREL to be as efficient as 14.6% in 2006,[tpl]cite news|title=Printing Solar Cells (in German)|url=http://www.nanosolar.com/cache/BilddW2_07Nanosolar.pdf|publisher=Bild der Wissenschaft (Scientific American)|date=2007-01-10[/tpl] 15.3% in 2009,[tpl]cite news|title=NREL Certifies 15.3% Nanosolar Foil Efficiency|url=http://www.nanosolar.com/company/blog/nrel-certifies-153-nanosolar-foil-efficiency|date=2009-09-09[/tpl] and 17.1% in 2011.[tpl]cite news|title= Nanosolar Achieves 17.1% Aperture Efficiency Through Printed CIGS Process|url=http://www.nanosolar.com/company/blog/nanosolar-achieves-171-aperture-efficiency-through-printed-cigs-process|date=2011-10-05[/tpl] Efficiencies for current production panels are said to be 8-9%, with plans to submit panels with 10-11% efficiency for IEC certification in the fall of 2010.

Nanosolar has developed a suite of in-house capabilities for creating nanostructured components based on various patented and patent-pending techniques. It uses nanostructured components as the basis for creating printable semiconductors, printable transparent electrodes, novel forms of advanced nanocomposite solar-cell design and powerful new forms of barrier films.Nanocomponents from Nanosolar website
According to the company, "leveraging recent science advances in nanostructured materials, Nanosolar has developed a proprietary ink that makes it possible to simply print the semiconductor of a high-performance solar cell. This ink is based on Nanosolar developing various proprietary forms of nanoparticles and associated organic dispersion chemistry and processing techniques suitable for delivering a semiconductor of high electronic quality."Nanoparticle Ink from Nanosolar websiteCoated nanoparticles and quantum dots for solution-based fabrication of photovoltaic cells US Patent 7,306,823, Nanosolar Inc, December 11, 2007
Two advantages over earlier technologies is that a printing process is quick and also makes it easy to deposit a uniform layer of the ink, resulting in a layer with the correct ratio of elements everywhere on the substrate. Also, the ink is printed only where needed, so there is less waste of material. Last, the substrate material on which the ink is printed is much more conductive and less expensive than the stainless steel substrates that are often used in thin-film solar panels.
These solar cells successfully blend the needs for efficiency, low cost, and longevity and will be easy to install due to their flexibility and light weight. Estimates by Nanosolar of the cost of these cells fall roughly between 1/10 and 1/5[tpl]cite news|title=Manufacturing Plans|url=http://www.nanosolar.com/cache/sjmnwl.htm|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|date=2006-06-21[/tpl] the industry standard per kilowatt. However, solar module prices have fallen by 60% since that prediction in 2006.[tpl]cite news|title=Retail Price Summary|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/facts-and-figures/retail-price-environment/module-prices|publisher=solarbuzz.com|date=2012-03-01[/tpl] 
The company implies that their solar cells can last more than 25 years by saying they "achieve a durability compatible with our 25-year warranty."Designed To Last from Nanosolar website They recently commissioned a study by Black and Veatch that finds their 25-year warranty to be compatible with their module design.
