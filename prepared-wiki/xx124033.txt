In the Seinfeld episode "The Face Painter", Berg's name is given to an attorney friend of Jerry's who gives Jerry some New York Rangers playoff tickets. When Jerry fails to thank Berg's character for the tickets, Berg does not offer Jerry tickets for another game that week. In that episode, Jerry jokes that Berg has a great "John Houseman name", pronouncing it jokingly in a Houseman accent.
In the Season 8 of Curb Your Enthusiasm episode "The Divorce," Larry David fires his divorce attorney Andrew Berg (played by Paul F. Tompkins) after he finds out that Berg is not Jewish - as he had presumed from the name - but, like Alec Berg, is a Catholic of Swedish heritage.
