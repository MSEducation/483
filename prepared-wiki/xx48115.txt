===Amsterdam-Paris nightservice===

Before 2004 a night train ran during summer between Amsterdam Centraal and Paris-North. Although much slower than the Thalys, it was popular with budget tourists: some rail passes are not accepted on Thalys' services and one could save the costs of a hotel stay overnight. The train had sleeping cars at a supplemental fee. Many people preferred the cheaper seats instead of the sleeping cars

==Toilet==

Trains without a toilet:
In 2011 NS announced that in the case of a calamity causing a long stop of a train without a toilet and without the possibility of passengers leaving the train, NS will supply disposable bags, and allow the passengers entrance to the unused driver cabin.
