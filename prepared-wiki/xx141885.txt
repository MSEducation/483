Karthik Sivakumar (born  on 25 May 1977), better known by his stage name Karthi, is an Indian film actor, who works in the Tamil film industry. The younger son of actor Sivakumar, Karthi holds a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering. Since he had always wanted to become a film director, he returned to India and joined Mani Ratnam as an assistant director. He was offered acting roles and made his acting debut in Paruthiveeran in 2007 as the titular character, a careless village rowdy, winning critical acclaim and several accolades including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. His next role was that of a coolie in Aayirathil Oruvan (2010), a fantasy-adventure film directed by Selvaraghavan. He achieved consecutive commercial successes with his subsequent releases – Paiyaa (2010), Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) and Siruthai (2011), which established him in the Tamil film industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/oct-10-02/karthi-naan-mahaan-alla-08-10-10.html |title=Karthi – Tamil Movie News – Karthi’s hat-trick |work=Behindwoods |work=behindwoods.com|date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Warrior, Shobha|date=18 August 2010|title=Eagerly awaiting Karthi's Naan Mahaan Alla|work=Rediff |work=rediff.com |accessdate=22 August 2010|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/aug/18/slide-show-1-south-interview-with-karthi.htm[/tpl]
Apart from his film career, Karthi has also been involved in social welfare activities, encouraging fans to do likewise through the "Makkal Nala Mandram", a social welfare club that he inaugurated. In 2011, he became a cause ambassador to promote awareness of lysosomal storage disease.

==Early life==

Karthi was born on 25 May 1977 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. He was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan,[tpl]cite news|title=Karthi Sivakumar, casual and down to earth|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/23/stories/2007092358270200.htm|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=23 September 2007|location=Chennai, India[/tpl] and later at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He gained a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Crescent Engineering College, Chennai. After graduating, he worked as an Engineering consultant in Chennai and considered higher studies abroad. "I was earning about [tpl]INR[/tpl] 5000, per month and found the work monotonous. That was when I thought, I should do something more", he recalls. Karthi got a scholarship for his higher studies in the United States,[tpl]cite web|author=Warrior, Shobha|date=24 January 2007|title=Surya's brother debuts|work=Rediff |work=rediff.com |accessdate=22 August 2010|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/24karthi.htm[/tpl] and enrolled at Binghamton University, New York, where he earned his Master of Science in Industrial Engineering.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/life/2007/10/12/stories/2007101250090300.htm|title=a la Karthi|work=The Hindu |last=Gupta|first=Rinku|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=1 June 2010[/tpl] While pursuing his masters, he also attended lectures on filmmaking.
He worked part–time as a graphic designer in New York for a short period, then decided to pursue a career in film–making. He attended two courses in basic film–making at State University of New York before entering films. He stated, "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry".

==Career==

===2007: Debut success===

When Karthi returned to India, he met director Mani Ratnam, who offered him the role of Arjun (later played by Siddharth) in the film Aayutha Ezhuthu. He declined the offer and worked as an assistant director on the same film and its Hindi version Yuva because he wanted to become a film director and preferred directing to acting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-23/news-interviews/27904044_1_paruthi-veeran-first-film-second-film|title=I want to look nice shirtless: Karthi|work=The Times of India |last=Daithota|first=Madhu|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=1 June 2010[/tpl] He continued to receive acting offers and his father convinced him to take up acting, telling him " ... one can always direct films but one will not get a chance to act once you grow older".

Critics unanimously praised Karthi's portrayal of a careless village rowdy. Behindwoods said: "He has done away with every trace of sophistication in his body language and even handles the sickle with consummate ease. He looks every inch a hot blooded youngster from some rural part of Tamil Nadu and appears seasoned in the romantic scenes ... Uninformed people might not believe that this is the young man’s big screen debut.
