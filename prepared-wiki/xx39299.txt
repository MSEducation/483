PLOS (for Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit open access scientific publishing project aimed at creating a library of open access journals and other scientific literature under an open content license. It launched its first journal, PLOS Biology, in October 2003 and publishes seven journals, all peer reviewed, [tpl]As of|2012|04|lc=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/publications/journals/|title=Journals|publisher=plos.org|accessdate=2012-04-17[/tpl]

==History==

The Public Library of Science began in 2000 with an online petition initiative by Nobel Prize winner Harold Varmus, formerly director of the National Institutes of Health and at that time director of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center; Patrick O. Brown, a biochemist at Stanford University; and Michael Eisen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/early-history/|title=What Is PLOS? Early History|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] The petition called for all scientists to pledge that from September 2001 they would discontinue submission of papers to journals that did not make the full text of their papers available to all, free and unfettered, either immediately or after a delay of no more than 6 months. Although tens of thousands signed the petition, most did not act upon its terms; and in August 2001, Brown and Eisen announced they would start their own non-profit publishing operation.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1093/embo-reports/kve239[/tpl] In December 2002, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded PLOS a $9 million grant, which it followed in May 2006 with a $1 million grant to help PLOS achieve financial sustainability and launch new free-access biomedical journals.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.moore.org/newsitem.aspx?id=524|title=Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation |year=|accessdate=December 17, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.moore.org/init-grants-awarded.aspx?init=116|title=Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation |year=|accessdate=May 2006[/tpl]
The 2000/2001 petition also prompted action by established journals. Some, including BioMed Central journals, became open access journals, making the full text of papers freely available immediately upon publication. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and others became delayed open access journals, making articles freely available some months after publication. Many others continue to rely on self-archiving.
The PLOS organizers turned their attention to starting their own journal, along the lines of the UK-based BioMed Central, which has been publishing open access scientific papers in the biological sciences in journals such as Genome Biology and the Journal of Biology since late 1999.
As a publishing company, the Public Library of Science officially launched its operation on 13 October 2003, with the publication of a peer-reviewed print and online scientific journal entitled PLOS Biology, and has since launched seven more peer-reviewed journals. One, PLOS Clinical Trials, has since been merged into PLOS ONE. Following the merger, the company started the PLOS Hub for Clinical Trials to collect journal articles published in any PLOS journal and relating to clinical trials.
The PLOS journals are what it describes as "open access content"; all content is published under the Creative Commons "attribution" license. The project states (quoting the Budapest Open Access Initiative) that: "The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited."
In 2011, the Public Library of Science became an official financial supporting organization of Healthcare Information For All by 2015, a global initiative that advocates unrestricted access to medical knowledge, sponsoring the first HIFA2015 Webinar in 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hifa2015.org/hifa2015-webinars/|title=HIFA2015 Webinars|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl]
In 2012 the organization quit using the stylization "PLoS" to identify itself and began using only "PLOS".[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2012/07/new-plos-look/ |title=New PLOS look |author=David Knutson |date=23 July 2012 |work=PLOS BLOG |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=6 August 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69j2pzKwV |archivedate=6 August 2012[/tpl]
In January 2013, PLOS confirmed [tpl]cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36504 |title=PLOS and figshare make open science publishing more open |publisher=Creative Commons |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-01-01[/tpl] a partnership with figshare to make open science publishing more open.
In April 2013, PLOS announced their new initiative, the PLOS Text Mining Collection, to assist researchers in easily retrieving and extracting information from a digital text format.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2013/04/17/announcing-the-plos-text-mining-collection|title=PLOS Text Mining Collection|year=2013|accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl]
In December 2013, PLOS announced the publication of its 100,000th article.[tpl]cite web|author=by |url=http://www.plos.org/plos-celebrates-milestone/ |title=Celebrates Milestone |publisher=PLOS |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2014-01-01[/tpl]
In December 2013, PLOS completed phase two http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2013/12/plos-announces-website-redesign/ of their website redesign. The new landing page now enables visitors to navigate more quickly and easily to the information they need. The new design also includes a rotating carousel of PLOS’ most recent announcements, a news feed and a featured article from its suite of journals.

==Business model==

To fund the journals, PLOS charges a publication fee to be paid by the author or the author's employer or funder. In the United States, institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute have pledged that recipients of their grants will be allocated funds to cover such author charges.  The Global Participation Initiative (GPI) was instituted in 2012, by which authors in group one countries are not charged a fee, and those in group two countries are given a fee reduction.  (In all cases, decisions to publish are based solely on editorial criteria.)
PLOS was launched with grants totaling US$13 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Sandler Family Supporting Foundation. PLOS confirmed in July 2011 that it no longer relies on subsidies from foundations and is covering its operational costs itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2011/07/2010-plos-progress-update/ |title=2010 PLOS Progress Update | The Official PLOS Blog |publisher=Blogs.plos.org |date=2011-07-20 |accessdate=2012-02-27[/tpl] 
In September 2013, PLOS published their 2012-2013 Progress Update Report [tpl]cite web|author=by |url=http://www.plos.org/plos-announces-its-2012-2013-progress-update/ |title=announces its 2012-2013 Progress Update |publisher=PLOS |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2014-01-01[/tpl] http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/progress-updates/ [tpl]broken link |date=April 2014[/tpl] which confirmed total liabilities and net assets standing at $20,511,000.

==Impact==

The initiatives of the Public Library of Science in the United States have initiated similar proposals in Europe, most notably the "Berlin Declaration" developed by the German Max Planck Society, which has also pledged grant support for author charges (see also the Budapest Open Access Initiative).
