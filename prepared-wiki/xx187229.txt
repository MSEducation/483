==History==

Already having experience working with such musical events as Australia's Big Day Out, Hulahoop decided to break away from the traditional methods of the industry, declare its independence and begin its work to revolutionize the artist/label relationship. With national and international tours being its main focus initially, Hulahoop is now expanding itself into the realm of band management and signings, already said to have picked up Triple J's Unearthed winners, The Preytells, and Blackmilk who have been tagged as 'The Next Big Thing' to come out of Australia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
