Coventry is situated [tpl]convert|95|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of central London, [tpl]convert|19|mi|km[/tpl] east-southeast of Birmingham, [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] southwest of Leicester and [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] north of the county town of Warwick. It is further from the coast than any other city in Britain. Although harbouring a population of almost a third-of-a-million inhabitants, Coventry is not amongst the English Core Cities Group due to its proximity to Birmingham. Approximately half-a-million people live within 10 miles (16 km) of Coventry city centre.
Coventry was the world's first twin city, when it formed a twinning relationship with the Russian city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) during World War II. The relationship developed through ordinary people in Coventry who wanted to show their support for the Soviet Red Army during the Battle of Stalingrad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory_record/6224/volgograd_russia|title=Twin towns and cities:Volgograd, Russia|publisher=Coventry City Council|accessdate=21 August 2011[/tpl] The city is now also twinned with Dresden, Lidice, Saint-Étienne and 22 other cities around the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory/25/twin_towns_and_cities|title=Twin towns and cities|publisher=Coventry City Council|accessdate=21 August 2011[/tpl] A part of the City Centre at the entrance to the lower shopping precinct was named Lidice Place.
Coventry Cathedral is one of the newer cathedral buildings, having been built after the destruction of the fourteenth-century cathedral church of Saint Michael by the German Luftwaffe on 14 November 1940. Coventry motor companies have contributed significantly to the British motor industry. The city has two universities, the city centre-based Coventry University and the University of Warwick on the southern outskirts.

==History==

Coventry is an ancient city that predates Birmingham and Leicester. It is likely that Coventry grew from a settlement of the Bronze Age near the present-day city centre where Coventry's bowl-shaped topography and, at that time large flowing river and lakes, created the ideal settlement area, with mild weather and thick woods: food, water and shelter would have been easily found. The people of the area may have been the Corieltauvi, a largely agricultural people who had few strongly defended sites or signs of centralised government.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
The Romans founded another settlement in Baginton and another formed around a Saxon nunnery, founded ca. AD 700 by St Osburga,Coventry's beginnings in the Forest of Arden Retrieved 29 September 2008 that was later left in ruins by King Canute's invading Danish army in 1016. Leofric, Earl of Mercia and his wife Lady Godiva built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a Benedictine monastery in 1043 dedicated to St Mary.Fox (1957), p. 3.The history of Coventry Cathedral on the cathedral's website Retrieved on 28 September 2008 In time, a market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded.
By the 14th century, Coventry was an important centre of the cloth trade, and throughout the Middle Ages was one of the largest and most important cities in England. The bishops of Lichfield were often referred to as bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, or Lichfield and Coventry (from 1102 to 1541). Coventry claimed the status of a city by ancient prescriptive usage, was granted a charter of incorporation in 1345, and in 1451 became a county in its own right.[ref]Home Office List of English Cities by Ancient Prescriptive Right, 1927, cited in

Hostile attitudes of the cityfolk towards Royalist prisoners held in Coventry during the English Civil War are believed[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] to have been the origin of the phrase "to be sent to Coventry", which in Britain means "to be ostracised"; although their physical needs were catered for, the Royalist prisoners were literally never spoken to by anybody[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl].
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Coventry became one of the three main British centres of watch and clock manufacture and ranked alongside Prescot, in Lancashire and Clerkenwell in London.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coventrywatchmuseum.co.uk |title=Coventry Watch Museum Project |publisher=Coventry Watch Museum[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventrykid.com/My%20Suddens%20Branches.htm|title=John Suddens, watchmaker|accessdate=25 June 2009[/tpl] As the industry declined, due mainly to competition from Swiss Made clock and watch manufacturers, the skilled pool of workers proved crucial to the setting up of bicycle manufacture and eventually the motorbike, car, machine tool and aircraft industries.
In the late 19th century, Coventry became a major centre of bicycle manufacture. The industry energised by the invention by James Starley and his nephew John Kemp Starley of the Rover safety bicycle, which was safer and more popular than the pioneering penny-farthing. The company became Rover. By the early 20th century, bicycle manufacture had evolved into motor manufacture, and Coventry became a major centre of the British motor industry. The design headquarters of Jaguar Cars is in the city at their Whitley plant and although vehicle assembly ceased at the Browns Lane plant in 2004, Jaguar's head office returned to the city in 2011, and is also sited in Whitley. Jaguar is owned by the Indian company, Tata Motors.
Coventry became home to one of Britain's first local ambulance services in 1902. The local entertainment business received a boost in 1910 when the city's first cinema opened. Public transport was enhanced in 1914 when motorbuses took to local roads.
With many of the city's older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation, the first council houses were let to their tenants in 1917. With Coventry's industrial base continuing to soar after the end of World War I a year later, numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the 1920s and 1930s. The development of a southern by-pass around the city, starting in the 1930s and being completed in 1940, helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land.
Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during World War II, most notoriously from a massive Luftwaffe air raid known as the "Coventry Blitz" on 14 November 1940. Firebombing on this date led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to Coventry's historic cathedral, leaving only a shell and the spire. More than 4,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, along with around three quarters of the city's industrial plants. More than 800 people were killed, with thousands injured and homeless. The Germans coined the term "Coventrate" to describe the tactics of complete urban devastation developed for the raid.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/15/newsid_3522000/3522785.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY / 15 / 1940: Germans bomb Coventry to destruction|work=BBC News Online | date=15 November 1940[/tpl]
Aside from London, Hull and Plymouth, Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was probably targeted due to its high concentration of armaments, munitions, aircraft and aero-engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort, although there have been claims that Hitler launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of Munich by the RAF six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain. Following the raids, the majority of Coventry's historic buildings could not be saved as they were in ruinous states or were deemed unsafe for any future use. Several structures were demolished simply to make way for modern developments which saw the city centre's buildings and road infrastructure altered almost beyond recognition by 1970.
Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after World War II, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties, including a major prefabricated housing district in South Canley which exists to this day.
In the post-war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the Gibson Plan, gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale) and in 1962 Sir Basil Spence's much-celebrated new St Michael's Cathedral (incorporating one of the world's largest tapestries) was consecrated. Its prefabricated steel spire (flèche) was lowered into place by helicopter.
Major expansion to Coventry had taken place previously, in the 1920s and 1930s, to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city's booming factories. The areas which were expanded or created in this development included Radford, Coundon, Canley, Cheylesmore and Stoke Heath.
Coventry's motor industry boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and Coventry enjoyed a 'golden age'. During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited. A new sports centre, with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK, was constructed and Coventry City Football Club reached the First Division of English Football. The Belgrade Theatre was also constructed along with the Herbert Art Gallery. Coventry's pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside of London. In 1965 the new University of Warwick campus was opened to students, and rapidly became one of the country's leading higher-education institutions.
Coventry's large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of Asian and Caribbean immigrants who arrived from Commonwealth colonies after 1948. In 1960, one of Britain's first mosques – and the very first in Coventry – was opened on Eagle Street to serve the city's growing Islamic community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/coventry.html|title=A brief history of Coventry|work=localhistories.org|first=Tim|last=Lambert|accessdate=21 September 2012[/tpl] The 1970s, however, saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly, especially towards the end of that decade. By the early 1980s, Coventry had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and crime rates rose well above the national average.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] Some 30 years later, Coventry is now considered as one of the UK's safer major cities and has gradually recovered economically with newer industries locating there, although the motor industry continues to decline. By 2008, only one motor manufacturing plant was operational, that of LTI Ltd, producing the popular TX4 taxi cabs. On 17 March 2010 LTI announced they would no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry, instead producing them in China and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article7066364.ece|title=Manganese Bronze: Black cabs on the road to China|last=Lea|first=Robert|date=18 March 2010|work=The Times |location=UK | location=London[/tpl]
On the sporting scene, Coventry Rugby Football Club was consistently among the nation's leading rugby football sides from the early 20th century, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s with a host of major honours and international players.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Association football, on the other hand, was scarcely a claim to fame until 1967, when Coventry City F.C. finally won promotion to the top flight of English football as champions of the Football League Second Division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-city-fc-news/2008/01/17/promotion-winners-the-greatest-coventry-city-player-ever-92746-20363894/|title=Promotion winners: The greatest Coventry City player ever|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|first=Jim|last=Brown|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] They would stay among the elite for the next 34 years, reaching their pinnacle with FA Cup glory in 1987 – the first and to date only major trophy in the club's history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10269~1030502,00.html|title=Club Records|work=ccfc.co.uk|publisher=Coventry City F.C.|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl] Their long stay in the top flight of English football ended in relegation in 2001,[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1310324.stm |work=news.bbc.co.uk| publisher=BBC Sport | title=Coventry relegated at Villa | date=5 May 2001[/tpl] and in 2012 they were relegated again to the third tier of English football. Highfield Road, to the east of the city centre, was Coventry City's home for 106 years from 1899. They finally departed from the stadium in 2005 on their relocation to the 32,600-seat Ricoh Arena some three miles to the north of the city centre, in the Rowleys Green district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierfootballbooks.co.uk/highfield_road.html|title=Highfield Road - Coventry City football Club|work=premierfootballbooks.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2012[/tpl] Since the year 2000, the city has also been home to one of the most successful Ice Hockey teams in the country, the Coventry Blaze who are four time Elite League champions.

==City boundaries==

Coventry forms the largest part of the Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area.
The protected West Midlands Green Belt, which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of Warwickshire and the metropolitan borough of Solihull (the Meriden Gap), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as Kenilworth, Nuneaton, Leamington Spa, Warwick, Rugby and Balsall Common.

==Places of interest==

===Cathedral===

St. Michael's Cathedral is Coventry's best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th-century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during World War II, leaving only the outer walls and spire. At [tpl]convert|303|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] high, the spire of St. Michael's is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after Salisbury and Norwich.Arthur Mee, The King's England – Warwickshire; Hodder & Stoughton, 1936 Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir Basil Spence. The cathedral contains the tapestry Christ in Glory by Graham Sutherland. The bronze statue St Michael's Victory over the Devil by Jacob Epstein is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral.Britten-Pears Foundation Retrieved 24 September 2009 The Cathedral was featured in the 2009 film Nativity!.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2009/10/23/nativity-movie-could-make-coventry-a-big-star-this-christmas-92746-24995014/|title=Nativity movie could make Coventry a big star this Christmas|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|first=Marion|last=McMullen|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl]
The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the "three spires" which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th century, the others being those of Christ Church (of which only the spire survives) and Holy Trinity Church (which is still in use).

===Cultural institutions===

The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum is one of the largest main cultural institutions in Coventry. Another major visitor attraction in Coventry city centre is the free-to-enter Coventry Transport Museum, which has the largest collection of British-made road vehicles in the world. The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, Thrust2 and ThrustSSC. The museum received a major refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a striking new entrance as part of the city's Phoenix Initiative project. The revamp saw the museum exceed its projected five-year visitor numbers within the first year alone, and it was a finalist for the 2005 Gulbenkian Prize.
About four miles from the city centre and just outside Coventry in Baginton is the Lunt Fort, a reconstructed Roman fort on its original site. The Midland Air Museum is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to Coventry Airport and near Baginton.
Coventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded a museum in Spon Street.
The city's main police station in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections – one representing the history of the city's police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations – viewings can be made by appointment.
Coventry City Farm was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |title=City farm shuts after cash crisis |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |work=BBC News Online[/tpl]

==Redevelopment==

Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by MJP Architects, reached the final shortlist for the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. It was published in the book 'Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration' in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blackdogonline.com/all-books/phoenix.html|title=Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration|accessdate=27 August 2009|year=2004|work=Black Dog Publishing[/tpl] Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to Coventry Canal Basin, coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board. On 16 December 2007, IKEA's first city centre store in the UK was opened, in Coventry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcoventryandwarwickshire.co.uk/shopping/coventry.aspx|title=Shopping in Coventry|work=visitcoventryandwarwickshire.co.uk|publisher=Coventry City Council|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl]
The River Sherbourne runs under Coventry's city centre; the river was paved over during the rebuilding after World War II and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place 2009 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it in parts of the city centre. In April 2012, the pedestrianisation of Broadgate  was completed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/03/23/coventry-s-new-broadgate-square-to-open-on-st-george-s-day-92746-30605552/|title=Coventry's new Broadgate Square to open on St George's Day|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|first=Jenny|last=Waddington|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=17 July 2012[/tpl]

==Twinning with other cities; "city of peace and reconciliation"==

Coventry and Stalingrad (now Volgograd) were the world's first 'twin' cities when they established a twinning relationship during World War II. The relationship developed through ordinary people in Coventry who wanted to show their support for the Soviet Red Army during the Battle of Stalingrad. The city was also subsequently twinned with Dresden, as a gesture of peace and reconciliation following World War II. Coventry is now twinned with 27 other cities around the world.
Coventry Cathedral is notable for being one of the newest cathedrals in the world, having been built following the World War II bombing of the ancient cathedral by the Luftwaffe. Coventry has since developed an international reputation as one of Europe's major cities of peace and reconciliation, centred around its cathedral, and holds an annual Peace Month.
John Lennon planted a tree outside the cathedral to thank the city for making friends with others.

==Climate==

As with the rest of the British Isles and the midlands, Coventry experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is Coundon/Coventry Bablake. Temperature extremes recorded in Coventry range from [tpl]convert|-18.2|C|F[/tpl] in February 1947, to [tpl]convert|35.1|C|F[/tpl] in August 1990.[tpl]cite web| publisher = Bablake Weather| url= http://bws.users.netlink.co.uk/temperature%20extremes.htm | title = extremes of temperature[/tpl]  The lowest temperature reading of recent years was [tpl]convert|-10.8|C|F[/tpl] during December 2010.[tpl]cite web| publisher = Met Office | url= http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/ | title = 2010 temperature[/tpl][tpl]cite web | publisher = Bablake Weather | url= http://bws.users.netlink.co.uk/last%20years%20stats.htm | title = 2010 temperature[/tpl]

==Education==

Coventry has two universities; Coventry University is situated on a modern city centre campus while the University of Warwick lies [tpl]convert|3+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off[/tpl] to the south of the city centre, mostly within Coventry and straddling the border with Warwickshire. The University of Warwick is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research and is a member of the prestigious Russell Group. A team from the University won the BBC TV University Challenge trophy in April 2007. Coventry University is one of only a handful of universities to run a degree course in automotive design in the world renowned Coventry School of Art and Design
Coventry also has three further education colleges within city boundaries, City College, Henley College and Hereward College.
Many of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as Finham Park School, which is a mathematics and IT college, a teacher training school and the only school in Coventry to offer studying the International Baccalaureate, and Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School which has recently become a specialist college of music, one of only a few in the country. Bishop Ullathorne RC School became a specialist college in humanities in 2006. Woodlands School in Coventry is now also a sports college, which has a newly built sport centre. Ernesford Grange School, in the south east, is a specialist science college. Coundon Court School is a Technology College. Pattison College, a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts. There is also Caludon Castle School, a business and enterprise school, which has been rebuilt over 2005–2007. Exhall Grange School and Science College is in the north of the city, although, its catchment area is north Warwickshire. There is also Cardinal Newman Catholic School and Community College.
Coventry has a variety of schools: one of the oldest secondary schools is Sidney Stringer Academy which is located in the centre of the city. It is a co-educational school that has made improvements in the last few years and has moved into a larger building costing £28million.
The Coventry School Foundation comprises the independent schools King Henry VIII School and Bablake School together with King Henry VIII Preparatory School.
The Woodlands School, which is an all-boys school, and Tile Hill Wood School are the only single-sex schools left in Coventry. However, their sixth forms have merged to form the "West Coventry 6th Form",The Westwood Academy joined in 2013 and lessons take place in mixed classes on all three sites. 
The Westwood Academy, which is a Technology College, is close to the University of Warwick. It is the only school in Coventry that is a CISCO Academy and prides itself on its links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.
Sherbourne Fields School is an educational special needs school for young people with physical disabilities and is located in the Coundon area. It opened in the 1960s and there are now discussions as to whether to close this school.

==Arts and culture==

===Literature and drama===

===Music and cinema===

During the late-1970s and early-1980s, Coventry was the centre of the Two Tone musical phenomenon, with bands such as The Specials and The Selecter coming from the city, spawning several major hit singles and albums. The Specials achieved two UK number 1 hit singles between 1979–1981, namely "Too Much Too Young" and "Ghost Town". Notable singles by The Selecter included "On My Radio" and "Three Minute Hero".
Today Coventry is recognised for its range of music events including one of the UK's foremost international jazz programmes, the Coventry Jazz Festival, and the award-winning Godiva Festival. On the Saturday of the Godiva Festival, a carnival parade also starts in the city centre and makes its way to War Memorial Park where the festival is held.
In the film The Italian Job, the famous scene of Mini Coopers being driven at speed through Turin's sewers was actually filmed in Coventry, using what were then the country's biggest sewer pipes, that were accessible because they were being installed. More recently various locations in Coventry have been used in the BAFTA nominated film The Bouncer starring Ray Winstone, All in the Game, also starring Ray Winstone (Ricoh Arena), the medical TV series Angels (Walsgrave Hospital), the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances (Stoke Aldermoor and Binley Woods districts) and in August 2006 scenes from "The Shakespeare Code", an episode of the third series of Doctor Who, were filmed in the grounds of Ford's Hospital. The 2013 ITV comedy-drama Love and Marriage was also set in the city.

===Football===

Coventry City F.C. have been in existence since 1883, but did not reach the top flight of the Football League until 1967, when they were promoted as Second Division champions. Their highest league position so far is sixth place in the First Division in 1970, when they qualified for the European Fairs Cup (later the UEFA Cup, now The Europa League) in 1970–71. Their only major trophy to date is the FA Cup which was won in 1987 with a 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.
The club was a founder member of Premier League in 1992 and spent an impressive 34 consecutive seasons in the English top flight prior to their eventual relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier Football League Championship without any significant success, Coventry were relegated to Football League One in 2012, the first time in 48 years that the club were destined to play in the English league system's third tier. Their current stadium is the 32,600 capacity Ricoh Arena, which opened in Rowleys Green in the north of the city in 2005, replacing 106-year-old Highfield Road to the east of the city centre.
Notable former players include Reg Matthews (the first Coventry-born footballer to be capped by England), Clarrie Bourton, George Hudson, Bobby Gould, Willie Carr, Ian St. John, Dion Dublin, Stuart Pearce, Gerry Francis, Kevin Gallacher, Terry Gibson, Mark Hateley, Ian Wallace, Tommy Hutchison, Martin Jol, Les Sealey, Robbie Keane, Gary McAllister, Steve Ogrizovic, Colin Stein, Gary Breen, Magnus Hedman and Terry Yorath.  Their most famous former managers are Jesse Carver, George Raynor, Harry Storer and Jimmy Hill. Others include Noel Cantwell, Dave Sexton, John Sillett, Bobby Gould, Phil Neal, Ron Atkinson, Gordon Strachan, Peter Reid, Gary McAllister, Micky Adams, Iain Dowie and Chris Coleman.

===History and politics===

Coventry is well known for the legendary 11th century exploits of Lady Godiva who, according to legend, rode through the city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes being levied on the cityfolk by her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia.  According to the legend the residents of the city were commanded to look away as she rode, but one man did not and was allegedly struck blind. He became known as Peeping Tom thus originating a new idiom, or metonym, in English.  There is a Grade II* listed statue[tpl]IoE|469098|Bronze statue of Lady Godiva – Grade II*[/tpl] of her in the city centre, which for 18 years had been underneath a much-maligned Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy, removed in October 2008.  There is also a bust of Peeping Tom looking out across Hertford Street shopping precinct, and overlooking Broadgate and the statue of Godiva is a clock where, at every hour, Lady Godiva appears on her horse while being watched by Peeping Tom.
The Labour politician Mo Mowlam was educated in Coventry; trade union organiser Tom Mann  and National Socialist Movement leader Colin Jordan also came from the city.  The statesman and founder of modern Australia, Sir Henry Parkes, was born in Canley in 1815.

===Science, technology and business===

Coventry has been the home to several pioneers in science and engineering. Samuel Courtauld and Co Ltd's director H.G.Tetley chose Foleshill in Coventry in 1904 as the site of the world's first man-made fibre factory which produced an "artificial silk" later known as viscose rayon.  In 1987, also in Foleshill, Courtaulds Research produced the world's first solvent-spun cellulose fibres Tencel. Sir Frank Whittle, the inventor of the jet engine, was from the city, as was the inventor James Starley, instrumental in the development of the bicycle and his nephew J.K. Starley, who worked alongside his uncle and went on to found car company Rover.  Cyborg scientist Kevin Warwick is also a Coventrian, as is Sir John Egan, industrialist and former Chief Executive of Jaguar Cars.  Sir Frederick Gibberd, architect and designer, was born in Coventry, and amongst the buildings for which he is best known are Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and Didcot Power Station.  Donald Trelford, journalist and academic, was born in Coventry and attended Bablake School. He was editor of The Observer newspaper from 1975 to 1993.  Born in Coventry, former King Henry VIII Grammar School pupil Paul Connew became editor of the Sunday Mirror and deputy editor of the Daily Mirror and News of The World – he is now Director of Communications at the children's charity Sparks.

===The arts===

==Economy==

Historically Coventry was the most important seat of ribbon-making in the UK. In this industry it competed locally with Norwich and Leicester and internationally with St Etienne in France.
Coventry has long been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing, dating from 1896. Starting out with some less familiar names such as Coventry Motette, The Great Horseless Carriage Company, Swift Motor Company and more familiar names like Humber, Hillman, Riley, Francis-Barnett and Daimler and the Triumph motorcycle having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The Massey-Ferguson tractor factory was situated on Banner Lane, Tile Hill, until it closed in the late 1990s. Although the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, the Jaguar
company has retained its corporate headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&D team at the University of Warwick, and Peugeot still have a large parts centre in Humber Road. The famous London black cab taxis are produced in Coventry by LTI and these are now the only vehicles still wholly built in Coventry.
The manufacture of machine tools was once a major industry in Coventry. Alfred Herbert Ltd became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. Unfortunately in later years the company faced tough competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other famous Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A. C. Wickman, and Webster & Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was Matrix Churchill which was forced to close in the wake of the Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon) scandal. It had been owned by the Saddam Hussein government, via front companies, and closed amidst much controversy and bad feeling.
Coventry's main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development, creative industries as well as logistics and leisure.
Coventry motor companies once contributed significantly to the British motor industry but that role is now much diminished.

Notes:

==Transport==

Coventry is near the M6, M69, M45 and M40 motorways. It is also served by the A45 and A46 dual carriageways.

==Waste management==

Coventry has a large energy from waste incinerator Coventry & Solihull Waste Disposal Company. CSWDC.

==Local and national government==

Traditionally a part of Warwickshire (although it was a county in its own right for 400 years), Coventry became an independent county borough in 1889. It later became a metropolitan district of the West Midlands county under the Local Government Act (1974), even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally "jut out" into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In 1986, the West Midlands County Council was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective unitary authority in its own right.
Coventry is still strongly associated with its traditional county, Warwickshire. This may be because of its geographical location, forming a large protrusion into the county.
Coventry is administered by Coventry City Council, controlled since 2010 by the Labour Party, led since May 2013 by Ann Lucas.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-22410471|title=Ann Lucas named Coventry City Council leader|date=4 May 2013|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl] The city is divided up into 18 Wards each with three councillors. The chairman of the council is the Lord Mayor, who has a casting vote.
Certain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the West Midlands Police, the West Midlands Fire Service and the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (Centro) which is responsible for public transport.
In 2006, Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance service is based at Coventry Airport in Baginton.
Coventry is represented in Parliament by three MPs all of whom are Labour. These are:
Up until 1997, Coventry was represented by four Members of Parliament, whereupon the Coventry South West and Coventry South East constituencies were merged to form Coventry South.
At the Annual Meeting of the City Council on 16 May 2013, Councillor Gary Crookes was elected as the new Lord Mayor of Coventry. Councillor Crookes has been a Conservative Councillor since 1995 representing the Wainbody Ward.

==Postcodes==

Postal districts CV1 to CV6 inclusive cover the city of Coventry and its immediate suburbs. Postal districts CV7 to CV47 cover almost all of the surrounding administrative county of Warwickshire, with the exception of those areas around Coleshill, Polesworth, Alcester and Studley in western Warwickshire, which have Birmingham (B) postcodes instead. However, Coventry remains the post town for settlements within the CV7 postcode (e.g., Balsall Common and Berkswell etc.), even though they are within the neighbouring Solihull Metropolitan Borough.

==Twin cities==

Coventry first twinned with Volgograd, Russia. After World War II Coventry twinned with Dresden as an act of peace and reconciliation, both cities having been very heavily bombed during the war. Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city.
Coventry is now twinned with 26 places across the world:[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/what-point-coventrys-twin-towns-3038605|title=Coventry's twin towns|accessdate=6 August 2013|last=Griffin|first=Mary|date=2 August 2011|work=Coventry Telegraph[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory/25/twin_towns_and_cities|title=Coventry - Twin towns and cities|accessdate = 6 August 2013|work = Coventry City Council.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130412062545/http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory/25/twin_towns_and_cities|archivedate =14 April 2013[/tpl]

==Accent==

Origins:
Coventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways, towards both the 'West' and 'East' Midlands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2005/01/07/voices_05_chinn_history_feature.shtml|title=What did the Vikings ever do for us? |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |work=BBC News Online[/tpl] One thousand years ago, the extreme west of Warwickshire, what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country was then separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of Arden, with resulting inferior means of communication. The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which, by the 14th century, was England's third city. Even as far back as Anglo-Saxon times Coventry – situated as it was, close to Watling Street – was a trading and market post between King Alfred's Saxon Mercia and Danelaw England with a consequent merging of dialects.[tpl]Cite book |title= English Accents:An Introduction to Social and Regional Varieties of English in the British Isles |editor1-last=Trugill |editor1-first= Peter |editor2-last= Hughes |editor2-first=Arthur |editor3-last= Watt |editor3-first= Dominic|year= 2005 |publisher=Hodder Stoughton |isbn= 978-0-340-88718-9[/tpl]
Coventry & Birmingham accents:
Phonetically the accent of Coventry is similar to Northern English in that it eliminates the long a [tpl]IPA|/ɑː/[/tpl], so cast is pronounced [tpl]IPA|/kæst/[/tpl] rather than [tpl]IPA|/kɑːst/[/tpl]. Yet the clipped, flatter vowels in the accent also contain traces of Estuary English (T-glottaling), increasingly so amongst the young since 1950. One notable feature which television producers have been apt to overlook is the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents. In Birmingham and the Black Country 'Old' and 'cold' may be pronounced as "owd" and "cowd", this linguistic feature stops starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the 'Arden Forest' divide perhaps.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brummie|title=Brummie|date=3 August 2007|accessdate=1 October 2009|work=Wikipedia[/tpl]  Yet accents alter briskly in this particular part of the Midlands, North Warwickshire (Bedworth & Nuneaton) displays increased East Midlands dialect features. Then again, just to the south, the general Southern English feature of the longer 'a' in words such as "bath" and "path" (becoming like the nonce words "barth" and "parth" as pronounced in a non-rhotic accent) starts to occur regardless of class or geodemographic grouping across an east to west band of settlements somewhere between Southam and Banbury, positioning Coventry right at the edge of England's phonetic crossroads.
Coventry accent on Television:
Dramatic representations on film have been very uneven down the years, ranging from Yorkshire sounding builders visiting the Queen Vic in EastEnders 1987 to Black Country sounding factory workers in the Jeffrey Archer adaptation 'First Among Equals' (1984).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.episodeworld.com/show/EastEnders/season=22/English.html|title=Eastenders Episode Guide|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009[/tpl] The BBC's 2009 documentary The Bombing of Coventry contained useful phonetic data on the 'Coventry Accent' in the form of interviews with Coventrians. A recent performance from the actress Becci Gemmell, playing Coventry character Joyce in the BBC drama Land Girls, also gave a more accurate phonetic representation of the accent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/04/landgirls.shtml |title=Land Girls Press Pack|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=10 October 2009 |work=BBC News Online[/tpl]

==2008 bomb scare==

The city was bombed many times during the Second World War by the Luftwaffe. These bombs were often abandoned if they fell in areas of little significant importance to the war effort, and continue to be found during construction work to this day. Many old bombs were found to still be viable explosive devices.  On 12 March 2008, an unexploded World War II Luftwaffe bomb was discovered in Coventry's city centre. Police said the device seemed genuine but it was not clear if it was live.[tpl]cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7292097.stm|title = 'World War II bomb' found in city|accessdate =27 March 2008|date = 12 March 2008|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC[/tpl]  A cordon of 500 metres was enforced.
