Francis Dhomont (born Paris, France, 2 November 1926) is a French composer of electroacoustic / acousmatic music.

==Biography==

He studied composition under Ginette Waldmeier, Charles Koechlin and Nadia Boulanger.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scena.org/lsm/sm12-3/sm12-3_dhomont_en.html|title=Hats off to Francis Dhomont!|last=Beaucage|first=Réjean |date=2006-05-11|publisher=Scena.org|accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl] In the late 1940s he intuitively discovered with magnetic wire what Pierre Schaeffer at about the same time came to call musique concrète, consequently conducting solitary experiments with the musical possibilities of sound recording.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In 1963 he decided to dedicate his time to electroacoustic composition utilising natural sounds. Performances in public of his music are done using the French "diffusion" technique over multiple loudspeakers. His work consists exclusively of tape pieces using natural, or "found" sounds, exploring morphological interplay and the ambiguities between sound and the images it may create.
Dhomont's work has won many international awards including at the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition (France), the Magisterium Prize in 1988, Prix Ars Electronica in 1992 (Linz, Austria) and others. In 1997, as the winner of the Canada Council for the Arts' Lynch-Staunton Prize, he was supported by the DAAD for a residence in Berlin. He was recently awarded a prestigious career grant by the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec . Dhomont is the editor of several electroacoustic music journals, and has produced many radio programs for Radio-Canada and Radio-France.
From 1978 to 2005, he divided his time between France and Québec, where he taught at the Université de Montréal from 1980 to 1996. He was a founding member of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community.  He now lives in Avignon (France) and regularly presents his works in France and abroad. A great traveller, he frequently participates in juries.
