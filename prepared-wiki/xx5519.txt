[[Geography of Kenya]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Kenya

The geography of Kenya is diverse. Kenya has a coastline on the Indian Ocean, which contains swamps of East African mangroves. Inland are broad plains and numerous hills.
Central and Western Kenya is characterised by the Kenyan Rift Valley home to two of Africa's highest mountains, Mount Kenya and Mount Elgon.The Kakamega Forest in western Kenya is relic of an East African rainforest. Much larger is Mau Forest, the largest forest complex in East Africa.

==Geology==

The recent geology of western Kenya is dominated by the volcanism and rift tectonics of the East African Rift. The rift runs north–south from Lake Turkana in the north south past Mount Kenya and Lake Magadi and on to Lake Natron and Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.
Much of the western two-thirds of the country underlying the Pliocene–Pleistocene volcanics consist of Precambrian basement rocks.Petroleum Potential of NW-Kenya Rift Basins: A Synopsis of Evidence and Issues The southeast corner of the country is underlain by sediments of the Karoo System of Permian to Late Triassic age and a strip of Jurassic age sediments along the coast in the Mombasa area. The Anza trough is a NW–SE trending Jurassic rift extending from the Indian Ocean coast to the Sudan northwest of Lake Turkana. The Anza Rift resulted from the break–up of Gondwana.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/crustal-structure-tectonic-evolution-anza-rift-northern-kenya/ |title=Crustal structure and tectonic evolution of the Anza rift, northern Kenya |author=L C Greene, D R Richards, R A Johnson |journal=Tectonophysics |year=1991 | volume= 197 | issue= 2–4 | pages= 203–211 |accessdate=2011-11-20 | doi=10.1016/0040-1951(91)90041-P[/tpl]

==Climate==

The climate of Kenya varies by location, from mostly cool every day, to always warm/hot. The climate along the coast is tropical. This means rainfall and temperatures are higher throughout the year. At the coastal cities Mombasa,Lamu,Malindi, the air changes from cool to hot, almost every day (see chart below).
The further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about 12 C (corresponding to a rise of about 22F), almost every day.
Elevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11 °C (20 °F) cooler, day or night.[ref]
