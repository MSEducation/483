[[Gross world product]]

CATEGORIES: Economic indicators, National accounts, Gross domestic product

The gross world product (GWP) is the combined gross national product of all the countries in the world.  Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global gross domestic product (GDP).See measures of national income and output for more details. In 2012, the GWP totalled approximately US$84.97 trillion in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and around US$71.83 trillion in nominal terms. The per capita PPP GWP was approximately US$12,400.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=World|publisher= CIA World Factbook|date=10 April 2013|accessdate=17 April 2013[/tpl]
