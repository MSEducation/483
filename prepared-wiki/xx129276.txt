Judaeo-Aragonese was a Judaeo-Romance language (a Jewish language derived from Aragonese), spoken in north central Iberia from the around the mid-700s until about the time of the expulsion from Spain, when it either merged with the various Judeo-Spanish dialects, or fell out of use in favor of the (by then) far more influential Judaeo-Spanish dialects originating in southern Spain, especially in the areas occupied by the modern Valencian Community, Murcia and Andalusia.
