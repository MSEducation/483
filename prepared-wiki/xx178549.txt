Shoval ([tpl]lang-he-n|שׁוֹבָל[/tpl]) is a kibbutz in the northern Negev desert in Israel. Located near the Bedouin city of Rahat, it falls under the jurisdiction of Bnei Shimon Regional Council.

==History==

The kibbutz was founded on October 6, 1946 as part of the 11 points operation by a gar'in whose members were of Hashomer Hatzair and immigrants who had survived the Patria disaster. Its name was taken from two passages in the Books of Chronicles:Jewish villages in Israel, Jewish National Fund, Jerusalem 1949, p.169  1 Chr 1:38; 2:52; 4:1. The population of Shoval is about 600 people, 200 of which are kibbutz members.

==Economy==

Shoval has two major sources of income; agriculture and plastics manufacturing. Its dairy farm is one of the largest in the area and is managed as a partnership with kibbutz Na'an. It also has a vast area of arable land where wheat, barley and potatoes are grown. In addition there are several chicken coops that are mainly used to raise chickens for meat. The kibbutz also operates a plastic seals manufacturing plant named Seal Jet.

==Education==

In 1963, a regional high school was built named Mevo'ot HaNegev in the kibbutz. The school serves pupils of the ages of 12-18 from the kibbutz and the surrounding settlements. The education system in the kibbutz also includes kindergartens and the young students learn in the Nitzanei HaNegev elementary school in Beit Kama. The kibbutz also hosts an ulpan for teaching the Hebrew language and its students study and work in the kibbutz.
