Prince Edward Island (PEI or P.E.I.; [tpl]lang-fr|Île-du-Prince-Édouard[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-fr|il dy pʁɛ̃s‿edwaʁ|pron[/tpl], Quebec French pronunciation: [tpl]IPA-frdia|ɪl d͡zy pʁẽs‿edwɑːʁ|[/tpl], [tpl]lang-mic|Epekwitk[/tpl], Scottish Gaelic: Eilean a' Phrionnsa) is a Canadian province consisting of the island itself, as well as other islands.
It is one of the three Maritime provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population. The island has several informal names: "Garden of the Gulf" referring to the pastoral scenery and lush agricultural lands throughout the province; and "Birthplace of Confederation" or "Cradle of Confederation",[tpl]cite book|title=Prince Edward Island|year=2013|publisher=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/ebconcise/prince_edward_island[/tpl] referring to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, although PEI did not join Confederation until 1873, when it became the seventh Canadian province.  The backbone of the economy is farming, as it produces 25% of Canada's potatoes. Historically, PEI is one of Canada's older settlements and demographically still reflects older immigration to the country, with Celtic, Anglo Saxon and French last names being overwhelmingly dominant to this day.
According to the 2011 census, the province of Prince Edward Island has 145,855 residents. It is located about 200 km north of Halifax, Nova Scotia and 600 km east of Quebec City.  It consists of the main island and 231 minor islands. Altogether, the entire province has a land area of [tpl]convert|5685.73|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&T=101&S=50&O=A|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2011 and 2006 censuses |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2012[/tpl]
