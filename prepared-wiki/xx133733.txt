==History==

Until the 19th century, the region was known as the Baixada da Guanabara. It experienced some development during the 18th century, when it was an important corridor for transporting gold mined in the neighboring state of Minas Gerais. 
In the 19th century was one of the first regions to develop coffee plantations. However, during the reign of Emperor Pedro II the region suffered serious economic decline due to the creation of railroads, which led to a sharp decline in the traffic on the region’s rivers and roads.
In the early 20th century the area experienced a great influx of persons arriving from other parts of the country, mainly from Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and Northeastern Brazil, in search of a better quality of life near Rio de Janeiro, which at the time was the capital of Brazil. 
In the second half of the 20th century, the region acquired a reputation for poverty, crime and inadequate social services, which continues to this day. Favelas are located here.
Large marsh drainage projects were undertaken in order to improve sanitary conditions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
