Schirmer is remembered for establishing ophthalmology as an independent discipline at Greifswald, as well as his research involving the anomalies of refraction and accommodation of the eye. Also he performed extensive studies of diseases involving the lacrimal apparatus. The term "Schirmer's syndrome" is employed to   indicate the association of hydrophthalmia (early glaucoma) and Sturge-Weber syndrome.Sturge-Weber syndrome @ Who Named It
