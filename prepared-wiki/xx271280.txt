The South African Class GF 4-6-2+2-6-4 of 1927 is a South African steam locomotive from the 
South African Railways era.
In 1927 the South African Railways placed thirty-seven Class GF Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 4-6-2+2-6-4 "Double Pacific" wheel arrangement in service. A further twenty-eight locomotives were delivered in 1928.

==Manufacturers==

The specifications for the Class GF 4-6-2+2-6-4 Garratt locomotive was prepared by Colonel F.C. Collins, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1922 to 1929, and an order for thirty-seven locomotives was placed with Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG (Hanomag) in Germany. It was designed as a mixed traffic locomotive for use on branchlines and secondary mainlines throughout the country. They were delivered in 1927 and numbered in the range from 2370 to 2406.
A second order was placed with Henschel and Son in 1927 for eighteen locomotives that were delivered in 1928, numbered in the range from 2407 to 2424.
This was followed by a third order, placed with Maffei in 1928, for a final batch of ten locomotives that were delivered that same year and numbered in the range from 2425 to 2434.
They were superheated, had bar frames and used Walschaerts valve gear, and until the arrival of the Class GMA and Class GMAM, they were the most numerous Garratt locomotive in SAR service.[tpl]Durrant-Twilight|page=113[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

As built, the Class GF had inside bearings in the two-wheeled pony trucks and considerable trouble was experienced with hot boxes until they were modified to outside bearings, after which they proved to be very successful locomotives. Their good turn of speed and reasonably high tractive effort made the class a good utility locomotive.

==Service==

===South African Railways===

They saw service on many lines in Natal, the Transvaal, the Orange Free State and the Eastern Cape. In the Eastern Transvaal they were stationed at Nelspruit to work the branches to Graskop and Plaston. Some worked out of Johannesburg via Krugersdorp and Zeerust on the Mafeking line as well, where they were allowed to carry an increased coal load of [tpl]convert|11.5|LT|t|1|abbr=off[/tpl], compared to the [tpl]convert|10|LT|t|1|abbr=off[/tpl] that they were allowed on lighter rail elsewhere.
The bulk of the Class GF fleet worked in Natal, some stationed at Empangeni to work the sugar cane traffic from Mtubatuba while most were based at Mason’s Mill to work the various branches that radiated from Pietermaritzburg. They worked a daily passenger train from Franklin to Kokstad, but on the other branches they were mainly used on goods and mixed train service.
Apart from four that were sold and two that were scrapped after collisions, they were all still in stock by 1972, although not all were still in operation. The last one in SAR service was scrapped in 1979.

===Mozambique===

Four of the Class GF, numbers 2370, 2419, 2420 and 2432, were sold to the Caminhos de Ferro de Moçambique (CFM), where they became the Series 911, numbered in the range from 911 to 914.

===Industrial===

Considering that the Class GF was a fairly light and large wheeled locomotive that was more suited to passenger work than heavy hauling, a surprising number of them were sold into mining service upon retirement.
Most went to the Enyati Railway, where in later years some were equipped with diesel-driven air brake equipment, situated in a cage behind the coal bunker, since some of the SAR’s air braked coal export block trains originated on the Enyati. As far as is known, the industrial locomotives were the following:
