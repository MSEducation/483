The World Zionist Organization ([tpl]lang-he-n|הַהִסְתַּדְּרוּת הַצִּיּוֹנִית הָעוֹלָמִית[/tpl]; HaHistadrut HaTsionit HaOlamit), or WZO,  
consists of Zionist institutions like The World Zionist Unions, The international Zionist Federations; and other international organizations that define themselves as Zionist, such as WIZO, Hadassah, Bnai-Brith, Maccabi, the International Sephardic Federation, the three streams of world Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform), delegation from the CIS – Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union), the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), and more.  The WZO's headquarters was permanently moved to Jerusalem, after being located over the years in capitals of Europe, including Berlin and London, and most recently in New York City, in the United States.  

==History==

Founded as the Zionist Organization ([tpl]lang-he-n|הַהִסְתַּדְּרוּת הַצִּיּוֹנִית[/tpl]; HaHistadrut HaTsionit), or ZO, in 1897 at the First Zionist Congress, held from August 29 to August 31 in Basel, Switzerland.See Chapter 2: The Seven Years of Herzl of Zionism – The First 120 Years  by the Jewish Agency. It changed its name to World Zionist Organization in January 1960. 
The ZO served as an umbrella organization for the Zionist movement, whose objective was the creation of a Jewish homeland in  Palestine - at that time under the Ottoman Empire and following the First World War The British Mandate of Palestine. When the State of Israel was declared 51 years later on May 14, 1948, many of its new administrative institutions were already in place, having evolved during the regular Zionist Congresses of the previous decades. Some of these institutions remain to this day.

==Membership and delegations==

Membership in the ZO was open to all (Jews), and the right to vote for delegates to the Congresses was secured by the purchase of the Zionist Shekel. Delegations from all around the world, and from many different political backgrounds and religious traditions, took part in each Congress; delegations/parties were mainly grouped by ideology, rather than by geography.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl]
In 1960 the ZO changed its name to the World Zionist Organization and adopted a new constitution under which individuals are ineligible for membership, which is reserved for organizations.

==Presidents of World Zionist Organization==

==Chairs of the Executive of World Zionist Organization (and the Jewish Agency for Israel)==

In 2009, the positions were separated again. Natan Sharansky was elected as the head of the Jewish Agency and Avraham Duvdevani was elected as the new Chairman of the WZO at the 36th Zionist Congress, on 15 June 2010.

==Sister organizations==

The finances of the WZO were conducted by the Jewish Colonial Trust (founded in 1899), and acquisition of land was conducted by the Jewish National Fund (founded in 1901).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+Two+The+Seven+Years+of+Herzl.htm |title=Chapter Two The Seven Years of Herzl |publisher=Jewishagency.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-29[/tpl] Keren Hayesod (founded 1920) funded Zionist and Yishuv activities prior to the creation of the state of Israel through enterprises such as the Palestine Electric Company, the Palestine Potash Company  and the Anglo-Palestine Bank.

==Jerusalem Program==

The platform of the WZO is the Jerusalem Program. The Zionist Council, meeting in Jerusalem in June 2004, adopted this text as the latest version.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1707 |title=Jerusalem Program 2004 |publisher=Wzo.org.il |date= |accessdate=2008-11-29 |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070707033356/http://wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1707 |archivedate = July 7, 2007[/tpl]
 
 Zionism, the national liberation movement of the Jewish people, brought about the establishment of the State of Israel, and views a Jewish, Zionist, democratic and secure State of Israel to be the expression of the common responsibility of the Jewish people for its continuity and future.
The foundations of Zionism are:

==Herzl Award==

==Settlement controversy==

A document which was brought before Israel's Supreme Court, showed that private Palestinian land was taken and given to Israeli settlers by the World Zionist Organization. The land in question had been ruled off-limits by Israel. The World Zionist Organization had been acting as an agent of the government in assigning land to Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, to avoid responsibilities under international law, used the World Zionist Organization to settle its citizens in the territory occupied in 1967. The document concerns several homes in the Israeli settlement of Ofra, approximately 15 miles north of Jerusalem in the West Bank. The Israeli Justice Ministry confirmed that the land in question was owned by Palestinians and that the nine houses in question had been ordered demolished. Dror Etkes of Yesh Din said "It's an international organization that is, simply put, stealing land."[tpl]cite news |last=Teibel |first=Amy |title=Lawsuit brings murky West Bank land deals to light |work=Associated Press| date=21 June 2009 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009363393_apmlisraeldisputeddeal.html[/tpl]
