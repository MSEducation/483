[[Noggin (Viva UK block)]]

CATEGORIES: Nickelodeon programming blocks

Noggin UK was a block of children's television programmes currently broadcast on MTV's free-to-air music channel, Viva (formerly TMF), from 6am to 8am daily. It first launched in January 2006. On Monday 25 September 2006, Noggin was replaced by a new strand named Nick Jr on TMF, which was identical to its predecessor with the exception of the new branding. The slot once again reverted to the Noggin moniker in March 2009.
Prior to its launch on TMF, the Noggin name had been used for a block of classic animated children's programmes from the late 1960s to early 1990s carried on Nick Jr. between 8pm and 10pm. This block changed its name to 'Nick Jr Classics' shortly before the TMF launch.
