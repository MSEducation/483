Madness is a self-titled compilation album by the British ska/pop band. It was issued primarily for the North American market in order to capitalise on the top 10 success in the United States of their hit single "Our House" from the 1982 album Madness Presents the Rise & Fall, which had not been available there. 
The album features six tracks from The Rise & Fall album, three from the 1981 album 7, one from the 1979 debut album One Step Beyond... and two single a-sides.  Curiously, the 1980 album Absolutely was not represented at all on this compilation.
Madness contains every UK single from "Grey Day" to "Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)," with the notable exception of "Driving in My Car," which has never been issued on any US compilation. However, the album was also issued in Japan where Driving In My Car replaced Rise & Fall.
