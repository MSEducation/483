[[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Winterbourne Monkton]]

CATEGORIES: Church of England churches in Wiltshire

The Church of St Mary Magdalene is the Anglican church in the Wiltshire village of Winterbourne Monkton. Its history dates from the 12th century and it lies in a peaceful setting in the Wiltshire countryside. The information leaflet inside the church tells us that what is now the chancel was originally the chapel, and although it is not known when it was built, it was standing in 1133.
An unusual feature inside the church consists of two huge tree trunks which originally supported the bells in the free-standing bell tower.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
