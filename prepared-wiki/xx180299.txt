The data contained in the row entitled Actual pledged delegates is a subset of the data in the row entitled Estimated pledged delegates. It represents delegates won in contests where the final apportionment of delegates has already been decided, but does not include delegates from contests where the final apportionment depends upon the outcome of further caucuses or conventions.  Caveat lector: the below "Estimated total delegates" row totals 2,390 delegates, but there are only 2,380 delegates.[tpl]-[/tpl]
