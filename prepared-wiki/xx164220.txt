==Invention==

As a graduate of Cornell University and serving as a US Naval Reserve Pilot, Dalton took an interest in slide-rule flight computers.  His first models were designed in the early 1930s but it was not until 1932 that the first revision of the E-6B, originally known as the "Dalton Dead Reckoning Computer", came into existence.
