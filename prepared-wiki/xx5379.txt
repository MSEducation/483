Judge Joseph Dredd is a fictional character whose comic strip in the British science fiction anthology 2000 AD is the magazine's longest running, having been featured there since its second issue in 1977. Dredd is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges are empowered to arrest, sentence, and execute criminals at the scene of crime. The character was created by writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra, although editor Pat Mills also deserves some credit for early development.
Judge Dredd is amongst the UK's best known comic characters. So great is the character's name recognition that his name is sometimes invoked over similar issues to those explored by the comic series, such as the police state, authoritarianism, and the rule of law.'Judge Dredd' powers for police urged, The Daily Telegraph, 22 September 2005 (from archive.org)  Judge Dredd was named the Seventh Greatest Comic Character by the British magazine Empire.Empire: The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters.

==Publication history==

When Pat Mills was developing 2000 AD in 1976, he brought in his former writing partner, John Wagner, to develop characters. Wagner had written various Dirty Harry-style "tough cop" stories for other titles, and suggested a character who took that concept to its logical extreme. Mills had developed a horror strip called Judge Dread but abandoned the idea as unsuitable for the new comic; but the name, with the spelling modified to "Dredd" at the suggestion of sub-editor Kelvin Gosnell, was adopted by Wagner."Judge Dredd: The Mega-History," by Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton (Lennard Publishing, 1995), p. 17.Pat Mills's blog, 20 September 2012 (retrieved 12 November 2012).
The task of visualising the character was given to Carlos Ezquerra, a Spanish artist who had worked for Mills before on Battle Picture Weekly. Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film Death Race 2000, showing the character Frankenstein (played by David Carradine) clad in black leather on a motorbike, as a suggestion of Dredd's appearance. Ezquerra added body-armour, zips, and chains, which Wagner initially declined.Jarman & Acton, pp. 21–22 Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended; in response to which, Mills set the story further in the future.Jarman & Acton, p. 30.The original launch story written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra was published several years later in an annual.
By this stage, Wagner had quit, disillusioned that a proposed buy-out of the new comic by another company (which would have given him and Mills a greater financial stake in the comic) had fallen through.Jarman & Acton, pp. 18 and 24. Mills was reluctant to lose "Judge Dredd" and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would provide a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that "Judge Dredd" would not be ready for the first issue of 2000 AD, launched in February 1977.Jarman & Acton, p. 34.
The story chosen to introduce the character was submitted by Peter Harris, and extensively re-written by Mills.Mills also included an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell: Jarman & Acton, p. 48. It was drawn by newcomer Mike McMahon. The strip debuted in "prog" (issue) No. 2, but Ezquerra, angry that another artist had drawn the first published strip, quit and returned to work for Battle.Jarman & Acton, pp. 42–43. Wagner soon  returned to the character, starting in prog 9. His "Robot Wars" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists (including Ezquerra), and marked the point where Dredd became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished.Jarman & Acton, pp. 62–63. The character has appeared in almost every issue since, the bulk of the stories written by Wagner (in collaboration with Alan Grant between 1980 and 1988).
Since 1990 Dredd has also headlined his own title, the Judge Dredd Megazine. With Wagner concentrating his energies there, the Dredd strip in 2000 AD was left to younger writers such as Garth Ennis, Mark Millar, Grant Morrison and John Smith. Their efforts were not popular with fans, and sales fell.Jarman & Acton, p. 128. Wagner returned to writing the character full-time in 1994.
Judge Dredd has also been published in a long-running comic strip (1981–1998) in the Daily Star,Judge Dredd in the Daily Star. 2000adonline.com. Retrieved 4 May 2012. and briefly in Metro from January – April 2004.Judge Dredd in Metro. 2000ad.org. Retrieved 30 January 2014. These were usually created by the same teams writing and drawing the main strip and the Daily Star strips have been collected into a number of volumes.

==Character and appearance==

Joseph Dredd is the most famous of the Street Judges that patrol Mega-City One, charged to instantly convict, sentence, and execute offenders. Dredd is armed with a "Lawgiver" pistol (programmed to recognise only his palm-print, and capable of six types of ammunition), a daystick, a knife and stun/gas grenades. His helmet obscures all of his face, except for his mouth and jaw. He rides a large "Lawmaster" motorbike equipped with machine-guns, a powerful laser cannon, and full artificial intelligence capable of responding to orders from the Judge and operating itself.
Dredd's entire face is never shown properly in the strip. This custom began as an unofficial guideline, but soon became a rule which artists were required to follow.Jarman & Acton, pp. 74–75. As John Wagner explained: "It sums up the facelessness of justice − justice has no soul. So it isn't necessary for readers to see Dredd's face, and I don't want you to."Jarman & Acton p. 75
On very rare occasions Dredd's face has been shown in flashbacks to when he was a child, in pictures lacking detail.2000 AD #30 and 1187 In an early story in prog 8, Dredd is forced to remove his helmet and the other characters react as if he is disfigured; but, Dredd's face was covered by a faux censorship sticker.Jarman & Acton, pp. 56 and 74. In only one other prog has Dredd's face been on view. In prog 52, during Dredd's tenure on the Lunar Colonies, he uses a 'face-change' machine to impersonate the crooked lawyer of a gang of bank robbers."The Face Change Crimes" in 2000 AD #52 (18/2/1978), written by John Wagner, with art by Brian Bolland. Page 14. 
In Carlos Ezquerra's original design he drew Dredd with large lips, "to put a mystery as to his racial background."Jarman & Acton, p. 22. Not all of the artists who worked on the strip were told of this; therefore Mike McMahon drew Dredd as a black man, while Brian Bolland and Ron Smith drew him as a white man. As the strip was not yet printed in colour, this went unnoticed and the idea was dropped.Jarman & Acton, pp. 89–90.
Time passes in the Judge Dredd strip in approximate real time, so as a year passes in life, a year passes in the comic. Thus the first Dredd story, published in 1977, was set in 2099, and stories published in 2014 are set in 2136. Consequently, as former editor Alan McKenzie explains, "every year that goes by Dredd gets a year older – unlike Spider-Man, who has been a university student for the past twenty-five years!"Jarman & Acton, p. 112. Therefore Dredd is over seventy years old, with over fifty years of active service (2079–2136), and for some time characters in the comic have been mentioning that Dredd is not as young and fit as formerly. This remains a theme of many stories, and in prog 1595 (2008) Dredd was diagnosed with benign cancer of the duodenum. It is not known whether there are any long term plans to address this issue (although Mega-City One has cloning and brain transplant technology). In an interview with Empire in 2012 Wagner said: "There could be many ways to end it, but the probability is that I won’t still be around when it happens! I would love to write it, but I can’t see it happening. I’ll leave the script in my will."Empireonline.com "Exclusive: John Wagner And Alex Garland Talk Dredd"

===Fictional character biography===

Senior Judge Joseph Dredd and his brother Rico Dredd were cloned from the DNA of Chief Judge Fargo, the first chief judge, in 2066."A Case for Treatment," in 2000 AD #389 Their growth was artificially accelerated until an apparent physiological age of 5, with all the appropriate knowledge for their age electronically implanted in their brains during gestation."Origins," in 2000 AD #1515 The name Dredd was chosen by the genetic scientist who created them, Morton Judd, to "instill fear in the population"."Origins," in 2000 AD #1515 As cadets during Atomic Wars, they were temporarily made full Judges and sent to restore order to the panic-stricken streets.2000 AD #1517 Distinguishing themselves, they were chosen to take part in assaulting the White House when the Justice Department deposed President Booth."Origins," 2000 AD #1530 They were later educated at the Academy of Law, Joseph graduating second in his class while Rico came first."The Return of Rico," in 2000 AD #30 Later that year Joseph was forced to arrest Rico for murder and corruption. Offered the opportunity to become chief judge in 2101, Dredd declined, preferring to serve on the streets enforcing the law."The Day the Law Died," in 2000 AD #108 On several occasions he saved his city from conquest or destruction by powerful enemies, and in 2114, he saved the story's entire world during the Fourth World War."Judgement Day," in 2000 AD #786–799
Although Dredd holds his duty above every other priority this devotion is not blind loyalty. On two occasions (in 2099 and 2112), Dredd resigned from the force on points of principle, but both times returned."Robot Wars," 2000 AD #11; "Tale of the Dead Man," #668 In 2113, Dredd insisted that the Justice Department gamble its very existence on a referendum to prove its legitimacy."Nightmares," 2000 AD #706 In 2116, he risked 20 years' imprisonment with hard labour when he challenged the policy of a chief judge;"Prologue," Judge Dredd Megazine vol. 2 #57 and in 2129, he threatened to resign to persuade another chief judge to change the city's harsh anti-mutant laws."The Spirit of Christmas," 2000 AD #2008 (a December 2007 New Year issue)
After fifty years of active service, Dredd's career may be drawing to a close. In 2130, he was diagnosed with cancer, though it was accounted operable."The Edgar Case," 2000 AD #1595 In 2132, Dredd was appointed to the Council of Five, Mega-City One's highest governing body,"Tour of Duty," 2000 AD #1693 on which he served for two years."Day of Chaos," 2000 AD #1789

===Family and associates===

==Villains==

Numerous infamous criminals (or "perps" in the story's argot) have featured over the years, including:

==The Judge system==

Street Judges act as police, judge, jury, and executioner. Capital punishment in Mega-City One is rarely used,2000 AD #261, 630, 1337, and Batman vs. Judge Dredd: Die Laughing (1998) though deaths while resisting arrest are commonplace. Numerous writers have used the Judge System to satirize contemporary politics.
Judges, once appointed, can be broadly characterised as "Street Judges" (who patrol the city), and administrative, or office-based judges. Dredd was once offered the job of Chief Judge; but refused it.2000 AD #108 The incorruptibility of the Judges is supposedly maintained by the Special Judicial Squad, although SJS judges have themselves broken the law on occasion, most notably SJS head Judge Cal who killed the chief judge and usurped his office for himself.2000 AD #89 This 'Judge System' has spread world-wide, with various super-cities possessing similar methods of law enforcement. As such this political model has become the most common form of government on Earth, with only a few small areas practicing civilian rule. There is therefore an international "Judicial Charter" which countries and city states join upon instituting a Judge System.2000 AD #727 and 804

==Dredd's world==

The setting of Judge Dredd is a dystopian future Earth damaged by a series of international conflicts; much of the planet has become radioactive wasteland, and so populations have aggregated in enormous conurbations known as 'mega-cities'.2000 AD #4 The story is centred on the megalopolis of Mega-City One, on the east coast of North America. Within Mega-City One, extensive automation (including intelligent robots) has rendered the majority of the population unemployed.2000 AD #9 As a consequence, the general population is prone to embracing any fashion or craze they encounter.2000 AD #290 Mega-City One is surrounded by the inhospitable "Cursed Earth".2000 AD #4 and 61 Much of the remaining world's geography is somewhat vague, although other mega-cities are visited in the strip.
Mega-City One's population lives in gigantic towers known as City Blocks, each holding some fifty thousand people.2000 AD #117 and 118 Each is named after some historical person or TV character, usually for comic effect. For example, Joe Dredd used to live in the Rowdy Yates Block – Rowdy Yates was a character in the American TV cowboy drama Rawhide, played by a young Clint Eastwood. Eastwood would later play the lead in Dirty Harry – one of the thematic influences by which Judge Dredd was inspired. A number of stories feature rivalries between different blocks,2000 AD #489 on many occasions breaking into full-scale gun battles between them2000 AD #182 (most notably in "Block Mania"2000 AD #236–244). The Judges' powers reflect the difficulty of maintaining order. Mega-City One extends from Boston to Charlotte; but extended further before the Apocalypse War.2000 AD #245–270 At its height, the city contained a population of about 800 million; after the Apocalypse War, it averaged at 400 million; following Chaos Day in 2134, the city was reduced to 50 million. The story Origins revealed that Mega-City One was formed by urban sprawl rather than deliberate design, and by 2051 it was recognised as the world's first mega-city.
There are four other major population centres in Dredd's Northern America: the first is Texas City, including several of the southern former United States and based on Wild West manners.2000 AD #160–161 South of the city is Mex-City. Far north is Uranium City. Canada remains a nation (now called Canadia) with scattered communities. Until 2114 Mega-City Two also existed on the West Coast, but was destroyed during the world war known as Judgement Day.Judge Dredd Megazine volume 2 #7 Nuclear deserts and destruction elsewhere in the world are also extensive: Much of the north Atlantic is severely polluted, and is now known as the "Black Atlantic."2000 AD #128–129 An underwater settlement known as Atlantis exists in the Atlantic, half-way along a tunnel from Mega-City One to Brit-Cit (England).2000 AD #485
Nuclear desert also stretches across western Europe. The British Isles are Brit-Cit, Cal-Hab (Scotland), and Murphyville in Ireland (a country-sized theme park depicting a stereotypical view of traditional Irish life).2000 AD #727–732 The continent has Euro-City (eastern France and part of Germany), Ciudad España (eastern Spain), the Ruhr and Berlin Conurbs in Germany, Vatican City, and a scattering of other city-states. Russia's East-Meg One was destroyed by Dredd at the climax of the Apocalypse War in 2104.2000 AD #266–267 Further east is East-Meg Two,2000 AD #270 which has other territories under the "Sov Block" banner. Mongolia, lacking a Mega-City or Judge system, has called itself the Mongolian Free State and criminals have flocked there for a safe haven; East-Meg Two performed vicious clearances there in 2125.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
In Asia, separated from East-Meg Two by an extensive nuclear desert, are Sino-City One (destroyed during Judgement Day) and Sino-City Two in eastern China, with Hong Tong built in the remains of Hong Kong and partitioned between Sino-Cit and Brit-Cit control.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Hondo City lies on the remains of the islands of Japan.2000 AD #608–611 Nu-Delhi (previously Indo-Cit and Delhi-City) is in southern India. Between Hondo and Sino-City lie the Radlands of Ji, a nuclear desert containing outlaw gangs and martial arts schools.2000 AD #451 In the Pacific cities survive in south-east Australia or "Oz" (the Sydney-Melbourne Conurbation), the Solomon Islands (Solomon City), Tonga (Friendly City), and the New Pacific City; New Zealand is said to exist as well. All of Indonesia's islands are now linked by a network of mutant coral called "The Web", described as a lawless hotbed of crime.
The Middle East is without many major cities, being either nuclear or natural deserts, and only the mega-city of Luxor, Egypt has survived; the Mediterranean coast is heavily damaged by mutagens. In Africa much of the south is nuclear desert and a 'Great African Dustbowl' has formed in the north-west; but a large number of nation states have survived, whereof Simba City (Gabon), New Jerusalem (Ethiopia), Zambian Metropolitan, and Dar es Salaam are the largest cities. Nuclear fallout and pollution appear to have missed Antarctica and the Arctic, allowing one mega-city (Antarctic City) to be constructed there.
The high levels of pollution have created instances of mutation in humans and animals. The mega-cities largely operate on a system of genetic apartheid, making expulsion from the cities the worst punishment possible.2000 AD #160 Mega-City One ended apartheid in the 2130s, but encourages mutants to move to Cursed Earth townships instead of remaining in the city.
Earth's moon has been colonised, with a series of large domes forming Luna City;2000 AD #42 another colony, Puerto Luminae, exists but is lawless.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] In addition, many deep space colonies have been established. Some are loyal to various mega cities, while many are independent states, and others still face violent insurgencies to gain independence. The multi-national Space Corps battles both insurgencies and external alien threats. The newly discovered planet 'Hestia' (which orbits the Sun at 90 degrees to Earth's orbit) has a colony; there are some references to colonies on Mars; Saturn's moon Titan has a judicial penal colony;2000 AD #30 and Mega-City One is known to have deep space missile silos on Pluto.2000 AD #771

==Major Judge Dredd storylines==

There have been a number of Judge Dredd storylines that have either significantly developed the Dredd character or the fictional world, or which depict a story on a grand scale. These are listed below. (For a complete list of all stories see here.)

==List of stories==

All of the stories from both comics are currently being reprinted in their original order of publication in two series of trade paperbacks. Stories from the regular issues of 2000 AD and the Megazine are collected in a series entitled Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files. This series began in 2005.Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files – Grovel: graphic novel reviews. Grovel.org.uk (20 January 2010). Retrieved 4 May 2012.Excluded from the Complete Case Files series were the stories "America" (Megazine vol. 1 #1–7) and "Beyond Our Kenny" (vol. 1 #1–3). These were originally published not as mainstream Judge Dredd stories but as spin-off series. However their respective sequels appeared under the Judge Dredd banner, and they are collected in trade paperbacks under the titles "Judge Dredd: America" and "Judge Dredd: The Art of Kenny Who?" Stories from special holiday issues and annuals appear in Judge Dredd: The Restricted Files. This four-volume series began in 2010 and concluded in 2012.

==Alternative versions==

Shortly before the release of the 1995 movie, three new comic book titles were released, followed by a one-off comic version of the film story.

===Films===

====Judge Dredd (1995)====

An American film loosely based on the comic strip was released in 1995, starring Sylvester Stallone as Dredd[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113492/ |title=Judge Dredd IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2007 [/tpl] (it was said that Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally requested for the role,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113492/trivia |title=Judge Dredd IMDb Trivia|accessdate=3 May 2007 [/tpl] but declined because in the original script, Dredd would keep the helmet on during major parts of the film). The film received negative reviews upon its release. It currently holds a 15% rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus stating that "Director Danny Cannon fails to find the necessary balance to make it work".Rotten Tomatoes Retrieved 21 June 2010 In deference to its expensive Hollywood star, Dredd's face was shown. In the comic, he very rarely removes his helmet, and even then his real face is never revealed. Also the writers largely omitted the ironic humour of the comic strip, and ignored important aspects of the "Dredd mythology". For example, in the film a "love interest" is developed between Dredd and Judge Hershey, something that is strictly forbidden between Judges (or Judges and anyone else for that matter) in the comic strip. In the United States, the film won several "worst film of the year" awards.Judge Dredd back in force. Indiemoviesonline.com. Retrieved 4 May 2012.Judge Dredd. Lioncomics.tripod.com.

The winner of the game is the judge who collected the most points arresting perps. Players could sabotage each other's arrest attempts. Additionally, there were many amusing card combinations such as arresting Judge Death for selling old comics, as the Old Comic Selling crime card featured a 2000 AD cover with Judge Death on it.
