'''GRANITE CREEK, BRITISH COLUMBIA"
'''Although never a city, "Granite City" is an alternate name for the mining settlement Granite Creek, established on Granite Creek during the  1885 gold rush. Granite Creek is now a ghost town in the Similkameen region of British Columbia, Canada.

==Early years==

A cowboy and sometimes prospector named  Johnny Chance discovered gold in Granite Creek in 1885.  The discovery of gold led to the creation of a mining settlement called "Granite City"  in 1885. The federal Post Office named "Granite Creek" was opened  on May 1, 1886. It remained open with only one temporary closure, until March 31, 1918.[tpl]cite web|title=Post Offices and Postmasters.|url=http://www.granitecreekbc.ca/archive/Granite_Creek_Postmasters.pdf[/tpl] Granite Creek lay deep in the remote Tulameen country of southern British Columbia.  By 1886 Granite Creek contained 300 European prospectors and 100 Chinese.  On April 21, 1886 the newspaper called the Victoria Colonist reported Granite City(sic) had "9 general stores,14 hotels and restaurants,2 jewelers,3 bakers,3 blacksmiths,2 livery stables,a shoemaker, butcher, chemist, attorney, doctor and 8 pack trains owned in the city.  200 buildings occupy the two main streets - Government and Granite."

Granite Greek was mistakenly regarded as one of the largest cities in British Columbia.  The town never contained a school, church nor a local governing body.  The jail did not have bars on the windows.  The windows were one foot square.
On April 4, 1907 most of the town was destroyed by a fire.

==The 1930s==

By 1915 the gold rush was over and Granite Creek lay deserted. The depression of the 1930s brought drifters to Granite Creek hoping to eke out a living on the placer gold creeks of the past.  By the time the depression came to an end only a handful of miners lived at Granite Creek.  By the 1960s the last of these miners in Granite Creek had passed on and Granite Creek became a ghost town of British Columbia.  Only a very few partial log buildings stand on the original site.

==Lost platinum cache==

British Columbia Historian Bill Barlee reports the story of a Scandinavian by the name of Johanssen.  Johanssen recovered a reported 300 ounces of platinum from Granite Creek, British Columbia[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl].  Johanssen is reported to have buried his cache of platinum in a bucket south of his cabin and visible from the cabin door.  Granite City was destroyed by a fire in 1907.  Johanssen's cabin was levelled by the fire.  With the cabin lost so was the location as to where the cache was.  The platinum cache is reported to still be there, close to $50,000 in platinum buried somewhere in Granite City[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]. This legend should be lightly regarded, as other than N.L. Barlee's story, there is no other evidence of such a cache.

==Television==

Granite Creek was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, Season 1, Episode 11.
