[[Germany at the 1952 Winter Olympics]]

CATEGORIES: Nations at the 1952 Winter Olympics, Germany at the Winter Olympics, 1952 in German sport

Germany competed at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway after not having been invited to the 1948 Winter Olympics because of the role in World War II, and because the NOC restored in 1947 as Deutscher Olympischer Ausschu√ü did not represent a recognized state yet. The Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, the NOC for Germany was renamed and in 1951 recognized by the IOC while recognition of a separate NOC of the GDR was declined. East Germans were told to cooperate in a single team Germany, which they declined in 1952, but accepted for 1956 and later.
Germany entered all events except the 1500 metres skating event, which was skipped by Germany' only speed skating entrant in favour of the other three events.
The IOC website currently uses both the codes GER or FRG for German medal winners, suggesting they represented two different teams:

==Medalists==

==Alpine skiing==

==Bobsleigh==

==Cross-country skiing==

==Figure skating==

==Ice hockey==

The tournament was run in a round-robin format with nine teams participating.

==Nordic combined==

Events:
The cross-country skiing part of this event was combined with the main medal event, meaning that athletes competing here were skiing for two disciplines at the same time. Details can be found above in this article, in the cross-country skiing section. 
The ski jumping (normal hill) event was held separate from the main medal event of ski jumping, results can be found in the table below (athletes were allowed to perform three jumps, the best two jumps were counted and are shown here).
