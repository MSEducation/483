===Purchase of 41 018===

No. 042 018-2 was bought, because she was the best of the 29 surviving Class 41s, having only had an L2/H2.8 overhaul in 1975. She had completed just die 66,000 kilometer since her overhaul and could therefore continue to be worked for a long time, both in terms of distance and time.

==Events==

Special steam trains are hauled by 41 018 in cooperation with other organisations.
