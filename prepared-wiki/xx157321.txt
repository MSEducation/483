Čili is a restaurant chain in Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Poland and Russia. It started as a pizza restaurant, but soon diversified into different areas.

==History==

In 1997, the first Čili Pica restaurant was opened on Konstitucijos Avenue in Vilnius, Lithuania. From 1999 onwards the company, renamed UAB Čilija, began to diversify, adding bistros in 2000, traditional Lithuanian-style restaurants in 2002, Chinese restaurants in 2003, coffee shops in 2004 and drive-ins in 2006.
The first restaurant outside Vilnius was opened in Palanga. The company soon expanded into other countries, opening its first non-Lithuanian restaurant in December 2001 in the Latvian city of Liepāja. As of May 2009, there were 79 outlets in five countries, some of them established via franchising.
