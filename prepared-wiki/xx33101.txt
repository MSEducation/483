The Bush Doctrine is a phrase used to describe various related foreign policy principles of the 43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush. The phrase was first used by Charles Krauthammer in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's "unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html  |title=Charlie Gibson's Gaffe |first=Charles |last=Krauthammer |work=The Washington Post |date=September 13, 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-31[/tpl] According to Charles Krauthammer, who was the first to use it in June 2001, the phrase has had four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of the George W. Bush presidency:  firstly, unilateralism, i.e. unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and rejecting the Kyoto Protocol; secondly, after 9-11-2001, the “with us or against us” policy on terror; thirdly, a doctrine of pre-emptive war, e.g. Iraq; and fourthly, the idea that the fundamental mission of American foreign policy is to spread democracy throughout the world. After 9/11 the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3DE123CF930A25757C0A9649C8B63 |title=Editorial Observer; President Bush and the Middle East Axis of Ambiguity |first=Steven R. |last=Weisman |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2002[/tpl]
Different pundits would attribute different meanings to "the Bush Doctrine", as it came to describe other elements, including the policy of preventive war, which held that the United States should depose foreign regimes that represented a potential threat to the security of the United States, even if that threat was not immediate; a policy of spreading democracy around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating terrorism; and a willingness to unilaterally pursue U.S. military interests.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1616724,00.html |title= Edwards Rejects the 'War on Terror' |first=Mike |last=Allen |journal=TIME|date=May 2, 2007[/tpl][ref]

The phrase "Bush Doctrine" was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President Dick Cheney, in a June 2003 speech in which he said, "If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq."Vice President Tells West Point Cadets "Bush Doctrine" Is Serious, American Forces Press Service, June 2, 2003

==National Security Strategy of the United States==

The main elements of the Bush Doctrine were delineated in a document, the National Security Strategy of the United States, published on September 17, 2002.Introduction - The National Security Strategy 2002, PDF This document is often cited as the definitive statement of the doctrine.[tpl]cite news |last=Opinion |title=Aftermath; The Bush Doctrine |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0D8153BF930A25757C0A9659C8B63&scp=4&sq=%22bush%20doctrine%22&st=cse |work=New York Times |date=April 13, 2003| accessdate=2008-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Opinion |title=The Bush Doctrine |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1D71F30F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63&scp=9&sq=bush%20doctrine&st=cse |work=New York Times |date=September 22, 2002| accessdate=2008-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Gitlin |first=Todd |journal=Mother Jones |title=America's Age of Empire: The Bush Doctrine |url=http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2003/01/ma_205_01.html |date=January–February 2003 |accessdate=2008-09-12[/tpl] It was updated in 2006[tpl]cite book|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2006/print/index.html |title=The National Security Strategy of the United States |author=National Security Council |publisher=The White House|date=March 2006 |authorlink= United States National Security Council[/tpl] and is stated as follows:[tpl]cite book|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2006/print/sectionV.html|chapter=Summary of National Security Strategy 2002|title=The National Security Strategy of the United States|author=National Security Council|publisher=The White House|date=March 2006[/tpl]

==Components==

The Bush Doctrine has been defined as a collection of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy. Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: preemptive strikes against potential enemies and promoting democratic regime change.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1000.html |title=The Bush Doctrine |work=Think Tank|publisher=PBS |first=Ben J. |last=Wattenberg |authorlink=Ben J.

The George W. Bush administration claimed that the United States is locked in a global war; a war of ideology, in which its enemies are bound together by a common ideology and a common hatred of democracy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/08/13/news/image.php |title=News Analysis: 'Islamic fascists'?

Out of the National Security Strategy, four main points are highlighted as the core to the Bush Doctrine: Preemption, Military Primacy, New Multilateralism, and the Spread of Democracy.[tpl]cite journal|author=Lieber, Keir A. and Robert J. Lieber |title=The Bush National Security Strategy |journal= U.S. Foreign Policy Agenda |volume=7|issue=4|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=December 2002|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itps/1202/ijpe/pj7-4lieber.htm[/tpl]  The document emphasized preemption by stating: "America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few," and required "defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders."[tpl]cite news|work=Chicago Tribune |title=The Bush Doctrine |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-bush-doctrinesep12,0,6804685.story|author=Tribune Staff|date=September 12, 2008[/tpl]
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld remarked thus in 2006, in a statement taken to reflect his view of the Doctrine's efficacy: "If I were rating, I would say we probably deserve a D or D+ as a country as how well we're doing in the battle of ideas that's taking place. I'm not going to suggest that it's easy, but we have not found the formula as a country."
In his 2010 memoir Decision Points, President Bush articulates his discrete concept of the Bush Doctrine.  According to the President, his doctrine consisted of four "prongs," three of them practical, and one idealistic.  They are the following: (In his words)

===Unilateralism===

Unilateral elements were evident in the first months of Bush's presidency. Conservative Charles Krauthammer, coiner of the term "Bush Doctrine," deployed "unilateralism," in February 2001 to refer to the president's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding the president's decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty.[tpl]cite news | last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |title=The Bush doctrine: In American foreign policy, a new motto: Don't ask. Tell |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/2001/03/05/doctrine.html |publisher=CNN |date=February 26, 2001| accessdate=2008-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |title=Charlie Gibson's Gaffe |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html |work=Washington Post |date=September 12, 2008| accessdate=2008-09-12[/tpl]
There is some evidence that Bush's willingness for the United States to act unilaterally came even earlier. The International Journal of Peace Studies 2003 article "The Bush administration's image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity" states:[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.gmu.edu/academic/ijps/vol8_1/David%20and%20Ramel.htm |title=The Bush Administrations's Image of Europe: From Ambivalence to Rigidity|journal=International Journal of Peace Studies|volume=8 |issue=1 |first=Charles-Philippe |last=David |coauthors=Frédéric Ramel |date=Spring–Summer 2003 |accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl] 

===Attacking countries that harbor terrorists===

The doctrine was developed more fully as an executive branch response in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The attacks presented a foreign policy challenge, since it was not Afghanistan that had initiated the attacks, and there was no evidence that they had any foreknowledge of the attacks.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://worlddefensereview.com/phares113007.shtml |title=Bin Laden and Future Jihad in Europe|first=Walid |last=Phares|authorlink= Walid Phares |journal=World Defense Review|date=November 30, 2007[/tpl] In an address to the nation on the evening of September 11, Bush stated his resolution of the issue by declaring that "we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010911-16.html |title=Statement by the President in His Address to the Nation|date= September 11, 2001 |first=George W. |last=Bush|authorlink=George W. Bush|publisher=The White House[/tpl] 
President Bush made an even more aggressive restatement of this principle in his September 20, 2001 address to a Joint Session of Congress:[tpl]cite news |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/print/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |publisher=The White House |first=George W. |last=Bush |authorlink=George W.

Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.[/tpl]
Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary at the time, later wrote in an autobiographical account of that address, "In a speech hailed by the press and by Democrats, President announced what became known as the 'Bush Doctrine'".page 186  The first published reference after the 9/11 attacks to the terror-fighting doctrine appeared September 30 in an op-ed by political scientist Neal Coates.[tpl]cite news | last=Coates |first=Neal |title=The Bush Doctrine: New Policy to Ensure Our Safety Must Be Examined |url= http://texnews.com/1998/2001/opinion/bush0930.html |publisher= Abilene Reporter News |date= September 30, 2001| accessdate=2009-11-22[/tpl]
This policy was used to justify the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, and has since been applied to American military action against Al Qaeda camps in North-West Pakistan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]

===Pre-emptive strikes===

Bush addressed the cadets at the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) on June 1, 2002, and made clear the role pre-emptive war would play in the future of American foreign policy and national defense:[tpl]cite news |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/06/print/20020601-3.html |title=President Bush Delivers Graduation Speech at West Point |publisher=The White House |first=George W. |last=Bush |authorlink=George W. Bush |date=June 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl] [tpl]Cquote|We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants, who solemnly sign non-proliferation treaties, and then systemically break them. If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long — Our security will require transforming the military you will lead — a military that must be ready to strike at a moment's notice in any dark corner of the world. And our security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute, to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives.[/tpl]
The stance of the US administration was that the harsh measures to spread the democracy around the globe are inevitable and  efficacious, in which for instance, liberating Iraq will not only plant democracy in the area, but also enable the democracy to flourish in the rest of the Middle East.Jervis,Robert (Fall, 2003). "Understanding the Bush Doctrine". The Academy of Political Science, Political Science Quarterly ,
Two distinct schools of thought arose in the Bush Administration regarding the question of how to handle countries such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea (the so-called "Axis of Evil"[tpl]cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/bush.speech.txt/ | work=CNN | title=Bush State of the Union address | date=January 29, 2002 | accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl] states). Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, as well as U.S. Department of State specialists, argued for what was essentially the continuation of existing U.S. foreign policy. These policies, developed after the Cold War, sought to establish a multilateral consensus for action (which would likely take the form of increasingly harsh sanctions against the problem states, summarized as the policy of containment). The opposing view, argued by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and a number of influential Department of Defense policy makers such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, held that direct and unilateral action was both possible and justified and that America should embrace the opportunities for democracy and security offered by its position as sole remaining superpower.

===Democratic regime change===

In a series of speeches in late 2001 and 2002, Bush expanded on his view of American foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the United States should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the United States had the right to act unilaterally in its own security interests, without the approval of international bodies such as the United Nations.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1616724,00.html |title=Edwards Rejects the 'War on Terror' |first=Mike |last=Allen, |journal=TIME|date= May 2, 2007[/tpl] This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.
In his 2003 State of the Union Address, Bush declared:[tpl]cite news |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/print/20030128-19.html |title=President Delivers "State of the Union"  |publisher=The White House |first=George W. |last=Bush |authorlink=George W.

The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift to humanity.[/tpl]
After his second inauguration, in a January 2006 speech at National Defense University, Bush said: "The defense of freedom requires the advance of freedom."
Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine held that the hatred for the West and United States in particular does not exist because of actions perpetrated by the United States, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of United States are using terrorism as a war of ideology against the United States. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself and its friends by promoting democracy where the terrorists are located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities.

==Influences on the Bush Doctrine==

===Neoconservatives===

The development of the doctrine was influenced by neoconservative ideology, and it was considered to be a step from the political realism of the Reagan Doctrine. The Reagan Doctrine was considered key to American foreign policy until the end of the Cold War, just before Bill Clinton became president of the United States. The Reagan Doctrine was considered anti-Communist and in opposition to Soviet Union global influence, but later spoke of a peace dividend towards the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. The Reagan Doctrine was strongly criticized[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110008830 |title=Is the Bush Doctrine Dead? |first=Norman |last=Podhoretz |authorlink=Norman Podhoretz |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20810FB3D5C0C718CDDAC0894DA484D81 |first=Norman |last=Podhoretz |authorlink=Norman Podhoretz |title=The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan's Foreign Policy |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=May 2, 1982|accessdate=2008-09-14[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/1984/3.html |title=The First Term: The Reagan Road to Détente |first=Norman |last=Podhoretz |authorlink=Norman Podhoretz |journal=Foreign Affairs |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|volume=63 |issue=3 |date=America and the World 1984 |accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl]  by the neoconservatives, who also became disgruntled with the outcome of the Gulf War and United States foreign policy under Bill Clinton, sparking them to call for change towards global stability[tpl]cite book|first=Dale C. |last=Copeland|title=The Origins of Major War |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8014-8757-9[/tpl] through their support for active intervention and the democratic peace theory. Several central persons in the counsel to the George W. Bush administration considered themselves to be neoconservatives or strongly support their foreign policy ideas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm |title=PNAC Statement of Princicples |authorlink=Elliott Abrams |first=Elliot, et al. |last=Abrams |date=1997-06-03 |publisher=Project for the New American Century |accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first=Peter J. |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/041101fa_fact |title=The Believer: Paul Wolfowitz Defends His War|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 1, 2004|accessdate=2007-06-20|last=Boyer[/tpl]Cf.

Neoconservatives are widely known to long have supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and on January 26, 1998, the PNAC sent a public letter to then-President Bill Clinton stating: [tpl]Cquote|As a result, in the not-too-distant future we will be unable to determine with any reasonable level of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons. Such uncertainty will, by itself, have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East. It hardly needs to be added that if Saddam does acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction, as he is almost certain to do if we continue along the present course, the safety of American troops in the region, of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states, and a significant portion of the world’s supply of oil will all be put at hazard. As you have rightly declared, Mr. President, the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how we handle this threat.[/tpl]
Among the signatories to Project for the New American Century's original statement of Principals is George H. W. Bush’s Vice President Dan Quayle, George W. Bush's defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, his deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, his Vice President Dick Cheney, and his brother Jeb Bush.
PNAC member and the chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee (DPBAC), Neoconservative Richard Perle, later expressed regret over the Iraq invasion and ultimately put the blame for the invasion on President George W. Bush;.[tpl]cite news |title= Neocons turn on Bush for incompetence over Iraq war |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1939471,00.html |work= The Guardian | first= Julian |last= Borger |date= November 4, 2006 | location=London[/tpl]
Other than Bush and Rumsfeld,  who are thought to have adopted neoconservative foreign policy thinking include Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
The Bush Doctrine, in line with long-standing neoconservative ideas, held that the United States is entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the United States must take responsibility for security and show leadership in the world by actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.ourjerusalem.com/opinion/story/opinion20020904a.html |title=In Praise of the Bush Doctrine |first=Norman |last=Podhoretz |authorlink=Norman Podhoretz |journal=Our Jerusalem |date=September 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl]
The Bush Doctrine, and neoconservative reasoning, held that containment of the enemy as under the Realpolitik of Reagan did not work, and that the enemy of United States must be destroyed pre-emptively before they attack — using all the United States' available means, resources and influences to do so.
On the book Winning the War on Terror Dr. James Forest, U.S. Military Academy Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, comments: "While the West faces uncertainties in the struggle against militant Islam’s armies of darkness, and while it is true that we do not yet know precisely how it will end, what has become abundantly clear is that the world will succeed in defeating militant Islam because of the West’s flexible, democratic institutions and its all-encompassing ideology of freedom."

===Natan Sharansky===

Another part of the intellectual underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book The Case for Democracy, written by Israeli politician and author Natan Sharansky and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States Ron Dermer, which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/10/bush.readinglist.tm/ |title=What the president reads |first=John F. |last=Dickerson |journal=TIME |date=January 10, 2005[/tpl] The book argues that replacing dictatorships with democratic governments is both morally justified, since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.

===Expanding United States influence===

Princeton University research fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 International Security journal article "The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy",[tpl]cite journal |title=The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy |journal=International Security |volume=29 |issue=4 |first=Jonathan |last=Monten |date=Spring 2005[/tpl] attributed the Bush administration's activist democracy promotion to two main factors: the expansion of material capabilities, and the presence of a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that the Bush Doctrine promotion of democracy abroad was held as vital by the Bush administration to the success of the United States in the "war on terror". It was also a key objective of the administration's grand strategy of expanding the political and economic influence of the United States internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: "exemplarism," or leadership by example, and "vindicationism," or the direct application of United States power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of the Bush administration.

==Criticism and analysis==

The Bush Doctrine resulted in criticism and controversy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pww.org/article/articleview/399/ |title=Unity can defeat the Bush doctrine |work=People Weekly World |first=Jarvis |last=Tyner |authorlink=Jarvis Tyner |date=January 12, 2002|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl]  Peter D. Feaver, who worked on the Bush national security strategy as a staff member on the National Security Council, said he has counted as many as seven distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the United States, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the "Bush Doctrine," demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. "I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine," said Philip D. Zelikow, who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. "Indeed, I believe the assertion that there is such a doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration's policies than they deserve." Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said he thought there was no "single piece of paper" that represents the Bush doctrine.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/12/ST2008091203408.html |title=Many Versions of 'Bush Doctrine' |date=September 13, 2008 | first=Michael|last=Abramowitz | journal=The Washington Post[/tpl]
And yet there are inspections that indicate such strategies that are concentrated on liberalism and democracy follow the mainstream of American diplomatic traditions. With the adherence to liberal and universal political ideals, evangelism, and perceived obligations to disseminate the norms internationally, the United States historically played its role as an agent of liberal change in international arena.Monten,Jonathan (Spring, 2005).

Kaufman wrote: "No one grasped the logics or implications of this transformation better than Halford Mackinder. His prescient theories, first set forth in Geographical Pivot of History, published in 1904, have rightly shaped American grand strategy since World War II. Mackinder warned that any single power dominating Eurasia, "the World Island", as he called it, would have the potential to dominate the world, including the United States."[tpl]harvnb|Kaufman|2007|pages=11–12[/tpl] Kaufman is a political scientist, public policy professor and member of The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee. He said in an interview about the book: "I wrote this book because of my conviction that the Bush Doctrine has a more compelling logic and historical pedigree than people realize."

The Bush Doctrine was polarizing both domestically and internationally. In 2008, polls showed there was more anti-Americanism than before the Bush administration formed the Bush Doctrine; this increase was probably, at least partially, a result of implementing the Bush doctrine and conservative foreign policy.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.28138/pub_detail.asp |title=Don't Blame George Bush for Anti-Americanism |journal=National Post|location=Canada|date=June 14, 2008|publisher=Republished by the American Enterprise Institute |first=David |last=Frum |authorlink=David Frum |accessdate=2008-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~ppns/papers/speulda.pdf |format=PDF|title=Documenting the Phenomenon of Anti-Americanism |publisher=The Princeton Project on National Security|location=Princeton University |first=Nicole |last=Speulda |authorlink= |year=2005[/tpl]

===Foreign interventionism===

The foreign policy of the Bush Doctrine was subject to controversy both in the United States and internationally.
Some critics of the policies were suspicious of the increasing willingness of the United States to use military force unilaterally.
Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson argued that it reflects a turn away from international law, and marks the end of American legitimacy in foreign affairs.[tpl]cite journal|first= Robert W. |last=Tucker |coauthors=David C.

Others have stated that it could lead to other states resorting to the production of WMD or terrorist activities.[tpl]cite news | first=Richard | last=Falk |authorlink=Richard A.

Patrick J. Buchanan wrote that the 2003 invasion of Iraq had significant similarities to the 1996 neoconservative policy paper A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm.[tpl]cite journal|first=Patrick J. |last=Buchanan|authorlink=Patrick J.

Political scientist Karen Kwiatkowski in 2007 wrote on her article "Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine":
 We are killing terrorists in self-defense and for the good of the world, you see. We are taking over foreign countries, setting them up with our favorite puppets "in charge," controlling their economy, their movements, their dress codes, their defensive projects, and their dreams, solely because we love them, and apparently can’t live without them.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/kwiatkowski/kwiatkowski170.html |title=Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine |first=Karen |last=Kwiatkowski |authorlink=Karen Kwiatkowski |publisher=LewRockwell.com|date=January 15, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-18[/tpl] 

===Radical departure===

According to Buchanan and others, the Bush Doctrine was a radical departure from former United States foreign policies, and a continuation of the radical ideological roots of neoconservatism.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.25086/pub_detail.asp |title=Operation Comeback |first=Joshua |last=Muravchik |authorlink=Joshua Muravchik |journal=Foreign Policy|date=November–December 2006|format=Republished by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) |accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=America Unlimited: The Radical Sources of the Bush Doctrine |url=http://www.worldpolicy.newschool.edu/wpi/journal/articles/wpj04-1/meyer.htm |first=Karl |last=Meyer |authorlink=Karl E.

Initially, support for the United States was high, but by the end of the Bush administration, after seven years of war, anti-Americanism was high and criticism of the Bush Doctrine was widespread; nonetheless the doctrine still had support among some United States political leaders.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/jan/14/00006/ |title=Declaring Forever War, Giuliani has surrounded himself with advisers who think the Bush Doctrine didn't go nearly far enough |journal=The American Conservative |first=Michael C. |last=Desch |authorlink=| date=January 14, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl]
The representation of prominent neoconservatives and their influences on the Bush Doctrine had been highly controversial among the United States public.[tpl]cite news |title=The Neoconservative Convergence |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006921 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Charles |last=Krauthammer |authorlink=Charles Krauthammer |date=July 21, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Can the Neocons Get Their Groove Back? |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/17/AR2006111701474_pf.html |first=Joshua |last=Muravchik |authorlink=Joshua Muravchik |work=Washington Post |date=November 19, 2006|accessdate=2008-09-16[/tpl]
Critics, like John Micklethwait in the book The Right Nation, claim that Bush was deceived by neoconservatives into adopting their policies.[tpl]cite book |title=You’re Not Stupid!

===Polarization===

Anti-war critics have claimed that the Bush Doctrine was strongly polarizing domestically, had estranged allies of the United States,[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/kwiatkowski/kwiatkowski170.html |title=Making Sense of the Bush Doctrine |first=Karen |last=Kwiatkowski |authorlink=Karen Kwiatkowski |date=January 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-18[/tpl] and belied Bush's stated desire to be a "uniter, not a divider".[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/02/bush_insists_us_is_stronger_si.html |title=Bush Insists U.S. Is Stronger Since He Took Office |journal=Roll Call |first=Mort |last=Kondracke |authorlink=Mort Kondracke |date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-08-18[/tpl]

===Compassionate belief and religious influence===

Bush often talked about his belief in compassionate conservatism[tpl]cite book |title=George W. Bush : Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative |first=Arthur Frederick |last=Ide |authorlink=|publisher=Monument Press |date=November 1, 2000 |isbn=978-0-930383-50-3 |oclc=44803063[/tpl] and liberty as "God's gift". In his Claremont Institute article Democracy and the Bush Doctrine,[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1218/article_detail.asp |title=Democracy and the Bush Doctrine |first=Charles R. |last=Kesler |authorlink=Charles R. Kesler |publisher=Claremont Institute |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2008-09-15 [/tpl] Charles R. Kesler wrote, "As he begins his second term, the president and his advisors must take a hard, second look at the Bush Doctrine. In many respects, it is the export version of compassionate conservatism."

===Sociopsychological strategy and effects===

There is also criticism on the Bush Doctrine practices related to their sociopsychological effects saying they create a culture of fear.[tpl]cite book |title=Invitation to Terror: The Expanding Empire of the Unknown |first=Frank |last=Furedi |authorlink=Frank Furedi |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=October 30, 2007|isbn=978-0-8264-9957-8 |oclc=156830963[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Politics of Fear: Beyond Left and Right |first=Frank |last=Furedi |authorlink=Frank Furedi |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=October 6, 2005|isbn=978-0-8264-8728-5 |oclc=238727258[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism |first=Naomi |last=Klein |authorlink=Naomi Klein |date=June 24, 2008 |isbn=978-0-312-42799-3 |publisher=Picador |oclc=182737600[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url=http://nplusonemag.com/politics-fear-part-i-whatever-happened-war-terror |title=The Politics of Fear, Part 1 |first=Alex |last=Gourevitch |journal=n+1 |issue=6 |date=December 2, 2007|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl]
Author Naomi Klein wrote in her book The Shock Doctrine about a recurrent metaphor of shock, and claimed in an interview that the Bush administration has continued to exploit a "window of opportunity that opens up in a state of shock", followed by a comforting rationale for the public, as a form of social control.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSP37XQd0Zs |title=The Shock Doctrine: Naomi Klein on C-SPAN |date=October 8, 2007|publisher=C-SPAN |work=After Words |first=Naomi |last=Klein |authorlink=Naomi Klein |coauthors=Franklin Foer |accessdate=2008-09-15[/tpl]

===Democratization===

Some commentators argue that the Bush Doctrine has not aimed to support genuine democratic regimes driven by local peoples, but rather US-friendly regimes installed by diplomats acting on behalf of the United States, and intended only to seem democratic to U.S. voters.[tpl]cite book|last=Kolhatkar|first=S. |coauthors=J. Ingalls|year=2007 |title=Bleeding Afghanistan: Washington, warlords and the propaganda of silence|isbn=1-58322-731-8[/tpl] For example, in the case of Afghanistan, it is argued that parliamentary democracy was downplayed by the US and power concentrated in the hands of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, a U.S. ally.[tpl]harvnb|Kolhatkar & Ingalls|2007|chapter=Chapter 4: A Client "Democracy", pp. 117-166[/tpl] The election of Karzai has been described as the result of manipulation on the parts of the U.S. government and U.S. policy maker Zalmay Khalilzad. At the same time, these commentators draw attention to the number of unpopular (but U.S.-friendly) warlords achieving "legitimating" positions under U.S. supervision of the elections. Some commentators interpreted voter turnout figures as evidence of "large-scale fraud".[tpl]cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul |title=America's lost respect |work=New York Times |date=October 1, 2004[/tpl] Sonali Kolhatkar and James Ingalls have written, "It remains to be seen if U.S. policy makers will ever allow anything approaching democracy to break out in Afghanistan and interfere with their plans."[tpl]harvnb|Kolhatkar & Ingalls|2007|p=166[/tpl]
Of the elections in Afghanistan, Sima Samar, former Afghan Minister for Women's Affairs, stated, "This is not a democracy, it is a rubber stamp. Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2039665.stm |title=Tempers Flare At Loya Jirga |publisher=BBC News online |date=June 12, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2013[/tpl]
Most studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the history of the United States exporting democracy.  John A. Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using Freedom House data.[ref]
.[/ref] A plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy. In 69 instances the country became less democratic after the intervention. In the remaining 63 cases, a country became more democratic.
