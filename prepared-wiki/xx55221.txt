==Special service==

Muni operates 15 express lines, 6 Limited lines, and 12 Owl lines, which run between 1 am and 5 am. During sporting events, additional lines go to Candlestick Park.
Express lines only run during peak hours (with the sole exception of the 8X Bayshore Express); during mornings they run towards downtown (the Financial District) and during the evening they run away from downtown. All express lines have an "X", "AX", or "BX" following the line's number. Some lines are divided into A and B Expresses. The B Express line is shorter and has stops that are closer to downtown, while the A Express makes stops further away from downtown and will make few or no stops in the area where the B Express stops.
Limited lines also provide fast service along their routes. They make fewer stops than the standard line to achieve faster travel, but the stops are interspersed at greater intervals along the entire line. Express buses make frequent local stops near the origin and destination, but not in the middle. Limited buses take the same route as the regular line, while Express buses take a bypass route. All limited-stop lines have an "L" following the line's number.

==Statistics==

Muni operates about 1,000 vehicles: diesel, electric, and hybrid electric transit buses, light rail vehicles, streetcars, historic streetcars, and cable cars. Many buses are diesel-powered, but more than 300 are zero emissions trolleybuses powered by overhead electrical wires. The electricity to run all of Muni's trolleybuses and streetcars comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park.[ref]

In 2006, Muni purchased 86 hybrid electric transit buses from Orion Bus Industries that are diesel-fueled but feature lower emissions and 19% reduced fuel consumption.[ref]

All Muni lines except for cable cars are wheelchair accessible. All bus lines have bicycle racks, but streetcars and cable cars do not.
