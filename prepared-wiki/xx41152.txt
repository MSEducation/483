==Career==

===1985–1993: Early acting work===

Hawke obtained his mother's permission to attend his first casting call at age 14.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/oct/08/features.fiction|title=Another sunrise|last=Halpern|first=Dan|date=October 8, 2005|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 3, 2009 | location=London[/tpl] He secured his first film role in 1985's Explorers, in which he played an alien-obsessed schoolboy alongside River Phoenix.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E2DB1738F931A25754C0A963948260|title=The Screen: 'Explorers'|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=July 12, 1985|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] The film received favorable reviews[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/explorers/|title=Explorer Movie Reviews|date=July 12, 1985|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] but had poor box office revenues, a failure which Hawke has admitted caused him to quit acting for a brief period after the film's release. Hawke later described the disappointment as difficult to bear at such a young age, adding "I would never recommend that a kid act." His next film appearance was not until 1989's comedy drama Dad, where he played Ted Danson's son and Jack Lemmon's grandson.
In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance, playing a shy student opposite Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher in Dead Poets Society. The film was critically well-received;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dead-poets-society/|title=Dead Poets Society (1989): Reviews|date=June 2, 1989|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 13, 2010[/tpl] the Variety reviewer noted "Hawke ... gives a haunting performance."[tpl]cite news|url=http://variety.com/1988/film/reviews/dead-poets-society-1200428019/|title=Dead Poets Society Review|date=January 1, 1989|work=Variety|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] With revenue of $235 million worldwide, the film remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&id=ethanhawke.htm|title=Ethan Hawke Movie Box Office Results|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: "I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the film's success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else."
Hawke's next film, 1991's White Fang, brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of Jack London's novel of the same name, featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a Yukon gold hunter who befriends a wolfdog. According to The Oregonian, "Hawke does a good job as young Jack ... He makes Jack's passion for White Fang real and keeps it from being ridiculous or overly sentimental."[tpl]cite journal|first=Ted|last=Mahar|title='White Fang': A Boy, A Mine And A Dog|date=January 24, 1991|work=The Oregonian|page=C14[/tpl] Hawke then appeared in A Midnight Clear (1992), a well-received war film by Keith Gordon,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1039575-1039575-midnight_clear/ |title=A Midnight Clear – Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes[/tpl] and survival drama Alive (1993), a film adaptation of Piers Paul Read's 1974 book.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alive-1993 | title=Alive Review | work=Chicago Sun-Times |date= January 15, 1993 | first=Roger | last=Ebert  | accessdate=June 17, 2013[/tpl]

===1994–2000: Critical success===

Hawke's next role, in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994) as Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love interest (played by Winona Ryder), received critical praise. Film critic Roger Ebert called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: "Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/reality-bites-1994|title=Reality Bites|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 18, 1994|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] The New York Times noted, "Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html?pagewanted=all|title=Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething|last=James|first=Caryn|date=February 18, 1994|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 19, 2012[/tpl] Nonetheless, the film was a surprise box office disappointment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-04-03/entertainment/25862687_1_reality-bites-generation-x-movies-david-ansen|last=Rickey|first=Carrie|title=Generation X Turns Its Back|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|page=L01|date=April 3, 1994|accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl]
The following year Hawke again received critical acclaim, this time for his performance in Richard Linklater's 1995 drama Before Sunrise. The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/01/27/DD52018.DTL|title=An Extraordinary Day Dawns 'Before Sunrise'|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=January 27, 1995|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl] The San Francisco Chronicle praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: "they interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/01/27/WEEKEND15835.dtl|title=Modern "Roman Holiday' alive and well in Vienna|last=Shulgasser|first=Barbara|date=January 27, 1995|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=February 3, 2009[/tpl]
Apart from acting, Hawke directed the music video for the 1994 song "Stay (I Missed You)" by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/dec/19/comment|title=The best Ethan Hawke scene|date=December 19, 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=July 16, 2009 | location=London[/tpl] He also published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did." The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious ... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294593,00.html|title=The Hottest State — Book Review|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=October 18, 1996|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 5, 2009[/tpl] The New York Times thought Hawke did "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately "a sweet love story".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/books/love-hurts.html|title=Love Hurts|last=Nessel|first=Jen|date=November 3, 1996|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 24, 2011[/tpl]

Hawke's next film role was in Michael Almereyda's 2000 film Hamlet, in which he played the title character. The film transposed the famous William Shakespeare play to contemporary New York City, a technique Hawke felt made the play more "accessible and vital".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/a-renaissance-man-tackles-shakespeare-hamlet-s-ethan-hawke-mind-movie-stardom-article-1.869336|title=A Renaissance Man tackles Shakespeare 'Hamlet's' Ethan Hawke has more on his mind than movie stardom|last=Dominguez|first=Robert|date=May 11, 2000|work=Daily News (New York)|accessdate=April 10, 2012[/tpl] Salon reviewer wrote: "Hawke certainly isn't the greatest Hamlet of living memory ... but his performance reinforces Hamlet's place as Shakespeare's greatest character.

===2001–2006: Training Day===

Hawke's next role, and one for which he received substantial critical acclaim, came in Training Day (2001). Hawke played rookie cop Jake Hoyt, alongside Denzel Washington, as one of a pair of narcotics detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department spending 24 hours in the gang neighborhoods of South Los Angeles. The film was a box office hit, taking $104 million worldwide, and garnered generally favorable reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/training-day/|title=Training Day (2001): Reviews|date=October 5, 2001|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 13, 2010[/tpl] Variety wrote that "Hawke adds feisty and cunning flourishes to his role that allow him to respectably hold his own under formidable circumstances."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117798774?refcatid=31|title=Training Day Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=August 31, 2001|work=Variety|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Hawke's performance was "totally believable as a doe-eyed rookie going toe-to-toe with a legend Washington".[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/04/review.training.day/index.html|title=Review: 'Training Day' a course worth taking|last=Clinton|first=Paul|date=October 4, 2001|publisher=CNN|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Hawke himself described Training Day as his "best experience in Hollywood".
