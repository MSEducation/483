He was one of the architects of the amnesty program that ended the insurgency of the Communist Party of Thailand. Under his leadership, the army started projects for rural development. These included the Isan Khiew programme in the underdeveloped North Eastern region and the New Hope programme in the conflict-ridden Southern provinces. For these projects he provided big businesses with lucrative contracts, including the leading agrobusiness corporation Charoen Pokphand (CP). Chavalit began his political career in 1988 as Defence Minister, with the rank of Deputy Prime Minister, in the administration of Chatichai Choonhavan. He held that position until 1991. In 1990, he founded his own party, the New Aspiration Party. The party was backed by the CP group and its chairman Dhanin Chearavanont.[tpl]Citation |author1=Duncan McCargo |author2=Ukrist Pathamanand |title=The Thaksinization of Thailand |publisher=NIAS Press |year=2005 |page=33[/tpl] He then served as Minister of Interior in the cabinet of Chuan Leekpai from 1992 to 1994, and was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence in the government of Banharn Silpa-archa from 1995 to 1996.

==Premiership==

In late 1996, following the Royal Decree of Parliament Closure a general election was held. On November 16, 1996, Chavalit's New Aspiration Party won the most seats. With the support of five coalition parties - Chart Pattana, Social Action, Thai Citizen, Seri Dhamma and Mass Citizen - Chavalit was appointed by royal decree as the 22nd Prime Minister on November 25, 1996. However, he encountered pressure from many political movements, who finally forced him to resign on November 6, 1997, in the midst to the Asian financial crisis.
On 14 May and 15 May 1997, the Thai baht, which was then pegged to the U.S. dollar, was hit by massive speculative attacks. Prime Minister Chavalit announced he would not devalue the baht, but eventually Chavalit's government could not help but had to devalue the currency's value in July 1997. This sparked the Asian financial crisis, since the Thai government failed to defend the baht against the international speculators. 
Thailand's booming economy came to a halt amidst massive layoffs in finance, real estate, and construction that resulted in huge numbers of workers returning to their villages in the countryside and 600,000 foreign workers being sent back to their home countries.The baht devalued swiftly and lost more than half of its value. The Thai stock market dropped 75% in 1997. Due to the crisis, in November this year, the premier eventually stepped down.
During the early 1990s, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh controlled 126 military-run radio stations and two of the country's five television networks. Chavalit agreed to make military stations available for an anti-AIDS campaign. He also agreed to help Meechai Viravaidya spearhead a three-year blitz to halt the spread of the disease.
