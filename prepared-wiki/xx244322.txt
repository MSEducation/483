The Monaco Marathon or the Monaco and the Riviera Marathon (French: Marathon de Monaco et des Riviera) is a marathon run every year starting and finishing in Monaco. It crosses the border to France and Italy and goes along the coast to a turning point in Ventimiglia, Italy and back again to Monaco. There is also a 10 km race run entirely inside Monaco.
The marathon is run in March every year. In 2009 there were around 700 marathon participants, plus around 1000 participants in the 10 km race.
Due to the race's coincidence with French regional elections in 2010, the event was shortened to a half marathon, and Dennis Mehlfeld of Germany and American runner Heidi Freitag won the men's and women's races, respectively. The 10 km race continued as originally planned and a total of 1800 runners from 39 countries took part in the day's events that year.Merlino, Stephane (2010-03-21). 1800 take to the streets of Monaco for Half Marathon and 10Km.
