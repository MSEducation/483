The Chinatown neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois, is on the South Side (located in the Armour Square community area), centered on Cermak and Wentworth Avenues, and is an example of an American Chinatown, or ethnic-Chinese neighborhood. By the 2000 Census, Chicago Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas has 68,021 Chinese.  Chicago is the second oldest settlement of Chinese in America after the Chinese fled persecution in California.
Chinatown should not be confused with an area on the city's North Side sometimes referred to as "New Chinatown", which is centered around Argyle Street and is somewhat of a misnomer given that it is largely represented by people of Southeast Asian heritage.

==History==

Looking to escape the anti-Chinese violence that had broken out on the west coast, the first Chinese arrived in Chicago after 1869 when the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed.Ho 2005, p. 9. By the late 1800s, 25% of Chicago's approximately 600 Chinese residents settled along Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrison Avenues in Chicago's Loop.Kiang 2008 In 1889, 16 Chinese-owned businesses were located along the two-block stretch, including eight grocery stores, two butcher shops and a restaurant.[tpl]Cite journal |title=It happened here - Chicago's original Chinatown |date=April 29, 2010 |journal=Time Out Chicago |publisher=Time Out Chicago Partners |author=Malooley, Jake |issue=270 |page=6[/tpl] In 1912, the Chinese living in this area began moving south to Armour Square. Some historians say this was due to increasing rent prices.Solzman 2008 Others see more complex causes: discrimination, overcrowding, a high non-Chinese crime rate, and disagreements between the two associations ("tongs") within the community, the Hip Sing Tong and the On Leong Tong.Bronson, Chiu & Ho 2011, p. 9Moy 1995, p 382 The move to the new South Side Chinatown was led by the On Leong Merchants Association who, in 1912, had a building constructed along Cermak Avenue (then 22nd Street) that could house 15 stores, 30 apartments and the Association's headquarters. While the building's design was typical of the period, it also featured Chinese accents such as tile trim adorned with dragons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccamuseum.org/Places.html#anchor_33 |title=Earliest South Side Chinatown:  A Forgotten On Leong Building, ca. 1912 |date=July 14, 2005|publisher=Chinese-American Museum of Chicago |accessdate=October 7, 2009[/tpl]
In the 1920s, Chinese community leaders secured approximately 50 ten-year leases on properties in the newly developing Chinatown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F0E0E5495527971&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Still Standing - Living links to a rich history of commerce and culture|accessdate=August 10, 2009|date=January 6, 2002|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Leroux, Charles[/tpl] Because of severe racial discrimination, these leases needed to be secured via an intermediary, H. O. Stone Company. Jim Moy, then-director of the On Leong Merchants Association, then decided that a Chinese-style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community's new presence in the area.Ho 2005, p. 58. With no Chinese-born architects in Chicago at the time, Chicago-born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the new On Leong Merchants Association Building in spring, 1926.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.puitak.org/building.php |title=Our Building |publisher=Chinese Christian Union Church |accessdate=February 9, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Michaelsen and Rognstad's drew their final design after studying texts on Chinese architecture,.Bronson, Chiu & Ho 2011, p 32-3[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccamuseum.org/Places.html#anchor_10 |title=Pui Tak Building (formerly On Leong Building), 2216 S Wentworth Avenue |date=August 7, 2005|publisher=Chinese-American Museum of Chicago |accessdate=February 9, 2009[/tpl] When the building opened in 1928 at a cost of a million dollars, it was the finest large Chinese-style structure in any North American Chinatown.Bronson, Chiu & Ho 2011, p 32 The On Leong Association allowed the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association to put its headquarters in the new building and also used it as an immigrant assistance center, a school, a shrine, a meeting hall, and office space for the Association itself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB4227194CEDE69&p_docnum=9&p_queryname=25 |title=Chinese Church Gives Landmark A Rebuilt Image |publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=November 17, 1995 |author=Herrmann, Andrew |accessdate=February 9, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://egov.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/O/OnLeongMerchants.html |title=On Leong Merchants Association Building |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development |accessdate=February 9, 2009[/tpl] It was often informally referred to as Chinatown's "city hall."  In 1928, Michaelsen and Rognstad designed two other buildings in the area—Won Kow Restaurant, Chinatown's oldest restaurant,[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ADHB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10F7AD2902E21920&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Chinese Chicago Where to soak up Chinatown's culture during - the Year of the Dog|accessdate=December 16, 2009|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=Newsbank|work=Daily Herald|author=Zeldes, Leah A.[/tpl] and the Moy Shee D.K Association Building, the former receiving a two-story addition in 1932.Sinkevitch 2004, p. 372.
During the late 1980s, a group of Chinatown business leaders bought [tpl]convert|32|acre|m2[/tpl] property north of Archer Avenue from the Santa Fe Railway and built Chinatown Square, a two-level mall consisting of restaurants, beauty salons and law offices, flanked by 21 new townhouses. Additional residential construction, such as the Santa Fe Gardens, a 600-unit village of townhouses, condominiums and single-family homes still under construction on formerly industrial land to the north.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F0E0E5495527971&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Chinatown 's new reach expands its old borders |accessdate=August 11, 2009|date=July 18, 2004|publisher=Newsbank|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Olivo, Antonio|author2=Avila, Oscar[/tpl]  Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new addition was the creation of Ping Tom Memorial Park in 1999; located on the bank of the Chicago River, the park features a Chinese-style pavilion that many consider to be the most beautiful in the Midwest.Bronson, Chiu & Ho 2011, p 51
