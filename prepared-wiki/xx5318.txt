[[Just another Perl hacker]]

CATEGORIES: Perl, English phrases

Just another Perl hacker, or JAPH, typically refers to a Perl program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is canonical but is occasionally omitted).  Short JAPH programs are often used as signatures in online forums, or as T-shirt designs.  The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without code) for a signature.
JAPH programs are classically done using extremely obfuscated methods, in the spirit of the Obfuscated C Contest.  More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation).
The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature as a signature was originated by Randal L. Schwartz, in his postings to the newsgroup comp.lang.perl.Randal L. Schwartz in Usenet message M1HFPVH2JQ.FSF@HALFDOME.HOLDIT.COM explaining the origin of JAPH. Available through  Google.com (In fact, many of the JAPHs below are his.)
