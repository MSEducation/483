Ted Kirkpatrick (born 1960) is an American heavy metal drummer best known for his work with the American Christian metal band Tourniquet.

==Biography==

A founding member of the band Tourniquet - drummer, songwriter and lyricist Ted Kirkpatrick’s aggressive, musical, and often unorthodox approach to drumming has been recognized by thousands - critics and fans alike. A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Ted began playing drums at age 12. By age 14, Ted was playing drums along with the records of many of his early influences, bands like Rush, King Crimson, and ELP. He holds a business degree from the University of Texas, Austin, where he graduated with honors, and often finds himself using the skills learned in college in the many facets of successfully operating the band.
Entirely self-taught, Ted began to develop his own unique drumming style through a variety of influences. He is a great admirer of the classical masters and has attended countless classical concerts, and  his drumming and songwriting are influenced by the power of Beethoven and Mahler  symphonies, the staccato bursts of Scarlatti's harpsichord sonatas, and the counterpoint of Bach's fugues, to name a few. His latest solo release (2010) IN THE SHADOW OF THE MASTERS features Ted drumming to classics by Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Chopin, Paganini and others. "To me, the fantastic music of the classical masters is in a totally different realm - there simply is no other music to compare it to. I believe it was a time in history that will never be repeated - kind of like when dinosaurs roamed the earth. In drumming to these timeless works as with any music, I always strive to treat the drums as a musical instrument - not just a noisy time keeper."
Ted is well known for his ability to create and execute poly-rhythms within the framework of songs, for his advanced double bass technique, and most of all for bringing a musicality to his drumming which is always apparent in Tourniquet songs. His approach to the drums as a musical instrument makes even more sense in light of his role as Tourniquet's primary songwriter. He has written both music and lyrics for fifteen of Tourniquet's No.1 singles, in addition to many other songs that showcase the technical, melodic, and eccentric side of the band evident on all 11 Tourniquet albums and his 2 self recorded and produced solo albums.
The readers of HM Magazine voted Ted "Favorite Drummer" 10 years in a row. He has been featured twice in Modern Drummer Magazine, and countless drummers list him as one of their drumming influences. Ted officially endorses DW drums, Paiste cymbals, Vic Firth sticks, and Evans drumheads.

==Animal Welfare==

In 2010, he released a solo album, "Ode to a Roadkill", featuring animal sounds as lead "vocals".  His love for butterflies and other insects have influenced his and Tourniquet's album covers, and he says that the fantastic, repetitive sounds of the jungle have influenced his drumming as well.Modern Drummer - August 2000 - pg 29, 86, 123 - Fueled by a Higher Power

==Influences==

As principle lyricist for the band, Ted’s talent for allegory and symbolism, and using unusual and sometimes bizarre examples to convey God’s Word can be found throughout the Tourniquet catalog.
A fan of ethnic and world music, Ted has played or included other, less traditional (in terms of metal music) instruments on Tourniquet albums, including the Greek bouzouki, flute, banjo, and dulcimer. For the acoustic sets that Tourniquet occasionally performs, he plays 6 or 12 string guitar.
