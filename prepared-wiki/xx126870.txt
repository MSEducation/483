"Make Me Wanna Scream" is the second and final single from American R&B singer Blu Cantrell's second studio album, Bittersweet (2003). The song features reggae artist Ian Lewis from the group Inner Circle. There are two versions of the song: the original version featuring Ian Lewis and the version with Cantrell alone.

==Music video==

The video for the song was directed by Hype Williams and shot in 2003. It features Cantrell walking through a city with her friends in the background and of her driving a Mercedes. In the video, she vandalizes her ex-boyfriend's car and spray-paints it, along with some of her girlfriends. The ex-boyfriend, who comes out of his house at the end of the video and notices the girls painting "pig" on his car, was believed to be Simon Webbe (from the English boy band Blue), but it was actually her then-boyfriend Tony De Nero.

==Chart performance==

Although failing to match the success of previous single "Breathe", "Make Me Wanna Scream" still managed to chart moderately in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, and Australia. It nonetheless reached number six in Romania.
