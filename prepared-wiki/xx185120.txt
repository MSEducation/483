The N. C. Wyeth House and Studio was a home of painter N. C. Wyeth in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania, United States.
After N. C. Wyeth died, Mrs. Wyeth lived in the house until 1973, then their daughter, Carolyn Wyeth, lived there and painted in the studio until her death in 1994, when the Brandywine River Museum took possession and began restoration.
The house and studio were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997.[tpl]Cite document|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: N. C.
