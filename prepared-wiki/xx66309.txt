The Boston Post was the most popular daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years before it folded in 1956.  The Post was founded in November 1831 by two prominent Boston businessmen, Charles G. Greene and William Beals.
By the 1930s, The Boston Post had grown to be one of the largest newspapers in the country, with a circulation of well over a million readers.
Throughout the 1940s, facing increasing competition from the Hearst-run papers in Boston and New York and from radio and television news, the paper began a decline from which it never recovered.
When it ceased publishing in October 1956, its daily circulation was 255,000 and Sunday circulation approximately 260,000.(4 October 1956). Boston Post Ceases Publication For 3rd Time in Last Three Months, Miami News (Associated Press story)

==Boston Post Cane Tradition==

In 1909, under the savvy ownership of Edwin A. Grozier, the Boston Post engaged in its most famous publicity stunt. The paper had several hundred ornate, gold-tipped canes made and contacted the selectmen in New England's largest towns. The Boston Post Canes were given to the selectmen and presented in a ceremony to the town's oldest living man."The Boston Post Cane" Information Center.  The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930.  Many towns in New England still carry on the Boston Post cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909.
