 [[Sri Sathya Sai Baba]], [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]], and [[Anandamayi Ma]] encouraged bhajans among followers.
Sathya Sai bhajans include devotional reverence to all religions including Hinduism, Islam and Christianity etc. Accompanied by traditional Indian musical instruments such as the harmonium and tabla, bhajans set to Indian classical music ragas are lead by trained singers and followed by the congregation.
Sathya Sai on bhajans- "Bhajans charge the atmosphere with divine adoration; that is why I insist on group singing."***Sathya Sai Speaks VI, Chap 50, 239 (old ed.)
