Capablanca won the London tournament of 1922 with 13 points from 15 games with no losses, ahead of Alexander Alekhine on 11½, Milan Vidmar (11), and Akiba Rubinstein (10½). During this event, Capablanca proposed the "London Rules" to regulate future World Championship negotiations: the first player to win six games would win the match; playing sessions would be limited to 5 hours; the time limit would be 40 moves in 2½ hours; the champion must defend his title within one year of receiving a challenge from a recognized master; the champion would decide the date of the match; the champion was not obliged to accept a challenge for a purse of less than US $10,000 (worth about $260,000 in 2006 termsUsing incomes for the conversion; if prices are used, the result is about $103,000.

Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubow, Géza Maróczy, Richard Réti, Rubinstein, Tartakower and Vidmar promptly signed them. Between 1921 and 1923 Alekhine, Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch all challenged Capablanca, but only Alekhine could raise the money, in 1927.[ref]

In 1922, Capablanca also gave a simultaneous exhibition in Cleveland against 103 opponents, the largest in history up to that time, winning 102 and drawing one – setting a record for the best winning percentage ever in a large simultaneous exhibition.[tpl]cite book | last=Damsky | first=Yakov | author-link= | year=2005 | title=The Batsford Book of Chess Records | page=253| publisher=Batsford | location=London | isbn=0-7134-8946-4[/tpl]
After beginning with four draws, followed by a loss, Capablanca placed second at the New York 1924 chess tournament with the score of 14/20 (+10 −1 =9), 1½ points behind Emanuel Lasker, and 2 ahead of third-placed Alekhine. Capablanca's defeat at the hands of Richard Réti in the fifth round was his first in serious competition in eight years. He made another bad start at the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, and could only fight back to third place, two points behind Bogoljubow and ½ point behind Emanuel Lasker. Capablanca won at Lake Hopatcong, 1926 with 6 points out of 8, ahead of Abraham Kupchik (5) and Maroczy (4½).
A group of Argentinian businessmen, backed by a guarantee from the president of Argentina, promised the funds for a World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine in 1927. Since Nimzowitsch had challenged before Alekhine, Capablanca gave Nimzowitsch until January 1, 1927 to deposit a forfeit in order to arrange a match. When this did not materialize, a Capablanca–Alekhine match was agreed, to begin in September 1927.
In the New York 1927 chess tournament, played from February 19 to March 23, 1927,[tpl]cite book|last=Reti|first=R.|title=New York 1927|editor=Tartakower, S., and Leach, C.|chapter=Introduction|url=http://labatechess.com/cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=133&products_id=237|accessdate=2009-06-02[/tpl] six of the world's strongest masters played a quadruple round-robin, with the others being Alekhine, Rudolf Spielmann, Milan Vidmar, Nimzowitsch and Marshall, with Bogoljubow and Emanuel Lasker not present. Before the tournament, Capablanca wrote that he had "more experience but less power" than in 1911, that he had peaked in 1919 and that some of his competitors had become stronger in the meantime; however, he finished undefeated, winning the mini-matches with each of his rivals, 2½ points ahead of second-place Alekhine, and won the "best game" prize for a win over Spielmann.
In December 1921, shortly after becoming World Champion, Capablanca married Gloria Simoni Betancourt. They had a son, José Raúl Jr., in 1923 and a daughter, Gloria, in 1925.[tpl]cite book|last=Winter |first=E.G.|title=Capablanca: A Compendium ...|publisher=McFarland|year=1990|chapter=5: Champion|isbn=0-89950-455-8[/tpl] According to Capablanca's second wife, Olga, his first marriage broke down fairly soon, and he and Gloria had affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablancaolga.html|title=The Genius and the Princess|last=Winter|first=E.G.|accessdate=2009-06-02[/tpl] Both his parents died during his reign, his father in 1923 and mother in 1926.

===Losing the title===

Since Capablanca had won the New York 1927 chess tournament overwhelmingly and had never lost a game to Alekhine, the Cuban was regarded by most pundits as the clear favorite in their World Chess Championship 1927 match. However, Alekhine won the match, played from September to November 1927 at Buenos Aires, by 6 wins, 3 losses, and 25 draws – the longest formal World Championship match until the contest in 1984–85 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.[tpl]cite journal|last=Byrne|first=R.|date=December 21, 1984|title=Chess title match to become longest one in modern era|journal=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/21/nyregion/chess-title-match-to-become-longest-one-in-modern-era.html|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] Alekhine's victory surprised almost the entire chess world. After Capablanca's death, Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory, since in 1927 he had not thought he was superior to Capablanca, and he suggested that Capablanca had been overconfident.Alekhine, A., tribute to Capablanca, pp. 157–158, in: Alekhine, A., 107 Great Chess Battles, tr. E.G. Winter, Oxford University Press, 1980. Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation, while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition, and had thoroughly studied Capablanca's play. According to Kasparov, Alekhine's research uncovered many small inaccuracies, which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles209.pdf|title=Interview with Garry Kasparov: Part 2|last=Kasparov|first=G.|coauthors=Russell, H.W.|date=July 28, 2003|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] Vladimir Kramnik commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins. Luděk Pachman suggested that Capablanca, who was unaccustomed to losing games or to any other type of setback, became depressed over his unnecessary loss of the eleventh game, a long, gruelling endgame, featuring errors by both players.[tpl]cite book|last=Pachman|first=L.|title=Decisive Games in Chess History|publisher=Courier Dover|year=1987|pages=86–90|chapter=World Championship 1927: Why Did Alekhin Win?|isbn=0-486-25323-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jlgJTCyonAgC&pg=PA1&dq=capablanca|accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl][ref]Alekhine described the game as a "comedy of errors", and included it in his "Best Games" collection only because it was "the crucial point of the match": 
[/ref]
Immediately after winning the match, Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match, on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion – the challenger must provide a stake of US $10,000, of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated.[ref]
 Regarding a possible "two-game lead" clause, Winter cites Capablanca's messages to Julius Finn and Norbert Lederer, dated 15 October 1927, in which he proposed that, if the Buenos Aires match were drawn, the second match could be limited to 20 games. Winter cites La Prensa 30 November 1927 for Alekhine's conditions for a return match.[/ref] Alekhine had challenged Capablanca in the early 1920s but Alekhine could not raise the money until 1927. After Capablanca's death, Alekhine wrote that Capablanca's demand for a $10,000 stake was an attempt to avoid challenges. Negotiations dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Their relationship became bitter, and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played.[tpl]cite book|last=Fine|first=R.|title=Lessons from My Games: A Passion for Chess|publisher=Dover|date=1958, reprinted 1983|pages=80|isbn=0-486-24429-6[/tpl]

===Post-championship and partial retirement===

After losing the World Championship in late 1927, Capablanca played more often in tournaments, hoping to strengthen his claim for a rematch. From 1928 through 1931, he won six first prizes, also finishing second twice and one joint second. His competitors included rising stars such as Max Euwe and Isaac Kashdan, as well as players who had been established in the 1920s, but Capablanca and Alekhine never played in the same tournament during this period, and would next meet only at the Nottingham, 1936 tournament, after Alekhine had lost the world title to Euwe the preceding year. In late 1931, Capablanca also won a match (+2 −0 =8) against Euwe, whom Chessmetrics ranks sixth in the world at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S035520000000131000000000000010100|title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Max Euwe |last=Sona|first=J.|publisher=Chessmetrics|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl]
Despite these excellent results, Capablanca's play showed signs of decline: his play slowed from the speed of his youth, with occasional time trouble; although he continued to produce many superb games, he also made some gross blunders. Chessmetrics nonetheless ranks Capablanca as the second strongest player in the world (after Alekhine) from his loss of the title through to autumn 1932, except for a brief appearance in the top place.
After winning an event at New York in 1931, he withdrew from serious chess, perhaps disheartened by his inability to secure a return match against Alekhine, and played only less serious games at the Manhattan Chess Club and simultaneous displays. On 6 December 1933, Capablanca won all 9 of his games in one of the club's weekly rapid chess tournaments, finishing 2 points ahead of Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine and Milton Hanauer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter30.html#4817._Capablancas_clean_sweep|title=Capablanca's clean sweep|last=Winter|first=E.G.|accessdate=2009-06-03[/tpl] Based on reports in: American Chess Bulletin, January 1934, page 15; The New York Times, 7 December 1933, page 31.
It is from this period that the only surviving voiced film footage survives. He is with Max Euwe and Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander. Hollander asks Capablanca for his views on the upcoming world Championship match between Euwe and Alekhine in October of that year (1935). Capablanca replies: "Dr. Alekhine's game is 20% bluff. Dr. Euwe's game is clear and straightforward. Dr. Euwe's game—not so strong as Alekhine's in some respects—is more evenly balanced." Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch, explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism, but in the previous ten years, their score had been evenly matched at 7–7.Han interviews Dutchman Max Euwe and Capablanca, Dutch Public Broadcasting archives, 18 May 2012

===Return to competitive chess===

At first Capablanca did not divorce his first wife, as he had not intended to re-marry. Olga, Capablanca's second wife, wrote that she met him in the late spring of 1934; by late October the pair were deeply in love, and Capablanca recovered his ambition to prove he was the world's best player. In 1938 he divorced his first wife and then married Olga on October 20, 1938, about a month before the AVRO tournament.
Starting his comeback at the Hastings tournament of 1934–35, Capablanca finished fourth, although coming ahead of Mikhail Botvinnik and Andor Lilienthal. He placed second by ½ point in the Margate tournaments of 1935 and 1936. At Moscow 1935 Capablanca finished fourth, 1 point behind the joint winners, while Emanuel Lasker's third place at the age of 66 was hailed as "a biological miracle."[ref]
