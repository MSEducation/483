Son Records was set up in 1998 by Alastair Nicholson (formerly of Ninja Tune), to provide an outlet for hip-hop coming out the UK, whether by established names or more often than not, up and coming talent. With over 40 releases to date, Son has put out debut releases from some of the best and brightest hip-hop artists in the country, including C-Mone, Cappo, DPF, the Pitman, Styly Cee and Wordsmith, along with releases from musical dons like Def Tex, HKB Finn and Mad Doctor X.
