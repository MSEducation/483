[[Cleats (comic strip)]]

CATEGORIES: American comic strips

Cleats is a comic strip by Bill Hinds. Cleats features a group of young kids, coaches, and their parents as they deal with the day-to-day trials and tribulations of being on a soccer team (Although there are storylines that have the kids engaged in physical sports other than soccer). Cleats was carried in over 75 newspapers[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/products/?isbn=0740741381| author=Andrew McMeel Publishing| title=Cleats Information Page |accessdate = 2007-09-12[/tpl]
The last iteration of Cleats had been run on 31 October 2010, in the form of a special Halloween 'exit' strip.  Bill Hinds stated that he had ceased producing Cleats because the strip "had suffered in many newspaper comic polls over the past nine years."
In many newspapers, editors have chosen to run the earliest Cleats strips again, allowing readers to compare Hinds' initial style and characters against their more recent development.  This has resulted in previous Sunday strips appearing on weekdays, but has opened to broad examination the processes by which a professional cartoonist evolves his work over years of production.
