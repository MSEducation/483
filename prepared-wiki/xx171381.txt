However, the ascension of the Dutch Prince William to the English throne, after overthrowing the [[Catholic]] [[Stuart dynasty]], in the [[Glorious Revolution]] caused a dramatic shift in commercial, military, and political power from Amsterdam to London.<ref>

This shift combined with constant wars against a variety of foes and economic recession pushed the Netherlands out of the top tier of European powers by the end of the War of Spanish Succession.

===England===

England's climb to the pre-eminent sea power of the world began in 1588 as the attempted invasion of the Spanish Armada was defeated by the combination of outstanding naval tactics by the English under command of Sir Francis Drake and the breaking of the bad weather.  The strengthened English Navy waged several wars with their neighbors across the North Sea and by the end of the 17th century had erased the Dutch's previously world-spanning empire.[ref]

The building of the British Empire as a domain on which the sun never set was possible only because the British navy exercised unquestioned control over the seas around Europe, including the North Sea.  In the late 18th century, Britain's naval supremacy faced a new challenge from Napoleonic France and her continental allies.  In 1800, a union of lesser naval powers, called the League of Armed Neutrality, was formed to protect neutral trade during Britain's conflict with France.  The British Navy defeated the combined forces of the League in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 in the Kattegat.[ref]
