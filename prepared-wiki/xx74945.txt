Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian ([tpl]convert|5199|m|ft|0[/tpl]), Nelion ([tpl]convert|5188|m|ft|0[/tpl]) and Point Lenana ([tpl]convert|4985|m|ft|0[/tpl]). Mount Kenya is located in central Kenya, just south of the equator, around [tpl]convert|150|km|mi|0[/tpl] north-northeast of the capital Nairobi.  Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.
Mount Kenya is a stratovolcano created approximately 3 million years after the opening of the East African rift.
Before glaciation, it was [tpl]convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high. It was covered by an ice cap for thousands of years. This has resulted in very eroded slopes and numerous valleys radiating from the centre. There are currently 11 small glaciers. The forested slopes are an important source of water for much of Kenya.
There are several vegetation bands from the base to the summit. The lower slopes are covered by different types of forest. Many alpine species are endemic to Mount Kenya, such as the giant lobelias and senecios and a local subspecies of rock hyrax. An area of [tpl]convert|715|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] around the centre of the mountain was designated a National Park
and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The park receives over 16,000 visitors per year.

==Mount Kenya National Park==

Mount Kenya National Park, established in 1949, protects the region surrounding the mountain. Currently the national park is within the forest reserve which encircles it. In April 1978 the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The national park and the forest reserve, combined, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.
The Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies,preserve an area of great scenic beauty, conserve the biodiversity within the park and to preserve the water catchment for the surrounding area.
Kenya’s government has announced a project to discourage animals from straying into small holdings surrounding the Park and devastating crops. The project will see the Park enclosed by an electric fence with five electrified strands and is expected to be completed by 2014. The fence will discharge an electric shock, but is not dangerous to humans or animals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19517183 |title=Mt Kenya to get electric fence to stop wildlife straying|publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl]

==Local culture==

The main ethnic groups living around Mount Kenya are Kĩkũyũ, Ameru, Embu and Maasai. The first three are closely related. They all see the mountain as an important aspect of their cultures. All these cultures arrived in the Mount Kenya area in the last several hundred years.

===Gĩkũyũ (also called Kikuyu)===

The Gĩkũyũ live on the southern and western sides of the mountain. They are agriculturalists, and make use of the highly fertile volcanic soil on the lower slopes. The Gĩkũyũ people believe that God, Ngai or Mwene Nyaga, lived on Mount Kenya when he came down from the sky. They believe that the mountain is Ngai's throne on earth. It is the place where Gĩkũyũ, the father of the tribe, used to meet with God. Thus according to the Kikuyu records, Gĩkũyũ is the first person on Earth to ascend the mountain. 'Mwene Nyaga' in Gikuyu language can also translate as the "Owner of Snow" where 'Mwene' translates to 'owner', and 'Nyaga' to snow.'Nyaga' can also translate to 'Ostrich'.
Kikuyus used to build their houses with the doors facing the mountain.  The Gĩkũyũ name for Mount Kenya is Kĩrĩ Nyaga (Kirinyaga), which literally translates to 'God's Resting Place' or 'Where God Lives' in this case referring to Mwene Nyaga.

===Embu===

The Embu people live to the south-east of Mount Kenya, and believe that the mountain is God's home (Meru word for God is Ngai or Mwene Njeru). The mountain is sacred, and they build their houses with the doors facing towards it.  The Embu people are closely related to the Ameru and Mbeere people. The Mbeere and Akamba are the settlers of the southeast side of the Mountain.

===Ameru===

The Ameru occupy the east and north slopes of the mountain. They are generally agricultural and also keep livestock and occupy what is among the most fertile land in Kenya. The Meru God Murungu was from the skies. Their name for Mt. Kenya is Kirimara which means 'mountain with white features'. Mt. Kenya features a lot in the Ameru folklore and songs.
