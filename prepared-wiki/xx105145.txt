The Jolly Farmer is a roundabout on the A30 (London Road) between Camberley and Bagshot in Surrey, UK.
Origins of the Jolly Farmer name date to the late 17th century when there was a highwayman called William Davies who worked on Bagshot Heath and allegedly only took gold from his victims. His identity was discovered since he was a local farmer who only paid his taxes in gold. A picture of him was painted and hung in the Golden Farmer pub along the London Road. One day however it was remarked that the golden farmer looked more jolly than golden, so the pub changed its name and was henceforth known as the Jolly Farmer.
Davies is said to have been hung at the adjacent hill now called Gibbet Lane.
The Jolly Farmer roundabout used to be home to a pub called the Jolly Farmer, which subsequently changed ownership and was re-branded as the Mongolian Barbecue. This has now ceased trading, and fast-food restaurant chain Burger King made a bid to buy the roundabout.  Following a safety campaign, the council rejected this offer. Today, the Jolly Farmer roundabout contains the "American Discount Golf Store".
