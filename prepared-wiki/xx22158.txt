In some cultures snakes were fertility symbols, for example the Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew fertility of Nature. During the dance, live snakes were handled and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. "The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops.."[tpl]cite book|last=Monsen|first=Frederick|title=Festivals of the Hopi, and dancing and expression in all their national ceremonies|url=http://www.adwr.state.az.us/Adjudications/documents/HopiContestedCaseDisclosures/Hopi%20Initial%20Disclosure/HP1535%20-%20HP1549.pdf[/tpl] In other cultures snakes symbolized the umbilical cord, joining all humans to Mother Earth. The Great Goddess often had snakes as her familiars - sometimes twining around her sacred staff, as in ancient Crete - and they were worshiped as guardians of her mysteries of birth and regeneration.[tpl]cite book|last=Hilda Roderick|first=Ellis Davidson|title=Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions|year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=U.K.|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&lr=&id=R-rIAAAAIAAJ[/tpl]

==Symbolic values frequently assigned to serpents==

===Fertility and rebirth===

As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Sa-Sp/Serpents-and-Snakes.html |title=Myths Encyclopedia Serpents and Snakes |publisher=Mythencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-07[/tpl] The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life.

===Guardianship===

Serpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may be grounded in the observation that when threatened, some snakes (such as rattlesnakes or cobras) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm's way.
At Angkor in Cambodia, numerous stone sculptures present hooded multi-headed nƒÅgas as guardians of temples or other premises. A favorite motif of Angkorean sculptors from approximately the 12th century CE onward was that of the Buddha, sitting in the position of meditation, his weight supported by the coils of a multi-headed naga that also uses its flared hood to shield him from above.  This motif recalls the story of the Buddha and the serpent king Mucalinda: as the Buddha sat beneath a tree engrossed in meditation, Mucalinda came up from the roots of the tree to shield the Buddha from a tempest that was just beginning to arise.
The Gadsden flag of the American Revolution depicts a rattlesnake coiled up and poised to strike.  Below the image of the snake is the legend, "Don't tread on me."  The snake symbolized the dangerousness of colonists willing to fight for their rights and homeland. The motif is repeated in the First Navy Jack of the US Navy.

===Poison and medicine===

Serpents are connected with poison and medicine. The snake's venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi[ref]
