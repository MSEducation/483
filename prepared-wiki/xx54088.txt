[[Tony Award for Best Revival]]

CATEGORIES: Tony Awards, Awards established in 1977, 1977 establishments in New York, Awards disestablished in 1993, 1993 disestablishments in the United States, 1994 disestablishments in New York

The Tony Award for Best Revival was presented from 1977 until 1994, when it was split into the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. If there are not enough revivals, it is possible under the current Tony rules for the "Best Revival of a Play or Musical" award to return. Any time there are three play revivals and three musical revivals, the categories are automatically separated; if there are fewer, the Tony Awards Administration Committee may still choose to split up the categories.
The award was given to the best play, musical or non-musical, which had already appeared on Broadway in a previous production.
