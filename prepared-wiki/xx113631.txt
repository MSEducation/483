Abhas Mitra
(born June 3, 1955) is an Indian astrophysicist best known for his distinct views on
several front-line astrophysics concepts, particularly black holes. He presently heads the theoretical astrophysics section of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India.[tpl]cite web|title=Abhas Mitra Curriculum Vitae (BARC India)|url=http://barc-in.academia.edu/AbhasMitra/CurriculumVitae[/tpl]
Mitra’s research papers have regularly questioned the mainstream cosmological concepts of "Big Bang"  and "Black Hole",A.

==Prominent Scientific Work==

===Eternally Collapsing Objects===

Though Mitra stresses that the `Black Hole’’ solutions are correct, his contention is that Black Hole masses, arising from relevant
integration constants, are actually zero. His peer reviewed paper published in Journal of Mathematical Physics of the American Institute of Physics supports this contention by showing that Schwarzschild black holes have M = 0.A. Mitra, J. Math. Phys. 50, 042502 (2009) (American Institute of Physics)[tpl]cite web |title=Comments on The Euclidean gravitational action as black hole entropy, singularities, and space-time voids''|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jmp/50/4/10.1063/1.3118910[/tpl]  If so, (i) The so-called massive Black Hole Candidates (BHCs) must be quasi-black holes rather than exact black holes and (ii) During preceding gravitational collapse, entire mass energy and angular momentum of the collapsing objects must be radiated away before formation of exact mathematical black holes. And since the formation of a mathematical zero mass black hole requires infinite proper time, continued gravitational collapse becomes eternal, and the so-called black hole candidates must be Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO).A.

Mitra’s peer reviewed papers describe why continued physical gravitational collapse should lead to formation of ECOs rather than true black holes, and the mathematical ``black hole’’ states can be achieved only asymptotically.A.

The corresponding Harvard University Press Release[tpl]cite web|title=New Picture of Quasar Emerges: Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Press Release|url=http://www.cv.nrao.edu/tuna/past/2006/NEW_QSO_STRUCTURE_FOUND.pdf[/tpl] acknowledges Mitra's original contribution in this context, and this is rare for any astrophysics research which is completely rooted in India rather than abroad.

===Against the Big Bang Paradigm===

As per the present version of Big Bang Paradigm, almost 70% of the mass energy of the universe is due to ``Dark Energy’’ whose most
likely form is Einstein’s Cosmological Constant. But Mitra’s research has shown that Cosmological Constant is exactly zero as suspected by many.[ref]A. Mitra, General Relativity and Gravitation

Mitra, S. Bhattacharyya, and N. Bhatt, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 22, 1350012 (2013)(World Scientific) [tpl]cite web|title=ΛCDM Cosmology Through the Lens of Einstein's Static Universe, the Mother of Λ|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218271813500120[/tpl]</ref><ref>A. Mitra, J. Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, 07, 007 (2013) (Institute of Physics, UK) [tpl]cite web|title=Energy of Einstein's static universe and its implications for the ΛCDM cosmology|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1475-7516/2013/03/007/[/tpl]</ref> 
In addition, these papers point out that as per cosmological observations, the actual universe is far more complex than the idealized perfect ``isotropy
and homogeneity’’ assumed by the Big Bang model; and ``Dark Energy’’ is an illusion caused by such departures.

===X-ray Binaries===

Mitra is the first astrophysicist to suggest that photo-meson process rather than proton-proton collision process could be the leading mechanism for Ultra High Energy gamma-ray production in ultra-compact X-ray binaries.A.
