==History==

===Establishment===

After the Australia women's national football team qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China for the first time, head coach Tom Sermanni felt the establishment of a professional league was vital for continuing the development of players.[tpl]cite web|last=Grainey|first=Tim|title=Grainey: A closer look at the Westfield W-League|url=http://equalizersoccer.com/2013/11/26/australia-westfield-w-league-heats-up/|publisher=Equalizer Soccer|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=26 November 2013[/tpl]  The Football Federation Australia established the league the following year. The W-League was initially composed of eight teams: Adelaide United, Brisbane Roar, Central Coast Mariners, Melbourne Victory, Newcastle Jets, Perth Glory, and Sydney FC. Seven of the eight teams were affiliated with the inaugural Australian A-League clubs, and shared their names and colours to promote their brands. The eighth club was the Canberra-based Canberra United.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,24089401-23215,00.html|title=W-League to debut in October|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=Fox Sports[/tpl]
The Central Coast Mariners were forced to withdraw from the 2010–11 season due to a lack of funding and have yet to return.

===Inaugural season, 2008===

The W-League's inaugural season commenced on 25 October 2008, with Perth Glory hosting Sydney FC at Members Equity Stadium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/81307,girls-shop-to-the-top.aspx|title=Girls shop to the top|publisher=FourFourTwo (Australia)|date=28 July 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008[/tpl] After ten rounds, Queensland Roar were the top-placed team, becoming the first W-League premiers, and advancing to the semi-finals along with the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams. They faced Canberra United in the W-League Grand Final 2009, defeating them 2–0 to take the champions trophy.
One game per week (the 3:00 pm Saturday game) was broadcast live nationwide on ABC1."Brisbane Roar v Canberra United – Saturday, 3 October at 3pm on ABC1" The teams in the W-League have a salary cap of A$150,000 for the entire squad.
