[[Field-programmable analog array]]

CATEGORIES: Gate arrays, Analog circuits

A field-programmable analog array (FPAA) is an integrated device containing configurable analog blocks (CAB) and interconnects between these blocks.  Unlike their digital cousin, the FPGA, the devices tend to be more application driven than general purpose as they may be current mode or voltage mode devices.  For voltage mode devices, each block usually contains an operational amplifier in combination with programmable configuration of passive components.  The blocks can, for example, act as summers or integrators.
FPAAs usually operate in one of two modes: continuous time and discrete time.
