==Early life==

Lucas was born in La Grange, North Carolina, and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina."Frank Lucas, Between Issues" Metro Magazine, 8 November 2007. He claims that the incident that sparked his motivation to embark on a life of crime was witnessing his 12-year-old cousin's murder at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan, for apparently "reckless eyeballing" (looking at) a Caucasian woman, in Greensboro. He drifted through a life of petty crime until one particular occasion when, after a fight with a former employer, he fled to New York on the advice of his mother. In Harlem, he indulged in petty crime and pool hustling before he was taken under the wing of gangster Bumpy Johnson. Lucas' connection to Johnson has since come under some doubt; he claimed to have been Johnson's driver for 15 years, although Johnson spent just five years out of prison before his death in 1968. According to Johnson's widow, much of the narrative that Lucas claims as his actually belonged to another young hustler named Zach Walker, who lived with Johnson and his family and later betrayed him.[tpl]cite book | last = Mayme Hatcher Johnson| authorlink = Mayme Hatcher Johnson| title = Harlem Godfather: The Rap on my Husband, Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson|edition= when | publisher = Oshun Publishing Company, Inc.; First edition (February 29, 2008)| isbn= 0-9676028-3-1 |pages= 159, 221, 248[/tpl]

==Criminal career==

After Johnson's death, Lucas traveled around and came to the realization that, to be successful, he would have to break the monopoly that the Italian Mafia held in New York. Traveling to Bangkok, Thailand, he eventually made his way to Jack's American Star Bar, an R&R hangout for black soldiers. It was here that he met former U.S. Army sergeant Leslie "Ike" Atkinson, a country boy from Goldsboro, North Carolina, who happened to be married to one of Lucas' cousins.  Lucas is quoted as saying, "Ike knew everyone over there, every black guy in the Army, from the cooks on up."
When interviewed for a magazine article published in 2000, Lucas denied putting the drugs among the corpses of American soldiers. Instead he flew with a North Carolina carpenter to Bangkok and:
However, Atkinson, nicknamed "Sergeant Smack" by the Drug Enforcement Administration,Chepesiuk, Ron (January 17, 2008). "New Criminologist Special - Frank Lucas, 'American Gangster,' and the Truth Behind the Asian Connection". has said he shipped drugs in furniture, not caskets.  Whatever method he used, Lucas smuggled the drugs into the country with this direct link from Asia. Lucas said that he made US$1 million per day selling drugs on 116th Street though this was later discovered to be an exaggeration. Federal judge Sterling Johnson, who was special narcotics prosecutor in New York at the time of Lucas' crimes, called Lucas' operation "one of the most outrageous international dope-smuggling gangs ever, an innovator who got his own connections outside the U.S. and then sold the narcotics himself in the street." In an interview, Lucas said, "I wanted to be rich. I wanted to be Donald Trump rich, and so help me God, I made it."
Lucas only trusted relatives and close friends from North Carolina to handle his various heroin operations.  Lucas thought they were less likely to steal from him and be tempted by various vices in the big city. He stated his heroin, "Blue Magic", was 98-100% pure when shipped from Thailand.[tpl]cite web|last=Jacobson |first=Mark |url=http://nymag.com/guides/money/2007/39948/ |title=A Conversation Between Frank Lucas and Nicky Barnes - Money 2007 - New York Magazine |publisher=New York Magazine|date=2007-10-25 |accessdate=2011-07-02[/tpl] Lucas has been quoted as saying that his worth was "something like $52 million", most of it in Cayman Islands banks. Added to this is "maybe 1,000 keys (kilograms), (2,200 pounds), of dope on hand" with a potential profit of no less than $300,000 per kilo (per 2.2 lb).
This huge profit margin allowed him to buy property all over the country, including office buildings in Detroit, and apartments in Los Angeles and Miami. He also bought a several-thousand-acre ranch in North Carolina on which he ranged 300 head of Black Angus cattle, including a breeding bull worth $125,000.
Lucas rubbed shoulders with the elite of the entertainment, politics, and crime worlds, stating later that he had met Howard Hughes at one of Harlem's best clubs in his day. Though he owned several mink and chinchilla coats and other accessories, Lucas much preferred to dress casually and corporately so as not to attract attention to himself.[tpl]cite web |date=November 6, 2007|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1573648/20071106/story.jhtml|title = Real 'American Gangster' Frank Lucas Talks About Hanging With Diddy's Dad, Possible Sequel|publisher = MTV| accessdate=2008-02-24| last=Jayson Rodriguez |quote=[/tpl]   When he was arrested in the mid-1970s, all of Lucas' assets were seized.

==Arrests and releases==

In January 1975, Lucas' house in Teaneck, New Jersey, was raided by a task force consisting of 10 agents from Group 22 of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and 10 New York Police Department detectives attached to the Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB).[tpl]cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.crimemagazine.com/07/teaneck_raid,1014-7.htm|title = The Raid in Teaneck|publisher = pub| accessdate = 2008-02-24 | last=Ron Chepesiuk and Anthony Gonzalez |quote=|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220025415/http://www.crimemagazine.com/07/teaneck_raid,1014-7.htm |archivedate = February 20, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]  In his house authorities found $584,683 in cash.  He was later convicted of both federal and New Jersey state drug violations. The following year he was sentenced to 70 years in prison. Once convicted, Lucas provided evidence that led to more than 100 further drug-related convictions.  For his safety in 1977, Lucas and his family were placed in the witness protection program.Cruz, Alicia (May 24, 2010).

In 1981, after 5 years in custody, his 40-year Federal term and 30-year state term were reduced to time served plus lifetime parole.  In 1984, he was caught and convicted of trying to exchange one ounce of heroin and $13,000 for one kilogram of cocaine.  He was defended by his former prosecutor Richie Roberts and received a sentence of seven years. He was released from prison in 1991.

==Depictions in media==

Lucas' life was dramatized in the 2007 Universal Pictures crime film American Gangster, in which he was portrayed by Denzel Washington. The film grossed more than $US127 million,[tpl]Cite news|publisher =ABC News/Reuters|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/american-gangster-lawsuit-dismissed/1045622|title=American Gangster lawsuit dismissed|date= February 18, 2008[/tpl] and was met with generally positive reviews.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_gangster/ | title=American Gangster | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=November 12, 2007 [/tpl] In an interview with MSNBC, Lucas expressed his excitement about the film and amazement at Denzel Washington's portrayal,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/10/26/432807.aspx |title=Breakfast with the real 'American Gangster'|publisher=MSNBC|date= October 26, 2007 |author=Bradley Davis |work=Inside Dateline[/tpl] though he admitted to several news outlets that only a small portion of the film was true,[tpl]Cite web |title=GANGING UP ON MOVIE'S 'LIES'|work=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11042007/news/nationalnews/ganging_up_on_movies_lies_8968.htm |author=Susannah Cahalan |date=November 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2008[/tpl] and that much of it was fabricated for narrative effect. In addition, Richie Roberts criticized the film for portraying him in a custody battle while in real life he never had a child; he also criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as "almost noble".
Sterling Johnson, Jr., a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor and assisted the arrest and trial of Lucas, described the film as "one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood." In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as "illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not."[tpl]Cite news|author=Coyle, Jake|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/295102|title=Is 'American Gangster' really all that 'true'?|publisher=Toronto Star|date=January 17, 2008[/tpl] Former DEA agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal saying that the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film defamed them and hundreds of other agents.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&nav=F8nI|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080208093858/http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&nav=F8nI|archivedate=February 8, 2008|title=DEA agents sue over 'American Gangster' |publisher=WPRI[/tpl] The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the intertitle that appears at the end of the film was "wholly inaccurate", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that "It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to "show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent".
Many of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right hand man of Bumpy Johnson, rising above the power of the Mafia and Nicky Barnes, and that he was the mastermind behind the Golden Triangle heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story a myth. Associated Press entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted that "this mess happened partially because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events."

==Family==

Lucas married Julianna Farrait, a homecoming queen from Puerto Rico. The two often bought each other expensive gifts, including a coat for which she paid $125,000 and another $40,000 cash for a matching hat. Farrait was also jailed for her role in her husband's criminal enterprise, spending five years behind bars. After she came out of prison they lived separately for some years, and Farrait moved back to Puerto Rico. However, they reconciled in 2006, and have been married for more than 40 years.
Lucas fathered seven children, including a daughter, Francine Lucas-Sinclair, and a son, Frank Lucas, Jr.Davis, Bradley (October 26, 2007). "BREAKFAST WITH THE REAL 'AMERICAN GANGSTER'" MSNBC. Lucas-Sinclair entered the witness protection program with Lucas in 1977 and has since started up a webpage, Yellow Brick Road, containing resources for the children of imprisoned parents.
