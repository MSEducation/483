The Central Bank of Ireland ([tpl]lang-ga|Banc Ceannais na hÉireann[/tpl]) is the financial services regulator of Ireland and historically the central bank. The bank was the issuer of Irish pound banknotes and coinage until the introduction of the euro currency, and now provides this service for the European Central Bank.
The bank was founded in 1943 and since 1 January 1972 has been the banker of the Government of Ireland in accordance with the Central Bank Act 1971,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1971/en/act/pub/0024/index.html |title=Central Bank Act, 1971 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=28 July 1971 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] which can be seen in legislative terms as completing the long transition from a currency board to a fully functional central bank.Previously the commercial Bank of Ireland, established in 1783, had been the government's banker.
The bank's head office is located on Dame Street, Dublin, where the public may exchange non-current Irish coinage and currency (both pre- and post-decimalization) for euro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://two.archiseek.com/2010/1980-central-bank-of-ireland-dame-street-dublin/ |title=1980 – Central Bank of Ireland, Dame Street, Dublin |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=10 April 2010 |archiveurl = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100101000000/http%3A//two.archiseek.com/2010/1980-central-bank-of-ireland-dame-street-dublin/ |archivedate = 1 January 2010|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The Currency Centre at Sandyford is the currency manufacture, warehouse and distribution site of the bank.

==Functions and objectives==

The Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, created a new single unitary body – the Central Bank of Ireland –  responsible for both central banking and financial regulation. The new structure replaced the previous related entities, the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  The Acthttp://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2010/1210/b12b10d.pdf commenced on 1 October 2010.

==History==

On the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, the new state's trade was overwhelmingly with the United Kingdom (98% of Irish exports and 80% of imports in 1924), so the introduction of an independent currency was a low priority. British banknotes (British Treasury notes, Bank of England notes), and notes issued by Irish banks circulated (but only the first were legal tender) and coins remained in circulation.
Under the terms of the Coinage Act 1926, the Finance Minister was authorised to issue coins of silver, nickel, and bronze of the same denominations as the British coins already in circulation – however the Irish silver coins were to contain 75% silver as compared to the 50% silver coins issued by Britain at the time. These coins entered circulation on 12 December 1928.
Under the terms of the Currency Act 1927, a new unit of currency, the Saorstát Pound (Free State Pound) was created, which was to be maintained at parity with the British Pound Sterling by a Currency Commission which would keep British government securities, sterling cash, and gold to keep a 1–1 relationship.

===The Central Bank===

The Central Bank Act 1942 which came into effect on 1 February 1943 renamed the Currency Commission the Central Bank of Ireland, although the organisation did not at that time acquire many of the characteristics of a central bank:
This seriously limited the banks' ability to run an independent monetary policy.
In 1953 Governor Joseph Brennan resigned, following disagreement with the Government over opinions on
economic and financial policy published in the Bank’s recent Annual Reports. The mid-1960s saw the Bank take over the normal day-to-day operations of exchange control from the Department of Finance.  The Central Bank broadened its activities over the decades, but it remained in effect a currency board until the 1970s. In 1976 a liquidator was appointed to Irish Trust Bank Ltd and in 1982 Merchant Banking Ltd also collapsed. Staff over the years have gone on strike, the longest of which was in the winter of 1984/1985. The Bank assisted the Government in the administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc which failed in 1985 and threatened its parent Allied Irish Banks.http://www.centralbank.ie/data/site/abt_hist.pdf  [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.centralbank.ie/data/site/abt_hist.pdf|date =20110101000000[/tpl] It took over the policing of the Irish Stock Exchange on 1 November 2007, assuming day-to-day responsibility for detecting and investigating market abuse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2006/01/14/story239577.asp |title=Financial Regulator takes over monitoring of stock market|publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] In 2013 it outsourced its Information Technology function to Hewlett Packardhttp://www.irishexaminer.com/business/anger-over-central-bank-it-outsourcing-move-226870.html

===Decimalisation===

The 1970s was a decade of change, which began with the decimalisation of the currency which came into effect on 15 February 1971, when the decimal coinage was released into circulation (although 5p, 10p, and 50p coins were released a few years earlier, as they had exact equivalents in old currency units). Decimalisation would have provided an ideal opportunity to break the link with Sterling, but there was not much demand for this at that time. In 1972 however, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates broke down, and in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis inflation in Britain increased dramatically, and economic theory would suggest that a smaller economy whose currency is pegged to a larger one will suffer the larger economy's inflation rate. At the same time moves to create a money market in Dublin and the transfer in 1968 of the commercial banks' sterling assets to the Central Bank made it possible to contemplate a break in the link. In the mid to late 1970s, opinion within the bank was moving toward breaking the link with sterling and devaluing the Irish currency in order to limit inflationary effects from abroad.
At this time, however, an alternative option became available. In April 1978, the European Council meeting in Copenhagen decided to create a "zone of monetary stability" in Europe, and European Economic Community institutions were invited to consider how to create such a zone. At the following Council meeting in Bremen, Germany in June 1978 the basic features of the European Monetary System were outlined, including the creation of the ECU – European Currency Unit, a basket of the Community's currencies used to determine exchange rates, and the forerunner of the euro.

===The European Monetary System===

The Irish government had to decide whether or not to participate in the EMS. If the EMS had included all the European Community's currencies, it would have provided stability for 75% of Ireland's external trade, but in the event Britain, which still accounted for 50% of Ireland's external trade, decided to stay out of the EMS. Despite this, on 15 December 1978 it was announced that Ireland would participate in the EMS. Countries were given the option of either a 2.25% or 6% margin of fluctuation within the EMS' Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), and Ireland took the narrower margin. The EMS started on 13 March 1979, and towards the end of the month Sterling started to gain in value against the EMS currencies because of rising oil prices, and by 30 March Sterling breached the upper fluctuation band limit of the Belgian franc and the Irish currency could no longer track Sterling. After over 50 years, the parity of the Irish and British currencies was broken, and the Irish currency became known as the Irish pound (or Punt).
The initial experience of the EMS was disappointing. It had been expected that the Irish Pound would appreciate in value against Sterling, and hence reduce inflation in Ireland, but in practice Sterling appreciated considerably in value thanks to its status as a petrocurrency and to the tight monetary policies of the new British government of Margaret Thatcher. By late 1980 the Irish Pound had fallen in value to less than 80 British pence, and Irish inflation was higher than British. Economic policy in Ireland was inconsistent with a "hard currency" policy, and the Irish Pound also failed to hold its value against the central rate of the Deutschmark, although it did appreciate in value against some of the other EMS currencies.
Eventually the EMS settled down (notwithstanding a crisis in 1992 when the Irish Pound was devalued by 10%), and Irish inflation was consistently the same or lower than Britain's inflation rate from 1987 onwards.

===Towards the Euro===

The idea of a single European currency goes back to the Schumann Plan of 1950. The first blueprint for how to go about implementing the currency, the Werner Report of 1970 was not proceeded with, but the ultimate aim was always kept in mind. The Delors Report endorsed by the Madrid Summit of June 1989 envisaged a three-stage process to monetary union, and this was given legal authority by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 (enacted into Irish law as the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland by 70% of those voting in a referendum on 18 June 1992). This envisaged the start of monetary union on 1 January 1999 and the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January 2002.
The Central Bank began production of euro coins in September 1999, producing over a billion coins, weighing about 5,000 tons, with a value of 230 million euro before the introduction into circulation of the euro coins in January 2002. Production of euro banknotes began in June 2000, with 300 million notes worth 4 billion euro being produced in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 euro. Euro banknotes produced for the Central Bank are identified by having the serial number begin with the letter T. The Bank did not initially issue €200 or €500 euro banknotes, but has since begun to do so.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0111/euro.html|title=More euro in circulation than Irish pounds|accessdate=1 May 2007|date=11 January 2002|publisher=RTÉ News[/tpl]

===Banking system collapse resulting from property bubble===

Despite growing evidenceThe Central Bank admitted in November 2005 that estimates of overvaluation of 0% to 60% in the Irish residential property market existed. The Irish Times revealed minutes of a meeting with the OECD which indicated that while the Central Bank agreed that Irish property was overvalued by 15% it was fearful of precipitating a crash by "putting a number on it". of an unsustainable property price and construction bubble during the mid-2000s, corrective regulatory action was delayed and timid. After the bubble burst, Irish banks faced mounting losses on a scale which exposed them to a collapse of confidence following the Lehman's bankruptcy in September 2008; they then suffered acute liquidity pressures which had to be met by Central Bank support, including emergency lending. Management abuses, which the CBOI did not restrain, were also revealed at Anglo Irish Bank, which had to be nationalised in January 2009.
Their Annual Report, which was published just three months before the Government was forced to unconditionally guarantee the deposits of the Irish-owned banks,said: "The banks have negligible exposure to the sub-prime sector and they remain relatively healthy by the standard measures of capital, profitability and asset quality. This has been confirmed by the stress testing exercises we have carried out with the banks".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/last-of-the-breed-1903360.html |title=John Hurley: Last of the breed |publisher=Irish Independent |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/columnists/dan-white/id-rely-on-astrologer-fergus-more-than-central-bank-chief-1822588.html |title=I'd rely on astrologer Fergus more than Central Bank chief |first=Dan |last=White |publisher=Evening Herald |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]

Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.[tpl]cite web|last=Curran |first=Richard |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=MARKETS-qqqm=nav-qqqid=43326-qqqx=1.asp |title=The inquisitor |publisher=Sunday Business Post |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/becb8b70-b917-11de-98ee-00144feab49a.html |title=Ahern admits to part in Irish crisis |work=Financial Times |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
In July 2009, a senior Central Bank official told the Oireachtas Enterprise Committee that shareholders (later corrected/clarified to refer to institutional investors) who lost their money in the banking collapse were to blame for their fate and got what was coming to them for not keeping bank chiefs in check.  The official did admit that the Central Bank had failed to give sufficient warning about reckless lending to property developers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/top-official-says-shareholders-to-blame-for-the-banking-crisis-1846180.html |title=Top official says shareholders to blame for the banking crisis |publisher=Evening Herald |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
A report by the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee said it was “exercising inadequate supervision” and a proper analysis of loan books of the banks was not done.http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/ourview/banking-regulation--clearly-nothing-has-been-learned-247740.html#.UnTr7SJVo5g.twitter

===The Financial Regulator===

In 2003 a new separate division of the Central Bank, with its own Chairman, Chief Executive, and board, was established as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This was as a compromise between those who favoured a fully independent regulator and those who believed the Central Bank should maintain full control of regulation of the financial services industry. This division of the Bank authorised and regulated all financial institutions (including insurance undertakings, collective investment funds and credit unions) in Ireland.http://www.financialregulator.ie/processes/authorisation/Pages/approach.aspx [tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]"How to start a bank in Ireland"[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Under the 2003 arrangements the Central Bank provided the Financial Regulator with services. The Regulator’s industry panel, which provided the Regulator with feedback on its charges and policies said in April 2007 that they had ‘‘major concerns with the quality and cost of the services’’ provided to the Regulator by the Central Bank.[tpl]cite web|last=McBride |first=Louise |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/04/01/story22361.asp |title=Financial Regulator is questioned by own advisers |publisher=The Sunday Business Post |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2010[/tpl]
In January 2009, the chief executive officer of Financial Regulator, Patrick Neary, retired early over the handling of the investigation into the €87 million secret directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0109/financial-business.html |title=Neary to retire as Regulator |date=9 January 2009 |publisher=RTE [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/regulators-retirement-was-overdued--in-the-dark-financial-regulator-patrick-neary-has-finally-taken-early-retirement-1598042.html |title=Financial regulator Patrick Neary has finally taken early retirement |date=10 January 2009 |author=Sinead Ryan |publisher=Evening Herald [/tpl]

A July 2009 editorial, in the respected, Sunday Business Post, said "returning the key powers of regulation to the Central Bank will be useless unless there is a fundamental change in the culture of the organisation. This does not require a complete change of personnel, but a change of key personnel."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=EDITORIAL-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=42958-qqqx=1.asp|title=The Sunday Business Post[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] There can be no denying that the spinning off of the Financial Regulator from the functions of the Central Bank in 2003, was an outright failure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/move-to-rulesbased-system-will-need-a-change-in-culture-1779342.html|title=Move to rules-based system will need a change in culture – Business, Frontpage – Independent.ie |publisher=Sbpost.ie |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/columnists/dan-white/id-rely-on-astrologer-fergus-more-than-central-bank-chief-1822588.html |title=I'd rely on astrologer Fergus more than Central Bank chief – Dan White, Columnists |publisher=Herald.ie |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl]

In 1982, PMPA, then the largest motor insurer in Ireland with about 300,000 policy holders and 32 per cent of the entire market, had to be saved from total collapse by the State. A 2pc levy was imposed on all non-life insurance premiums at the time to cover the collapse of PMPA which ended in the early 1990s. The subsequent administration of the company lasted 30 years.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/consumers-face-l5year-levy-to-cover-cost-of-quinn-fiasco-28892007.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Consumers face l5-year levy to cover cost of Quinn fiasco | date=2 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/insurance-firm-pmpa-to-exit-administration-after-30-years-29309350.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Insurance firm PMPA to exit administration after 30 years | date=30 May 2013[/tpl]
The Insurance Corporation of Ireland was a wholly owned subsidiary of the CBOI-supervised Allied Irish Banks, when it collapsed in 1985. This was that had arisen due to severe underpricing of policies being written, adequate reserves were not being maintained and it was not monitoring the true profitability of the business. This collapse occurred at a time of deep economic recession in Ireland (government debt in 1985 was 116% of GDP). But the Irish taxpayer bailed AIB out of its difficulties at the urging of the Central Bank. The Irish Government did so as the Central Bank claimed that it could put AIB's core banking business in jeopardy.

In 2000, the Dáil Public Accounts Committee "DIRT" enquiry, into the facilitation of wide-spread tax evasion by the banking industry, was of the view that the Central Bank had an inappropriate and outmoded approach to supervision in the context of the growing sophistication of banking and the changing role of banks. It also found there was an insufficient concern with ethics and supervision other than from the standpoint of a traditional and narrow concern with prudential supervision in the Central Bank.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0422/1224268870178.html |title=Thu, Apr 22, 2010 – Paying a high price for toothless regulation |work=The Irish Times  |date=4 April 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gov.ie/committees-99/c-publicaccounts/sub-rep/page5.htm |title=Díospóireachtaí Coistí – Committee Debates |publisher=Gov.ie |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2012[/tpl] The Chairman of the inquiry was "shocked and horrified" at the "careless and reckless" manner in which the Governor had quoted false statistics to the Public Accounts subcommittee.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/heads-must-roll-says-jim-mitchell-521833.html |title=Heads must roll, says Jim Mitchell|work=The Irish Independent  |accessdate=21 April 2012 |date=19 December 1999[/tpl]
The Central Bank was warned by the German regulator, BaFin, as early as 2004 that Sachsen LB's troubled Irish subsidiaries were involved in highly risky and under-scrutinised transactions worth as much as €30bn or 20 times the parent bank's capitalisation. Despite the warning, in 2007 the CBOI approved another Sachsen investment vehicle and two months later the stable of off-balance sheet companies needed a €17.3bn bail-out from the German association of savings banks to keep Sachsen afloat.Financial Regulator knew Ormond Quay risks three years agohttp://www.rte.ie/business/2008/0813/sachsenlb1.html [tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]

Criminal prosecutions by the Garda Síochána against managers in banks who committed offences are being undermined as CBOI staff were aware of the alleged offences, took no action to stop them and thus provided an arguable defence to those who committed wrongdoing, as they could reasonably claim they were acting with the approval of regulatory authorities at all times. One line of inquiry investigated by detectives was that they did not inform the Department of Finance of all facts they knew about the banking industry.
