==Main cast==

==Production==

The series was created by Frank Spotnitz (best known as executive producer and head writer for The X-Files), who will write the majority of the episodes of season 1. Spotnitz is executive producing with Kudos’ Stephen Garrett (executive producer of Law & Order: UK, Spooks/MI5), Jane Featherstone (producer behind Spooks/MI5, The Hour, Life on Mars), Alison Jackson (Ashes to Ashes, Eternal Law), and BBC's Christopher Aird (Spooks, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries). 
After Spotnitz had wrapped up The X-Files he met Stephen Garrett and Jane Featherstone of Kudos Film and Television. They asked him to come to England and work with British television. Spotnitz had lived in Europe before and was interested in returning. He claims the idea was appealing but it simply never happened. The years passed and Spotnitz was talking to The X-Files star Gillian Anderson, who was visiting Los Angeles from London where she lives, and she asked, "Would you ever consider doing a show (in England)?". Spotnitz started talking to her about doing a spy series and then the first call he made was to Stephen Garrett since the two lost touch. "You know the idea of doing a show in England? I think I may finally have it".
On 13 January 2011, the BBC announced the show — then called Morton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/01_january/13/drama.shtml |title=Press Office – Danny Cohen announces new drama commissions for BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] Gillian Anderson was no longer attached to the show; it took Spotnitz and Kudos longer than estimated to get the green light from the BBC and by then, Anderson was too busy with other projects.
Spotnitz relocated to London with his family. While trying to get Hunted off the ground, he served as co-producer and head writer for Strike Back: Project Dawn (or just Strike Back in the United States), which was also produced by HBO for Cinemax, but co-produced with another British broadcaster, BSkyB (for Sky1), not the BBC.
On 22 September 2011, reports confirmed that HBO/Cinemax would come on board as co-producers and that the name Morton had been scrapped and the new name was Nemesis.[tpl]cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/action-drama-from-frank-spotnitz-is-a-go-at-cinemax-melissa-george-to-star/ |title=Action Drama From Frank Spotnitz Is A Go At Cinemax, Melissa George To Star – |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] On 6 March 2012, Spotnitz announced on his homepage that the show's title had been changed again to Hunted.[tpl]cite web|first=Frank |last=Spotnitz |url=http://biglight.com/blog/its-official-3/ |title=I’m Delighted to Announce… « Big Light |publisher=Big Light |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl]
Spotnitz spent a lot of time researching private spy agencies. He told Screen International: "It's not an area I was very aware of until I went looking for it. Most private contractors don't want to be noticed. Their websites are dry and boring and they don't want the wrong kind of attention. I talked to people who run these companies in the US, United Kingdom and Switzerland and then I researched the type of personality working at them".[tpl]cite web|last=Wiseman |first=Andreas |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/x-files-writer-frank-spotnitz-talks-new-spy-series-hunted-working-in-the-uk-and-a-feature-sequel-to-x-files/5040192.article?blocktitle=Latest-distribution-news&contentID=252 |title=The X-Files writer Frank Spotnitz talks new UK spy series Hunted, working in the UK and a feature sequel to The X-Files | News | Screen |publisher=Screendaily.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2012[/tpl]

It's all location filming. It’s really expensive and difficult to do, but it looks so much better and has a real feel of authenticity", Spotnitz told The Hollywood Reporter. "It's international and it looks international".
During the series, Sam has childhood memories of an oast house and in episode 5 she finds the Oast House. This is the oast house at Little Scotney Farm, Lamberhurst, Kent. It is still a working oast house owned by the National Trust, producing hops to make "Scotney Ale".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1515908 |title=Oast House at Little Scotney Farm, Lamberhurst, Kent:: OS grid TQ6936 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! |publisher=Geograph.org.uk |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]

===Sam Hunter spinoff===

On 25 September 2012, it was reported that British screenwriter Ben Harris had joined the writing team in preparation for a second series pickup from BBC One and Cinemax.[tpl]cite web|title=BBC One/Cinemax Eyeing Second Season Order For 'Hunted', Adds Ben Harris To Writing Team|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2012/09/hunted-season-2-ben-harris/|first=Patrick|last=Munn|work=TVWise|date=25 September 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012[/tpl] 
Melissa George has reported that the second series of Hunted would be set in Berlin. The Australian star previously said that her Hunted role "could potentially be long-term", adding that she may be playing Sam "for the next five years".[tpl]cite news|author=Published Monday, 22 October 2012, 10:58am EDT |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a432502/melissa-george-talks-hunted-series-two-plans-its-set-in-berlin.html |title=Melissa George talks 'Hunted' series two plans: 'It's set in Berlin' - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=18 October 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012[/tpl]
On 3 November 2012, it was reported that British screenwriter Claire Wilson had joined the writing team in preparation for a second series pickup from BBC One and Cinemax.[tpl]cite web|title=BBC One/Cinemax Series 'Hunted' Adds Claire Wilson To Writing Staff, Renewal Discussions In "Early Stages"|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2012/11/hunted-writing-staff-claire-wilson/|first=Patrick|last=Munn|work=TVWise|date=3 November 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl]
However, on 14 November 2012, The Guardian reported that BBC One had decided not to commission a second series of Hunted, citing ratings declines as the primary reason.[tpl]cite news|title=BBC1's Hunted laid to rest|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/14/bbc1-hunted-laid-to-rest#start-of-comments|first=Maggie|last=Brown|work=The Guardian|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012|location=London[/tpl]  Cinemax has since announced that it is working with Frank Spotnitz to reboot the show, describing the current incarnation as "too expensive" to continue without BBC support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/cinemax-eyes-new-incarnation-of-hunted-with-frank-spotnitz-and-melissa-george/|title=Cinemax Eyes New Incarnation of 'Hunted' With Frank Spotnitz and Melissa George|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=15 November 2012[/tpl]
Spotnitz has revealed that the original plans for Hunted Series Two — which would have followed Sam Hunter to Germany — have been abandoned in the wake of the series shake-up. "It's going to change — that plot was when we still had the BBC as a partner", he explained. "Now it's one of those funny things where it's the same character, but it's a different series." Spotnitz added that he "would very much expect" future episodes to air in the UK, adding that he has considered other British networks as potential partners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a439629/hunted-creator-frank-spotnitz-on-series-two-its-sort-of-a-spinoff.html |title='Hunted' creator Frank Spotnitz on series two: It's sort of a spinoff - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]
