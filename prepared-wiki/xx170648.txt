Calne railway station was opened on 3 November 1863 by the Great Western Railway as a terminus for the branch line from the Great Western mainline (with a junction at Chippenham).  It was situated a short distance from Calne town centre and was equipped with only one platform. The station, when first opened, had its own engine shed. 
In the early years of the station's history, the seven sidings were usually full due to the amount of traffic coming in from the nearby Chippenham railway station. Calne was the terminus of the 5 mi line from [tpl]stnlnk|Chippenham[/tpl]. 
The station was always for public use all the way from its beginning until its closure in 1965, as part of the nationwide Beeching Axe, as it was one of the least profitable lines in the entire country.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] It closed and the buildings were left to be vandalised but were eventually taken down. A few years later, the area was built on to become Station Road Industrial Estate and as of 2014 a small housing development is being built on the site.
