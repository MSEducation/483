Bossmusic is an independent record label based in London, most notable for releasing early Reuben records. It was founded by Andy Ross, who used to manage Food Records before it was taken over and merged into Parlophone by EMI in 1994. In recent years the label has moved into music management, while still occasionally releasing records.
