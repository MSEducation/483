Selenium is a chemical element with  symbol Se and atomic number 34. It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between those of its periodic table column-adjacent chalcogen elements sulfur and tellurium. It rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature, or as pure ore compounds. Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously known tellurium (named for the Earth).
Selenium is found impurely in metal sulfide ores, where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during copper production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known, but are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are in glassmaking and in pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Uses in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium continues to be used in a few types of DC power surge protectors, baby formula, and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.
Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently requiring none.[tpl]cite web |url = http://cals.arizona.edu/arec/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |format = PDF |title = Poisonous Plants on Arizona Rangelands |first = George |last = Ruyle |accessdate = 2009-01-05 |publisher = The University of Arizona[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

Selenium exists in several allotropes that interconvert upon heating and cooling carried out at different temperatures and rates. As prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, which is usually sold industrially as beads.[tpl]cite book|title = Inorganic chemistry| first = James E.|last = House| publisher = Academic Press| year = 2008| isbn = 0-12-356786-6| page = 524[/tpl] The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50 °C and converts to gray selenium at 180 °C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw|pages=751–752[/tpl]
The red-colored α, β and γ forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying evaporation rates of the solvent (usually CS2). They all have relatively low, monoclinic crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se8 rings arranged in different fashions, as in sulfur. The packing is most dense in the α form. In the Se8 rings, the Se-Se distance is 233.5 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 105.7 degrees. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se6 or Se7 rings.
The most stable and dense form of selenium has a gray color and hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, wherein the Se-Se distance is 237.3 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1 degrees. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6 pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapors just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Contrary to other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the unusual changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.[tpl]YouTube|nDEfR2Nw50s|Video of selenium heating[/tpl]

===Isotopes===

Selenium has six naturally occurring isotopes, five of which are stable: 74Se, 76Se, 77Se, 78Se, and 80Se. The last three also occur as fission products, along with 79Se, which has a half-life of 327,000 years.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ptb.de/en/org/6/nachrichten6/2010/60710_en.htm|title = The half-life of 79Se|publisher = Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|date= 2010-09-23|accessdate = 2012-05-29[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Jörg |first1=Gerhard |last2=Bühnemann |first2=Rolf |last3=Hollas |first3=Simon |last4=Kivel |first4=Niko |last5=Kossert |first5=Karsten |last6=Van Winckel |first6=Stefaan |last7=Gostomski |first7=Christoph Lierse v. |title=Preparation of radiochemically pure 79Se and highly precise determination of its half-life |journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes |volume=68 |issue=12 |pages=2339–2351 |year=2010 |pmid=20627600 |doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2010.05.006[/tpl] The final naturally occurring isotope, 82Se, has a very long half-life (~1020 yr, decaying via double beta decay to 82Kr), which, for practical purposes, can be considered to be stable. Twenty-three other unstable isotopes have been characterized.[tpl]cite journal| last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128| publisher=Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.[/tpl]

==Chemical compounds==

Selenium compounds commonly exist in the oxidation states −2, +2, +4, and +6.

===Chalcogen compounds===

Selenium forms two oxides: selenium dioxide (SeO2) and selenium trioxide (SeO3). Selenium dioxide is formed by the reaction of elemental selenium with oxygen:
It is a polymeric solid that forms monomeric SeO2 molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form selenous acid, H2SeO3. Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with nitric acid:
Unlike sulfur, which forms a stable trioxide, selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185 °C:
Selenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of anhydrous potassium selenate (K2SeO4) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw|page=780[/tpl]
Salts of selenous acid are called selenites. These include silver selenite (Ag2SeO3) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3).
Hydrogen sulfide reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce selenium disulfide:
Selenium disulfide consists of 8-membered rings of a nearly statistical distribution of sulfur and selenium atoms. It has an approximate composition of SeS2, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se4S4 and Se2S6. Selenium disulfide has been use in shampoo as an anti-dandruff agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in fireworks.
Selenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating selenic acid, H2SeO4, which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with hydrogen peroxide:[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1002/9780470132517.ch9|author = Seppelt, K. and Desmarteau, Darryl D.|title = Selenoyl difluoride|journal = Inorganic Syntheses|year = 1980|volume = 20|pages = 36–38|isbn = 0-471-07715-1|series = Inorganic Syntheses[/tpl] The report describes the synthesis of selenic acid.
Hot, concentrated selenic acid is capable of dissolving gold, forming gold(III) selenate.[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/ja02018a005[/tpl]

===Halogen compounds===

Iodides of selenium are not well known. The only stable chloride is selenium monochloride (Se2Cl2), which might be better known as selenium(I) chloride; the corresponding bromide is also known. These species are structurally analogous to the corresponding disulfur dichloride. Selenium dichloride is an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds (e.g. the preparation of Se7). It is prepared by treating selenium with sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2). Selenium reacts with fluorine to form selenium hexafluoride:
In comparison with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), selenium hexafluoride (SeF6) is more reactive and is a toxic pulmonary irritant.
Some of the selenium oxyhalides, such as selenium oxyfluoride (SeOF2) and selenium oxychloride (SeOCl2) have been used as specialty solvents.

===Selenides===

Analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms a dihydride H2Se. It is a strongly odiferous, toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than H2S. In solution it ionizes to HSe-. The selenide dianion Se2- forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include mercury selenide (HgSe), lead selenide (PbSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(Ga,In)Se2). These materials are semiconductors. With highly electropositive metals, such as aluminium, these selenides are prone to hydrolysis:
Alkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, [tpl]chem|Se|x|2-[/tpl], which exist as chains.

===Other compounds===

Tetraselenium tetranitride, Se4N4, is an explosive orange compound analogous to tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4).[tpl]cite journal |last1= Woollins|first1 = J.

Selenium reacts with cyanides to yield selenocyanates:

===Organoselenium compounds===

Selenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to carbon, which are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1002/anie.199010671[/tpl]

==History==

Selenium (Greek σελήνη selene meaning "Moon") was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn.Berzelius, J. J. (1818) "Lettre de M. Berzelius à M. Berthollet sur deux métaux nouveaux" (Letter from Mr. Berzelius to Mr. Berthollet on two new metals), Annales de chimie et de physique, series 2, vol. 7, pp. 199–206. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, and so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its  similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p474|title = The discovery of the elements. VI.

In 1873, Willoughby Smith found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first of commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics.[tpl]cite journal|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=diwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA116 |title=Action of light on selenium|journal =Popular Science|year =1876| volume = 10 | issue =1 |page=116[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=CaxdTFMwQEAC&pg=PA77|chapter = Earliest semiconductor device| pages = 77–79|title = Getting to Know Semiconductors|isbn = 978-981-02-3516-1|last1 = Levinshtein|first1 = M.

Selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to human beings working in industries. Selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin, which is seen in animals that have eaten high-selenium plants. In 1954, the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms.[tpl]cite journal|pmc =1269698|title =The need for selenite and molybdate in the formation of formic dehydrogenase by members of the Coli-aerogenes group of bacteria|volume =57|issue =1|journal=Biochem J. |year=1954|pages=10–16|author=Pinsent, Jane |pmid=13159942[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1007/0-306-47466-2_267|chapter =Some Functions of the Essential Trace Element, Selenium|title =Trace Elements in Man and Animals 10|year =2002|last1 =Stadtman|first1 =Thressa C.|isbn =0-306-46378-4|page =831[/tpl] Its essentiality for mammalian life was discovered in 1957.[tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1021/ja01569a087|year =1957|last1 =Schwarz|first1 =Klaus|last2 =Foltz|first2 =Calvin M.|journal =Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume =79|issue =12|pages =3292–3293 | title=Selenium as an Integral Part of Factor 3 Against Dietary Necrotic Liver Degeneration[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1007/0-387-33827-6_1|chapter =Selenium: A historical perspective|title =Selenium|year =2006|last1 =Oldfield|first1 =James E.|isbn =978-0-387-33826-2|page =1[/tpl] In the 1970s, it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes. This was followed by the discovery of selenocysteine in proteins. During the 1980s, it was shown that selenocysteine is encoded by the codon UGA. The recoding mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals (see SECIS element).

==Occurrence==

Native (i.e., elemental) selenium is a rare mineral, which does not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals.[tpl]cite web| publisher = Webminerals| url = http://www.galleries.com/minerals/elements/selenium/selenium.htm |title = Native Selenium |accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl] Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements.
Selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including selenide-, selenate-, and selenite-containing minerals, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found quite impurely, replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.[tpl]cite journal|pmid = 9726787|year = 1998|last1 = Kabata-Pendias|first1 = A.|title = Geochemistry of selenium|volume = 17|issue = 3–4|pages = 173–177|journal = Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi= 10.1579/0044-7447(2007)3694:SGAH2.0.CO;2|year= 2007|volume= 36|page= 94|title= Selenium Geochemistry and Health|last1= Fordyce|first1= Fiona|journal= AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment[/tpl]
In living systems, selenium is found in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1515/BC.2007.138|title = Selenium in chemistry and biochemistry in comparison to sulfur|year = 2007|last1 = Wessjohann|first1 = Ludger A.|last2 = Schneider|first2 = Alex|last3 = Abbas|first3 = Muhammad|last4 = Brandt|first4 = Wolfgang|journal = Biological Chemistry|volume = 388|issue = 10|pages = 997–1006|pmid = 17937613[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1039/B205802M|title =Trends in selenium biochemistry|year =2002|last1 =Birringer|first1 =Marc|last2 =Pilawa|first2 =Sandra|last3 =Flohé|first3 =Leopold|journal =Natural Product Reports|volume =19|issue =6|pages =693–718|pmid =12521265[/tpl]
Certain solids are selenium-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by certain plants. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00370-3|title = Role of oceans as biogenic sources of selenium|year = 2001|last1 = Amouroux|first1 = David|last2 = Liss|first2 = Peter S|last3 = Tessier|first3 = Emmanuel|last4 = Hamren-Larsson|first4 = Marie|last5 = Donard|first5 = Olivier F.X|journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume = 189|issue = 3–4|page = 277|bibcode = 2001E&PSL.189..277A [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1080/08910600701698986|title =How to use the world's scarce selenium resources efficiently to increase the selenium concentration in food|year =2007|last1 =Haug|first1 =Anna|last2 =Graham|first2 =Robin D.|last3 =Christophersen|first3 =Olav A.|last4 =Lyons|first4 =Graham H.|journal =Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease|volume =19|issue =4|pages =209–228|pmid =18833333|pmc =2556185[/tpl]
Anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c1.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Selenium |accessdate = 2009-01-05[/tpl]

==Production==

Selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, such as those of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly conducive to producing selenium as a byproduct, and it is obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants but this method to produce sulfuric acid is no longer used. These muds can be processed by a number of means to obtain selenium. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c5.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Selenium – Production, Import/Export, Use, and Disposal |accessdate = 2009-01-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Se/key.html |title = Chemistry : Periodic Table : selenium : key information |accessdate = 2009-01-06 |publisher = webelements[/tpl] Since the invention of solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) for the production of copper this method takes an increasing share of the world wide copper production.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0301-4207(03)00025-4|title = SX-EW copper and the technology cycle|year = 2002|last1 = Bartos|first1 = P.J.|journal = Resources Policy|volume = 28|issue = 3–4|page = 85[/tpl] This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached together with the copper.
Industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide. The selenium dioxide is then mixed with water and the solution is acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF03220269|title = Recovering selenium and tellurium from copper refinery slimes|year = 1989|last1 = Hoffmann|first1 = James E.|journal = JOM|volume = 41|issue = 7|page = 33|bibcode = 1989JOM....41g..33H [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF03220271|title = Recovering selenium from copper refinery slimes|year = 1989|last1 = Hyvärinen|first1 = Olli|last2 = Lindroos|first2 = Leo|last3 = Yllö|first3 = Erkki|journal = JOM|volume = 41|issue = 7|page = 42|bibcode = 1989JOM....41g..42H [/tpl][tpl]-[/tpl]
About 2,000 tonnes of selenium has been produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in Germany (650 t), Japan (630 t), Belgium (200 t) and Russia (140 t), and the total reserves were estimated at 93,000 tonnes. These data however exclude two major producers, the United States and China. The price has been relatively stable during 2004–2010 at ~30 US dollars per pound (per 100-pound lot) but has increased to 65 $/lb in 2011. A previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from 4–5 to 27 $/lb. The consumption in 2010 was divided as follows: metallurgy – 30%, glass manufacturing – 30%, agriculture – 10%, chemicals and pigments – 10%, electronics – 10%. China is the dominant consumer of selenium at 1,500–2,000 tonnes/year.

==Applications==

===Manganese electrolysis===

During the electro winning of manganese an addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the electrolysis cells. China is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose. For every tonne of manganese an average of 2 kg selenium oxide is used.[tpl]cite web|title = Selenium and Tellurium: Statistics and Information|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/selenium/|publisher = United States Geological Survey |accessdate = 2012-05-30[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.111|title = Studies of the reduction mechanism of selenium dioxide and its impact on the microstructure of manganese electrodeposit|year = 2011|last1 = Sun|first1 = Yan|last2 = Tian|first2 = Xike|last3 = He|first3 = Binbin|last4 = Yang|first4 = Chao|last5 = Pi|first5 = Zhenbang|last6 = Wang|first6 = Yanxin|last7 = Zhang|first7 = Suxin|journal = Electrochimica Acta|volume = 56|issue = 24|page = 8305[/tpl] 

===Glass production===

The largest commercial use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, is for the production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities that are typical for most glass. For this purpose various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, the red color may be desirable, in which case mixtures of CdSe and CdS are added.Bernd E. Langner "Selenium and Selenium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_525[/tpl].

===Alloys===

Selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead.

==Biological role==

Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants such as locoweed require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). See more on plant nutrition below.
Selenium is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidasesLinus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University lpi.oregonstate.edu and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).
The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze certain reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides:
Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland and in every cell that uses thyroid hormone, by participating as a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites: the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine. (Only the deiodinase iodotyrosine deiodinase, which works on the last break-down products of thyroid hormone, does not use selenium).[tpl]cite web |url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher = Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-01-05[/tpl]

===Evolution in biology===

From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drive the evolution of selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,[tpl]cite journal |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |year=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899 |last1=Gladyshev |first1=Vadim N. |last2=Hatfield |first2=Dolph L.[/tpl] where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-containing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroy peroxide and repair damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stadtman TC |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |pages=83–100 |year=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503[/tpl]
Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, vanadium, magnesium, copper, and zinc, may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas. Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of vertebrates, aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.[tpl]cite journal |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |year=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198 |last1=Lobanov |first1=Alexey V |last2=Fomenko |first2=Dmitri E |last3=Zhang |first3=Yan |last4=Sengupta |first4=Aniruddha |last5=Hatfield |first5=Dolph L |last6=Gladyshev |first6=Vadim N[/tpl] Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols (including flavonoids), tocopherols, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late Jurassic period.
The deiodinase isoenzymes constitute another family of eukaryotic selenoproteins with identified enzyme function. Deiodinases are able to extract electrons from iodides, and iodides from iodothyronines. They are, thus, involved in thyroid-hormone regulation, participating in the protection of thyrocytes from damage by H2O2 produced for thyroid-hormone biosynthesis.Venturi S.

===Nutritional sources of selenium===

Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals, meat, mushrooms, fish, and eggs. Brazil nuts are the richest ordinary dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs). In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in kidney, tuna, crab, and lobster.[tpl]cite journal |last = Barclay |first = Margaret N.

The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.A common reference for this is [tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6424964|pmid =4926392|year =1970|last1 =Schroeder|first1 =HA|last2 =Frost|first2 =DV|last3 =Balassa|first3 =JJ|title =Essential trace metals in man: Selenium|volume =23|issue =4|pages =227–43|journal =Journal of chronic diseases|doi =10.1016/0021-9681(70)90003-2[/tpl]

===Indicator plant species===

Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are Astragalus species (including some locoweeds), prince's plume (Stanleya sp.), woody asters (Xylorhiza sp.), and false goldenweed (Oonopsis sp.)[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title = Selenium in Plants |accessdate = 2008-12-05 |author= Zane Davis, T. |date= 2008-03-27 |page=8[/tpl]

===Detection in biological fluids===

Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.[tpl]cite book|first = R.|last = Baselt|title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition= 8|publisher = Biomedical Publications|place= Foster City, CA|year = 2008|pages= 1416–1420|isbn= 978-0-9626523-5-6[/tpl]

===Toxicity===

Although selenium is an essential trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.[tpl]cite web |url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher = National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |accessdate = 2009-01-05[/tpl] This 400 microgram (µg) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.[tpl]cite book |title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher = Institute of Medicine |date = August 15, 2000 |pages = 314–315 |url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&page=315 |isbn = 0-309-06949-1 |author = a report of the Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Leves of Nutrients and of Interpretation and Use of Dietary Reference Intakes, and the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.[/tpl] The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid toxicity, but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded in literature.
Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, and death.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Health Effects |accessdate = 2009-01-05[/tpl] Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of their low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide.

On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died shortly before a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a pharmacy released a statement explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose of one of the ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly compounded by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times higher than normal in the horses' blood samples, and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in their liver samples. It was later confirmed that selenium was the ingredient in question.[tpl]cite web|date=2009-05-06| url = http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/news/2009/05/033.shtml| title = Polo pony selenium levels up to 20 times higher than normal| accessdate = 2009-05-05[/tpl]
Selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates.

In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.

Although New Zealand has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/Sel.htm |work = Prescriber Update Articles |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-07-13 |publisher = New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |author = MedSafe Editorial Team[/tpl]
Selenium deficiency as defined by low (There are interactions between selenium and other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to Kashin-Beck disease.
Also, there are interactions between selenium and other minerals, such as zinc and copper. It seems that a high dose of Se supplements to pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio which, in turn, leads to Zn reduction. It can be concluded that the Zn status should be monitored when high doses of Se are supplemented to pregnant animals. Further studies need to be done with higher levels of Se supplement to conﬁrm these interactions.
In some regions (e.g. various regions within North America) where low available selenium levels in soil lead to low concentrations in dry matter of plants, Se deficiency in some animal species may occur unless dietary (or injected) selenium supplementation is done.National Research Council, Subcommittee on Sheep Nutrition (1985). Nutrient requirements of sheep. 6th ed., National Academy Press, Washington, ISBN 0309035961.   Ruminants are particularly susceptible.  In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than in non-ruminants, and is lower from forages than from grain.National Research Council, Committee on Nutrient Requirements of Small Ruminants (2007). Nutrient requirements of small ruminants.  National Academies Press, Washington, ISBN 0-309-10213-8.  Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g. some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because of cyanide from the aglycone released by glucosidase activity in the rumen[tpl]cite journal|author=Coop, I.

===Controversial health effects===

A number of correlative epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (as measured by blood levels) in a number of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer,[tpl]cite journal|url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/128/11/1845.full.pdf|pmid = 9808633|year = 1998|last1 = Ip|first1 = C|title = Lessons from basic research in selenium and cancer prevention|volume = 128|issue = 11|pages = 1845–54|journal = The Journal of nutrition[/tpl] diabetes, HIV/AIDS,[tpl]cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02490-9|title =The importance of selenium to human health|year =2000|last1 =Rayman|first1 =Margaret P.|journal =The Lancet|volume =356|issue =9225|pages =233–41|pmid=10963212[/tpl] and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation has been found to be a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has a meta-analysis of such selenium supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.[tpl]cite journal|pmid = 22419320|year =2012|last1 =Bjelakovic|first1 =G|last2 =Nikolova|first2 =D|last3 =Gluud|first3 =LL|last4 =Simonetti|first4 =RG|last5 =Gluud|first5 =C|title =Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|volume =3|pages =CD007176|doi =10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2|journal =Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|editor1-last =Bjelakovic|editor1-first =Goran[/tpl]
