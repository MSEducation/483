==RAF Ludham==

Ludham was transferred from  No. 12 Group RAF to the Admiralty on 24 August 1944 and occupied by the Mobile Naval Airfields Organisation. RNAS Ludham was commissioned as HMS Flycatcher, RNAS Ludham on 4 September under the command of the Senior Officer Mobile Naval Airfields Organisation.
At Ludham the MNAO assembled and despatched the first five Mobile Naval Air Bases (MONAB) and one "Transportable Aircraft Maintenance Yard" (TAMY). Flycatcher moved from Ludham to RAF Middle Wallop which was more advantageous to shipping the assembled units to the Far East. In return the RAF took Ludham on again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~faahistoryweb/Flycatcher-1.htm|title=Flycatcher (1) Ludham|archiveurl=http://archive.is/lDco|archivedate=25 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl]

==Film location==

Ludham was one of the film locations for the 1954 movie "Conflict of Wings" starring John Gregson and Muriel Pavlow. Adapted from the novel by Don Sharp, the story takes place in a Norfolk country village where the locals decide to fight against a proposal to build a rocket range on a bird sanctuary.Britmovie (2)
Filming took place in the village centre and shows many buildings and features (including the Bakers Arms pub and the very narrow main road through the village) which no longer exist.
