Hydroalkoxylation is a chemical reaction that combines alcohols with alkenes or alkynes.  The process affords ethers.
The reaction converts alkenes to dialkyl or aryl-alkyl ethers:
Similarly, akynes are converted to vinyl ethers:
As shown, the reaction follows the Markovnikov rule.   The process exhibits good atom-economy in the sense that no byproducts are produced.  The reaction is catalyzed by bases and also by transition metal complexes.Alonso, F., Beletskaya, I.
