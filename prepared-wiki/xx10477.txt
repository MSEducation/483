Robots and androids have frequently been depicted or described in works of fiction. The word "robot" itself comes from a work of fiction, Karel ÄŒapek's play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) written in 1920 and first performed in 1921.
This list of fictional robots and androids is a chronological list, categorised by medium. It includes all depictions of robots, androids and gynoids in literature, television, and cinema; however, robots that have appeared in more than one form of media are not necessarily listed in each of those media. This list is intended for all fictional computers which are described as existing in a humanlike or mobile form. It shows how the concept has developed in the human imagination through history.
Static computers depicted in fiction are discussed in the separate list of fictional computers.
