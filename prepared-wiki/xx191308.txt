==Population Centres==

This suburban electorate was in the southern part of greater Auckland.

==History==

The electorate was established in the 1993 election, and included the eastern part of the previous Otara electorate. The Otara seat was usually won by Labour, but in the 1990 election when Labour lost a number of seats, Trevor Rogers of National beat Taito Phillip Field the new Labour candidate for Otara to replace Colin Moyle (who was retiring).
In the 1993 election, Trevor Rogers moved east to the new Howick seat, which covered higher-income suburbs traditionally National.
The seat was abolished in the 1996 election, the first MMP election, when it was absorbed into the Manukau East electorate.
