The Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) is a goose with a black head and neck, white patches on the face, and a brown body. Native to arctic and temperate regions of North America, it also occasionally migrates to northern Europe, and has been introduced to Britain, New Zealand, and other temperate regions.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The Canada Goose was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work Systema Naturae.[tpl]cite book|language=Latin|last=Linnaeus | first=C. | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata | location=Holmia |publisher=Laurentius Salvius | year=1758[/tpl] It belongs to the Branta genus of geese, which contains species with largely black plumage, distinguishing them from the grey species of the Anser genus. The specific epithet canadensis is a New Latin word meaning "from Canada". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first citation for the 'Canada Goose' dates back to 1772. The Canada Goose is often incorrectly referred to as the "Canadian Goose".[tpl]cite book|authorlink=Frank Gill (ornithologist)|last=Gill|first=Frank|last2=Minturn|first2= Wright|title=Birds of the World: Recommended English Names|publisher= Christopher Helm|year= 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|editor-last=Gill|editor-first=F.|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last= Donsker|year=2012|title=IOC World Bird Names (v. 3.1)|url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/ |accessdate=May 1, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91857/Canada-goose |title=Canada goose (bird) |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=11 March 2013[/tpl]
The Cackling Goose was originally considered to be the same species or a subspecies of the Canada Goose, but in July 2004 the American Ornithologists' Union's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split the two into two species, making Cackling Goose into a full species with the scientific name Branta hutchinsii. The British Ornithologists' Union followed suit in June 2005.[tpl]cite web|last=Stackhouse|first=Mark|url=http://www.utahbirds.org/RecCom/NewGoose.htm |title=The New Goose[/tpl]
The AOU has divided the many subspecies between the two species. The subspecies of the Canada Goose were listed as:
The distinctions between the two geese have led to confusion and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada Goose and larger types of Cackling Goose. The old "Lesser Canada Goose" was believed to be a partly hybrid population, with the birds named taverneri considered a mixture of minima, occidentalis and parvipes. In addition, it has been determined that the Barnacle Goose is a derivative of the Cackling Goose lineage, whereas the Hawaiian Goose is derived from the Canada Goose.

==Description==

The black head and neck with a white "chinstrap" distinguish the Canada Goose from all other goose species, with the exception of the Barnacle Goose, but the latter has a black breast, and also grey, rather than brownish, body plumage.Audubon Society There are seven subspecies of this bird, of varying sizes and plumage details, but all are recognizable as Canada Geese. Some of the smaller races can be hard to distinguish from the Cackling Goose, which slightly overlap in mass. However, the Cackling Goose is usually considerably smaller, scarcely larger than a Mallard with a much shorter neck and smaller bill.
This species ranges from [tpl]convert|75|to|110|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and has a [tpl]convert|127|–|185|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] wingspan.[tpl]cite book|last=Ogilvie|first=Malcolm |last2= Young|first2=Steve|title=Wildfowl of the World|publisher=New Holland Publishers |year=2004|isbn= 978-1-84330-328-2[/tpl] The male usually weighs [tpl]convert|3.2|-|6.5|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], and can be very aggressive in defending territory. The female looks virtually identical but is slightly lighter at [tpl]convert|2.5|-|5.5|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], generally 10% smaller in linear dimensions than its male counterpart, and has a different honk. Among standard measurements, the wing chord can range from [tpl]convert|39|to|55|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], the tarsus can range from [tpl]convert|6.9|to|10.6|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and the bill can range from [tpl]convert|4.1|to|6.8|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. The largest subspecies is the B. c. maxima, or the "Giant Canada Goose", and the smallest (with the separation of the Cackling Goose group) is B. c. parvipes, or the "Lesser Canada Goose".[tpl]Cite book|last=Madge |first=Steve|last2=Burn|first2=Hilary|title=Waterfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese, and Swans of the World|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1988|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-46727-6[/tpl] An exceptionally large male of race B. c. maxima, which rarely exceed [tpl]convert|8|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], weighed [tpl]convert|10.9|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and had a wingspan of [tpl]convert|2.24|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Distribution and habitat==

This species is native to North America. It breeds in Canada and the northern United States in a variety of habitats. The Great Lakes region maintains a very large population of Canada Geese. Canada Geese occur year-round in the southern part of their breeding range, including most of the eastern seaboard and the Pacific coast. Between California and South Carolina in the southern United States and northern Mexico, Canada Geese are primarily present as migrants from further north during the winter.
By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th century and early 20th century had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. The Giant Canada Goose subspecies was believed to be extinct in the 1950s until, in 1962, a small flock was discovered wintering in Rochester, Minnesota, by Harold Hanson of the Illinois Natural History Survey.[tpl]cite book |last=Hanson|first=Harold C. |title=The Giant Canada Goose |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=1997|edition=2nd. |isbn=978-0-8093-1924-4[/tpl] In 1964, the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center was built near Jamestown. Its first director, Harvey K. Nelson, talked Forrest Lee into leaving Minnesota. Forrest Lee would head the center’s Canada Goose production and restoration program. Forrest soon had 64 pens with 64 breeding pairs of screened, high-quality birds. The project involved private, state and federal resources and relied on the expertise and cooperation of many individuals. By the end of 1981, more than 6,000 giant Canada Geese had been released at 83 sites in 26 counties in North Dakota.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bismarcktribune.com/news/obituaries/forrest-lee/article_aa918dcc-70b0-11e2-aeaf-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Obituary: Forrest Lee|newspaper=The Bismarck Tribune|location=Bismarck, North Dakota|date=February 7, 2013[/tpl] With improved game laws and habitat recreation and preservation programs, their populations have recovered in most of their range, although some local populations, especially of the subspecies occidentalis, may still be declining.[tpl]citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]
In recent years, Canada Goose populations in some areas have grown substantially, so much so that many consider them pests for their droppings, bacteria in their droppings, noise, and confrontational behavior. This problem is partially due to the removal of natural predators and an abundance of safe, man-made bodies of water near food sources, such as those found on golf courses, in public parks and beaches, and in planned communities. Due in part to the interbreeding of various migratory subspecies with the introduced non-migratory Giant subspecies, Canada Geese are frequently a year-around feature of such urban environments.[tpl]cite web|title=Why Do Canada Geese Like Urban Areas?|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/geese/tips/canada_geese_urban_areas.html|work=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=20 February 2014[/tpl] 
Contrary to its normal migration routine, large flocks of Canada Geese have established permanent residence in Esquimalt, British Columbia, on Chesapeake Bay, in Virginia's James River regions, and in the Triangle area of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill), and nearby Hillsborough. Some Canada Geese have taken up permanent residence as far south as Florida, in places such as retention ponds in apartment complexes. Large resident populations of Canada Geese are also present in much of the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California.

===Outside North America===

Canada Geese have reached northern Europe naturally, as has been proved by ringing recoveries. The birds include those of the subspecies parvipes, and possibly others. Canada Geese are also found naturally on the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Siberia, eastern China, and throughout Japan.[tpl]citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]
Canada Geese have also been introduced in Europe, and have established populations in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Scandinavia, and Finland. Most European populations are non-migratory, but those in more northerly parts of Sweden and Finland migrate to the North Sea and Baltic coasts.[tpl]cite book|last=Svensson|first=Lars|year=2009|edition=2nd|publisher=Princeton University Press|title=Birds of Europe|isbn=978-0-691-14392-7|pages=20–21[/tpl] Semi-tame feral birds are common in parks, and have become a pest in some areas. In the early 17th century, explorer Samuel de Champlain sent several pairs of geese to France as a present for King Louis XIII. The geese were first introduced in Britain in the late 17th century as an addition to King James II's waterfowl collection in St. James's Park. They were introduced in Germany and Scandinavia during the 20th century, starting in Sweden in 1929. In Britain they were spread by hunters, but remained uncommon until the mid-20th century. Their population grew from 2200–4000 birds in 1953 to an estimated 82,000 in 1999, as changing agricultural practices and urban growth provided new habitat. European birds are mostly descended from the subspecies canadensis, likely with some contributions from the subspecies maxima.[tpl]cite book|title=Wildfowl|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3dsVIhtJTakC&pg=PT173|series=Collins New Naturalist Library 110|first=Cabot|last=David|publisher=HarperCollins UK|isbn= 0007405146|year=2010[/tpl]
Canada Geese were introduced as a game bird into New Zealand in 1905. They have become a problem in some areas by fouling pastures and damaging crops. They were protected under the Wildlife Act 1953 and the population was managed by Fish and Game New Zealand who culled excessive bird numbers. In 2011 the government removed the protection status, allowing anyone to kill the birds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beehive.govt.nz/release/canada-geese-protection-status-changed|title=Canada geese protection status changed|date=17 March 2011|work=Beehive |publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=24 March 2011[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Like most geese, the Canada Goose is naturally migratory with the wintering range being most of the United States. The calls overhead from large groups of Canada Geese flying in V-shaped formation signal the transitions into spring and autumn. In some areas, migration routes have changed due to changes in habitat and food sources. In mild climates from California to the Great Lakes, some of the population has become non-migratory due to adequate winter food supply and a lack of former predators.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
Males exhibit agonistic behaviour both on and off breeding and nesting grounds. This behavior rarely involves interspecific killing. One documented case involved a male defending its nest from a Brant Goose that wandered into the area, the following attack lasted for one hour until the death of the Brant. The cause of death was suffocation or drowning in mud as a direct result of the Canada Goose's pecking the head of the Brant into the mud. Researchers attributed it to high hormone levels and the Brant's inability to leave the nesting area.[tpl]cite journal|last=Krauss|first=David A.|first2=Issa |last2=Salame|title=Interspecific Killing of a Branta bernicla (Brant) by a Male Branta canadensis (Canada Goose)|journal=Northeastern Naturalist|publisher=Northeastern Naturalist Humboldt Field Research Institute|year= 2012|accessdate= August 2, 2013 |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2884011711.html|doi=10.1656/045.019.0415|volume=19|issue=4|pages=701[/tpl]

===Diet===

Canada Geese are primarily herbivores,[tpl]cite book |year=2002|contribution= Canada Goose (Branta canadensis)|title= The Birds of North America|editor=Poole, A.|location= Ithaca|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology|doi=|author=Mowbray, Thomas B.; Ely, Craig R.; Sedinger, James S. and Trost, Robert E.|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/682/articles/introduction[/tpl] although they sometimes eat small insects and fish.[tpl]cite web|last=Angus|first= Wilson|title=Identification and range of subspecies within the Canada and Cackling Goose Complex (Branta canadensis & B. hutchinsii)|url=http://www.oceanwanderers.com/CAGO.Subspecies.html[/tpl] Their diet includes green vegetation and grains. The Canada Goose eats a variety of grasses when on land. It feeds by grasping a blade of grass with the bill, then tearing it with a jerk of the head. The Canada Goose also eats beans and grains such as wheat, rice, and corn when they are available. In the water, it feeds from silt at the bottom of the body of water. It also feeds on aquatic plants, such as seaweeds. In urban areas, they are also known to pick food out of garbage bins.

===Reproduction===

During the second year of their lives, Canada Geese find a mate. They are monogamous, and most couples stay together all of their lives. If one dies, the other may find a new mate. The female lays from 2–9 eggs with an average of five and both parents protect the nest while the eggs incubate, but the female spends more time at the nest than the male.
Its nest is usually located in an elevated area near water such as streams, lakes, ponds and sometimes on a beaver lodge. Its eggs are laid in a shallow depression lined with plant material and down.
The incubation period, in which the female incubates while the male remains nearby, lasts for 24–28 days after laying. As the annual summer molt also takes place during the breeding season, the adults lose their flight feathers for 20–40 days, regaining flight at about the same time as their goslings start to fly.[tpl]Cite book |last=Johnsgard |first=Paul A. |title=Ducks, Geese, and Swans of the World |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2010 |origyear=1978 |edition=revised online |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biosciducksgeeseswans/5/ |page=79[/tpl]
As soon as the goslings hatch they are immediately capable of walking, swimming and finding their own food (a diet similar to the adult geese). Parents are often seen leading their goslings in a line, usually with one adult at the front, and the other at the back. While protecting their goslings, parents often violently chase away nearby creatures, from small blackbirds to lone humans that approach, after warning them by giving off a hissing sound and will then attack with bites and slaps of the wings if the threat does not retreat or has seized a gosling. Most of the species that prey on eggs will also take a gosling. Although parents are hostile to unfamiliar geese, they may form groups of a number of goslings and a few adults, called crèches.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
The offspring enter the fledging stage any time from 6 to 9 weeks of age. They do not leave their parents until after the spring migration, when they return to their birthplace.

===Migration===

Canada Geese are known for their seasonal migrations. Most Canada Geese have staging or resting areas where they join up with others. Their autumn migration can be seen from September to the beginning of November.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The early migrants have a tendency to spend less time at rest stops and go through the migration much faster. The later birds usually spend more time at rest stops.
Canada Geese fly in a distinctive V-shaped flight formation, with an altitude of 1 km (3,000 feet) for migration flight. The maximum flight ceiling of Canada Geese is unknown, but they have been reported at 9 km (29,000 feet).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fws.gov/blackwater/canadageese.html | title=Canada Geese at Blackwater | publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service | accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl]
Flying in the V formation has been the subject of study by researchers. The front position is rotated since flying in front consumes the most energy. Canada Geese leave the winter grounds more quickly than the summer grounds. Elevated thyroid hormones, such as T3 and T4, have been measured in geese just after a big migration. This is believed because of the long days of flying in migration the thyroid gland sends out more T4 which will help the body cope with the longer journey. The increased T4 levels are also associated with increased muscle mass (hypertrophy) of the breast muscle, also because of the longer time spent flying. It is believed that the body sends out more T4 to help the goose's body with this long task by speeding up the metabolism and temperature at which the body works.[tpl]cite journal |first=T.

===Habitat===

Salinity plays a role in the growth and development of goslings. Moderate to high salinity concentrations without fresh water results in slower development, growth and saline-induced mortality. Goslings are susceptible to saline-induced mortality before their nasal salt glands become functional, with the majority occurring before the sixth day of life.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stolley|first=Doris|first2=John|last2= Bissonette|first3= John |last3=Kadlec|title=Effects of saline environments on the survival of wild goslings (Branta canadensis)|journal= The American Midland Naturalist|year=1999|accessdate=August 2, 2013|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-43219961.html|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(1999)1420181:EOSEOT2.0.CO;2|volume=142|pages=181[/tpl]

===Disease===

Canada Geese are susceptible to avian bird flus, such as H5N1. A study was carried out using the HPAI virus, a H5N1 virus, the results found that the geese are susceptible to the virus and would prove useful for monitoring the spread of the virus, attributed to the high mortality of the infected birds. The study found that prior exposure to other viruses may result in some resistance to H5N1.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pasick|first=John|first2=Yohannes |last2=Berhane|first3= Carissa|last3= Embury-Hyatt|first4= John |last4=Copps|first5= Helen |last5=Kehler|first6=Katherine|last6= Handel|first7=Shawn |last7=Babiuk|first8=Kathleen|last8= Hooper-McGrevy|first9= Yan|last9= Li|first10=Quynh|last10= Le|first11= Song |last11=Phuong|title=Susceptibility of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1)|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|publisher=U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases|year=2007|accessdate= August 2, 2013|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172746394.html|doi=10.3201/eid1312.070502|volume=13|issue=12|pages=1821–7|pmid=18258030|pmc=2876756[/tpl]

==Relationship with humans==

In North America, non-migratory Canada Goose populations have been on the rise. The species is frequently found on golf courses, parking lots and urban parks, which would have previously hosted only migratory geese on rare occasions. Owing to its adaptability to human-altered areas, it has become the most common waterfowl species in North America. In many areas, non-migratory Canada Geese are now regarded as pests by humans. They are suspected of being a cause of an increase in high fecal coliforms at beaches.http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_1105191_0_0_18/State%20Parks%20Again%20Offering%20Early%20Canada%20Goose%20Hunting.pdf An extended hunting season, deploying noise makers, and hazing by dogs have been used in an attempt to disrupt suspect flocks.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Woodruff | first =Roger A.| last2 = Green| first2 = Jeffrey S. | title = Livestock Herding Dogs: A Unique Application for Wildlife Damage Management | journal = Great Plains Wildlife Damage Control Workshop Proceedings| publisher = Noble Foundation| location = Ardmore, Oklahoma | volume = 12 | pages = 43–45 | year = 1995[/tpl]
Since 1999, The United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services agency has been engaged in lethal culls of Canada Geese primarily in urban or densely populated areas. The agency responds to municipalities or private land owners, such as golf courses, who find the geese obtrusive or object to their waste.Board of Park Commissioners (Seattle) Meeting Minutes July 12, 2001 Addling goose eggs and destroying nests are promoted as humane population control methods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.restontimes.com/news/2008/may/06/goose-egg-addling-stirs-concern-reston/|title=Goose egg addling stirs concern in Reston|date=May 6, 2008 |author =Gregg MacDonald, Fairfax County Times|accessdate=2009-06-10[/tpl]
Geese have a tendency to attack humans when they feel themselves or their goslings to be threatened. First the geese will stand erect, spread their wings and produce a hissing sound. Next, the geese will charge. They may then bite or attack with their wings.Division of Wildlife (Ohio) Goose Attacks
Canada Geese have been implicated in a number of bird strikes by aircraft. Their large size and tendency to fly in flocks may exacerbate their impact.
