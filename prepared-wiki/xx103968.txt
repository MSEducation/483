==Early years==

Jeff's interest in music was sparked at a young age, inspired by records his parents played at home his early influences were AC/DC, Bob Dylan, Leo Kottke, Ry Cooder, Roy Buchanan and Neil Young. After playing the clarinet for six years he took up the guitar after discovering his older sister's discarded nylon string acoustic. He played electric guitar in various local bands in his hometown of Geelong before forming his own band and moving to Sydney in 1990 with the aim of playing his own compositions.

==Solo career==

In 1992 Jeff split his band up and concentrated on playing solo shows. For the next 2 years he wrote the songs that ended up on his first independently released CD "Ravenswood".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.musicians.asn.au/ezine/archives/issue17/index.html |title=The Dues Interview 'Jeff Lang Lays It On The Line' |publisher=Musicians.asn.au |date=23 August 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl] Since that debut he has gone on to become known as a prolific songwriter, releasing 12 studio albums in the following 16 years in addition to numerous Live recordings. 7 of these albums have been nominated for the ARIA award for Best Blues and Roots Album, with his collaboration with Bob Brozman, "Rolling Through This World" winning the Award in 2002.

==Equipment==

Jeff Lang primarily plays acoustic guitars, although he has an unorthodox way of amplifying them, running a combination of a built-in microphone and a Sunrise magnetic pick-up together for his clean acoustic sound, whilst also running the output of the Sunrise pick-up through various effects through an electric guitar amplifier allowing him to obtain both acoustic and distorted electric guitar tones from the same guitar.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.jefflang.com.au/equipment.php |title=Jeff Lang Website - Equipment Page |publisher=Jefflang.com.au |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl] This approach has been hugely influential in the Australian scene, particularly after well-known guitarist John Butler was inspired by Jeff's playing and sound to pursue a very similar setup.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/john-butler-trio/oct-07/32089 |title=John Butler Trio, Barry Cleveland |publisher=Guitarplayer.com |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2010/Apr/Interview_John_Butler_Blending_Styles_Gear.aspx?Page=2 |title=Interview: John Butler - Blending Styles & Gear |publisher=Premier Guitar |date= |accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl]
