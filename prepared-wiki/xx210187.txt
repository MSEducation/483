==Style==

Allmusic reviewer Rick Anderson called the song "charmingly goofy. Like That' acts as the distilled essence of the band's trademark approach: slightly whimsical lyrics, a shout-along chorus, and a song that somehow adds up to more than the sum of its parts."[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r1335326|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Hawk Nelson Is My Friend Review |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-08-02 |author=Rick Anderson[/tpl]

==Music video==

In the music video for "Friend Like That", the band members are in a cartoon world, populated by characters and scenery also seen on the cover art and "board game" in the special-edition version of the album Hawk Nelson Is My Friend. Lead singer Jason Dunn is singing as he runs, while the others wait patiently for him to reach the group. He finally comes and they drive off. After stopping off, they enter a building and find themselves playing a live concert on stage.
