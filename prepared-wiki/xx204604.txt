The Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a Roman Catholic female religious congregation, founded in 1880 by Mother Francis Xavier Cabrini.
The aim of the institute is to spread devotion to the Heart of Jesus by means of the practice of spiritual and corporal works of mercy. The sisters conduct homes for the aged and the sick, orphanages, industrial schools, sewing classes; they visit hospitals and prisons, and give religious instruction in their convents, which are open to women desirous of making retreats. Its general mother house is at Rome. 

==History==

The congregation spread rapidly in Europe and America. In 1899, at the suggestion of Pope Leo XIII, the sisters came to New York, and opened convents in the archdioceses of Chicago, Denver, Newark, Seattle, and Los Angeles and the dioceses of Brooklyn and Scranton.
The sisters purchased the former Woodcrest estate in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania in 1953.  Cabrini College opened on the estate in September 1957.[tpl]cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database[/tpl] Note: This includes [tpl]cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H079246_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Woodcrest| accessdate = 2012-01-06| author =Martha W.
