Smithfield ham is a specific form of the country ham, a product which originated in the town of Smithfield in Isle of Wight County in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, USA. 

==Legal definition==

A 1926 Statute of Virginia (passed by the Virginia General Assembly) first regulated the usage of the term "Smithfield Ham" by stating:
The peanut feed stipulation was removed in 1966.  The present statute specifies both process and method as follows: LIS > Code of Virginia > 3.2-5419
The specificity of the statute ensures that the product is not pre-processed anywhere else, and only finished in Virginia, or the town of Smithfield.  The locality of the curing process also ensures a uniformity in flavor, since during the curing and aging process the local environment's air quality, humidity, and the local varieties of airborne mold spores (whose enzymes are produced as a byproduct of growth on the ham's rind) produce a unique and repeatable flavor.

==Commercial history==

The first record of the commercial sale of "Smithfield Ham" is a receipt for the sale of these cured hams to Ellerston and John Perot on the Dutch Caribbean Island of St Eustatius, dating from 1779."Images of America: Smithfield: Ham Capitol of the World", excerpt from Google Books
