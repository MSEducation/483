As well as educating pupils from Eltham, the school also attracts pupils from nearby Falconwood. 
Crown Woods College reopened in new Â£50million buildings designed by Nicholas Hare Architects in 2011, and is structured into four 'home schools', all of which are housed in separate buildings.

Three of the schools are for pupils aged 11 to 16 and pupils are allocated to the schools based on ability, skills and interests. The fourth school is a sixth form centre for 16 to 18 year old students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crownwoods.org.uk/cwc_principal.aspx |title=Crown Woods College - Our community, your success |publisher=Crownwoods.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21009540 |title=BBC News - Inside the three parts of Crown Woods College |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl]
