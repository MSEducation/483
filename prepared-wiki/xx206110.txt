The Stratford Power Station is a 575 MW power station located east of Stratford, Taranaki, New Zealand.  It comprises one combined cycle unit and two open cycle gas turbine units and is owned and operated by Contact Energy.

==History==

In June 1976, the construction of a 200MW power station was completed on the Stratford Power Station site.Stratford Power Station, brochure by New Zealand Electricity, 1981  This comprised four 50MW units, each a Pratt and Whitney TwinPak of two FT4 gas turbines.  The FT4 engine is the stationary version of the Pratt & Whitney JT4.  This plant was fired on natural gas. 
The four 50MW units were decommissioned and removed in 2001.
The FT4 units were owned and operated (in turn) by NZED, NZE, ECNZ and Contact Energy.

==Greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of climate change==

In 1993, the Environment Minister Simon Upton established a board of inquiry under the Resource Management Act to hear the application for a resource consent for Electricity Corporation of New Zealand's (ECNZ) proposed 400 megawatt Stratford power station in Taranaki.
In February 1995, the board of inquiry concluded that the station’s operation would significantly increase New Zealand’s emissions of carbon dioxide and make it more difficult for the Government to meet its obligation to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels as committed to under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The board of inquiry recommended that ECNZ must establish a carbon sink "sufficient to eventually store in perpetuity the equivalent quantity of carbon emitted from the site over the term of the permit".
In March 1995, the Environment Minister Simon Upton approved the expansion of the station to 400-megawatts on the condition that forests were planted to create a carbon sink or the effect of emissions was reduced by greater efficiency elsewhere.
In June 2003, a hearing committee of the TRC granted a variation to delete the consent conditions requiring mitigation of CO2 emissions.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.trc.govt.nz/assets/Publications/technical-reports/electricity-generation-compliance-monitoring-reports/871420w.pdf| title=Stratford Power Station (TCCP & SPP) Monitoring Programme Annual Report| date=2010| publisher=TRC[/tpl]

==Combined Cycle Plant==

The plant consists of one 360 MW combined cycle unit, based on a GT26 gas turbine in single shaft configuration.  Cooling is achieved with a mechanical draft cooling tower, using water from the Patea River.  This plant is known as TCC (Taranaki Combined Cycle). Fletcher Construction started construction in 1996 and it was commissioned in 1998.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.fletcherconstruction.co.nz/projects.php?action=search&id=161| title=Stratford Power Station| work=Fletcher Construction| accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl]  It was purchased by Contact Energy in 2003.

==Peaker plant==

Over 2009 and 2010, a 200 MW of new generation was built on the site, comprising two LMS100 gas turbine units in open cycle configuration. This is used for peaking duty, to complement hydro and wind generation, and was officially opened by Prime Minister John Key on 31 May 2011.
