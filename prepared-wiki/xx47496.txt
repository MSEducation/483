Lynne Mary Jones (born 26 April 1951) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Selly Oak from 1992 until the dissolution of parliament in April 2010.

==Early life==

Born in Birmingham, Lynne Jones went to the localhttp://www.poptel.org.uk/lynne.jones/grammar.htm Education Bartley Green Girls' Grammar School (now the comprehensive Hillcrest School) on Stonehouse Lane in Woodgate near Woodgate Valley Country Park, off the B4121. She studied Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham, eventually earning her Ph.D. in 1979. She also has a post-graduate Diploma in Housing Studies from Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University). She worked in research at the University of Birmingham from 1972-86. She was a housing association manager from 1987-92. She joined the Labour Party in 1974.
She has worked in both science and housing, and was a Councillor on Birmingham City Council representing Kings Norton ward from 1980-94.

===Research interests===

She first studied stimulus-response coupling in the rat parotid gland and at alpha adrenergic receptors. This led to a discovery that there are cell-surface receptors that are stimulated by hormones and neurotransmitters controlled by changes of intracellular calcium ion levels. It also involves the conversion of inositol phospholipids in the cell membrane. She also worked on the process of agonist-stimulated incorporation of radioactive phosphate into inositol phospholipids.

==Parliamentary career==

She was elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election.
She was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and took part in almost all of the backbench rebellions against the Labour government. She wa also Chair of the Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism, and is a patron of Press for Change. 
From 1993-2001 she was on the Science and Technology Select Committee. During the 2005-10 parliament she was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee.

===Leadership challenge===

In February 2006 she announced her intention to stand against Gordon Brown in the Labour Party leadership contest expected to follow Prime Minister Tony Blair's resignation if nobody else did, so that Brown could not simply be "crowned". Subsequently, Socialist Campaign Group Chair John McDonnell did so instead, but failed to gain enough nominations from MPs and Brown was unopposed.

===Retirement===

Following boundary alterations in Birmingham, which reduce its parliamentary representation from eleven to ten seats, Jones was expected to apply for selection to the redrawn Selly Oak constituency which contains wards from both the current Selly Oak and Hall Green constituencies. However, in January 2007 Jones announced her intention to stand down at the 2010 general election.  Jones supported the Respect candidate Salma Yaqoob who came second in the constituency.

==Personal life==

She is married, and has two sons (including one born in January 1990). In November 2009, she announced she is having treatment for cancer. Her husband has been treated for prostate cancer. She married Chris Kirk in April 1994 in Lambeth. He is Chief Executive of the Biochemical Society. She is a keen cyclist.
