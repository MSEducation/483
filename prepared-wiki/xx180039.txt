==History==

The Afro-Ecuadorian village of Piquiucho in northern Ecuador's Valle del Chota is a three-hour drive from Quito, the nation's capital.  It is in one of Ecuadorâ€™s poorest regions.[tpl]cite news | date=2007-01-27 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6302665.stm | title=Ecuadorean footballer rebuilds village | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2007-02-16[/tpl]  The village is not on official maps, and services to its inhabitants have been non-existent.  The plight of its people only became known following the selection of seven of the villages' sons to represent Ecuador's eleven member team in the World Cup in 2002 and 2006.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.afropresencia.com/id14.html | title=Ulises de la Cruz: remembering Piquiucho | publisher=afropresencia.com | accessdate=2008-02-04[/tpl]
