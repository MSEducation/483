All Saints Anglican Church is a continuing Anglican church in Raleigh, North Carolina. The church is independent of the Episcopal Church USA and all other churches of the Anglican Communion and under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but is part of the Anglican Church in America. All Saints does not have its own facilities, so the congregation holds services at the Jenkins Memorial United Methodist Church. http://www.allsaintsraleigh.com/aboutus.dsp
