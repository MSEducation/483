Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([tpl]myx|4863[/tpl]), DBA TM, is the largest integrated solutions[tpl]clarify|date=November 2011[/tpl] provider in Malaysia, and one of Asia's leading communications companies, with a market capitalisation of RM13.9 billion and a workforce of 26,629 employees. Established as the Telecommunications Department of Malaya in 1946, it was privatised in 1987, and listed on Bursa Malaysia in 1990. Subsequent growth led to a demerger in 2008 of TM's mobile and fixed services, allowing the company to focus more intently on its core businesses of Internet and multimedia, data and fixed-line services.http://www.tm.com.my/ap/about/investor/Documents/TM_Eng_2010.pdf
