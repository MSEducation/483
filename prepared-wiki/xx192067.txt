A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.
A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month.[tpl]cite book | last = Schneider | first = Gary | title = Electronic Commerce | publisher = Course Technology | location = Cambridge | year = 2010 | isbn = 0-538-46924-2 | page=497[/tpl]  In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.
The size of most credit cards is [tpl]Fraction|3|3|8[/tpl] × [tpl]Fraction|2|1|8[/tpl] in (85.60 × 53.98 mm),The metric dimensions are "soft metric", derived from the original standard inch dimensions. conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have an embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1.

==History==

===The Credit Cards in Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward===

The concept of using a card for purchases was described in 1887 by Edward Bellamy in his utopian novel Looking Backward.  Bellamy used the term credit card eleven times in this novel, although this referred to a card for spending a citizen's dividend from the government, rather than borrowing.(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and 3 times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, Equality Roughly similar in functions to the current day U.S. Social Security Cards with their Social Security numbers.

===Charge coins, medals, and so on===

Charge coins and other similar items were used in the late 1800s to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with materials made out of celluloid (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, and other type of whitish metals.Pre-plastic credit: Charge plates, coins, celluloids, from CreditCards.com Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring like a regular key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who have charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.
The charge coin offered a simple and fast way to copy a charge account number to the sales slip, by imprinting a sales slip with an imprint of the charge coin. This quickened the process of copying, that previously was done by handwriting. It also reduced the amount of errors during copying, by having a standardised form of numbers on the sales slip, instead of various kind of handwriting style.Charge Coins Come to Retro Boston, from Shopping Days In Retro Boston
Because the customer name is not on the charge coin, almost any person can use it. This sometimes lead to a case of mistaken identity, either accidentally or intentionally. Either acting on behalf of the charge account owner or out of malice to defraud both the charge account owner and the merchant. Beginning from the 1930s and so on, merchants started to move from charge coins to the newer Charga-Plate.Departement Store Charge Cards, from the Department Store Museum

===Charge cards from Western Union, oil companies, and other companies===

Western Union begun issuing charge cards to its frequent customers in 1921. The charge cards from this time were printed on paper card stock. In 1938, several companies started to accept each other's cards. In the 1940s, oil companies in the United States used them to sell fuel and other oil based products to a growing number of automobile owners.

===The Charga-Plate===

The Charga-Plate, developed in 1928, was an early predecessor to the credit card and used in the U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s.  It was a 2½ in × 1¼ in rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state.  It held a small paper card on its back for a signature.  In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the imprinter, with a paper "charge slip" positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the imprinter pressing an inked ribbon against the charge slip.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Credit_Card_Imprinter |title=Credit card imprinter |publisher=Cultureandcommunication.org |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co.  Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.

===The Air Travel Card===

In 1934, American Airlines and the Air Transport Association simplified the process even more with the advent of the Air Travel Card.[tpl]cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=June 1953|page=11[/tpl]  They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern UATP cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could "buy now, and pay later" for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines.  By the 1940s, all of the major domestic airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines.  By 1941 about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air. In October 1948, the Air Travel Card became the first inter-nationally valid charge card within all members of the International Air Transport Association.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.creditcardprocessingspace.com/history-of-the-credit-card/ |title=History Of The Credit Card |publisher=www.creditcardprocessingspace.com |accessdate=2013-02-14[/tpl]

===Early general purpose charge cards:the Diners Club, Carte Blanche, and American Express===

The concept of customers paying different merchants using the same card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara, founders of Diners Club, to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first 'general purpose' charge card and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement.  That was followed by Carte Blanche and in 1958 by American Express which created a worldwide credit card network (although these were initially charge cards that later on acquired credit card features).

===BankAmericard and Master Charge, the early forms of Visa and MasterCard===

Until 1958, no one had a stable revolving credit financial system by a third-party bank; that was generally accepted by a large number of merchants, as opposed to merchant-issued revolving cards accepted by only a few merchants. A dozen attempts by small American banks had been attempted, but didn't last long. In September 1958, Bank of America launched the BankAmericard in Fresno, California. BankAmericard became the first successful recognizably modern credit card and with its overseas affiliates, eventually evolved into the Visa system. In 1966, the ancestor of MasterCard was born when a group of banks established Master Charge to compete with BankAmericard; it received a significant boost when Citibank merged its own Everything Card (launched in 1967) into Master Charge in 1969.
Early credit cards in the U.S., of which BankAmericard was the most prominent example, were mass-produced and mass mailed unsolicited to bank customers who were thought to be good credit risks. But, "They have been mailed off to unemployables, drunks, narcotics addicts and to compulsive debtors, a process President Johnson's Special Assistant Betty Furness found very like 'giving sugar to diabetics'."Paul O'Neill, "A Little Gift from Your Friendly Banker", LIFE, April 27, 1970 These mass mailings were known as "drops" in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population before the law came into effect. After 1970, only credit card applications could be sent unsolicited in mass mailings.

===The development of credit cards outside North America===

The fractured nature of the U.S. banking system under the Glass–Steagall Act meant that credit cards became an effective way for those who were traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as issued by banks and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.
In 1966, Barclaycard in the UK launched the first credit card outside of the U.S.
Although credit cards reached very high adoption levels in the US, Canada and the UK in the mid twentieth century, many cultures were more cash-oriented, or developed alternative forms of cash-less payments, such as Carte bleue or the Eurocard (Germany, France, Switzerland, and others). In these places, adoption of credit cards was initially much slower. Because of strict regulations regarding banking system overdrafts, some countries, France in particular, were much faster to develop and adopt chip-based credit cards which are now seen as major anti-fraud credit devices. Debit cards and online banking (using either ATMs or PCs) are used more widely than credit cards in some countries. It took until the 1990s to reach anything like the percentage market-penetration levels achieved in the US, Canada, or UK. In some countries, acceptance still remains low as the use of a credit card system depends on the banking system of each country. While in others, a country sometimes had to develop its own credit card network, e.g. UK's Barclaycard and Australia's Bankcard. Japan remains a very cash oriented society, with credit card adoption being limited mainly toward the largest of merchants; although stored value cards (such as telephone cards) are used as alternative currencies, with the trend is toward RFIDs based systems inside cards, cellphones, and other objects.

===Vintage, old, and unique credit cards as collectibles===

The design of the credit card itself has become a major selling point in recent years. The value of the card to the issuer is often related to the customer's usage of the card, or to the customer's financial worth. This has led to the rise of Co-Brand and Affinity cards, where the card design is related to the "affinity" (a university or professional society, for example) leading to higher card usage. In most cases a percentage of the value of the card is returned to the affinity group.
A growing field of numismatics (study of money), or more specifically exonumia (study of money-like objects), credit card collectors seek to collect various embodiments of credit from the now familiar plastic cards to older paper merchant cards, and even metal tokens that were accepted as merchant credit cards.  Early credit cards were made of celluloid plastic, then metal and fiber, then paper, and are now mostly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic.

==How credit cards work==

Credit cards are issued by a credit card issuer, such as a bank or credit union, after an account has been approved by the credit provider, after which cardholders can use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. Merchants often advertise which cards they accept by displaying acceptance marks – generally derived from logos – or may communicate this orally, as in "We take (brands X, Y, and Z)" or "We don't take credit cards".
When a purchase is made, the credit card user agrees to pay the card issuer.  The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a personal identification number (PIN).  Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).
Electronic verification systems allow merchants to verify in a few seconds that the card is valid and the credit card customer has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase.  The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or point-of-sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank.  Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is called Chip and PIN in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.
For card not present transactions where the card is not shown (e.g., e-commerce, mail order, and telephone sales), merchants additionally verify that the customer is in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the security code printed on the back of the card, date of expiry, and billing address.
Each month, the credit card user is sent a statement indicating the purchases undertaken with the card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed.  In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see [tpl]USC|15|1643[/tpl], which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50).  The Fair Credit Billing Act gives details of the US regulations.  The cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount up to the entire amount owed which may be greater than the amount billed.  The credit issuer charges interest on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the credit card user fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a "late fee" and/or other penalties on the user.  To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the user's bank accounts, thus avoiding such penalties altogether as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.
Many banks now also offer the option of electronic statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the cardholder via the issuer's online banking website. Notification of the availability of a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the cardholder may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the cardholder may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times over.

===Advertising, solicitation, application and approval===

Credit card advertising regulations in the US include the Schumer box disclosure requirements.  A large fraction of junk mail consists of credit card offers created from lists provided by the major credit reporting agencies. In the United States, the three major US credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion and Experian) allow consumers to opt out from related credit card solicitation offers via its Opt Out Pre Screen program.

===Interest charges===

Credit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.
For example, if a user had a $1,000 transaction and repaid it in full within this grace period, there would be no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized on the back of the monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is APR/100 x ADB/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB) divided by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as RRFC or residual retail finance charge. Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).
The credit card may simply serve as a form of revolving credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.

===Benefits to customers===

The main benefit to each customer is convenience. Compared to debit cards and checks, a credit card allows small short-term loans to be quickly made to a customer who need not calculate a balance remaining before every transaction, provided the total charges do not exceed the maximum credit line for the card.
Different countries offer different levels of protection. In the UK, for example, the bank is jointly liable with the merchant for purchases of defective products over £100.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theukcardsassociation.org.uk/faqs/index.asp |title=FAQs |publisher=UK Cards Association |accessdate=2012-09-19[/tpl]
Many credit cards offer rewards and benefits packages, such as enhanced product warranties at no cost, free loss/damage coverage on new purchases, various insurance protections, for example, rental car insurance, common carrier accident protection, and travel medical insurance. Credit cards can also offer reward points which may be redeemed for cash, products, or airline tickets. Research has examined whether competition among card networks may potentially make payment rewards too generous, causing higher prices among merchants, thus actually deteriorating social welfare and its distribution, a situation potentially warranting public policy interventions.Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Economics of Payment Card Fee Structure: What Drives Payment Card Rewards?, March 2009

====Comparison of credit card benefits====

The table below contains a list of benefits offered in the United States for consumer credit cards. Benefits may vary in other countries or business credit cards.

===Detriments to customers===

====High interest and bankruptcy====

Low introductory credit card rates are limited to a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged.  As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed.[tpl]cite web|author=CreditCards.com |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/default-penalty-rates-what-they-are-how-to-avoid-1276.php |title=Credit card penalty rates can top 30 percent; how to avoid them |publisher=Creditcards.com |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] In other cases a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This can lead to a snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates.
Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit.
First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate,[tpl]cite web|last=Prater |first=Connie |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2009/12/18/issuer-rate-credit-card-defends-product/ |title=Issuer of 79.9% interest rate credit card defends its product |publisher=FoxBusiness.com |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] however they discontinued this card February 2011 because of persistent defaults.[tpl]cite web|last=Didier |first=Paul |url=http://www.debt800.com/worst-credit-card/ |title=The worst credit card in America is dead! |publisher=Debt800.com |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl]
Complex fee structures in the credit card industry limit customers' ability to comparison shop, help ensure that the industry is not price-competitive and help maximize industry profits.Michael Simkovic, "The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices" Berkeley Business Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009

====Inflated pricing for all consumers====

Merchants that accept credit cards must pay interchange fees and discount fees on all credit-card transactions.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/05/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/05visa.html?em=&pagewanted=all |quote=The fees, roughly 1 to 3 percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder’s bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa cards. |work=New York Times |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-06 | first=Andrew | last=Martin[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/28/news/credit_card_interchange/ | work=CNN | title=Hidden credit card fees are costing you | date=2008-07-31 | accessdate=2010-04-30 | first=Jessica | last=Dickler[/tpl] In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum transaction amount (no longer prohibited in the United States).[tpl]cite web|last=Carr |first=Ted |url=http://blog.visa.com/2010/09/02/minimizing-confusion-over-minimums/ |title=Minimizing Confusion Over Minimums |publisher=Blog.visa.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] The result is that merchants may charge all customers (including those who do not use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions. In the United States in 2008 credit card companies collected a total of $48 billion in interchange fees, or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% per transaction. Research shows that a substantial fraction of consumers (about 40 percent) choose a sub-optimal credit card agreement, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Do Consumers Choose the Right Credit Contracts?, October 2006

====Weakens self regulation====

Several studies have shown that consumers are likely to spend more money when they pay by credit card. Researchers suggest that when people pay using credit cards, they do not experience the abstract pain of payment.[tpl]cite web|author=Drazen Prelec and George Loewenstein |url=http://mktsci.journal.informs.org/content/17/1/4 |title=The Red and the Black: Mental Accounting of Savings and Debt |publisher=Mktsci.journal.informs.org |date=1998-12-21 |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] Furthermore, researchers have found that using credit cards can increase consumption of unhealthy food.[tpl]cite news| url=http://moneyland.time.com/2011/07/07/finally-money-advice-that-will-make-you-skinnier/ | work=Time | date=2011-07-07[/tpl]

===Grace period===

A credit card's grace period is the time the customer has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days depending on the type of credit card and the issuing bank.  Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.
Usually, if a customer is late paying the balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred depend on the grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period if there is any outstanding balance from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions).  However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.

===Benefits to merchants===

For merchants, a credit card transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as cheques, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.
Prior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending credit.  That task is now performed by the banks which assume the credit risk.  Credit cards can also aid in securing a sale, especially if the customer does not have enough cash on his or her person or checking account.  Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and/or services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in his or her pocket and the immediate state of his or her bank balance. Much of merchants' marketing is based on this immediacy.
For each purchase, the bank charges the merchant a commission (discount fee) for this service and there may be a certain delay before the agreed payment is received by the merchant.  The commission is often a percentage of the transaction amount, plus a fixed fee (interchange rate).

===Costs to merchants===

Merchants are charged several fees for accepting credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a commission of around 1 to 4 percent of the value of each transaction paid for by credit card.[ref]
