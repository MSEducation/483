[[Abel equation]]

CATEGORIES: Niels Henrik Abel, Functional equations

The Abel equation, named after Niels Henrik Abel, is special case of functional equations which can be written in the form
or
and controls  the iteration of [tpl]mvar|f[/tpl].

==Equivalence==

These equations are equivalent. Assuming that [tpl]mvar|α[/tpl] is an invertible function, the second equation can be written as
Taking  [tpl]math|x [tpl]=[/tpl]  α−1(y)[/tpl], the equation can be written as
For a function [tpl]math|f(x)[/tpl]  assumed to be known, the task is to  solve the functional equation for the  function [tpl]math|α−1[/tpl], possibly satisfying additional requirements, such as [tpl]math|α−1(0) [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl].
The change of variables [tpl]math|sα(x) [tpl]=[/tpl]  Ψ(x)[/tpl], for a real parameter [tpl]mvar|s[/tpl], brings Abel's equation into the celebrated Schröder's equation, [tpl]math|Ψ(f(x)) [tpl]=[/tpl] s Ψ(x)[/tpl] .
The further change [tpl]math|F(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] exp(sα(x))[/tpl]  into Böttcher's equation,  [tpl]math|F(f(x)) [tpl]=[/tpl] F(x)s[/tpl].

==History==

Initially, the equation in the more general form

was reported. Then it happens that even in the case of single variable, the equation is not trivial, and requires special analysis
[ref]
 Studied is the Abel functional equation α(f(x))=α(x)+1[/ref]
In the case of linear transfer function, the solution can be expressed in compact form

==Special cases==

The equation of tetration is a special case of Abel's equation, with [tpl]math|f [tpl]=[/tpl] exp[/tpl]. 
In the case of an integer argument, the equation encodes  a recurrent procedure, e.g.,
and so on,
Fatou coordinates represent solutions of Abel's equation, describing local dynamics of discrete dynamical system near a parabolic fixed point.Dudko, Artem (2012). Dynamics of holomorphic maps: Resurgence of Fatou coordinates, and Poly-time computability of Julia sets Ph.D. Thesis
