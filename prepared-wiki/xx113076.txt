"Ela Ela (Come Baby)" (Greek: Ελα Ελα) was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, performed in English by Constantinos Christoforou.
As Cyprus had finished in the top ten in the previous year's Contest, the song was already qualified for the final. It was thus performed ninth on the night (following Albania's Ledina Çelo with "Tomorrow I Go" and preceding Spain's Son de Sol with "Brujería"). At the close of voting, it had received 46 points, placing 18th in a field of 24 and returning Cyprus to the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.
The song is an up-tempo number, with Christoforou urging his lover to "come baby, come baby".
Christoforou had previously appeared at the 1996 Contest singing "Mono Yia Mas" solo, as well as taking part as a member of One with "Gimme" at the 2002 Contest. With this performance, he became the most prolific contestant to appear purely for Cyprus (Anna Vissi having two appearances for Greece in addition to her sole appearance for Cyprus. Additionally, the performance represented the third "leg" in the rare sequence of a solo performance, followed by one as a group member and followed again by a solo performance.
The studio version of the song features prominent backing vocals by Elena Patroklou who was also featured in the music video. However, she withdrew due to personal reasons, and the live performance at the Eurovision Song Contest therefore featured Elina Constantopoulou instead. Ironically, both women had previously taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest; Elena Patroklou for Cyprus in 1991 and Elina Constantopoulou for Greece in 1995.
It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2006 Contest by Annette Artani with "Why Angels Cry".
