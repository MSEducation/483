==History==

Elim founded 77th Street in 1988. It was her first foray into the retail industry and has since established a firm footing in the street wear scene in Singapore. It started with a humble beginning at Far East Plaza level four with only a [tpl]convert|180|sqft|m2[/tpl] store. With the help of her sister, Ms Sulim Chew, who was in charge of sourcing trendy items from Britain, the second shop was opened three years later in 1991 at the same mall but on level three. Subsequently, about one new store was opened every one to two years.
77th Street’s first overseas expansion attempt was a joint venture store in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with a Malaysian partner in 1995. Seeing the potential for 77th Street to  franchise in Malaysia beyond KL, this joint venture was later sold to the partner, whomh has now renamed the company to another name. In 2003, 77th Street secured and signed an agreement for a [tpl]convert|400000|sqft|m2[/tpl] mall which was conceptualised into a youth shopping cum activity belt in the popular shopping district of Xidan, Beijing, China.EnterpriseOne - 77th Street Makes Inroads Overseas[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] The following year, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth & Sports (MCYS) and Senior Minister for State for Trade & Industry and National Development was the Guest of Honour for the official opening for 77th Street Plaza at the Xidan Cultural Centre.
