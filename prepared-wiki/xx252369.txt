Each year a fancy dress theme is announced; 2010 was the year of the fantastic and so festival goers dressed in fantasy outfits. The festival boasts its own radio station called Bestival Radio. The station was broadcast on-site, played music and kept listeners camping at the festival up-to-date on news and events over the weekend. The first acts were announced on 4 February.
