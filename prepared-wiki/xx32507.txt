Astrild (from Old Norse: "Love-fire") is an old Nordic name for Amor or Cupid. Astrild probably originated in the writings of the 17th-century Swedish poet Georg Stiernhielm, and has since been used in Nordic poetry, mainly during the Baroque and Rococo eras. Astrild does not appear in Norse mythology; even though the name was used before Stiernhielm as a synonym for the estrildid finches.
