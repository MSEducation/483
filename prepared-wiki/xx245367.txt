==The Institution==

It was organized on September 28, 1878 in New York City, with the first annual meeting taking place in January 1879. The Act of Incorporation was on June 17, 1884.
U.S. Army officers had felt the need for an institution similar to the Royal United Services Institute of Great Britain.
The design of the Military Service Institution contemplated professional unity and improvement by
correspondence, discussion and the reading and publication of Essays, the establishment of a military library and museum, and, generally, the promotion of the military interests of the United States. The Rooms or Headquarters were located at Governors Island, New York City.
The end of the institution was brought about by World War One.
