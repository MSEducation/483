Charlie Van Dyke (Born Charles Leo Steinle, on December 19, 1947) is a former radio disc jockey who is best known for the voice work he has done for numerous radio and television stations.
Originally from Dallas, Texas, Van Dyke was already working in major-market Top 40 radio, at local powerhouse KLIF, by the time he was 19. Bill Drake would bring Van Dyke to his stable of stations, first in morning drive at CKLW in Windsor/Detroit in 1968 and 1969, then to KFRC in San Francisco where he did morning drive in 1969 and 1970. Van Dyke later did mid-days, and eventually, mornings and was Program Director at Drake's "Flagship", KHJ in Los Angeles. Other stops included WLS Chicago, WDGY Minneapolis, and WRKO Boston.
Charlie Van Dyke's spoken word record "The Flag" charted nationally, peaking at #116 in the Record World survey, June-July 1976.
Throughout most of the 1980s, he was a frequent guest host on American Top 40. He sub-hosted on 31 shows in all, including the first regular episodes of 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.
In the 1990s, he worked in radio from his Phoenix, Arizona home, and from 1998 to 2000, Van Dyke succeeded the late Robert W. Morgan in morning drive at KRTH Los Angeles. He continues to work as a voice talent for various television and radio stations, including WAVY-TV in Hampton Roads, KPNX in Phoenix, WABC-TV in New York City, KABC-TV in Los Angeles, WPVI in Philadelphia, WTVJ in Miami, WBTV in Charlotte, and soon, WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach.
Van Dyke is not presently a disc jockey, but in 2011, his son Christopher "Brotha' Fred" Frederick joined KISS-FM in Chicago as a midday personality.
