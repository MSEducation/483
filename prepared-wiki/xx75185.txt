[[List of rivers of Germany]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Germany, Lists of rivers by country, Lists of landforms of Germany, Lists of rivers of Germany

This is a list of rivers, which are at least partially located in Germany. Rivers that flow into the sea are sorted geographically, along the coast. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea (the lower in the list, the more upstream). Some rivers (e.g. Meuse) do not flow through Germany themselves, but they are mentioned for having German tributaries. They are given in italics. For clarity, only rivers that are longer than 50 km (or have longer tributaries) are shown. An alphabetical list of all German rivers that have an article in Wikipedia is given at the end.
