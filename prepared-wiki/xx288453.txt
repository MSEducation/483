He began his editing career in 1915, cutting shorts at Inceville. A fire that started in his cutting room during the editing of the Thomas H. Ince film Civilization destroyed the entire studio, forcing him to move to Culver City. He eventually rose to prominence as a film editor there after being hired by Joseph M. Schenck to edit his films. He eventually got a job at MGM, where he spent his editing career.
His brother Robert J. Kern was also a distinguished film editor.
