The Pulitzer Prize in Poetry is one of the six American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It has been presented since 1922 for a distinguished volume of original verse by an American author, published during the preceding calendar year. 
Finalists have been announced from 1980, ordinarily two others beside the winner.
