==Programming==

As an independent station, tvk's programming consists mostly of local information, alternative music (some of whose musicians continue to appear on tvk, even after mainstream success), local sports, educational programmes, and anime.

==Anime Programs==

With the glut of production of anime since the late 1990s, many short cycle (3-6 month) series have come to find their broadcast niche in independent UHF stations. tvk is one of the most prominent of those stations in this market. If it's a UHF-niche anime show, then it is most likely aired on tvk.
