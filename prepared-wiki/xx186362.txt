[[CEP250]]

Centrosome-associated protein CEP250 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CEP250 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mack GJ, Rees J, Sandblom O, Balczon R, Fritzler MJ, Rattner JB | title = Autoantibodies to a group of centrosomal proteins in human autoimmune sera reactive with the centrosome | journal = Arthritis Rheum | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 551–8 |date=Apr 1998 | pmid = 9506584 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/1529-0131(199803)41:33.0.CO;2-X [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Fry AM, Mayor T, Meraldi P, Stierhof YD, Tanaka K, Nigg EA | title = C-Nap1, a Novel Centrosomal Coiled-Coil Protein and Candidate Substrate of the Cell Cycle–regulated Protein Kinase Nek2 | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 141 | issue = 7 | pages = 1563–74 |date=Aug 1998 | pmid = 9647649 | pmc = 2133000 | doi =10.1083/jcb.141.7.1563  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CEP250 centrosomal protein 250kDa| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11190| accessdate = [/tpl]
This gene encodes a core centrosomal protein required for centriole-centriole cohesion during interphase of the cell cycle. The encoded protein dissociates from the centrosomes when parental centrioles separate at the beginning of mitosis. The protein associates with and is phosphorylated by NIMA-related kinase 2, which is also associated with the centrosome. Furthermore, CEP135 is also required for the centriolar localization of CEP250.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kim K, Lee S, Chang J, Rhee K | title = A novel function of CEP135 as a platform protein of C-NAP1 for its centriolar localization | journal = Exp.
