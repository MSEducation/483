Archaeological evidence found in Bujang Valley reveals that a Hindu–Buddhist kingdom ruled ancient Kedah possibly as early as 110 A.D. The discovery of temples, jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and clay brick monuments dating back to 110 A.D shows that a maritime trading route with south Indian Tamil kingdoms was already established since that time.New interest in an older Lembah Bujang, 2010/07/25[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The discoveries in Bujang Valley also made the ancient Kedah as the oldest civilization of Southeast Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.researchsea.com/html/article.php/aid/5044/cid/6/research/usm_discovers_earliest_civilisation_in_southeast__asia.html?PHPSESSID=p1epc0djha62ka35ikprp984r5 |title=Asia Research News - USM discovers earliest civilisation in Southeast Asia |publisher=Researchsea.com |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2014-02-02[/tpl]

The Siamese nevertheless invaded Kedah in 1821,R. Bonney, Kedah 1771–1821: The Search for Security and Independence (1971), Ch.
