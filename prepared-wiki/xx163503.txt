Steve Marriott (1947-1991) was a successful and versatile English blue-eyed soul, singer-songwriter and guitarist.  He is best remembered for his uniquely powerful voice and aggressive guitar in groups Small Faces (1965-1969) and Humble Pie (1969-1975).  In England, Marriott became a popular often photographed mod style icon through his role as lead singer and guitarist with the Small Faces in the mid to late sixties.
Marriott's music was influenced from an early age by his heroes Buddy Holly, Booker T & the MG's, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Muddy Waters, Bobby Bland and later the Rolling Stones.  Marriott posthumously received an Ivor Novello Award in 1996 for his Outstanding Contribution to British Music and listed in Mojo magazine (sister magazine to Q) as one of the top 100 greatest singers of all time. His song "Cocaine" from his Steve Marriott's Scrubbers album is featured in the soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto IV in the fictitious radio station Liberty Rock Radio 97.8.
