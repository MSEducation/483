St. Mary's High School is a Catholic secondary school in Kitchener, Ontario,
Canada. It serves most of Kitchener's Catholic students, with others attending Resurrection Catholic Secondary School. Members of its sports teams are known as the Eagles.

==History==

The school was originally located in the city's downtown where it was founded as the girls' school to complement the adjacent boys-only St. Jerome's High School. As the latter school had older infrastructure, it was closed and St. Mary's was made co-ed in 1990. In 2002, the school moved from the downtown to the southern suburbs, where there would be far less commuting time for most students. However, many transferring students were upset at the new soulless structure compared to the old St. Mary's.
The former school buildings have been given differing fates: one auxiliary building was demolished; the main St. Jerome's facility has been renovated to house Wilfrid Laurier University's Faculty of Social Work; and the main St. Mary's building now houses both the Catholic School Board offices and the Kitchener Downtown Community Centre.
In the autumn of 2004, a new branch of the Kitchener Public Library opened within the new school building.
The school's fall 2005 enrollment was 2,200 students. This population was still far higher than the anticipated capacity; 25 portable classrooms are currently installed on the grounds, and no student parking is available due to the need for faculty parking, however the newly constructed arena allows students use of its parking lot during school hours.
As of October 2008, the schools population was 2,121., making it one of the largest in Ontario.
The new school building features a Triple Gym, an auditorium/theatre known as Alumni Hall, as well as a large cafeteria.  The school also houses tennis courts and 2 soccer/football fields.
Several notable events have occurred at the new school since its opening in 2002. These events include: a bomb scare in 2004 and again in September 2010, a fire in the central stairwell in 2005, and a chemical scare in 2006. Also, in 2008, an E. coli scare emerged in the school's cafetorium, affecting several students.
In June 2011, the school received its first silver Certification in the WCDSB from Ontario Eco-School.http://www.wcdsb.ca/about/headlines/news/nr/2011/NR-Catholic-Board-Celebrates-Seven-New-EcoSchools.pdf, WCDSB Report - Seven School Receive Gold, Silver & Bronze Certification in June 16, 2011. with addition on June 2013 they arrive another silver Certification with Eco-School.http://www.wcdsb.ca/about/headlines/news/nr/2013/NR-Catholic-Board-Celebrates-New-EcoSchools.pdf, WCDSB Report - Twelve School Receive Gold, Silver & Bronze Certification in June 12, 2013.

==Athletics==

In late spring 2007, the girls slo-pitch team became WCSSA champions. They ended their season with 22 wins and 0 losses – a perfect season. They also competed in two tournaments in addition to the regular season, one in Toronto hosted by Bishop Allen and one in Kitchener at the Peter Hallman ballpark. They won both tournaments. Since then, they have gone 81-1-0 as of 2010.
In 2008/2009, the Activa Arena Complex, built by the city of Kitchener, was constructed beside the campus. The arena is now home to St. Mary's' hockey teams, and it also houses the Lennox Lewis Boxing School.
