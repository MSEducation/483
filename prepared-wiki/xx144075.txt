Sweater was said to have been influenced by fellow Perth band Turnstyle who returned the favour by writing their Top 20 ARIA hit "Spray Water On The Stereo" as a parody of Eskimo Joe.
The music video for the song "14Hz" contains Claire Hooper, one of the team captains on the news-based comedy quiz show television show, 'Good News Week'.
