Leung Sheung (Chinese: 梁相; 1918 - 1978) was a Chinese martial artist who studied Wing Chun Kung Fu who is known as the senior-most student of Yip Man (葉問) in Hong Kong. Leung Sheung was widely acknowledged for his superior skill and practical application. 
Although being credited with being a premier student of Yip Man, Leung Sheung was an extremely humble man. He spoke about his Wing Chun abilities in overly modest terms, preferring to instead elevate Yip Man's martial prowess. However, being one of the few close-door students of Yip Man while living and studying under him for many years, as well as being Yip Man's first student in Hong Kong, Leung presented Yip Man with obvious reason to train him well. It was Leung Sheung's undeniable abilities that played a significant role in promoting and building Yip Man's Wing Chun in Hong Kong. Leung Sheung, along with Lok Yiu and Chu Shong Tin are considered to be the three closed-door students of Yip Man.

==History==

Prior to meeting Yip Man, Leung Sheung trained in many styles of kung fu including Choi Li Fut, White Eyebrow, and Dragon style.http://www.wcarchive.com/bios/leung-sheung.htm But it was Yip Man's Wing Chun in which Leung Sheung would dedicate his life beginning in 1949. As Yip Man's first Hong Kong student, Leung Sheung was the older kung fu brother of Yip Man's other students. All of whom, including Bruce Lee, showed him high respect. 
In 1956, Leung Sheung began to teach Wing Chun publicly. He was one of the few students that Yip Man encouraged to open a school and begin to teach.Ip Man Portrait of a Kung Fu Master
