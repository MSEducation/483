[[Citizen's arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Criminal procedure, Legal terms

A citizen's arrest is an arrest made by a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official.[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=va&vol=1022703&invol=1 |title=HUDSON v. COMMONWEALTH, Record No. 022703., September 12, 2003 - VA Supreme Court - FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |year= 2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.
Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a person with arrest powers, who need not be a citizen of the country in which he or she is acting. For example, in the British jurisdiction of England and Wales, the power comes from section 24A(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 Aug 2011 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] called "any person arrest". This legislation states "any person" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a British Citizen.

==Legal and political aspect==

A person who makes a citizen's arrest could risk exposing him or herself to possible lawsuits or criminal charges – such as charges of impersonating a police officer, false imprisonment, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, or wrongful arrest – if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's civil rights are violated.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] This is especially true when police forces are attempting to determine who an aggressor is.
The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in France and Germany, a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. Note, however, that at least in Germany, this results from a different legal norm, "aid to others in immediate danger," which is concerned with prevention, not prosecution, of crimes.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===

The power to arrest is granted by both federal and state legislation, however the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a Federal offence is granted by s.3Z of the Crimes Act 1914.[tpl]cite web|url=http://legislation.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/612E850EF1814DE9CA257344000972EE/$file/CrimesAct1914Vol1_WD02.pdf |title=ComLaw Home |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=1 Oct 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] Under the Act, a person who is not a police constable may, without warrant, arrest another person if they believe on reasonable grounds that:
A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable.

====Victoria====

In the Australian state of Victoria, the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca195882/ |title=Crimes Act 1958 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=20 Apr 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl]. It states that a person may, without a warrant, arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons:
A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody.
Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under 458 of the Crimes Act, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself won't be considered unlawful if it was done so on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force "not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence".

====New South Wales====

In the Australian state of New South Wales, the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a police officer by s.100 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/police-powers |title=Police powers - Legal Aid NSW |publisher=NSW Government |date=15 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] of New South Wales. Under the Act, a person may, without a warrant, arrest another person if:
Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest. A person who arrests another person under s.100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before a magistrate to be dealt with according to law. The magistrate will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances.
According to the Law Society of New South Wales, the arresting person should:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au |title=Homepage - Law Society of NSW |publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales |year=2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl]

====Queensland====

In the Australian state of Queensland, the power to arrest is granted by s.546 of Schedule 1 to the Criminal Code Act 1899 of Queensland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf |title=Criminal Code Act 1899 - CriminCode.pdf |publisher=Government of Queensland, Australia |date=27 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl]  Under the Act, any person who finds another committing an offence may, without warrant, arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence:
s.260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a breach of the peace:

====South Australia====

The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (s271)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s271.html |title=South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 Section 271 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=1 Jan 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl] grants arrest powers to a person.
"s271(3): A person is liable to arrest and detention under this section if the person is in the act of committing, or has just committed an indictable offence; or theft (whether the theft is a summary or indictable offence); or an offence against the person (whether the offence is summary or indictable); or an offence involving interference with, damage to or destruction of property (whether the offence is summary or indictable)."

====Tasmania====

Under the Police Offences Act 1935 (Tasmania), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states "For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act." There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.

====Western Australia====

It was only in 2004 that the Western Australian parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant "any reputed common prostitute, thief, loose, idle or disorderly person, who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law …" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms "loose" or "idle" with any degree of legal certainty. WA now locates its citizen's arrest powers in section 25 of the Criminal Investigation Act (WA) 2006.

====The Territories====

Northern Territory: Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom he or she finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons.
Australian Capital Territory: refer to the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen's arrest.
Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or security officer, in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise).  The courts may order compensation for such suspects in appropriate circumstances. {speedydelete}

===Brazil===

A Federal law[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/anotada/2341030/art-301-do-codigo-processo-penal-decreto-lei-3689-41 |title=Art. 301 do Código Processo Penal - Decreto Lei 3689/41 |language=[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] |publisher=Jusbrasil.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what he/she is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen's arrest might be sued by the arrestee.

===Denmark===

Pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a suspect found at or in the immediate vicinity of a crime scene if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=138875#Kap69 |title=Retsplejeloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om rettens pleje (in Dansk/Danish)- English: Administration of Justice Act - Act on Administration of Justice- retsinformation.dk |publisher=retsinformation.dk |date=24 Oct 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014[/tpl]

===Canada===

====Federal====

Canada's blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a federal statute—there are no provincial "crimes".
Criminal offences are divided into three groups: Indictable, Dual Procedure, and Summary Conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable.
The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_9/FullText.html |title=Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl] As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen's arrest in Canada in circumstances where a "reasonable" amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |title=Backgrounder: Citizen's Power of Arrest and Self-Defence and Defence of Property |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl]

====Provincial====

There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen's arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others.
 TRESPASS TO PROPERTY ACTTrespass to Property Act Section 9.

===Finland===

Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806 gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto) or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is mild assault, pilferage, mild treachery, mild unapproved use, mild annexation of motor vehicle, mild mischief or mild forgery. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.
If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole.

===France===

Allows any person to arrest a person having been caught in flagrante delicto committing a crime punishable by a jail or prison term, and to conduct that person before the nearest officer of judiciary police – in modern practice, one would rather call the police in after performing the arrest.Code of penal procedure (France), Article 73.

===Germany===

Citizen's arrests can be made under §127 StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught in flagrante delicto and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or he/she is suspected to try to flee.§127 StPO (code of penal procedures) (Germany). The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany.

===Hong Kong===

It is known as the "101 power" in Hong Kong. Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that "Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence." Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. "Arrestable offence" is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Hong Kong), Chapter 212, Section 101.

===Hungary===

According to article 127, section 8 of Act XIX. of 1998 concerning Penal Procedure, anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the "investigative authorities" immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.

===India===

According to section 43, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
1)"Any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence, or any proclaimed offender, and, without unnecessary delay, shall make over or cause to be made over any person so arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken in custody to the nearest police station."
2) If there is a reason to believe that such person comes under the [provisions of Sec 41, a police officer shall re-arrest him.
3) If there is a reason to believe that he has committed a non-cognizable offence, and he refuses on the demand of the police officer to give his name and residence, or gives name or residence which such officer hs a reason to believe to be false, he shall be dealt with under the provisions of Sec 42, but if there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed any offence he shall at once be released.
According to this section any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested
a) A person committing a non bailable and cognizable offence in his presence or
b) Any proclaimed offender
he shall without unnecessary delay make over such person to a police officer or to the nearest police station.

===Ireland===

Any person can arrest someone who they have reasonable cause is in the act of committing or has committed an "arrestable" offence, that is one punishable by more than 5 years in prison.Criminal Law Act 1997 (Ireland), Section 4. The arrest can only be effected if the arrestor has reasonable cause that the person will attempt to avoid apprehension by Gardaí and the arrestor delivers the person to Garda custody as soon as is practicable.

===Israel===

A law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect who they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and a new law now allows the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers - Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. A magistrate's court in Jerusalem has in early 2009 handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court reached a conclusion that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.

Section 213 of the Criminal Code allows anyone (not only citizens) witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called genkouhan (現行犯, meaning in flagrante delicto).wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第213条 Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive.wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第217条 However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent petty crime (i.e. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tanteisha.net/taiho.html |title=現行犯逮捕 |publisher=Tanteisha.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] is false imprisonment per Section 220.wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第220条

===Latvia===

Criminal Procedure Law gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto) or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. The arrested person must be handed over to the police immediately.

 Section 265. Detention Procedures

(3) If there is a clear connection between a person and a committed criminal offence regarding which a punishment related to the deprivation of liberty may be applied, and such person is located at the location where the criminal offence was committed or flees from such site, or if a search for the person regarding the committing of such criminal offence has been announced, such person may be detained by anyone and shall immediately be transferred to the nearest police employee.

 Section 31. Detention Causing Personal Harm

(1) Detention causing personal harm is an act which is directed against such person as is committing or has committed a criminal offence. Criminal liability for this act shall not apply if the harm allowed to be effected to the person is not evidently disproportionate to the character of the offence, non-compliance or resistance.

(2) A person who, in carrying out detention, has violated conditions regarding the detention, shall be liable for violating such conditions.

(3) If the acts by which harm has been caused to the person to be detained have not been necessary for his or her arrest, liability on a general basis applies for the harm caused.

(4) The causing of harm to the detained person through negligence shall not be criminally punishable.

===Malaysia===

Section 27(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for a private person to arrest a person who, in his view, has committed a seizable offence or a non-bailable offence:Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 27(2).
 Any private person may arrest any person who, in his view, commits a non-bailable and seizable offence or who has been proclaimed under section 44 and shall without unnecessary delay hand over the person so arrested to the nearest police officer or, in the absence of a police officer, take that person to the nearest police station. 
Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 27(5).
 Any person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another may if his name and address are unknown be apprehended by the person injured or by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons, and may be detained until he gives his name and address and satisfies such person that the name and address so given are correct or until he can be delivered into the custody of a police officer. 
A "seizable offence" is defined as an offence in which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant as per defined by the Code.Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 2(1).

===Mexico===

Article 16 of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico allows any person to arrest a criminal found in flagrante delicto.Constitution of Mexico, Article 16.
Is important to know that in Mexico you can make the arrest, but you must immediately call the police, because is illegal to retain or transport any person against their will, failing to do so is called illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnaping that can earn a hard punishment of jail time for the perpetrator.

===New Zealand===

Some legal protection exists to those making a citizen's arrest as provided in the Crimes Act 1961 in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and are not liable to any civil proceeding. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for civil proceedings. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the Summary Offences Act 1981.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ns.org.nz/index.html/Factsheets/CitizensArrestAndSelf-defence?action=pdf |title=Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence |accessdate=2010-10-08 | publisher = Neighbourhood Support New Zealand |format=PDF[/tpl]
Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:Crimes Act 1961, Section 35 & 36.
Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where:
In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time.

Pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-021.html#176.

===Portugal===

According to the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure (article 255), any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime or fleeing from the crime scene if the crime they were committing is punishable with a prison term of any length. The arrested person must be handed over to the police immediately after it is possible to do so.

===Sweden===

Any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime or fleeing from the crime scene if the crime he or she was committing is punishable with a prison term of any length. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.

===Taiwan===

An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the Constitution of the Republic of China, "except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law", as shown below:
 
 The Code of Criminal Procedurehttp://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0010001&DF=&SNo=88.

Article 88: Arrest without a Warrant

A person in flagrante delicto may be arrested without a warrant by any person.

A person in flagrante delicto is a person who is discovered in the act of committing an offense or immediately thereafter.

A person is considered to be in flagrante delicto under one of the following circumstances:

However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. "pursued with cries" has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

A citizen's arrest is permitted to be made on any person under section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for an indictable offence, including either way offences (in this section referred to simply as "an offence"), but excluding certain specific ones listed below. It is thus permissible for any person to arrest:
In order for the arrest to be lawful, the following two conditions must also be satisfied:
Use of the second power above is rather risky, since it relies upon the person carrying out the arrest knowing that an offence has been committed, of which in itself needs to be indictable or either way offence. The Act therefore gives a constable additional powers under section 24 to arrest the following:
N.B. "Any person" powers can be used to arrest before an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. This act creates the offence of an attempted offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an indictable one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted - preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would.
A constable's arrest power is not limited to indictable offences, and conditions different from the above apply.
However, a citizen's arrest cannot be made:
In addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an arrest warrant, if the court issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.

=====Other powers=====

A person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated or a breach of the peace about to occur. This offence definition and power of arrest are contained under the common law definition of "breach of the peace".
Until 2006, there was an "any person" power of arrest under part of the Theft Act 1968 in England and Wales that related to poaching,Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 to the Theft Act 1968 which was used by private water bailiffs (as opposed to Environment Agency bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.Paragraph 38 of Schedule 7 to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005; commenced by article 2(m) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005

Similar provisions apply to Northern Ireland as to England and Wales, implemented through the "Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989" (SI 1989/1341)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1989/uksi_19891341_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl] as amended by the "Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order" (SI 2007/288).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20070288_en_1 |title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 No. 288 (NI. 2) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2010-04-24[/tpl]

====Scotland====

While no statutory provision for citizen's arrest exists in Scots Law, there is a common law position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person. An arrest is applicable reliant on situation.House of Commons - Armed Forces - Minutes of Evidence.Citizen's Arrest (Hansard, 18 October 1995).

===United States===

====Common law====

Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor or "breach of peace".[tpl]cite web|last=Daily, JD|first=James|title=Superheroes and Citizen's Arrest|url=http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2011/03/07/superheroes-and-citizens-arrest/|work=Law and the Multiverse[/tpl]  A breach of peace covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a
fine. The term historically included theft, "nightwalking", prostitution and playing card and dice games.[tpl]cite web|title=Atwater v. Lago Vista ( No. 99-1408 )|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/99-1408|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States[/tpl]

====State statutes====

California Penal Code section 837 is a good example of this codification:
 
 837. A private person may arrest another:

"Public offense" is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors and infractions.[tpl]cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 16|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/16.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=People v. Landis|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-superior-court/1050756.html|publisher=Appellate Division, Superior Court,Orange County.|quote=“Public offenses” include infractions.  (Pen.Code § 16;  People v. Tennessee (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 788, 791, 84 Cal.Rptr. 697.[/tpl] Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law.  With certain exceptions (see below) an arrest must be made.  "Holding them until the police get there", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.[tpl]cite web|title=Citizens' Arrest |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Citizen.pdf |publisher=Alameda County District Attorney's Office [/tpl]
In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside his presence but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed . For example, imagine a suspect has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage.  If he finds the suspect and makes the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for false arrest because a felony had not, in fact, been committed.
Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations.  For example, in Pennsylvania, the
courts have been clear that a citizen cannot make an arrest for a "summary offense".[tpl]cite web|last=Legg|first=Jason|title=From the Desk of the DA|url=http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf|work=Susquehanna County Office of the District Attorney[/tpl] In North Carolina, there is no de jure "citizens' arrest". Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a "detention".[tpl]cite web|title=Detention of offenders by private persons.|url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html|work=North Carolina General Statutes[/tpl]
Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code.[tpl]cite web|title=§19.2-81 Arrest Without a Warrant|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1902000/19.2-81.html|work=Code of Virginia[/tpl] However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by citizens for misdemeanors.[tpl]cite web|title=Edward Thomas WILSON v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of-appeals/1175015.html|publisher=Court of Appeals of Virginia,Richmond.[/tpl]

====Shopkeepers (merchants') privilege====

In some jurisdictions of the United States, the courts recognize a common law shopkeeper's privilege, under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property.  The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.W. Page, Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 22, at 142 (5th ed. 1984)

====Differing liability from police====

Private persons do not enjoy the same protections as the police in arresting others.  While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while citizens are held to a stricter liability.  Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion.[tpl]cite web|title=Terry v. Ohio (392 U.S. 1 (1968))|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States[/tpl]
Additionally, in many states pulling a person over in a vehicle to arrest them would be considered impersonating a police officer.
