The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released March 8, 1994, on Interscope Records. It is a concept album detailing the destruction of a man, from the beginning of his "downward spiral" to his attempt at suicide. The Downward Spiral features elements of industrial rock, techno, and heavy metal, in contrast to Nine Inch Nails' synthpop-influenced Pretty Hate Machine.
Co-produced by Trent Reznor and Flood, The Downward Spiral was conceived after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival tour as a pivot for the "negative vibe" felt by the band. Reznor moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles in Beverly Hills, California the following year, where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family. It was used as a studio called "Le Pig" for recording Broken and The Downward Spiral with collabrations from other musicians. The album was influenced by late 1970s rock music albums, David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall in particular, and focused on texture and space, avoiding explicit usage of guitars or synthesizers. 
The Downward Spiral was promoted with the Self Destruct Tour and four songs from the album ("March of the Pigs", "Closer", "Piggy", and "Hurt") became singles. The tour's concerts debuted the band's grungy and messy image and were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves and destroying their instruments. "March of the Pigs" and "Closer" were accompanied by music videos; the "March of the Pigs" video was shot twice and "Closer"'s was heavily censored. "Piggy" and "Hurt" were released as promotional singles.
A major commercial success, The Downward Spiral established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors while diverging into drug abuse and depression. It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and was praised for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was criticized by social conservatives for its lyrics. A companion remix album, Further Down the Spiral, was released in 1995. To mark the album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was remastered and re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats.

==Writing and recording==

The Downward Spiral was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as a pivot for the "negative vibe" felt by the band that Trent Reznor saw when they were in a European hotel. Nine Inch Nails live performances were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a feud with TVT Records that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager John Malm, Jr. and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album's themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznor's social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member Richard Patrick and was known for enjoying alcohol.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Kristina Estlund|title=Trentspeak|journal=Rip|publisher=Larry Flynt Publications|date=November 1994[/tpl] When developing The Downward Spiral, Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues. His friends suggested that he could take Prozac (fluoxetine), an antidepressant, but this choice did not appeal to him.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=96[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/5930270/nine-inch-nails-the-downward-spiral-at-20-classic-track-by-track|title=Nine Inch Nails' 'The Downward Spiral' at 20: Classic Track-By-Track|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|author=Kerri Mason|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2014[/tpl] He wanted the album's sound to diverge from Broken, emphasizing mood, texture, restraint and subtlety, although he was not sure about its musical direction.

He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive "terrifying" because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=97–99[/tpl] The studio was also used for the recording of Marilyn Manson's debut album Portrait of an American Family, which Reznor co-produced. Marilyn Manson accepted Reznor's offer of signing a contract with Nothing Records.[tpl]cite book |last1= Manson |first1= Marilyn |last2=Strauss |first2=Neil |title= The Long Hard Road Out of Hell |url= http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=C4pJdhmTC7MC&dq=The+Long+Hard+Road+Out+of+Hell |date=February 14, 1998 |publisher=HarperCollins division ReganBooks |location=New York |isbn=0-06-039258-4 |ref=harv[/tpl]
Reznor collaborated with former Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins, progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew, and Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna.[tpl]cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C| title = The A to X of Alternative Music| author = Steve Taylor| publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group| year = 2004| pages = 165| isbn = 0-8264-8217-1| accessdate = February 20, 2008[/tpl] Belew's first visit to the studio involved playing the guitar parts in "Mr. Self-Destruct", and he was told to play freely, think on reacting to melodies, concentrate on rhythm, and use noise. This approach improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument: he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=106–108[/tpl] Belew praised Reznor for his "command of technology," and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations "that are in his realm."[tpl]cite journal|title=Adrian Belew & Trent Reznor: Nine Inch Nails Meets The Lone Rhino|journal=Guitar Player|publisher=NewBay Media|date=April 1994[/tpl] Vrenna and Perkins played drum parts recorded live in the studio; the tracks were rendered into looped samples. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20 to 25-minute long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer.
Most of the music was recorded into a Macintosh computer using a board and manipulated with music editor programs on the computer. Unique effects such as analyzing and inverting the frequency were applied to the tracks to create original sounds. The band would "get an arrangement together" and convert it into analog tape.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=109–110[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=555|title=Machine Head|journal=Guitar World|publisher=NewBay Media|author=Alan Di Perna|date=April 1994[/tpl] Reznor sampled excerpts from guitar tracks and processed them to the point of randomness and expression.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=109[/tpl] Among the equipment Reznor used for recording the album are Pro Tools, Digidesign's TurboSynth, a Marshall rack head, the Prophet VS keyboard, and various Jackson and Gibson guitars.
In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tate's death in the house. Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with Rolling Stone:
[tpl]quote|While I was working on The Downward Spiral, I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister Tate. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck Charlie Manson.' I went home and cried that night. It made me see there's another side to things, you know?[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Rolling Stone |publisher=Wenner Media |issue=755 |date=March 6, 1997 |page=36 |first=Mikal |last=Gilmore |author-link=Mikal Gilmore |title=The Lost Boys[/tpl] Trent Reznor's part of the interview article posted at [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhrs3.html |title=Trent Reznor Lost Highway Interview |accessdate=December 25, 2007 |work=lynchnet.com |postscript=[/tpl][/tpl]
Flood, known for engineering and producing U2 and Depeche Mode albums, was employed as co-producer on The Downward Spiral. It became his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails due to creative differences. A "very dangerously self-destructive," humorous short song written for the album, "Just Do It," was not included in the final version and criticized by Flood in that Reznor had "gone too far." Reznor completed the last song written for the album, "Big Man with a Gun," in late 1993.[tpl]cite journal |magazine=Spin |volume=15 |issue=9 |date=September 1999 |page=124 |first=Eric |last=Weisbard |title=The 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s: 11 Nine Inch Nails The Downward Spiral |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bGjsvmNt8UgC&lpg=PA117&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=November 4, 2011 [/tpl] Also posted at [tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart89.shtml |title=Rank 11.

The Downward Spiral entered its mixing and mastering processes, done at Record Plant Studios and A&M Studios with Alan Moulder, who subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future album releases.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=119[/tpl]

==Music and lyrics==

 
 

Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout The Downward Spiral, which leaves it open to wide interpretation. The album relays nihilism and is defined by a prominent theme of self-abuse and control. It is a semi-autographical concept album in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's (Reznor) descent into madness in his own inner solipsistic world, through a metaphorical "Downward Spiral", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally suicide.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=120[/tpl][tpl]Allmusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r198574 |first=Steve |last=Huey |accessdate=April 27, 2004 [/tpl] Reznor described the concept as consisting of "someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on." Media journalists like The New York Times writer Jon Pareles noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana, and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.
The Downward Spiral features elements of industrial rock, techno, and heavy metal, a change from the synthpop-influenced Pretty Hate Machine. Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow verse–chorus form, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony (or both). The treatment of metal guitars in Broken is carried over to The Downward Spiral, which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures.[tpl]sfn|Huxley|1997|p=109–121[/tpl] The album features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress a central character.[tpl]cite journal | title = The Art of Darkness | last = Heath | first = Chris | authorlink = Chris Heath | journal = Details | publisher = Condé Nast Publications |date=April 1995[/tpl] Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end, frequently moving from whispers to screams.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=84 | work=IGN | title=Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth | author=Spence D. | date=May 3, 2005 | accessdate=January 29, 2014 | publisher=Ziff Davis[/tpl] These techniques are all used in the song "Hurt", which features a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word "I" every time the B/E# dyad is played. 
"Mr. Self Destruct", a song about a powerful person, follows a build-up sampled from THX 1138 with an "industrial roar" and is accompanied by an audio loop of a pinion rotating. "The Becoming" expresses the state of being dead and Reznor's transformation into a non-human organism. "Closer" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of "Piggy" on organ, then reappears in power chords at Drop D tuning throughout the chorus of "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on "The Downward Spiral". The album was chiefly inspired by David Bowie's Low, an experimental rock album which Reznor related to on songwriting, mood, and structures, as well as progressive rock group Pink Floyd's The Wall.[tpl]cite journal| url = http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart43.shtml| title = Techno Fear! | journal = Kerrang! | publisher = Bauer Media Group | author = Steffan Chirazi|date=April 1994| accessdate = January 21, 2009[/tpl]

==Cover art==

Committere, an installation featuring artwork and sketches for The Downward Spiral, "Closer" and "March of the Pigs" by Russell Mills was displayed at the Glasgow School of Art. Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting (titled "Wound") that was used for the cover art:
[tpl]quote|I had been thinking about making works that dealt with layers, physically, materially and conceptually. I wanted to produce works that were about both exposure and revealing and at the same dealt with closure and covering. Given the nature of the lyrics and the power of the music I was working with, I felt justified in attempting to make works that alluded to the apparently contradictory imagery of pain and healing. I wanted to make beautiful surfaces that partially revealed the visceral rawness of open wounds beneath. The mixed media work 'Wound' was the first piece I tackled in this vein (no pun intended) and it became the cover of the album. It is made of plaster, acrylics, oils, rusted metals, insects, moths, blood (mine), wax, varnishes, and surgical bandaging on a wooden panel.[tpl]cite web| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20100503082254/http://www.shedmatter.co.uk/russellmills/mills/installations/committere.html| title = Committere| author = Russell Mills| year = 2006| accessdate = April 25, 2009[/tpl][/tpl]
