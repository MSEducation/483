[[Yarra Glen railway station]]

CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne

Yarra Glen is the city-end terminus of the Healesville railway.
The first station on the site was built in 1888–1889 when the railway line was extended from Lilydale to Healesville. The settlement had been previously named Burgoyne, but when the railway was extended, the decision was made to rename it Yarra Glen. Though Yarra Glen was a small settlement, its station was often used for supplying Melbourne with produce from nearby farms.
The station closed along with the Healesville line in 1980. It sat idle for some years, and suffered some major fire damage to the roof, however the station is being restored as part of the Yarra Valley Railway, which is based out of Healesville. It currently opens on weekends and public holidays.
The Bushfires of late February and early March 2009 caused destruction to much of the grassland and forested areas of the Yarra Valley. This fire also caused the destruction of 2 timber trestle bridges between Yarra Glen Station and Healesville (only 2 small bridges between these 2 stations were lost, the main bridges that were lost were the Yarra Flat Trestles. These were the bridges between Yarra Glen and Yering, visible from the Melba Hwy when approaching Yarra Glen. These other 6 bridges were not part of the Yarra Valley Railway). Many of the sleepers were also burnt out (sleepers over approx 2 km of line were lost. This is outside the current running section of the Yarra Valley Railway). As a result, until reinstatement of the 2 bridges and rail to operating condition, Yarra Glen station is orphaned from the remaining part of the Healesville Line.
Additional fire activity also caused the burning and destruction of the timber bridges between Yarra Glen and Coldstream, resulting in the possible elimination of any future opportunity of reinstatement of railway services to Lilydale, without a significant amount of money/time.
