Man on the Silver Mountain is the first single by Rainbow and the first track of their debut album, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. Written by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and singer Ronnie James Dio, this song is, as Dio said, "a semi-religious one, a man on the silver mountain is a kind of God figure everyone is crying out to". This track became one of Rainbow's greatest hits and was also a live favorite for them. When Ronnie died and was buried in Los Angeles, the words on his grave were "The man on the silver mountain Ronnie James Dio".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=dio&GSfn=ronnie+&GSiman=1&GScid=7975&GRid=52461224& |title=Ronnie James Dio (1942-2010) |publisher=Find A Grave Memorial |accessdate=16 August 2013[/tpl]
