Cryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan protozoans that can cause gastrointestinal illness with diarrhea in humans.
Cryptosporidium is the organism most commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea. Treatment is symptomatic, with fluid rehydration, electrolyte correction and management of any pain. Cryptosporidium oocysts  are 4-6 µm in diameter and exhibit partial acid-fast staining. They must be differentiated from other partially acid-fast organisms including
Cyclospora cayetanensis.

==General characteristics==

Cryptosporidium causes the diarrheal illness  cryptosporidiosis.  Other apicomplexan pathogens include the malaria parasite Plasmodium, and Toxoplasma, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis.  Unlike Plasmodium, which transmits via a mosquito vector, Cryptosporidium does not use an insect vector and is capable of completing its lifecycle within a single host, resulting in cyst stages that are excreted in feces and are capable of transmission to a new host.
A number of Cryptosporidium species infect mammals. In humans, the main causes of disease are C. parvum and C. hominis (previously C. parvum genotype 1). C. canis, C. felis, C. meleagridis, and C. muris can also cause disease in humans.
Cryptosporidiosis is typically an acute, short-term infection, but can become severe and nonresolving in children and immunocompromised individuals. In humans, it remains in the lower intestine and may remain for up to five weeks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] The parasite is transmitted by environmentally hardy cysts (oocysts) that, once ingested, exist in the small intestine and result in an infection of intestinal epithelial tissue.
The genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, sequenced in 2004, was found to be unusual amongst eukaryotes in that the mitochondria seem not to contain DNA.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1094786 |title=Complete Genome Sequence of the Apicomplexan, Cryptosporidium parvum |publisher=Science/AAAS |year=2004 |author=Abrahamsen, M.

The CryptoDB.org NIH-funded database provides access to the Cryptosporidium genomics data sets.
