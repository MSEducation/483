Hobson is a former New Zealand parliamentary electorate. It existed from 1946 to 1978 and then from 1987 to 1996, and was represented by five Members of Parliament, four of whom represented the National Party. It is notable for returning a member of the Social Credit Party in the [tpl]NZ election link|1966[/tpl], as no other candidate not aligned with either Labour or National had been elected to Parliament since [tpl]NZ election link year|1943[/tpl].

==Population centres==

The 1941 census had been postponed due to World War II, so the 1946 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth and movements into account. The North Island gained a further two electorates from the South Island due to faster population growth. The abolition of the country quota through the Electoral Amendment Act, 1945 reduced the number and increased the size of rural electorates. None of the existing electorates remained unchanged, 27 electorates were abolished, eight former electorates were re-established, and 19 electorates were created for the first time, including Hobson.[tpl]sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91–96[/tpl] The electorate was in the Northland region, and in its original form included the following population centres: Ruawai, Dargaville, Kawakawa, Kaikohe, Kerikeri, Kaitaia, and Mangonui.[tpl]sfn|McRobie|1989|p=94[/tpl] The original area had previously been covered by the [tpl]NZ electorate link|Bay of Islands[/tpl] and [tpl]NZ electorate link|Kaipara[/tpl] electorates.[tpl]sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=90, 94[/tpl]
The electorate was abolished through the 1977 electoral redistribution. The area that it last covered was divided by the Bay of Islands and Kaipara electorates.[tpl]sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=114–119[/tpl]

==History==

The first representative of the Hobson electorate was Sidney Smith, who had previously represented the Bay of Islands electorate.[tpl]sfn|Wilson|1985|p=235[/tpl] Smith retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Logan Sloane in the [tpl]NZ election link|1960[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Wilson|1985|p=235[/tpl] In the 1960 and 1963 elections, Vernon Cracknell of the Social Credit Party contested the Hobson electorate and placed second on both occasions, pushing the Labour Party candidate into third place. The area had previously been receptive to social credit theory; the Social Credit Party had placed second in the 1954 election. In the [tpl]NZ election link|1966[/tpl], Cracknell narrowly defeated Sloane.[tpl]sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=191, 235[/tpl]
