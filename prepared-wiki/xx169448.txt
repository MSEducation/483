===Original cast notes===

Anne Rodgers took part in several workshops for the part of Grandma, but for unknown reasons eventually turned down the role.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3640223/All-singing-all-dancing-all-smoking.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=All-singing, all-dancing, all-smoking | first=Catherine | last=Shoard | date=11 April 2005[/tpl] It was then offered to Ann Emery, who previously auditioned, and has performed it ever since. On a similar note, Jackie Clune originally took part in a few workshops for Mrs Wilkinson, but became pregnant before casting was finalised. A few years later she was offered the part.http://london.broadway.com/tag/id/3000454/BillyElliot The process of finding the three Billy's  took many months.West End Programme - Featured Article by Jessica Ronane (Children's Casting Director)
