A restriction enzyme (or restriction endonuclease) is an enzyme that cuts DNA at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites.[tpl]cite journal | author = Roberts RJ | title = Restriction endonucleases | journal = CRC Crit.

To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.
These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses.[tpl]cite journal | author = Arber W, Linn S | title = DNA modification and restriction | journal = Annu.

Bacteriol. | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–21 |date=February 1953 | pmid = 13034700 | pmc = 169650[/tpl] It was found that a bacteriophage λ that can grow well in one strain of Escherichia coli, for example E. coli C, when grown in another strain, for example E. coli K, its yields can drop significantly, by as much as 3-5 orders of magnitude. The E. coli K host cell, known as the restricting host, appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage λ. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also become restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of Werner Arber and Matthew Meselson that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.[tpl]cite journal | author = Meselson M, Yuan R | title = DNA restriction enzyme from E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5134 | pages = 1110–4 |date=March 1968 | pmid = 4868368 |doi=10.1038/2171110a0|bibcode = 1968Natur.217.1110M[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Dussoix D, Arber W | title = Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli.

The restriction enzymes studied by Arber and Meselson were type I restriction enzymes which cleave DNA randomly away from the recognition site.[tpl]cite journal | author = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proc.

It was later shown by Daniel Nathans and Kathleen Danna that cleavage of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA by restriction enzymes yielded specific fragments which can be separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus showing that restriction enzymes can be used for mapping of the DNA.[tpl]cite journal | author = Danna K, Nathans D | title = Specific cleavage of simian virus 40 DNA by restriction endonuclease of Hemophilus influenzae | journal = Proc.

==Origins==

Restriction enzymes likely evolved from a common ancestor and became widespread via horizontal gene transfer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jeltsch A, Manfred K, Pingroud A | title = Evidence for an evolutionary relationship among type-II restriction endonucleases | journal = Gene | volume = 160 | pages = 7–16 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7628720 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00181-5 | issue = 1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Jeltsch A, Pingroud A | title = Horizontal gene transfer contributes to the wide distribution and evolution of type II restriction-modification systems | journal = J Mol Evol | volume = 42 | pages = 91–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8919860 | doi = 10.1007/BF02198833 | issue = 2[/tpl] In addition, there is mounting evidence that restriction endonucleases evolved as a selfish genetic element.[tpl]cite journal | author = Naito T, Kusano K, Kobayashi I | title = Selfish behavior of restriction-modification systems | journal = Science | volume = 267 | pages = 897–9 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7846533 | bibcode = 1995Sci...267..897N |doi = 10.1126/science.7846533 | issue = 5199[/tpl]

==Recognition site==

Restriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences usually vary between 4 and 8 nucleotides, and many of them are palindromic, meaning the base sequence reads the same backwards and forwards.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 |date=September 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705[/tpl] In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The mirror-like palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backwards on a single strand of DNA strand, as in GTAATG. The inverted repeat palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backwards, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being complementary to CATATG).[tpl]cite book | author = Clark DP | title = Molecular biology | publisher = Elsevier Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | year = 2005 | pages = | isbn = 0-12-175551-7[/tpl] Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.
EcoRI digestion produces "sticky" ends, 
whereas SmaI restriction enzyme cleavage produces "blunt" ends:
Recognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation (5' end or the 3' end) of a sticky-end "overhang" of an enzyme restriction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Goodsell DS | title = The molecular perspective: restriction endonucleases | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–1 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11897876 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.20-2-190[/tpl]
Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as neoschizomers. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as isoschizomers.

==Types==

Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into four groups (Types I, II III, and IV) based on their composition and enzyme cofactor requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bickle TA, Krüger DH |title=Biology of DNA restriction |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=434–50 |date=June 1993 |pmid=8336674 |pmc=372918 |doi= |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8336674[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Boyer HW | title = DNA restriction and modification mechanisms in bacteria | journal = Annu.

They differ in their recognition sequence, subunit composition, cleavage position, and cofactor requirements,[tpl]cite journal |author=Rao DN, Sistla S |title=S-Adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent restriction enzymes |journal=Crit.

Biotechnol. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=225–43 |year=2003 |pmid=12665693 |doi=10.1385/MB:23:3:225[/tpl] as summarised below:

===Type I===

Type I restriction enzymes were the first to be identified and were first identified in two different strains (K-12 and B) of E. coli.[tpl]cite journal |author=Murray NE |title=Type I Restriction Systems: Sophisticated Molecular Machines (a Legacy of Bertani and Weigle) |journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=412–34 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10839821 |pmc=98998 |doi= 10.1128/MMBR.64.2.412-434.2000|url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10839821[/tpl] These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site.  Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation[tpl]dn|date=August 2013[/tpl], which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions—one containing 3–4 nucleotides, and another containing 4–5 nucleotides—separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6–8 nucleotides. These enzymes are multifunctional and are capable of both restriction and modification activities, depending upon the methylation status of the target DNA. The cofactors S-Adenosyl methionine (AdoMet), hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and magnesium (Mg2+) ions, are required for their full activity. Type I restriction enzymes possess three subunits called HsdR, HsdM, and HsdS; HsdR is required for restriction; HsdM is necessary for adding methyl groups to host DNA (methyltransferase activity) and HsdS is important for specificity of the recognition (DNA-binding) site in addition to both restriction (DNA cleavage) and modification (DNA methyltransferase) activity.

===Type II===

Typical type II restriction enzymes differ from type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They are a homodimer, with recognition sites are usually undivided and palindromic and 4–8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, and they do not use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg2+ as a cofactor. These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily nomenclature was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes. These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.
Type IIB restriction enzymes (e.g. BcgI and BplI) are multimers, containing more than one subunit. They cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg2+ cofactors. Type IIE restriction endonucleases (e.g. NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence. One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an allosteric effector that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF restriction endonucleases (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time. Type IIG restriction endonucleases (Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active. Type IIM restriction endonucleases, such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA. Type IIS restriction endonucleases (e.g. FokI) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites. These enzymes may function as dimers. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.

===Type III===

Type III restriction enzymes (e.g. EcoP15) recognize two separate non-palindromic sequences that are inversely oriented. They cut DNA about 20-30 base pairs after the recognition site.[tpl]cite journal |author = Dryden DT, Murray NE, Rao DN | title = Nucleoside triphosphate-dependent restriction enzymes |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3728–41 |date=September 2001 |pmid = 11557806 |pmc=55918 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3728 | url =http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11557806[/tpl] These enzymes contain more than one subunit and require AdoMet and ATP cofactors for their roles in DNA methylation and restriction, respectively.[tpl]cite journal |author=Meisel A, Bickle TA, Krüger DH, Schroeder C |title=Type III restriction enzymes need two inversely oriented recognition sites for DNA cleavage |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6359 |pages=467–9 |date=January 1992 |pmid=1734285 |doi=10.1038/355467a0 |url=|bibcode = 1992Natur.355..467M[/tpl] They are components of prokaryotic DNA restriction-modification mechanisms that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type III enzymes are hetero-oligomeric, multifunctional proteins composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognises the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonuclease. Res is required for restriction, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognise short 5-6 bp long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25-27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Type III enzymes belong to the beta-subfamily of N6 adenine methyltransferases, containing the nine motifs that characterise this family, including motif I, the AdoMet binding pocket (FXGXG), and motif IV, the catalytic region (S/D/N (PP) Y/F).[tpl]cite journal | author = Sistla S, Rao DN | title = S-Adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent restriction enzymes | journal = Crit.

===Type IV===

Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the McrBC and Mrr systems of E. coli.https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases/types-of-restriction-endonucleases

===Type V===

Type V restriction enzymes (e.g., the cas9-gRNA complex from CRISPRs) utilize guide RNAs to target specific non-palindromic sequences found on invading organisms. They can cut DNA of variable length provided that a suitable guide RNA is provided. The flexibility and ease of use of these enzymes make them promising for future genetic engineering applications.Philippe, H. and Rodolphe, B. CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea.

===Artificial restriction enzymes===

Artificial restriction enzymes can be generated by fusing a natural or engineered DNA binding domain to a nuclease domain (often the cleavage domain of the type IIS restriction enzyme FokI[tpl]cite journal | author = Kim YG, Cha J, Chandrasegaran S | title = Hybrid restriction enzymes: zinc finger fusions to Fok I cleavage domain | journal = Proc.

Since their discovery in the 1970s, more than 100 different restriction enzymes have been identified in different bacteria. Each enzyme is named after the bacterium from which it was isolated using a naming system based on bacterial genus, species and strain.[tpl]cite journal | author = Smith HO, Nathans D | title = Letter: A suggested nomenclature for bacterial host modification and restriction systems and their enzymes | journal = J.

==Applications==

Isolated restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA for different scientific applications. 
They are used to assist insertion of genes into plasmid vectors during gene cloning and protein expression experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short polylinker sequence (called the multiple cloning site, or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a DNA ligase.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/restriction_enzymes/ | title = Cloning using restriction enzymes | author = Geerlof A | publisher = European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Hamburg | accessdate = 2008-06-07[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | edition = | language = | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-576-5[/tpl]
Restriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene alleles by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).[tpl]cite journal | author = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Combining allele-specific fluorescent probes and restriction assay in real-time PCR to achieve SNP scoring beyond allele ratios of 1:1000 | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–4, 196, 199 |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18330346 | doi = 10.2144/000112719[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Zhang R, Zhu Z, Zhu H, Nguyen T, Yao F, Xia K, Liang D, Liu C | title = SNP Cutter: a comprehensive tool for SNP PCR–RFLP assay design | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 33 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W489–92 |date=July 2005 | pmid = 15980518 | pmc = 1160119 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki358[/tpl] This is only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to genotype a DNA sample without the need for expensive gene sequencing. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by gel electrophoresis. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. The number of bands reveals the sample subject's genotype, an example of restriction mapping.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
In a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest genomic DNA for gene analysis by Southern blot. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or paralogues) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene mutations (polymorphisms) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).[tpl]cite book | author = Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = Fifth | language = | publisher = W.H.
