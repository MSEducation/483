In an MTV interview for a program about children of famous rock musicians, he commented that "I respect The Allman Brothers Band very much, but I've always been more into Black Sabbath, David Bowie, and Metallica."
He has worked with Thirty Seconds to Mars for the band's self-titled debut album.[tpl]cite AV media notes | title =30 Seconds to Mars | titlelink = 30 Seconds to Mars (album) | others = Thirty Seconds to Mars | year =2002 | type = Booklet | publisher = Immortal Records | id = 7243 8 12424 0 7 | location = Europe[/tpl] Also he has provided guest vocals on a number of different songs for other bands including, Orgy, Coal Chamber and Sugar Ray.
