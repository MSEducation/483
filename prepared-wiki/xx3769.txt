In both crime and law, hate crime (also known as bias-motivated crime) is a usually violent, prejudice motivated crime that occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain social group. Examples of such groups include but are not limited to:  ethnicity, gender identity, language, nationality, physical appearance, religion, or sexual orientation.Stotzer, R.:  "Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups", Williams Institute, 2007–06. Retrieved on 2012-03-17. "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of his or her membership in a certain group."Streissguth, Tom (2003). Hate Crimes (Library in a Book), p.3. ISBN 0-8160-4879-7.
"Hate crime" generally refers to criminal acts that are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the types above, or of their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).Hate crime, Home Office
A hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence. Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against hate speech in that hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct that is already criminal under other laws, while hate speech laws criminalize a category of speech.

==History==

The term "hate crime" did not really begin to be used until after World War II and the end of most major government-sanctioned racial cleansing,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] but the term is often used retrospectively about persecutions earlier than that. Examples include pogroms against Jews and the Armenian genocide.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=cit. that someone called them 'hate crimes'[/tpl]
Concern about hate crimes has become increasingly prominent among policymakers in many nations and at all levels of government in recent years. There have been many examples throughout modern-day Europe by  groups who harass and threaten many different racial groups.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl][tpl]Examples|date=September 2010[/tpl] In the United States, racial and religious biases have inspired most hate crimes.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The verb lynching is sometimes attributed to the actions of Charles Lynch, an 18th-century Virginia Quaker.  Lynch, other militia officers and justices of the peace rounded up Tories sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military.  Originally the term referred to organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals.  It later evolved to describe execution outside of "ordinary justice" and is associated with weak or nonexistent police authority, like in the Old West, and racism. Experts continue to debate the origin of the term.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
As Europeans began to colonize the world from the 16th century onward, indigenous peoples in the colonized areas, such as the Native Americans increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated intimidation and violence.Fred Fausz, "Jamestown at 400: Caught Between a Rock and a Slippery Slope", History News Network, George Mason University, 7 May 2007 During the past two centuries, some of the more typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include lynchings of African Americans, cross burnings to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods, assaults on white people traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods, assaults on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the painting of swastikas on Jewish synagogues and xenophobic responses to a variety of minority ethnic groups.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]
Examples like the murder of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom and the Wichita Massacre tend not to be classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] but they have meanwhile been described as "hate crimes against whites by blacks" by Conservative commentators such as David Horowitz (a conservative author and academic), Michelle Malkin (a commentator for the Fox News channel and a prolific conservative author) and Stuart Taylor, Jr. (journalist)."'Hate Crimes' and Double Standards" By Stuart Taylor, Jr. The Atlantic. May 29, 2007. The district attorneys in both these cases have specifically stated that while these incidents were indeed horrible, and had tremendous impacts on the communities affected by them, neither displayed evidence of being black-on-white racism, either upon initial or more in-depth review.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

==Victims in the United States==

Racist anti-black bias is the most frequently reported hate crime motivation in the United States. Of the 8,208 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2010, 48% were race related - with 70% of those having an anti-black bias.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2012[/tpl] Other frequently reported bias motivations were anti-jewish, anti-white, anti-hispanic, anti-islamic, and against a person's perceived sexual orientation. At times, these bias motivations overlap, as violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.[tpl]cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–995|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/44/5/980.short[/tpl]
The majority of victims of violent hate crime in 2003-2011 were from the White community (65%) followed by Hispanic (15%) and African American groups (13%)."Hate Crime Victimization, 2003-2011" (PDF). U.S. Department of Justice.
High profile murders motivated by the victims' sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of Sean W. Kennedy and Matthew Shepard. Kennedy was mentioned by Senator Gordon Smith in a speech on the floor of the US Senate while advocating such legislation.  The Matthew Shepard and James E. Byrd Jr. Hate crime Prevention Act was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, the disabled and military personnel and their family members.[tpl]citation needed|reason=military and families at least not obvious from linked article|date=June 2013[/tpl] This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.[tpl]clarify|"all-inclusive" how/45 years how?|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crime. This view would designate rape and domestic violence, as well as non-interpersonal violence against women such as the École Polytechnique massacre, as hate crime.[tpl]Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2YdCbgXjr-EC&pg=PA405 |chapter=Hate Crime Statutes: A Promising Tool for Fighting Violence Against Women |first=Marguerite |last=Angelari |title=Pornography, sex work, and hate speech |editor=Karen J.

==Psychological effects==

Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging psychological consequences, not only upon the direct victim but on others as well. A manual issued by the Attorney-General of the Province of Ontario in Canada lists the following consequences:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/french/crim/cpm/2005/HateCrimeDiscrimination.pdf |title=MANUEL DES POLITIQUES DE LA COURONNE  |date=21 March 2005  |format=PDF |language=French |accessdate=2009-06-21[/tpl]

==Hate crime laws==

Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:

===Eurasia===

====European Union====

Since 2002, with an amendment to the Convention on Cybercrime, the European Union mandates individual states to punish as a crime hate speech done through the internet.Arias, Martha L. INTERNET LAW - The European Union Criminalizes Acts of Racism and Xenophobia Committed through Computer Systems,  April 20, 2011

====Andorra====

Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or sex (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.

====Armenia====

Armenia has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).

====Austria====

Austria has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)).

====Azerbaijan====

Azerbaijan has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111).

====Belarus====

Belarus has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, § 64 (1), para. 9 (translated from the Russian), June 9, 1999.

====Belgium====

Belgium's Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of sex, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====

The Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."Office of the High Representative, Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, January 2003.

====Bulgaria====

Bulgarian criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and xenophobia, but a 1999 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."ECRI, Second Report on Bulgaria, adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000.

====Croatia====

Croatian Penal code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as "any crime committed out of hatred for someones race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute".[tpl]cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_06_71_1706.html |title=71 28.6.2006 Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Kaznenog zakona |publisher=Narodne-novine.nn.hr |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] On 1 January 2013 new Penal code will be introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on a "race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |title=Centar za LGBT ravnopravnost » Vlada prihvatila prijedloge Centra za LGBT ravnopravnost |publisher=Ravnopravnost.hr |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]

====Czech Republic====

The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law. 
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has three levels, to wit:
•	a circumstance determining whether an act is a crime – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, conviction for a hate crime is not possible. 
•	a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty – a hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
•	general aggravating circumstance – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation does not provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpráva o násilí z nenávisti v České republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-11[/tpl]

====Denmark====

Although Danish law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."ECRI, Second Report on Denmark, adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.  In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.
Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.

====Finland====

Finnish Criminal Code 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.EUMC, Racism and xenophobia in the E.U., p. 51. In addition, ethnic agitation ([tpl]lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan[/tpl]) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ([tpl]lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen[/tpl]), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an overt act that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of

====France====

In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe

====Georgia====

"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."

====Germany====

The German Criminal Code does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes hate speech under a number of different laws, including Volksverhetzung. In the German legal framework motivation is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] can be taken into consideration when determining the punishment; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland. Peter Lang: Frankfurt/Berlin/Bern/Bruxelles/New York/Oxford/Wien
Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18142 incidences for 2006, of which 17597 were motivated by right wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=FBI — 2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]  Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title=SPIEGEL ONLINE Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]

====Greece====

Article Law 927/1979 "Section 1,1 penalises incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence towards individuals or groups because of
their racial, national or religious origin, through public written or oral expressions; Section 1,2 prohibits the
establishment of, and membership in, organisations which organise propaganda and activities aimed at racial
discrimination; Section 2 punishes public expression of offensive ideas; Section 3 penalises the act of refusing,
in the exercise of one’s occupation, to sell a commodity or to supply a service on racial grounds."ECRI, Second Report on Greece, adopted on 1999-12-10, and made public on 2000-06-27. Public prosecutors may press charges even if the victim does not file a complaint. However, as of 2003, no convictions had been attained under the law.Sitaropoulos, N.: Executive Summary on Race Equality Directive, State of Play in Greece, section 5, 2003-10-12.

====Hungary====

Violent action, cruelty, and coercion by threat made on the basis of the victim's actual or perceived national, ethnic, religious status or membership in a particular social group are punishable under article 174/B of the Hungarian Criminal Code. This article was added to the Code in 1996.Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination : Hungary. 11/01/2002. A/57/18,paras.367-390.

====Iceland====

Section 233a of the Icelandic Penal Code states "Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly abuses a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to two years."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/135a/1940019.html |title=Icelandic Penal Code (in Icelandic) |publisher=Althingi.is |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]

"The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989" makes it an offense to incite hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, color, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the Traveller community, an indigenous minority group."
Ireland does not systematically collect hate crime data.

====Italy====

Italian criminal law, at Section 3 of Law No. 205/1993, the so-called Legge Mancino (Mancino law), contains a penalty-enhancement provision for all crimes motivated by racial, ethnic, national, or religious bias, but not for crimes motivated by sexual orientation.

====Kazakhstan====

In Kazakhstan, there are constitutional provisions prohibiting propaganda promoting racial or ethnic superiority.

====Kyrgyzstan====

In Kyrgyzstan, "the Constitution of the State party prohibits any kind of discrimination on grounds of origin, sex, race, nationality, language, faith, political or religious convictions or any other personal or social trait or circumstance, and that the prohibition against racial discrimination is also included in other legislation, such as the Civil, Penal and Labour Codes."CERD, Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 9 of the Convention; Concluding Observations: Kyrgyzstan, 1999.

====United Kingdom====

For England, Wales, and Scotland, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 makes hateful behaviour towards a victim based on the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) in a racial group or a religious group an aggravation in sentencing for specified crimes.Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c. 24) amended sections of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010024_en_5 For Northern Ireland, Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purpose.Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. A “racial group” is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A “religious group” is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the Public Order Act 1986, and offences under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.
The Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated. The Act requires a court also to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:

=====Scotland=====

In Scottish Common law[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence. There is specific legislation dealing with the offences of incitement of racial hatred, racially aggravated harassment and offences aggravated by religious prejudice. A Scottish Executive working group examined the issue of hate crime and ways of combating crime motivated by social prejudice, reporting in 2004.http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/8978[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl] Its main recommendations were not implemented, but in their manifestos for the Scottish Parliament election, 2007 several political parties included commitments to legislate in this area, including the Scottish National Party who now form the Scottish Government.  The Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 19 May 2008 by Patrick Harvie MSP,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/bills/09-AggPrej/index.htm |title=Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]  having been prepared with support from the Scottish Government, and was passed unanimously by the parliament on 3 June 2009.MSPs approve new hate crime laws BBC News 3 June 2009

====Canada====

“In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code”.
[tpl]cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161[/tpl]
In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):
''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''

A vast majority (84 per cent) of Hate crime perpetrators were “male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady  2010 page 163.).”

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and gays and lesbians (Silver et al., 2004).
During the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate related violence in Canada. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event erupted into a brawl that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.
The first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. “A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it’s prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996).”
Robert suggests that “Canada lags behind other nations in collecting comprehensive statistics on hate crime.”

====United States====

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime laws were passed after the American Civil War, beginning with the Civil Rights Act of 1871, to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes being committed by the Reconstruction era Ku Klux Klan. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the Civil Rights Act which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.".Streissguth (2003), p.20.
The first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for penalty enhancement in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included ancestry in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included creed and sex in 1982 and later disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. In the 1990s some state laws began to include age, marital status, membership in the armed forces, and membership in civil rights organizations.Streissguth (2003), p.20-21.
Criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included aggravated assault, assault and battery, vandalism, rape, threats and intimidation, arson, trespassing, stalking, and various "lesser" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes.Streissguth (2003), p.21.
Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the United States, federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the Matthew Shepard Act added  actual or perceived gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.
Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a civil cause of action in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics.State Hate Crime Laws, Anti-Defamation League, June 2006. Retrieved 2007-05-04.
According to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies.  Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 31.9% as simple assaults.  81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.Statistics, 2006 Hate Crime Statistics, 2006,[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]  Federal Bureau of Investigation
However, according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies.Statistics, 2007 Hate Crime Statistics, 2007,[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]  Federal Bureau of Investigation These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).Statistics, 2007 FBI Crime in the United States 2007,[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]  Federal Bureau of Investigation

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently though, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One prominent example is Mississippi's decision in 1990 to retry Byron De La Beckwith for the murder of Medgar Evers, a prominent figure in the NAACP.[tpl]cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48[/tpl]  This would be the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case would be re-opened. Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions and it resulted with a hung jury. However, he was finally sentenced to life in prison in 1994. Presented with testimony of two FBI informants who had infiltrated the KKK, the missing transcript from the first trial, the relocation of missing witnesses, numerous witness admissions of Beckwith bragging about his role in the murder and Beckwith’s own racist writings, a mixed race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. Even though De La Beckwith was 73 years of age when he was sentenced to life in prison, the 1994 conviction has been interpreted as a way for Mississippi to shed its racist past.[tpl]cite book|last=Alston, A.A. and Dickerson, J.L.|title=Devil’s Sanctuary: An Eye-Witness History of Mississippi Hate Crimes|year=2009|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, IL[/tpl]

===South America===

====Brazil====

In Brazil, hate crime laws focus on racism, racial injury, and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by death squadshttp://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm (Law 8072/1990, Article 1st, I) and genocide on the grounds of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion.http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm (Law 2889/1956, Article 1st) Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (crimes hediondos in Portuguese).Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.
The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662 |title=Racismo ou injúria racial? - Boletim Jurídico |publisher=Boletimjuridico.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl] Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the Penal Code establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, ethnicity, religion, origin, or the condition of being an aged or disabled person".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=DEL2848compilado |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl] On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from discrimination or prejudice on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm |title=L7716 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]
In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the wealth of all, with no prejudice as to origin, race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm

====Chile====

The Chilean Congress began a discussion on a piece of anti-discrimination in 2005, which was eventually passed in November, 2011. This legislation included an article that spoke expressly against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, on January 4, 2012, the Constitutional Tribunal (composed of senators from Chile's Independent Democratic Union) repealed the 2nd Article of the legislation (which applied primarily to sexual diversity).[tpl]cite web|author=Matthew Jenkin |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/un-calls-harsher-hate-crime-laws-chile300312 |title=UN calls for harsher hate crime laws in Chile |publisher=Gay Star News |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2013-01-21[/tpl]
On April 5, 2012, Chile's Congress passed most of an anti-discrimination law that would make it a crime to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, appearance or handicap.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17622162 | publisher=BBC News | title=Chile's Congress approves most of hate crime law | date=2012-04-05[/tpl]

==Support and opposition to hate crime laws==

===Support for hate crime laws===

Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.
In Wisconsin v. Mitchell, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found that penalty-enhancement hate crime statutes do not conflict with free speech rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising freedom of expression; rather, they allow courts to consider motive when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the First Amendment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=2011-10-12|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com[/tpl]

===Opposition to hate crime laws===

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992). Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, thought crimes.The Essayist (1998). Hate Crime Premise. 24 Jul. 1998.[tpl]Dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]Evenson, Brad (2003). Looking for thoughtcrime to crimestop. National Post.

In their book Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics, James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as “hate crimes” causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.Jacobs, James B. & Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 130–144 Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.[tpl]cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl] Some have argued that if it is true that all violent crimes are the result of the perpetrator's contempt for the victim, then all crimes are hate crimes. Thus, if there is no alternate rationale for prosecuting some people more harshly for the same crime based on who the victim is, then different defendants are treated unequally under the law, which violates the United States Constitution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/constitutionality.asp |title=Constitutional Challenges to Hate Crimes Statutes |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]
