==United Kingdom==

In England, corned beef hash is a traditional cheap and quick dish dating back many years. Corned beef (beef treated with saltpetre) is nearly always from a tin and almost always imported from South America[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]. Tinned corned beef was available more plentifully during war years (when fresh meat was heavily rationed) and a staple food in the armed forces. The meal is made with tinned corned beef, stirred with browned onions, before having liquid added (either gravy or stock, or tinned tomatoes) then having lightly boiled sliced potatoes layered over the top before being browned under a hot grill. Alternatively cubed boiled potatoes are stirred in. Some recipes would add peas or carrots.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
In Scotland, the dish of "stovies" is very similar to hash.  There are many variations on the dish, but all consist of a base of mashed or coarsely chopped potato, with onions and leftover meat, usually minced or roast beef although there are many variations including corned beef.

The meat packing company Hormel claims that it introduced corned beef hash and roast beef hash to the U.S. as early as 1950,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hormel.com/about/OurAdvertising/print/1950sRoastBeefHashAd.aspx|title=About Hormel > Our Advertising > Print > 1950s Roast Beef Hash Ad|publisher=Hormel|accessdate=July 18, 2011[/tpl] but "hash" of many forms was part of the American diet since at least the 19th century, as is attested by the availability of numerous recipes and the existence of many "hash houses" named after the dish.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-12-25/features/8802270412_1_hash-roast-beef-christmas-feast|title=The King of the Concoctions|accessdate=April 7, 2012 | work=Chicago Tribune|date=1988-12-25[/tpl]No Matter How You Chop It, Hash Makes Leftovers Into A Feast.

In Denmark, hash is known in Danish as "biksemad" (roughly translated, "tossed together food"), and it is a traditional leftover dish usually served with a fried egg, worcestershire sauce, pickled red beet slices and ketchup or Bearnaise sauce. The meat is usually pork, and the mixture is not mashed together into a paste, but rather the ingredients are coarsely diced and readily discernible in its cooked form.
In Sweden, there is a version of hash called pyttipanna[ref]
