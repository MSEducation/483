Loki's Minions Capture the Flag (LMCTF) was one of the first Quake II mods and the first ever capture the flag mod released for the game. It was created by Mike "Jormungard" Scandizzo of Clan Loki's Minions.  The mod was released the day after the Quake II source code was released and soon became very popular.  Its defining feature was the use of an off-hand grappling hook, which allowed the player to fly through the air while still being able to fire their weapon.

==Gameplay==

LMCTF is a Capture the Flag game.  There are two teams, Red and Blue.  The goal is to enter the other teams base, steal their flag and return it safely to your teams flag inside of your base.  The team with the most flag captures at the end of the match wins the game.

==Features==

LMCTF added many new features to the original Quake 2 game.  The off-hand grappling hook, power-up runes (Haste, Strength, Resist and Regeneration), plasma rifle, team radio and voice sounds, custom models, custom skins, custom maps, tournament mode and observer cam options are just a few of the additions.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lmctf.com/features.html | title = Loki's Minions Features | publisher = lmctf.com | accessdate = 2011-09-22 [/tpl]
