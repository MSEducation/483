Marlo Thomas was raised in Beverly Hills, California. Her parents called her Margo as a child, though she soon became known as Marlo, she told The New York Times, because of her childhood mispronunciation of the nickname.  She attended Marymount High School in Los Angeles. Thomas graduated from the University of Southern California with a teaching degree: "I wanted a piece of paper that said I was qualified to do something in the world," she said. She was also a member of the sorority Kappa Alpha Theta.[tpl]cite news| author=Judy Stone| title=And Now—Make Room for Marlo| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C17F83455117B93C6A91782D85F428685F9| work=The New York Times| date=4 September 1966| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2012-01-02[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early career===

Thomas appeared in many early TV shows including Bonanza, Ben Casey, Arrest and Trial, The Joey Bishop Show, The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, 77 Sunset Strip, and The Donna Reed Show, among others.
Her big break came in 1965 when she was cast by Mike Nichols in the London production of Neil Simon’s Barefoot in The Park, co-starring Daniel Massey, Kurt Kasner and Mildred Natwick. In 1986, she was once again cast by Nichols on Broadway in Andrew Bergman’s Social Security, co-starring Ron Silver and Olympia Dukakis.

===That Girl===

Thomas starred in an ABC pilot called Two's Company in 1965. Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of ABC programming executives. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show  about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic. Thomas, however, insured the show's success and it was put into production. 
The concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled That Girl, in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by Ted Bessell. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on Broadway. The series was the first television show to focus on a working, single girl who did not live with her parents, and paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman, following Lucille Ball, to produce her own series. That Girl aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the Nielsen ratings. 
In 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, Clairol, wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters. But Thomas rebuffed, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is a marriage. That Girl has since become popular in syndication. 

===Later career===
