It was there that he met the legendary Catholic activist Dorothy Day. Working with her Catholic Worker Movement, he began his commitment to social justice,[tpl]cite web|url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2007/09/29/|title=A Prairie Home Companion|date=2007-09-29[/tpl] and would one day go on to play Peter Maurin, cofounder of the Catholic Worker Movement, in Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story.

Sheen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/buzz/true-identity-charlie-sheen-tracing-roots-estevez-family|title=The True Identity of Charlie Sheen: Tracing The Roots of The Estevez Family|author=Erika Ramirez|publisher=Latina (magazine)[/tpl] In a 2003 Inside the Actors Studio interview, Sheen explained, "Whenever I would call for an appointment, whether it was a job or an apartment, and I would give my name, there was always that hesitation and when I'd get there, it was always gone. So I thought, I got enough problems trying to get an acting job, so I invented Martin Sheen. It's still Estevez officially. I never changed it officially. I never will. It's on my driver's license and passport and everything. I started using Sheen, I thought I'd give it a try, and before I knew it, I started making a living with it and then it was too late. In fact, one of my great regrets is that I didn't keep my name as it was given to me. I knew it bothered my dad."Stated in interview on Inside the Actors Studio, May 18, 2003[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/buzz/true-identity-charlie-sheen-tracing-roots-estevez-family|title=The True Identity of Charlie Sheen: Tracing The Roots of The Estevez Family|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Latina magazine|accessdate=28 February 2011[/tpl]

All but one decided to keep their own names when they began acting – Carlos made the decision to use his father's stage name, and is known as Charlie Sheen.
Charlie and his father jointly parodied their respective previous roles in the 1993 movie Hot Shots Part Deux: their river patrol boats passed each other, at which point they both shouted, "I loved you in Wall Street!" a film they both starred in as father and son in 1987.

He also appeared as a guest star in one episode of Two and a Half Men playing the father of Charlie's neighbor Rose (Melanie Lynskey), and another as guest star Denise Richards's father; at the time that episode aired, Richards was still married to Charlie. Martin also played a "future" version of Charlie in a VISA TV commercial. Martin has played other characters with his children. He starred in the film Bobby, which was directed by Emilio who also starred in the movie alongside his father. Renée had a supporting role in The West Wing, as one of President Josiah Bartlet's (Sheen) secretaries.
