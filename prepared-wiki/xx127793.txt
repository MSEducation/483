==I Really Got the Feeling==

While "Baby, I'm Burning" did get some country airplay in late 1978 and early 1979, it was the flip side — "I Really Got the Feeling" — that caught on with country music fans.
The song was a pop-styled ballad, written by Billy Vera, that bore no resemblance to the disco feel of "Baby, I'm Burning."  The subject matter of "I Really Got the Feeling" was about a woman who falls in love with a man at first sight, citing him as a virtuous individual. She plans to stay with him for the rest of her life, regardless of "what my Daddy might say."
"I Really Got the Feeling" became Parton's 10th No. 1 Billboard Hot Country Singles hit in January 1979.
