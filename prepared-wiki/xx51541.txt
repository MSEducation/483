[[EXIT (performance art group)]]

CATEGORIES: Crass, Theatre companies in the United Kingdom

EXIT were a performance art group during the mid-1970s. EXIT members Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher later founded anarchist punk rock band Crass, adopting many of EXIT's experimental/multi media techniques into Crass' presentation. 
Rimbaud acknowledges that EXIT in turn had been involved with the Fluxus Movement (of which Yoko Ono was a member). He also states that Crass was more influenced by the avant-garde than by any rock & roll precedent.
