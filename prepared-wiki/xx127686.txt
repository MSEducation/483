Southampton is a derelict station located along SEPTA's Fox Chase/Newtown Line located on Second Street Pike (PA-232) near Knowles Avenue in Upper Southampton, Pennsylvania.

==History==

Built in 1892, Southampton Station was a stop on the Reading Railroad's Newtown Line. It later became a part of SEPTA's Fox Chase Rapid Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, was closed on January 14, 1983,newtownline.pa-tec.org/history due to failing diesel train equipment (RDCs).
In addition, a labor dispute began within the SEPTA organization when the transit operator inherited 1,700 displaced employees from Conrail. SEPTA insisted on utilizing transit operators from the Broad Street Subway to operate Fox Chase-Newtown diesel trains, while Conrail requested that railroad motormen run the service. When a federal court ruled that SEPTA had to use Conrail employees in order to offer job assurance, SEPTA cancelled Fox Chase-Newtown trains.[tpl]cite news |first=Fredric N. |last=Tulsky |title=Conrail Staff Must Run Trains: court ruling bars SEPTA takeover |work=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=January 29, 1982[/tpl]SEPTA must use Conrail workers rather than its own personnel to run trains over the region's 13 commuter lines, a special federal court has ruled in a decision that offers some job assurance for 1,700 Conrail employees next year. The special court, in an opinion issued Wednesday, ruled that SEPTA had acted legally in October when it replaced Conrail workers with its former subway operators on the line. Service in the diesel-only territory north of Fox Chase was cancelled at that time, and Southampton Station still appears in publicly posted tariffs.SEPTA Tariff No. 154; effective July 1, 2009
Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.

==Fire==

Three months after SEPTA assumed operations, on January 2, 1982, the crossing at Second Street Pike just south of Southampton Station was the site of a fiery crash between a train, a gasoline truck, and a car. Five people were injured and the accident caused flames to rise fifty feet in the air and created a plume of black smoke visible for miles.[tpl]cite news |first=Ashley |last=Halsey, III |title=5 Hurt in Fiery Rail Collision |work=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=January 3, 1982[/tpl] Photographs from the fire indicate the crossing signal equipment was working properly, with warning lights continuing to warn motorists after the collision occurred.[tpl]cite news |first=Steve|last=Stecklow|title=Clues Sought in Crash of Train, Truck|work=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=January 4, 1982[/tpl] SEPTA general manager David L.
