==Route list==

List is current as of April 2014, according to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation.
The following routes are maintained by the Ministry of Transportation as part of British Columbia's highway system, but they are currently un-numbered:

==Yukon highways in British Columbia==

Highways 2 (Klondike Highway) and 3 (Haines Highway) in the northwest corner of the province are part of the Yukon territorial highway system and are not listed here or designated as BC highways.
Although some editions of The Milepost identify the B.C. portion of the Haines Highway as Highway 4, this is not an official highway number for the route.
Although the Alaska Highway crosses the 60th parallel north, and thus the border with the Yukon, nine times (including six crossings between historic miles 588 and 596), the highway route number changes just once, between Lower Post, B.C., and Watson Lake, Yukon.  The Yukon section east of here is maintained by Public Works Canada as part of the B.C. portion of Highway 97, while the B.C. section west of here is maintained by the Yukon Government as part of Yukon Highway 1.

==Defunct route numbers==

The first two freeways built in British Columbia were given 400-series numbers, much like the 400-Series Highways in Ontario.  Highways 401 and 499 were renumbered 1 and 99 respectively in 1973. The section of Highway 37 between Terrace and Kitimat was known as Highway 25 until 1986.  In recent years, many routes have been devolved to regional and/or municipal authorities and have lost their official highway status, notably the Fraser Highway in the Lower Mainland (formerly part of Highway 1A) and West Saanich Road on Vancouver Island (formerly Highway 17A). Also King George Highway through Surrey was renamed by the City in 2010 to King George Boulevard. (formerly British Columbia Highway 99A).  Some roads have informal highway numbers (e.g. 40, 51, 59) used by locals and are referred to by these numbers on provincial highway condition listings but are not signed as highways or listed as provincial highways on the Ministry of Transportation website.
