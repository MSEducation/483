==Context==

In 2011, Kandahar was one of the last Taliban strongholds.[tpl]cite news|last=Boone|first=Jon|title=Kandahar mayor killed by suicide bomber with explosives in turban|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/27/kandahar-mayor-killed-explosives-turban|work=UK Guardian Website|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|accessdate=2011-11-18|location=London|date=2011-07-27[/tpl]
In June 2011, NATO forces were launching their major offensive in Kandahar, as part of the new war strategy that was launched earlier that year in Marjah. The new strategy focused on clearing Taliban strongholds while protecting local population. They brought in large numbers of U.S. and Afghan troops into the city to participate in the "clearing phase" of the plan.
Kandahar was also going through internal problems when Afghan insurgents assassinated the Mayor. A suicide bomber, who hid the bomb under his turban, attacked Ghulam Haider Hamidi at his office.
