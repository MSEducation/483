The Border Route Trail is a [tpl]convert|65|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long hiking trail that crosses the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in the far northeast corner of Minnesota (Arrowhead) and follows the international border between Minnesota and Ontario, Canada. It connects with the Superior Hiking Trail on its eastern terminus and with the Kekekabic Trail on its western end at the Gunflint Trail (Cook Cty. Road 12). In addition to the eastern and western termini, the Border Route Trail can be accessed through several spur and connecting trails, allowing for hiking trips ranging from short day-hikes to multiday backpacking expeditions. 
The Border Route Trail Association was incorporated in 2004 to coordinate the maintenance and increase public awareness of the trail. The National Park Service is pursuing a re-route in northern Minnesota which will include the Border Route Trail into the North Country Trail.
The trail was planned and built in the early 1970s by the Minnesota Rovers Outing Club with the help of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the US Forest Service. It was the first long-distance, wilderness backpacking and hiking trail in Minnesota planned and constructed by volunteers.
