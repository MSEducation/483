The engine architecture includes a solid wide-chord swept fan with a 4-stage booster, followed by a 4 axial stage + 1 centrifugal stage high pressure compressor. In early stage of the project, the overall pressure ratio was 27:1 with a core pressure ratio of "over 17".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ebace-convention-news/2007-05-04/snecma-silvercrest-core-engine-set-first-run |title=Snecma Silvercrest core engine set for first run |publisher=AINonline.com |author=Thierry Dubois |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2013-07-24[/tpl] The high pressure compressor is driven by a single stage turbine, while the [tpl]convert|42.5|in|m|adj=on[/tpl] fan is coupled to a 4-stage low pressure turbine.
Turbomeca, which like Snecma is a part of the SAFRAN Group, participates in the design of the centrifugal compressor stage.
Early design featured a smaller 40-inch fan, no booster, one more high pressure compressor stage, one low pressure turbine stage less and a lower 4.5 bypass ratio.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aviation-international-news/2007-04-30/snecma-silvercrest-core-run-later-year |title=Snecma Silvercrest core to run later this year |publisher=AINonline.com |author=Thierry Dubois |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-24[/tpl]
The high pressure spool and combustor have been run in a US$ 120 million core-demonstrator called SM-X, reaching the take-off speed of 20,300rpm.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ebace-convention-news/2008-05-19/snecma-silvercrest-engine-completes-core-tests|title=Snecma Silvercrest engine completes core tests|author=Thierry Dubois|date=2008-05-20|accessdate=2013-07-24[/tpl]

Engine certification, originally pencilled in for the end of 2010 or early 2011, has been re-scheduled for 2015.
