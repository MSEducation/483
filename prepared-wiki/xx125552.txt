Martin Henriksson, born 30 October 1974 in Sweden, is one of two guitarists, one of the founding members and the main songwriter of the Swedish death metal band Dark Tranquillity.

==Biography==

When Dark Tranquillity formed in 1989 Henriksson was the bassist up until 1999. He switched to guitar when their ex-guitarist Fredrik Johansson quit, but recorded bass on the band's latest album Construct. 
Alongside Mikael Stanne, Henriksson is the only member of the band to receive songwriting credit on every DT album.  He took over from Niklas Sundin as the main songwriter during the Projector era, shortly before switching to guitar. However, on their latest album Construct he has writing credit for only two songs. 
Dark Tranquillity is Henriksson's only musical project.

==Style==

In Dark Tranquillity, he plays both rhythms and melodies. He is known for his smooth playing style, while Niklas Sundin, Dark Tranquillity's other guitarist, has a more harsh style. He normally does not play solos (Sundin usually performs them).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/interviews/martin-henriksson-niklas-sundin-dark-tranquillity/ |title=Guitar Lessons, Interviews, News, Reviews, & More | Guitar Messenger â€“ Martin Henriksson & Niklas Sundin Interview (Dark Tranquillity) |publisher=Guitarmessenger.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
Some exceptions to that are the songs 'Focus Shift' and 'Lost to Apathy', in whose videos Martin is seen playing slow, smooth leads. His riffs are sometimes complemented with pick slides and harmonics. When he was on bass (using picks), he also played melodies.

==Equipment==

Martin's main stage guitars include a Gibson Explorer and a Gibson Les Paul Studio Lite. He previously used Rocktron Prophesy rack mounted pre-amps, but after the Damage Done tour, he and Niklas Sundin begun using Peavey 5150 and Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier amplifiers along with Behringer V-AMP 2 PRO modeling processors. In the making off We Are The Void, they show a Peavey 6505s.
