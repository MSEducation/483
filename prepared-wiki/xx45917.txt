Medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), as medical therapy to treat disease or alleviate symptoms. The Cannabis plant has a history of medicinal use dating back thousands of years across many cultures.[tpl]Cite journal |author = Ben Amar M |title = Cannabinoids in medicine: a review of their therapeutic potential |journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume = 105 |issue = 1–2 |pages = 1–25 |year = 2006 |doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.001 |pmid = 16540272  |url=http://www.doctordeluca.com/Library/WOD/WPS3-MedMj/CannabinoidsMedMetaAnalysis06.pdf |format= PDF|type=Review[/tpl]  Its usage in modern times is controversial, and in recent years the American Medical Association, the MMA, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and other medical organizations have issued statements opposing its usage for medicinal purposes.[tpl]cite web|title=AMA Reaffirms Opposition to Marijuana Legalization|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/11/20/ama-reaffirms-opposition-to-marijuana-legalization|accessdate=25 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=American Society of Addiction Medicine Rejects Use of 'Medical Marijuana'|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-society-of-addiction-medicine-rejects-use-of-medical-marijuana-citing-dangers-and-failure-to-meet-standards-of-patient-care-118534464.html|accessdate=25 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Minnesota doctors oppose medical marijuana bill|url=http://www.bringmethenews.com/2014/03/18/minnesota-doctors-oppose-medical-marijuana-bill/|accessdate=25 April 2014[/tpl]
Cannabis has been used to reduce nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy and people with AIDS, and to treat pain and muscle spasticity;[tpl]cite journal |author=Borgelt LM, Franson KL, Nussbaum AM, Wang GS |title=The pharmacologic and clinical effects of medical cannabis |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=195–209 |date=February 2013 |pmid=23386598 |doi=10.1002/phar.1187 |type=Review[/tpl] its use for other medical applications has been studied, but there is insufficient data for conclusions about safety and efficacy. Short-term use increases minor adverse effects, but does not appear to increase major adverse effects. Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear, and there are safety concerns including memory and cognition problems, risk for dependence and the risk of children taking it by accident.
Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating extracts, and taking capsules. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol (available in the United States (US) and Canada) and nabilone (available in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), and the US). Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. In the US, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 20 states and the District of Columbia have decided they are no longer willing to prosecute individuals merely for the possession or sale of marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's marijuana sale regulations. However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.[tpl]cite web|title=Court upholds crackdown on pot dispensaries|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/01/15/court-upholds-crackdown-on-pot-dispensaries/|work=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=3 March 2014|author=Bob Egelko|date=15 January 2014[/tpl]

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved smoked cannabis for any condition or disease as it deems evidence is lacking concerning safety and efficacy of cannabis for medical use. The FDA issued an 2006 advisory against smoked medical cannabis stating; "marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision."[tpl]Cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108643.htm |title=Inter-agency advisory regarding claims that smoked marijuana is a medicine |publisher=fda.gov |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2012-12-24 [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] The National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA states that "Marijuana itself is an unlikely medication candidate for several reasons: (1) it is an unpurified plant containing numerous chemicals with unknown health effects; (2) it is typically consumed by smoking further contributing to potential adverse effects; and (3) its cognitive impairing effects may limit its utility".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/tib/marijuana.html |title=Nida: Marijuana, An update from the National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=Nida.nih.gov |date=February 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl]
The Institute of Medicine, run by the United States National Academy of Sciences, conducted a comprehensive study in 1999[tpl]update after|2013|12|6[/tpl] assessing the potential health benefits of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids. The study concluded that smoking cannabis is not to be recommended for the treatment of any disease condition, but that nausea, appetite loss, pain and anxiety can all be mitigated by cannabis. While the study expressed reservations about smoked cannabis due to the health risks associated with smoking, the study team concluded that until another mode of ingestion was perfected providing the same relief as smoked cannabis, there was no alternative. In addition, the study pointed out the inherent difficulty in marketing a non-patentable herb, as pharmaceutical companies will likely make smaller investments in product development if the result is not patentable. The Institute of Medicine stated that there is little future in smoked cannabis as a medically approved medication, while in the report also concluding that for certain patients, such as the terminally ill or those with debilitating symptoms, the long-term risks are not of great concern.[tpl]MEDRS|date=December 2013[/tpl]  [tpl]update after|2013|12|6[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author= Watson SJ, Benson JA Jr, Joy JE |title=Marijuana and medicine: assessing the science base: a summary of the 1999 Institute of Medicine report |year=2000 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=547–52 |pmid=10839332 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.6.547  [/tpl][tpl]update after|2013|12|6[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book |editor= Joy JE, Watson SJ, Benson JA |year=1999 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309071550 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-07155-0 |oclc=246585475 |accessdate=2013-12-18[/tpl] Citing "the dangers of cannabis and the lack of clinical research supporting its medicinal value" the American Society of Addiction Medicine in March 2011 issued a white paper recommending a halt on use of marijuana as medication in the U.S., even in states where it had been declared legal.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-society-of-addiction-medicine-rejects-use-of-medical-marijuana-citing-dangers-and-failure-to-meet-standards-of-patient-care-118534464.html |title=American Society of Addiction Medicine Rejects Use of 'Medical Marijuana,' Citing Dangers and Failure To Meet Standards of Patient Care, March 23, 2011 |location=Maryland |agency=PR Newswire |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.asam.org/MedicalMarijuana.html |title=Medical Marijuana, American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2010 |publisher=Asam.org |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-04-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]

A 2010 Cochrane review said that cannabinoids were "probably effective" in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children, but with a high side effect profile (mainly drowsiness, dizziness, altered moods, and increased appetite).  Less common side effects were "occular problems, orthostatic hypotension, muscle twitching, pruritis, vagueness, hallucinations, lightheadedness and dry mouth".[tpl]cite journal |author=Phillips RS, Gopaul S, Gibson F, et al. |title=Antiemetic medication for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in childhood |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD007786|year=2010|pmid=20824866 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007786.pub2 |subscription=yes |type=Review [/tpl]

===HIV/AIDS===

Evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with HIV/AIDS or for anorexia associated with AIDS; studies as of 2013 suffer from effects of bias, small sample size, and lack of long-term data.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lutge EE, Gray A, Siegfried N|title=The medical use of cannabis for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=4 |issue= |pages=CD005175 |year=2013 |pmid=23633327 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005175.pub3|subscription=yes |type=Review [/tpl]

===Pain===

Cannabis appears to be somewhat effective in treatment of chronic pain, including pain caused by neuropathy and possibly also that due to fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.[tpl]cite journal|author=Martín-Sánchez E, Furukawa TA, Taylor J, Martin JL|title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of cannabis treatment for chronic pain |journal=Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.) |date=November 2009|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1353–68|pmid=19732371|type= Review, meta-analysis|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00703.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Lynch ME, Campbell F|title=Cannabinoids for treatment of chronic non-cancer pain; a systematic review of randomized trials|journal=British journal of clinical pharmacology|date=November 2011|volume=72|issue=5|pages=735–44|pmid=21426373 |type=Review|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.03970.x|pmc=3243008[/tpl] A 2009 review states it was unclear if the benefits were greater than the risks, while a 2011 review considered it generally safe for this use.

===Multiple sclerosis===

Studies of the efficacy of cannabis in treating multiple sclerosis have produced varying results. The combination of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) extracts give subjective relief of spasticity, though objective post-treatment assessments do not reveal significant changes. A trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if other treatments have not been effective. Its use for MS is approved in ten countries. A 2012 review found no problems with tolerance, abuse or addiction.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=23011861|year=2012|last1=Oreja-Guevara|first1=C|title=Treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: New perspectives regarding the use of cannabinoids|volume=55|issue=7|pages=421–30|journal=Revista de neurologia |type=Review|language=es [/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

A 2013 literature review said that exposure to marijuana had biologically-based physical, mental, behavioral and social health consequences and was "associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, and vasculature".[tpl]cite journal |author=Gordon AJ, Conley JW, Gordon JM |title=Medical consequences of marijuana use: a review of current literature |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=15 |issue=12 |page=419 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24234874 |doi=10.1007/s11920-013-0419-7 |type=Review[/tpl] There are insufficient data to draw strong conclusions about the safety of medical cannabis, although short-term use is associated with minor adverse effects such as dizziness.

==Pharmacology==

The genus Cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids: Cannabis indica  and Cannabis sativa, which are listed as Schedule I medicinal plants in the US; a third species, Cannabis ruderalis, has few psychogenic properties. Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids[tpl]cite journal |author=Downer EJ, Campbell VA |title=Phytocannabinoids, CNS cells and development: a dead issue? |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=91–8 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20078688 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00102.x|type=Review[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Burns TL, Ineck JR |year = 2006 |title = Cannabinoid analgesia as a potential new therapeutic option in the treatment of chronic pain |journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume = 40 |issue = 2 | pages = 251–260 |pmid = 16449552 |doi=10.1345/aph.1G217 |type=Review[/tpl] – chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain.  As of 2012, more than 20 cannabinoids were being studied by the U.S. FDA.[tpl]cite journal |author=Svrakic DM, Lustman PJ, Mallya A, Lynn TA, Finney R, Svrakic NM |title=Legalization, decriminalization & medicinal use of cannabis: a scientific and public health perspective |journal=Mo Med |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=90–8 |year=2012 |pmid=22675784 |type=Review[/tpl]
The most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC).  Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.

===Methods of consumption===

Smoking is the means of administration of cannabis for many consumers, and the most common method of medical cannabis consumption in the US as of 2013.  It is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely as there are different ways of preparing cannabis for consumption (smoked, applied as oils, eaten, or drunk) and a lack of production controls. The potential for adverse effects from smoke inhalation makes smoking a less viable option than oral preparations.
Cannabis vaporizers have gained popularity because of the perception among users that less harmful chemicals are ingested when components are inhaled via aerosol rather than smoke.
Cannabinoid medicines are available in pill form (dronabinol and nabilone) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray (nabiximols). Oral preparations are "problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down Δ9THC and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations".

===Cannabinoid compounds===

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, was identified in the 1960s as the cannabinoid primarily responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis; in the 1990s, after the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, researchers began to study and better understand how cannabinoids acted on these receptors. THC is associated – more than any other cannabinoid – with most of the pharmacologic effects of cannabis.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major constituent of medical cannabis; it is a nonpsychotropic and how it works on brain receptors is not known. CBD represents up to 40% of extracts of Cannabis sativa. A 2007 review said CBD had shown potential to relieve convulsion, inflammation, cough, congestion and nausea, and to inhibit cancer cell growth.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mechoulam R, Peters M, Murillo-Rodriguez E, Hanus LO |title=Cannabidiol--recent advances |journal=Chem. Biodivers. |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=1678–92 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17712814 |doi=10.1002/cbdv.200790147|type=Review[/tpl]  Preliminary studies have also shown potential over psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Campos AC, Moreira FA, Gomes FV, Del Bel EA, Guimarães FS |title=Multiple mechanisms involved in the large-spectrum therapeutic potential of cannabidiol in psychiatric disorders |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=367 |issue=1607 |pages=3364–78 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23108553 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2011.0389|pmc=3481531 |type=Review[/tpl] Because cannabidiol relieves the aforementioned symptoms, cannabis strains with a high amount of CBD may benefit people with multiple sclerosis or frequent anxiety attacks.[tpl]cite journal |author = Lakhan SE, Rowland M |year = 2009 |title = Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review |journal = BMC Neurology |volume = 9 |page = 59 |pmid = 19961570 |pmc = 2793241 |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-59|type=Review[/tpl]
Cannabinol (CBN) is a product of THC and has mild psychtropic effects.

===Botanical strains===

Cannabis indica produces a higher level of cannabidiol (abbreviated CBD) relative to THC (the primary psychoactive component in medical and recreational cannabis). Cannabis sativa, on the other hand, produces a higher level of THC relative to CBD.[tpl]mcn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Medical use of sativa is associated with a cerebral high, and many patients experience stimulating effects. For this reason, sativa is often used for daytime treatment. It may cause more of a euphoric, "high" sensation, and tends to stimulate hunger, making it potentially useful to patients with eating disorders or anorexia. Sativa also exhibits a higher tendency to induce anxiety and paranoia, so patients prone to these effects may limit treatment with pure sativa, or choose hybrid strains.[tpl]mcn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Cannabis indica is associated with sedative effects and is often preferred for night time use, including for treatment of insomnia.[tpl]mcn|date=December 2013[/tpl] Indica is also associated with a more "stoned" or meditative sensation than the euphoric, stimulating effects of sativa, possibly because of a higher CBD-to-THC ratio.[tpl]medical citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Many strains of cannabis are currently cultivated for medical use, including strains of both species in varying potencies, as well as hybrid strains designed to incorporate the benefits of both species. Hybrids commonly available can be heavily dominated by either Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica, or relatively balanced, such as so-called "50/50" strains.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Cannabis strains with relatively high CBD-to-THC ratios, usually indica-dominant strains, are less likely to induce anxiety. This may be due to CBD's receptor antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid receptor, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic effect.   This likely means the high concentrations of CBD found in Cannabis indica mitigate the anxiogenic effect of THC significantly.[tpl]mcn|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Pharmacologic products===

In the U.S., the FDA has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine: dronabinol and nabilone.  Dronabinol, synthetic THC, is listed as Schedule III, meaning it has some potential for dependence, and nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is Schedule II, indicating high potential for side effects and addiction. Nabiximols, an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of Cannabis sativa and containing THC and CBD, is not approved in the U.S., but is approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand as of 2013.
As an antiemetic, these medications are usually used when conventional treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy fail to work.
Nabiximols is used for treatment of spasticity associated with MS when other therapies have not worked, and when an initial trial demonstrates "meaningful improvement". Trials for FDA approval in the U.S. are underway. It is also improved in several European countries for overactive bladder and vomiting. When sold as Savitex as a mouth spray, the prescribed daily dose in Sweden delivers a maximum of 32.4 mg of THC and 30 mg of CBD; mild to moderate dizziness is common during the first few weeks.Sativex, FASS-Allmänhet (only in Swedish), Läkemedelsindustriföreningens Service AB
Relative to inhaled consumption, peak concentration of oral THC is delayed, and it may be difficult to determine optimal dosage because of variability in patient aborption.

==Society and culture==

===Methods of acquisition===

The method of obtaining medical cannabis varies by region and by legislation. In the US, most consumers grow their own or buy it from dispensaries in the states and the District of Columbia which permit the use of medical cannabis.
The authors of report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users "game the system" to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition, but then use it for nonmedical purposes – though the truth of this claim is hard to measure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Reinarman C, Nunberg H, Lanthier F, Heddleston T |title=Who are medical marijuana patients?

Marijuana vending machines for selling or dispensing cannabis are in use in the United States and are planned to be used in Canada.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/10/16/pot-vending-machines-to-start-rolling-into-canada-after-firm-partners-with-u-s-company/ |title= The pot vending machine’s first foreign market?

===Programs===

As of  2011, 16 US states and the District of Columbia have public medical cannabis programs, but its use remains illegal by federal law.[tpl]COI source|date=December 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author= Clark PA, Capuzzi K, Fick C|title=Medical marijuana: Medical necessity versus political agenda |year=2011 |journal=Medical Science Monitor |volume=17 |issue=12|pages=RA249–61 |pmid=22129912 |pmc=3628147|doi=10.12659/MSM.882116 |type=Review[/tpl][tpl]update after|2013|12|9[/tpl] In 1978 the US government created a program  called the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program which dispenses cannabis cigarettes to 20 people with debilitating conditions including glaucoma and a rare bone disease.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] The program was "closed to new candidates in 1991", but as of 2013, allowed four people previously in the program to continue receiving medical cannabis.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===National and international regulations, classification and patent===

Medical use of cannabis or preparation containing THC as the active substance is legalized in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Israel, Netherlands, Spain, the UK and some states in the US, although it is illegal under US federal law.
Cannabis is in Schedule IV of the United Nations' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, making it subject to special restrictions. Article 2 provides for the following, in reference to Schedule IV drugs:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/single-convention.html|title=Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 As amended by the 1972 Protocol|date=13 March 1961|work=International Narcotics Control Board|publisher=United Nations|pages=2–3|accessdate=17 August 2009|format=PDF[/tpl]
The convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to allow medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare. The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators, manufacturers and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required "for medical and scientific purposes."
A number of medical organizations have endorsed reclassification of marijuana to allow for further study. These include, but are not limited to:
Other medical organizations recommend a halt to using marijuana as a medicine in U.S.

==Research==

The Schedule I classification of cannabis in the US makes the study of medical cannabis difficult. Another issue for research is the habit to mix cannabis with tobacco or switch between tobacco and cannabis.
Anecdotal evidence and pre-clinical research has suggested that cannabis or cannabinoids may be beneficial for treating Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease, but follow-up studies of people with these conditions has not produced good evidence of therapeutic potential.[tpl]cite journal |year=2009 |author=Iuvone T, Esposito G, De Filippis D, et al |title=Cannabidiol: A promising drug for neurodegenerative disorders? |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=65–75|doi=10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00065.x |journal=CNS neuroscience & therapeutics  |pmid=19228180 |type= Review [/tpl]  A 2001 paper argued that cannabis had properties that made it potentially applicable to the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and on that basis research on this topic should be permitted, despite the legal difficulties of the time.[tpl]update after|2013|12|6[/tpl] [tpl]Cite journal |author= Carter GT, Rosen BS |pmid=11467101|year=2001 |title=Marijuana in the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|volume=18|issue=4|pages=264–70|journal=The American journal of hospice & palliative care |type= Review |doi= 10.1177/104990910101800411[/tpl]

Cannabinoids have been proposed for the treatment of primary anorexia nervosa, but have no measurable beneficial effect.[tpl]cite book|author=Ethan B Russo|title=Cannabis and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutic Potential|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qH-2Lj9x7L4C&pg=PT191|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-61493-4|page=191[/tpl] The authors of a 2003 paper argued that cannabinoids might have useful future clinical applications in treating digestive diseases.[tpl]update after|2013|12|6[/tpl] [tpl]Cite journal|author=Di Carlo G, Izzo AA |title=Cannabinoids for gastrointestinal diseases: potential therapeutic applications |journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs |volume=12|issue=1 |pages=39–49 |year=2003 |pmid=12517253 |doi=10.1517/13543784.12.1.39 |type= Review[/tpl] Laboratory experiments have shown that cannabinoids found in marijuana may have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.

===Cancer===

Cannabinoids have shown exhibited some anti-cancer effects in laboratory experiments although there has been little research into their use as a cancer treatment in people.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bowles|first=DW|coauthors=O'Bryant, CL; Camidge, DR; Jimeno, A|title=The intersection between cannabis and cancer in the United States|journal=Critical reviews in oncology/hematology |date=July 2012 |volume=83|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=22019199|type=Review|doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.09.008[/tpl] Laboratory experiments have suggested that cannabis and cannabinoids have anticarcinogenic, antitumor and anticancer effects,[tpl]cite web | publisher = Health Canada | url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/med/infoprof-eng.php | title = Cannabis (marihuana, marijuana) and the cannabinoids  | date = February 2013 | accessdate = December 2, 2013[/tpl] including a potential effect on breast and lung cancer cells.[tpl]cite web|title=Cannabis and Cannabinoids (PDQ®)|url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page4 |work=National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=2 August 2013[/tpl] The National Cancer Institute reports that [tpl]As of|2013|11|lc=y[/tpl] there have been no trials on the use of cannabis to treat cancer in people, and only one small trial using delta-9-THC.[tpl]cite web | publisher = National Cancer Institute | title = Cannabis and Cannabinoids: Human/Clinical Studies | accessdate = December 2, 2013 | date = November 21, 2013 | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page5[/tpl] Although there is a large and growing volume of research, claims that there is evidence showing that cannabis cures cancer are, according to Cancer Research UK, "highly misleading", and prevalent on the internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2012/07/25/cannabis-cannabinoids-and-cancer-the-evidence-so-far/|title=Cannabis, cannabinoids and cancer – the evidence so far|last=Arney|first=Kat|date=2012-07-25|publisher=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl]
There is no firm evidence than cannabis helps reduce the risk of getting cancer; whether it increases the risk is difficult to establish, since most users combine its use with tobacco smoking, and this complicates research.

===Glaucoma===

The American Glaucoma Society noted that while cannabis can help lower intraocular pressure, it recommended against its use because of "its side effects and short duration of action, coupled with a lack of evidence that it use alters the course of glaucoma."[tpl]cite web|first=Henry|last=Jampel|title=Position statement on marijuana and the treatment of glaucoma|url=http://www.americanglaucomasociety.net/patients/position_statements/marijuana_glaucoma|publisher=American Glaucoma Society|accessdate=November 2013|date=10 August 2009[/tpl] As of 2008 relatively little research had been done concerning effects of cannabinoids on the eye.[tpl]cite journal|author=Yazulla S|title=Endocannabinoids in the retina: from marijuana to neuroprotection |journal=Progress in retinal and eye research |date=Sep 2008|volume=27|issue=5 |pages=501–26|pmid=18725316 |type=Review|doi=10.1016/j.preteyeres.2008.07.002|pmc=2584875[/tpl]

A 2009 Cochrane review examined the two controlled trials to date using cannabinoids of any preparation type for the treatment of tics or TS (Muller-Vahl 2002, and Muller-Vahl 2003). Both trials compared delta-9-THC; 28 patients were included in the two studies (8 individuals participated in both studies). Both studies reported a positive effect on tics, but "the improvements in tic frequency and severity were small and were only detected by some of the outcome measures".  The sample size was small and a high number of individuals either dropped out of the study or were excluded. The original Muller-Vahl studies reported individuals who remained in the study; patients may drop out when adverse effects are too high or efficacy is not evident.  The authors of the original studies acknowledged few significant results after Bonferroni correction.
Cannabinoid medication might be useful in the treatment of the symptoms in patients with TS, but the 2009 review found that the two relevant studies of cannibinoids in treating tics had attrition bias, and that there was "not enough evidence to support the use of cannabinoids in treating tics and obsessive compulsive behaviour in people with Tourette's syndrome".[tpl]cite journal|author=Curtis A, Clarke CE, Rickards HE |title=Cannabinoids for Tourette's Syndrome |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006565 |year=2009 |pmid=19821373 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006565.pub2 |subscription=yes |type=Review[/tpl]
