The Wisconsin Institute for Torah Study also known as WITS is a Orthodox High school for boys in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is an affiliate of Chofetz Chaim.

==Location==

It is located on Lake Drive in the Upper East Side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, overlooking Lake Michigan. It is on the UWM campus, a five minute walk from the main campus.

==History==

WITS was founded around the 1980s. Since then, they have moved to a bigger building. In 2004 they added another section to the building. It consists of a Beis Medresh, Classrooms, and a Computer Lab. It would have also included a gym and a new dining room, turning the old dining room in to office space, but legal issues got in the way. As the building was built in the very early 1900s and is considered a historic landmark of Milwaukee, they had to place the new building behind the old building, hiding it from sight, while also making it with the same type and color materiel as the old building. On June 17 2010, the third floor caught on fire, due to electric malfunctions.
