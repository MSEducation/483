By 15K, Kiplagat had joined the pack of 7 leaders, which also included Jia Chaofeng, Lucy Wangui Kabuu, Valentine Jepkorir Kipketer, Meselech Melkamu, Feyse Tadese and Kayoko Fukushi with the rest of the field being single or double marathoners, without any chase group.  The pack lost individuals, Jia was the first to exit, followed by Tadese, Kipketer and Kabuu.  By the time Fukushi lost some ground, the closest remaining chaser was her teammate Ryoko Kizaki over a minute back.  When Melkamu left, she left quickly leaving a two woman race to the finish.  In the shadow of the stadium, Kiplagat pulled away from Straneo through the Olympic Park to a 12-second victory, Fukushi almost 2 minutes back to get the bronze.  Kiplagat is the first woman to repeat as champion in the marathon.http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1872737/report-edna-kiplagat-denies-valeria-straneo-to-retain-marathon-title
