[[Segol (trope)]]

CATEGORIES: Cantillation marks

Segol ([tpl]lang-he-n|1=סְגוֹל֒[/tpl]   also known as Segolta, with variant English spellings), is a cantillation mark found in the Torah, Haftarah, and other books of the Hebrew Bible. The Segol occurs together with a preceding Zarka, sometimes with a Munach preceding one or both.
The Segol group is considered to be a disjunctive. It occurs in place of the Katan group or a Zakef gadol.Concordance of the Hebrew accents in the Hebrew Bible: Concordance ..., Volume 1 By James D. Price, page 18 It is the strongest disjunctive group ahead of the Etnachta group.Chanting the Hebrew Bible By Joshua R. Jacobson, page 102
The Hebrew word סְגוֹל֒ translates into English as bunch, referring to a bunch of grapes. This is reflected in its appearance as a three-dot symbol.
