Väinämöinen ([tpl]IPA-fi|ˈʋæinæˌmøinen[/tpl]) is the central character in the Finnish folklore and the main character in the national epic Kalevala.  His name comes from the Finnish word väinä, meaning stream pool. Originally a Finnish god,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] he was described as an old and wise man, and he possessed a potent, magical voice.

==Väinämöinen in Finnish mythology==

The first extant mention of Väinämöinen in literature is from a list of Tavastian gods by Mikael Agricola in 1551. He and other writers described Väinämöinen as the god of chants, songs and poetry. In many stories Väinämöinen was the central figure at the birth of the world. The Finnish national epic, Kalevala tells of his birth in the creation story in its opening sections.  This myth displays elements of creation from chaos and from a cosmic egg, as well as earth diver creation.
At first there were only primal waters and Sky.  But Sky also had a daughter named Ilmatar.  One day, seeking a resting place, Ilmatar descended to the waters.  There she swam and floated for 700 years until she noticed a beautiful bird also searching for a resting place.  Ilmatar raised her knee towards the bird so it could land, which it did.  The bird then laid six eggs made of gold and one made of iron.  As the bird incubated her eggs Ilmatar's knee grew warmer and warmer until finally she was burned by the heat and reacted by jerking her leg.  This motion dislodged the eggs, which  then fell and shattered in the waters.  Land was formed from the lower part of one of the eggshells while sky formed from the top.  The egg whites turned into the moon and stars, and the yolk became the sun.
Ilmatar spent another few hundred years floating in the waters, admiring the results of these broken eggs until she could not resist the urge growing inside her to continue creation.  Her foot prints became pools for fish and simply by pointing she created contours in the land.  In this way she made all that is.  Then one day she gave birth to Väinämöinen, the first man, whose father was the sea.  Väinämöinen swam off until he found land, but the land was barren so he asked the Great Bear in the sky for help.  A boy carrying seeds was sent down to him, and this boy spread flora across the land.[tpl]harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|2009[/tpl] - entry "Finnish Creation" Retrieved 2010-04-30
In the eighteenth century folklore collected by Cristfried Ganander, Väinämöinen is told to be son of Kaleva and thus brother of Ilmarinen.

==Väinämöinen in Kalevala==

In the ninteenth century, some folklorists, most notably Elias Lönnrot, the writer of Kalevala, disputed Väinämöinen's mythological background, claiming that he was an ancient hero, or an influential shaman who lived perhaps in the ninth century.[ref]*
