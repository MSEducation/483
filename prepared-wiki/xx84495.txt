David Allen Bawden (born September 22, 1959 in Oklahoma City), who calls himself "Pope Michael", is an American citizen and a conclavist claimant to the papacy. He stated in 2009 that he had approximately 30 "solid" followers.[tpl]cite video | people = Adam Fairholm (Director) | title = Pope Michael | medium = Online | date = 2009 [/tpl]
Bawden was elected by a group of six laypeople, which included himself and his parents, who had come to believe that the Catholic Church had seceded from the Catholic faith, and that there had been no legitimate Popes elected since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958.

==Background==

In 1975, Bawden and his family began to follow the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX).  Bawden attended the SSPX seminary in Écône, Switzerland and Saint Joseph's House, Armada, Michigan, but was dismissed from the seminary in 1978.[tpl]cite news|last=Brisendine|first=Steve|title=Despite few followers, 'Pope Michael' holds to beliefs|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/053005/kan_popemichael.shtml|accessdate=24 April 2012|newspaper=The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=30 May 2005[/tpl]
Bawden was elected to the papacy in 1990, in a papal conclave attended by five other people, including his parents.[tpl]cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=The Tribal Imagination: Civilization and the Savage Mind|year=2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=104|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MMm30y9a1G0C&pg=PA104[/tpl]

==Claim to the papacy==

Bawden believes that all the Popes since the death of Pope Pius XII on October 9, 1958 are modernists, heretics, and apostates, and that, therefore, their elections are invalid. He considers them to have incurred latae sententiae, or automatic excommunication, for violating Pope Pius X's laws.
A feature-length documentary has been made about Bawden.[tpl]cite news|last=Coppen|first=Luke|title=Today’s Catholic must-reads|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2012/02/29/todays-catholic-must-reads-290212/|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=Catholic Herald|date=29 February 2012[/tpl] Bawden was the subject in a chapter of the 2004 book: What's the Matter with Kansas? by American journalist and historian Thomas Frank.[tpl]cite book|title= What's the Matter with Kansas?: How Conservatives Won the Heart of America |first= Thomas last=Frank |authorlink=Thomas Frank|chapter=Antipopes among us|pages=217–224|publisher =Macmillan|year= 2004 |ISBN =0-8050-7339-6[/tpl]
