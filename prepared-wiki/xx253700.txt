[[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Malaysia, Trials in Malaysia, LGBT in Malaysia, Sex crime trials

The Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials are a source of considerable political controversy in Malaysia. The first trial was held in 1998, and resulted in former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim being convicted, and given a nine-year prison sentence. This verdict was overturned in 2004, resulting in Anwar's release from prison. While the leader of the Pakatan Rakyat opposition, Anwar was charged in 2008 with sodomising a male aide. He was tried in 2010 and 2011 and, in January 2012, was acquitted. In March 2014 the acquittal was overturned.

==1998 allegation==

===Corruption accusations===

In 1998, a book, 50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM ("50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister") was circulated among members of the UMNO General Assembly, containing graphic allegations as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar.Dr M: Up to Anwar to sue over 'gay' remark, Daily Express, 22 September 2005.

===Anwar's sacking from office===

Anwar was fired from the Cabinet in 2 September 1998, amid police reports that he was under investigation. The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. Dr. Munawar Anees, Anwar's former speechwriter, and Sukma Darmawan Sasmita Atmadja, Anwar's adoptive brother, were arrested under suspicion of engaging in homosexual acts. Five days later, they were given a jail sentence of six months after pleading guilty to "unnatural sex" with Anwar. They later recanted their confessions, and appealed the sentence, claiming to have been coerced into pleading guilty. Anees made a statutory declaration to that effect.Statutory Declaration from Dr. Munawar Ahmad Anees (part 1) 3 Dec 1998 However, Dr. Munawar's appeal was rejected by the High Court on 29 October 2008 upholding his guilty sentence.Dr. Munawar fails in bid to remit appeal to High Court. nst.com.my. 29 October 2008 Two of Anwar's secretaries, Ezam Mohamad and Mohamad Azmin Ali, were both held separately as part of police investigations into the "50 reasons" book. Both were later released.

===Black eye incident===

On 29 September 1998 Anwar appeared in court and pleaded innocent to charges of corruption and sodomy. A photo of Anwar with a black eye (incurred from a beating by then Inspector General of Police Rahim Noor) and one hand raised became a symbol of the political opposition in many reformasi posters.
The black eye was explained by Mahathir Mohamad and Rahim Noor as being "self-inflicted" and caused by "pressing a glass over his eyes". Only after a Royal Commission was convened did Rahim Noor admit that he had administered the beating to Anwar.[tpl]cite news |title=Rahim Noor's Confession: Black Eye and Blacker Deeds |work=Aliran |date=1 March 1999 |url=http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/ms990301.html |accessdate=30 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080725005620/http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/ms990301.html| archivedate= 25 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Anwar vindicated but Attorney-General should give full accounting of the compensation government is paying for Rahim Noor’s “black-eye” assault |work=Democratic Action Party |date=4 August 2005 |url=http://www.dapmalaysia.org/all-archive/English/2005/Aug05/lks/lks3607.htm |accessdate=30 August 2008[/tpl] Rahim apologised for the incident in August 2005.[tpl]cite news |title=Anwar wins apology for beating |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4740937.stm |work=BBC News|date=3 August 2005 |accessdate=7 September 2008 [/tpl] Rahim Noor was eventually charged for the assault and was given a two-month prison sentence and fined 2,000 ringgit.[tpl]cite news |title=Black eye for justice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/678217.stm|work=BBC News|date=15 March 2000 |accessdate=4 February 2010 [/tpl]

===DNA evidence===

During the trial, a mattress was presented to court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having anything to do with the mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. Dr. Lim Kong Boon, a DNA chemist, testified during the trial that DNA taken from 10 of 13 semen stains on the mattress matched Anwar's DNA.Alvin Ung CBS-489A Stain Upon Anwar's Defense, The Associated Press (via CBSNews). 30 December 1998
The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false forensics evidence to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.Anwar trial hears DNA evidence 30 December 1998, BBC News

===Alleged government interference===

During the trial, Mahathir appeared on Malaysian television in a special appearance to explain the arrest of his deputy. This was one of several occasions in which Mahathir declared Anwar guilty of sodomy and homosexual acts, even as the trial still was underway. The government included the statements of the purported victims of Anwar's sodomy attacks, evidence that was widely considered to be tainted.[tpl]cite news |title= Sodomy II: Hinging on court review |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100205110941/http://malaysianmirror.com/homedetail/45-home/28865-sodomy-ii-hinging-on-court-review|date=3 February 2010|work=Malaysian Mirror|accessdate=9 February 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, the prosecution was unable to accurately decide on a date that the alleged acts of anal sex had occurred – the government originally alleged that a sodomy had occurred inside a building that had not been constructed at the time of the alleged event. 
Furthermore, the Attorney General's prosecution team (headed by Abdul Gani Patail) also submitted a scenario in which Dr Munawar Anees took an overnight flight from Britain all the way to Malaysia to be sodomised by Anwar, and flew back to Britain after that. The infamous "stained mattress" that was taken in and out of court over 20 times throughout the duration of the trial, was supposedly the same one that Anwar did his homosexual acts and extramarital sex on.[tpl]cite news |title=Mattress shown in Anwar trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/235255.stm|work=BBC News|date=15 December 1998|accessdate=17 February 2010[/tpl] However, according to the evidence, the sexual acts had taken place on the mattress a few years ago, and yet the DNA evidence obtained from it were rather recent in age.[tpl]cite news |title=Anwar's indignity of soiled bedding case rests on bedding |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/anwars-indignity-of-soiled-bedding-case-rests-on-bedding-1191555.html|work=The Independent |location=London |date=15 December 1998|accessdate=17 February 2010 [/tpl]

===Sentencing===

On 14 April 1999, Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison for corruption and, on 8 August 2000, nine years in prison for sodomy. The sentences were to be served consecutively, and Anwar was given no credit for the six months he spent in jail during the trial. The following year, Anwar's corruption conviction was upheld by Malaysia's Court of Appeal. In July 2002, Anwar lost his final appeal against the corruption conviction in the Federal Court. In September 2004 the Federal Court overturned his sodomy conviction.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1190999.htm|title=Anwar Ibrahim freed after sodomy sentence overturned|last=Colvin|first=Mark|date=2 September 2004|work=ABC |location=Australia |accessdate=31 March 2010[/tpl]
In a speech during the proceedings against him, Anwar explained what he believed to be the underlying motive behind his persecution. He told the court: "I objected to the use of massive public funds to rescue the failed businesses of his (Mahathir's) children and cronies." Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch expressed doubts about the fairness of the trials.Malaysia: Double injustice heaped on Anwar Ibrahim 18 Apr 2003, Amnesty InternationalHuman Rights Watch Monitors Second Anwar Trial 11 June 1999, Human Rights Watch Amnesty International subsequently designated Anwar as a prisoner of conscience. The trial also provoked international criticism.

BBC News
Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, subsequently formed Parti Keadilan Nasional (the National Justice Party, later known as Parti Keadilan Rakyat or the People's Justice Party), which based its platform on campaigning for Anwar's release and reformasi. At the following general election, the then-National Justice Party performed poorly in the election, only winning five parliamentary seats.

On 15 August 2008 Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan swore on the Quran that he was sodomised by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim according to Federal Territory Mosque Imam Ramlang Porigi.

In November, the judge in the Sessions court struck down the request by Malaysia's Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail to transfer the case to the High Court.

===Local reaction===

Local reaction to the trial was split between supporters of different governmental factions. Opposition supporters believed there was a conspiracy to discredit him. Prominent opposition MP Karpal Singh suggested that Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and his wife were behind the initiation of the sodomy charge. However, the police strongly disagreed, indicating that Anwar's arrest was supported by the evidence.[tpl]cite news |title=Anwar’s Sodomy Charge Complicates Political Struggle |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1374&Itemid=178 |work=Asian Sentinel| date=7 August 2008|accessdate=10 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100116045312/http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1374&Itemid=178| archivedate= 16 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iEg6QO7zxNvZtTZnZAWchWpt6q_w |title=afp.google.com,Malaysian opposition leader Anwar charged with sodomy |work=AFP Google |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=10 January 2012[/tpl] A shared concern, such as that expressed by veteran UMNO leader Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, was that the trial will "shame the country the world over"[tpl]cite news |title= Anwar’s Sodomy II trial starts today|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/51635-anwars-sodomy-ii-trial-starts-today-|work= Malaysian Insider| date=2 February 2010|accessdate=9 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100205104210/http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/51635-anwars-sodomy-ii-trial-starts-today-| archivedate= 5 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Malaysia's Foreign Ministry on 8 February 2010 cautioned foreign governments against involving themselves in the trial by commenting on or criticising the Malaysian legal system.[tpl]cite news |title= Stop meddling in Anwar trial |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20100208-197394.html|work= AsiaOne| date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100211184636/http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20100208-197394.html| archivedate= 11 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Acquittal===

On 9 January 2012, almost two years after the trial started, Judge Zabidin Mohamad Diah found Anwar not guilty of sodomy, after finding the DNA evidence submitted by the prosecution unreliable. His oral verdict concluded: "The court is always reluctant to convict on sexual offences without corroborative evidence. Therefore, the accused is acquitted and discharged".

===Acquittal overturned===

The court overturned the acquittal of Anwar, upholding a government appeal. His lawyers are expected to appeal the court ruling, Reuters reported.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26479642|title="Malaysia: Anwar Ibrahim sodomy acquittal overturned"|date=7 March 2014|work=BBC News|accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]
The decision by the Kuala Lumpur Court of Appeal came late on 7 March 2014 as Anwar prepared to contest a state by-election on 23 March he was expected to win, opening the way for him to become the chief minister of Selangor state, the country’s main economic hub surrounding Kuala Lumpur. Human rights groups have accused Malaysia’s government of using an anachronistic colonial era law that criminalises “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” to persecute 66-year-old Anwar, who leads a three-party opposition that is increasingly popular in the predominantly Muslim nation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/anwar-ibrahim-sodomy-acquittal-overturned-20140307-34cxi.html|title="Anwar Ibrahim sodomy acquittal overturned"|date=7 March 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]
