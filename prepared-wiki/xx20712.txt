[[4 BC]]

CATEGORIES: 4 BC

Year 4 BC was a common year starting on Tuesday or Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a common year starting on Monday of the Proleptic Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Rufus (or, less frequently, year 750 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 4 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
