==Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site==

On September 9, 1942 the Japanese I-25 (submarine) surfaced near Cape Blanco, Oregon, and launched a Yokosuka E14Y "Glen" seaplane piloted by Nubuo Fujita who dropped incendiary bombs on Mount Emily and succeeded in starting multiple forest fires. The Fire Lookout stationed at the Mount Emily Fire Lookout Tower played a major role in "The Lookout Air Raid of 1942" which became the first bombing of the continental United States by an enemy aircraft. The site of the bombing was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the Wheeler Ridge Japanese Bombing Site in July 2006.[ref]
