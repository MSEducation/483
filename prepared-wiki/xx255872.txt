[[Mount Pleasant Road]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Toronto

Mount Pleasant Road is a major arterial thoroughfare in the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario that travels from Jarvis Street south of Bloor Street north to Glen Echo Drive. The road is unique as one of the few arterial roads in Toronto to be created after the development of the suburbs which it passes through. These include the wealthy Rosedale, Moore Park and Lawrence Park neighbourhoods. The road also passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name.
Mount Pleasant Road was first established in 1915 when the city of Toronto, having recently annexed Moore Park, purchased the right-of-way for a new road through the cemetery. This road opened to traffic in 1919, from St. Clair Avenue to the Blythwood Ravine, south of Lawrence Avenue. Several streets were absorbed into the length of Mount Pleasant Road in 1919, 1920 and 1935; the latest as part of a northward extension through Lawrence Park. In the late 1940s, what originally began as the Clifton Road Extension opened a new right-of-way between St. Clair Avenue and Jarvis Street, despite opposition from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), bringing the road to its current length of [tpl]convert|7.6|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. This extension is considered Toronto's first expressway.

Mount Pleasant begins as an extension of Jarvis Street, in downtown Toronto. Until late 2009, Jarvis extended north to Bloor; however, this section was renamed Ted Rogers Way on October 27, 2009, truncating Jarvis at Mount Pleasant.[ref]

The road forks to the northeast between large buildings and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale Ravine. It passes through residential South Rosedale, entering a trench and passing beneath Crescent Drive. The road descends into the Yellow Creek ravine (crossing David A. Balfour Park) along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank of the ravine, entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name.[ref]
