This article is about the former Midland Railway station in Bedfordshire. For the similarly named  Ampthill (Marston) station see the article on Millbrook (Bedfordshire) railway station
Ampthill railway station was built over a mile from the town of Ampthill in the English county of Bedfordshire by the Midland Railway in 1868 on its extension to St. Pancras.

==History==

Opened by the Midland Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. After passing on to the London Midland Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948, it was then closed by the British Transport Commission.
At the time it was built there were no coaching connections by road, so for a number of years the station was particularly beneficial in providing an outlet for the trade in straw hats, Ampthill's speciality being the "Narrow Improved" version.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books The station closed in 1959 and the inhabitants were advised to use the "excellent alternative bus service." 
About half a mile north of the station is Ampthill Tunnel, increased to three bores when the line was upgraded to four tracks in 1891.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books

==Present and future==
