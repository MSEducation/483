Étincelles, Op. 36, No. 6 (Sparks) is a piece for solo piano by Moritz Moszkowski. It is the 6th piece from Moszkowski's 8 Characteristic Pieces set.IMSLP

==Analysis==

This flashy showpiece, as the name suggests, conveys images of flashing sparks through the use of a staccato theme and extremely fast scale passages, which require a great deal of technical ability. The piece is written in the key of B-flat major and in 3/8 time. A happy and lively mood is consistent throughout the piece although the dynamics are nearly always quiet.Score at the IMSLP
Étincelles has a duration of about 3 minutes when played at the correct tempo.Étincelles, Op. 36, No. 6 at Allmusic

==Performances==

Étincelles has survived the general oblivion accorded most of Moszkowski's piano music. It is a popular piece and many famous pianists have recorded it. In particular the pianist Vladimir Horowitz played the piece frequently as an encore with exquisite polish and delegability[tpl]?[/tpl] at many of his later concerts. He even composed his own coda to the piece.Horowitz's Transcriptions at The Vladimir Horowitz Website
