[[Hunter hack]]

CATEGORIES: Equestrian sports

Hunter hack is a type of English pleasure class where exhibitors in Hunt seat tack and attire perform on the flat at a walk, trot, canter and hand gallop, and then jump two low fences.  The desired horse in this competition is to resemble a quiet, well-mannered working hunter rather than the more animated American-style show hack."Guidelines for Pennsylvania 4-H Working Hunter, Hunt Seat Equitation Over Fences and Hunter Hack".
