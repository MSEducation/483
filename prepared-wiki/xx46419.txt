==History==

The NLUUG was founded in 1983, but the initial members were active together a long time before that. 
The NLUUG founded the first Internet provider in the Netherlands, NLnet. NLnet at the time only was serving businesses, which is why XS4All usually claims to be the first Internet provider (for consumers).
Other claims to fame are the founding of the SANE Conferences organization and the fact that the NLUUG was the first organisation to have Linus Torvalds be a speaker on a conference outside Finland.in Ede, the Netherlands, November 5, 1993.
