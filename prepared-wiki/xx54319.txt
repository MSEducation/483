The Saint Thomas Christians, also called Syrian Christians or Nasrani, are an ancient community of Christians from Kerala, India who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. The community was historically united in leadership and liturgy, but since the 17th century have been split into several different church denominations and traditions.
Historically the Saint Thomas Christian community was part of the Church of the East, centred in Persia. They were organised as the Ecclesiastical Province of India in the 8th century, served by bishops and a hereditary Archdeacon. In the 16th century the overtures of the Portuguese padroado to bring the Saint Thomas Christians into the Catholic Church led to the first of several rifts in the community and the establishment of Syrian Catholic and Malankara Church factions. Since that time further splits have occurred, and the Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into several different Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions.
The Saint Thomas Christians represent a single ethnic group. Saint Thomas Christian culture is largely developed from East Syrian influences blended with local customs and later elements derived from indigenous Indian and European colonial contacts. Their language is Malayalam, the local tongue of Kerala.

==Terminology==

The Saint Thomas Christians are so called due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates to the period of Portuguese colonization. They are also known, especially locally, as the Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila. "Nasrani" is a term meaning "Christian"; it appears to be derived from Nazareth, the home town of Jesus. Mappila is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths, including Muslims (Jonaka Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila).Županov, Ines G. (2005).

R. G. Mathur, Anthropological Survey of India, Kerala Historical Society, p. 1 The Indian government designates members of the community as "Syrian Christians", a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority distinguishing the Saint Thomas Christians, who used  Syriac as their liturgical language, from newly evangelized Christians who followed the Latin liturgy.Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007). Origin of Christianity in India: a Historiographical Critique, p. 52. Media House Delhi. The term Syrian relates not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syrian Church.

==History==

===Early history===

The most commonly believed tradition of origin among Saint Thomas Christians relates to the evangelical activity of Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have come to India in middle of the 1st century.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, p. 93. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. There is no contemporary evidence for Thomas being in the subcontinent, though it was possible for a Roman Jew of the time to make such a trip. Groups such as the Cochin Jews and Bene Israel are known to have existed in India around that time.Thomas Puthiakunnel, (1973) "Jewish colonies of India paved the way for St. Thomas", The Saint Thomas Christian Encyclopedia of India, ed.

An organised Christian presence in India dates to the arrival of East Syrian settlers and missionaries from Persia, members of the Church of the East or Nestorian Church, in around the 3rd century.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, pp. 102–107; 115.. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. Saint Thomas Christians trace the further growth of their community to the arrival of the Nestorian Thomas of Cana from the Middle East, which is said to have occurred sometime between the 4th and 8th century. The subgroup of the Saint Thomas Christians known as the Knanaya or Southists trace their lineage to Thomas of Cana, while the group known as the Northists claim descent from Thomas the Apostle's indigenous converts; some additionally assert ancestry from Thomas of Cana through a second, Indian wife.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Swiderski |first1= Richard Michael |year= 1988 |title= Northists and Southists: A Folklore of Kerala Christians |journal= Asian Folklore Studies |volume= 47 |issue= 1 |pages= 76–80, 80–83 |publisher= Nanzan University |jstor= 1178253 |doi= 10.2307/1178253 [/tpl]

===Classical period===

As the community grew and immigration by East Syrians increased, the connection with the Church of the East, centred in the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, strengthened. From the early 4th century the Patriarch of the Church of the East provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch Ishoyahb III solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.[tpl]Cite book |title= The Church of the East: A Concise History |last= Baum|first= Wilhelm |coauthors= Dietmar W. Winkler|year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-415-29770-2|page= 53 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=yt0X840SjpEC&dq=Baum+Church+of+the+East|accessdate=5 April 2010[/tpl] In the 8th century Patriarch Timothy I organised the community as the Ecclesiastical Province of India, one of the church's Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a metropolitan bishop, dispatched from Persia, the "Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India". His metropolitan see was probably in Cranganore, or (perhaps nominally) in Mylapore, where the shrine of Thomas was located. Under him were a varying number of bishops, as well as a native Archdeacon, who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.
Some contact and transmission of knowledge of the Saint Thomas Christians managed to reach the Christian West, even after the rise of the Islamic empires.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, p. 112. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. Byzantine traveller Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote of East Syrian Christians he met in India and Sri Lanka in the 6th century.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, p. 105 & 110. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. In 883 the English king Alfred the Great reportedly sent a mission and gifts to Saint Thomas' tomb in India. During the Crusades, distorted accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians and the Nestorian Church gave rise to the European legend of Prester John.# Silverberg, Robert (1996). The Realm of Prester John, pp. 29–34. Ohio University Press. ISBN 1-84212-409-9.
The great distances involved and the geopolitical turmoil of the period caused India to be cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia at several points. In the 11th century the province was suppressed by the church entirely, as it had become impossible to reach,Fiey, J. M. (1993). Pour un Oriens Christianus novus; répertoire des diocèses Syriaques orientaux et occidentaux, p. 96. Beirut: Orient-Institut. but effective relations were restored by 1301.Wilmshurst, D. J. (2000). The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318–1913, p. 343 and 391. Louvain. However, following the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia later in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from church, and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.[tpl]Cite book |title= The Church of the East: A Concise History |last= Baum|first= Wilhelm |coauthors= Dietmar W. Winkler|year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-415-29770-2|page= 105 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=yt0X840SjpEC&dq=Baum+Church+of+the+East|accessdate=6 February 2012[/tpl]
In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the Coptic Pope of Alexandria and to the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East Shemʿon IV Basidi responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India. These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Nasrani community.Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007). Origin of Christianity in India: a Historiographical Critique, p. 274. Media House Delhi.

===Portuguese contact===

The Saint Thomas Christians first encountered the Portuguese in 1498, during the expedition of Vasco da Gama. At the time the community was in a tenuous position: though thriving in the spice trade and protected by their own militia, the local political sphere was volatile and the Saint Thomas Christians found themselves under pressure from the rajas of Calicut and Cochin and other small kingdoms in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians and the Portuguese newcomers quickly formed an alliance.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, 122–124. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5.
The Portuguese had a keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in spreading their particularly bellicose version of Christianity, which had been forged during several centuries of warfare in the Reconquista.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, 125–127. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. Facilitating their goals was the Padroado Real, a series of treaties and decrees in which the Pope conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered. They set up in Goa, forming a colonial government and a Latin church hierarchy under the Archbishop of Goa, and quickly set to bringing the Saint Thomas Christians under his authority.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, pp. 127–128. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5.
The Portuguese subjection of the Saint Thomas Christians was relatively measured at first, but they became more aggressive after 1552, the year of the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob and of a schism in the Church of the East, which resulted in there being two rival Patriarchs—one of whom entered communion with the Catholic Church. Both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese consistently managed to outmaneuver them, and effectively cut off the Saint Thomas Christians from their hierarchy in 1575, when the Padroado legislated that neither patriarch could send representatives to India without Portuguese approval.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, pp. 130–134. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5.
By 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, Aleixo de Menezes, had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.[tpl]Cite book |title= A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707 |last= Neill|first= Stephen|authorlink= Stephen Neill|year= 2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-54885-3|pages= 208–210|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RH4VPgBGQC|accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Prasad |first= Rajendra |year= 2009|series= History of Science, Philosophy, and Culture in Indian Civilization| title= A Historical-Developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals|volume= Volume XII, part 2 |publisher= Concept Publishing Compan |location= Delhi, India |isbn= 81-8069-595-6|page= 484 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1gtxVmUr1ygC |accessdate=1 February 2011[/tpl]Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007).

The Synod formally brought the Saint Thomas Christians into to Catholic Church; however, the actions of the Portuguese over the ensuing years fueled resentment in segments of the community, and ultimately led to open resistance to their power.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, p. 136. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5.

===Division and defiance===

Over the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Portuguese and the remaining native hierarchy, and after 1641 Archdeacon Thomas, the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George, was often at odds with the Latin prelates.Frykenberg, Eric (2008). Christianity in India: from Beginnings to the Present, p. 367. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-826377-5. In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the appearance in Mylapore of a mysterious figure named Ahatallah, who claimed to have been sent by the Pope to serve as "Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China".[tpl]Cite book |title= A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707 |last= Neill|first= Stephen|authorlink= Stephen Neill|year= 2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-54885-3|pages= 316–317 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RH4VPgB__GQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]
Ahatallah made a strong impression on the native clergy, but the Portuguese quickly decided he was an impostor, and put him on a ship bound for Europe by way of Goa. Archdeacon Thomas, desperate for a new ecclesiastical leader to free his people from the Padroado, travelled to Cochin and demanded to meet Ahatallah and examine his credentials. The Portuguese refused, stating the ship had already left for Goa. Ahatallah was never heard from in India again, inspiring rumours that the Portuguese had murdered him and inflaming anti-Portuguese sentiments even more.[tpl]Cite book |title= A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707 |last= Neill|first= Stephen|authorlink= Stephen Neill|year= 2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-54885-3|page= 319 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RH4VPgB__GQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]
This was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and community representatives met at the Church of Our Lady in Mattancherry to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd. The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the Coonan Cross Oath after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence. Shortly after, the leaders of this newly independent church decided Thomas should be elevated to bishop. Thomas was consecrated in a ceremony in which twelve priests laid hands on him, and he became the metropolitan of Malankara.[tpl]Cite book |title= A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707 |last= Neill|first= Stephen|authorlink= Stephen Neill|year= 2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-54885-3|pages= 320–321|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RH4VPgB__GQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]
After the Coonan Cross Oath the Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar that the consecration of Archdeacon as metropolitan was not legitimate. Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syrian Catholics with the historic title 'The Metropolitan and the Gate of all India' which denotes a Quasi Patriarchal status with all India jurisdiction.Joseph Thekkedathu, pous cit pp96-100Rev Dr Placid Podipara, The Hierarchy of Syro Malabar Church, in Collected works of Rev Dr Placid Podipara CMI, Vol I p 719[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115623/Christians-of-Saint-Thomas |title=Christians of Saint Thomas (Christian groups, India) - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-11-18[/tpl] This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the Pazhayakuttukar, or "Old Party", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the Puthankuttukar, or "New Party".Vadakkekara, p. 84; 86.Frykenberg, p. 361.Fernando, p. 79.Chaput, pp. 7–8. These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note.
After the Coonan Cross Oath, between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Syrian Catholics claimed eighty-four churches, and Archdeacon Mar Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and Chaldean Syrian Church have descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites & Orthodox), Thozhiyur (1772), Mar Thoma (Reformed) (1874), Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.Catholic Encyclopedia- “St. Thomas Christians” The Carmelite Period, Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India”[tpl]full|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In 1665, Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel, a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the St.Thomas Christians belonging to the "New Party", under the leadership of the Archdeacon, welcomed him.Claudius Buchanan 1811; Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; Michael Geddes, 1694;Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India”[tpl]full|date=November 2012[/tpl] This visit resulted in the Mar Thoma faction claiming spiritual authority of the Antiochean Patriarchate and gradually introduced the West Syrian liturgy, customs and script to the Malabar Coast.Vadakkekara, pp. 88–89. Those who accepted the West Syrian theological and liturgical tradition of Mar Gregorios became known as Jacobites.
The "Old Party", who continued with East Syrian and Latin theological and liturgical tradition and stayed faithful to the Synod of Diamper and the Roman Catholic Church came to be formally known as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church from the second half of the 19th century onward. Syro-Malabar Hierarchy was established on 21 December 1923 with the Metropolitan Mar Augustine Kandathil as the Head of their Church.Vadakkekara, pp. 83–88.Fr.

===British period===

In 1795, the kings of Travancore and Cochin entered into tributary alliance with the  British East Indian Company to repel the attacks from Tipu Sultan. The states soon became client regimes of the Company: both were forced to disband their military. The political order of the states also began to collapse. Saint Thomas Christians were hit hard by the loss of their privileged military role, their kalari network was dissolved and many families lost their livelihood.Susan Bayly – Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society – ISBN 0-521-89103-5, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 281–286 The trading class, as well as the office bearers, also suffered the set back and many Europeans who visited the states between 1801 and 1820 noted the poor and depressed condition of Saint Thomas Christians. Some partisan fund allocation for the churches by the British officials triggered a breakdown in the relationship between Saint Thomas Christians and prominent Hindu castes, at least temporarily.George Joseph, The life and times of a Kerala Christian nationalist, Orient Blackswan, 2003, pp. 33–39, ISBN 81-250-2495-6 In 1815, the British Resident, Colonel John Munro, founded a seminary in Kottayam, for the theological education of Jacobite Christian priests and invited the Anglican missionaries to teach there. This could be regarded as the beginning of the relationship between the CMS and the Saint Thomas Christians.[tpl]cite book|author=Stephen Neill|title=A History of Christianity in India: 1707-1858|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xi-tvrYbYxMC&pg=PA240|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=2 May 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89332-9|page=241[/tpl]

====Further divisions====

As a protest against the interference of the Anglican Church in the affairs of the Malankara Church, the Metropolitan, Cheppad Mar Dionysius, convened a Synod at Mavelikara on 16 January 1836. There it was declared that Malanakara Church would be subject to the Syrian traditions and Patriarch of Antioch.Cherian, Dr. C.V., Orthodox Christianity in India. Academic Publishers, College Road, Kottayam. 2003.p. 254-262. The declaration resulted in the separation of the CMS missionaries from the communion with the Malankara Church. However a minority from the Malankara Church, who were in favor of the reformed ideologies of the missionaries, stood along with them and joined the CMS. These Syrian Anglicans, were the first Reformed group from among the Saint Thomas Christians. They joined the missionaries in their evangelical activities among the non-Christians in the region and worked along with the missionaries in their reformative and educational activities.[tpl]cite book|author=Stephen Neill|title=A History of Christianity in India: 1707-1858|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xi-tvrYbYxMC&pg=PA240|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=2 May 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89332-9|pages=247–249[/tpl] On 27 September 1947, the C.M.S Church united with other similar Churches and formed the CSI.Dr.Juhanon Mar Thoma Metropolitan. Christianity in India and a Brief History of the Marthoma Syrian Church. Pub: K.M. Cherian. 1993. Since then, the Syrian Anglicans have been members of the CSI; in which they practically stay ethnically distinct.
By June 1875, there were two factions in the Malankara Church (Oriental Orthodox): Syrian Party and Reform Party. Mathews Mar Athanasius was the Malankara Metropolitan approved by the Governments of Travancore and of CochinAgur, C.M. Church History of Travancore.1903. and the group with him was known as "Reform Party" since Mathews Mar Athanasius was supportive to the reformation of Jacobite church with evangelistic ideologies. The Syrian faction, under the leadership of Metropolitan Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysious II, opposed the attempts to do away with age-old traditions of the church, which resulted in a stir in the community. Being invited by this faction, the Antiochene Patriarch Moran Mar Ignatius Peter III arrived in Kerala.M.P. Varkey, Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysious II, Metropolitan of Malankara Church.(Malayalam), Malayala Manorama. 1901. On June 1876, at the synod of Mulanthuruthy, presided over by the Patriarch, the Syrian faction formally came under the Antiochene Patriarchate.Cheriyan, Dr. C.V., Orthodox Christianity in India. Academic Publishers, College Road, Kottayam. 2003. p. 294. The synod condemned Mathews Mar Athanasius for abstaining from it, but his followers stayed firm with him.Varghese A.P. – India: History, Religion, Vision and Contribution to the World, Atlantic Publishers 2008, ISBN 978-81-269-0903-2, pp, 376–378 His successor Thomas Mar Athanasius and the bishop’s faction lost the lawsuit to the Patriarchal faction in the Royal Court of Travancore on 12 July 1889.N.M. Mathew, History of the Marthoma Church (Malayalam), Volume II.(2007). Page 125. Nonetheless, the Reform Party continued as an independent, Malankara Church and thereafter a series of suits arose on the rights over churches and associated properties. Later they chose the name Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church.
In 1912, due to attempts by the Antiochean Patriarch to gain temporal powers over the Malankara Church, there was another split in the West Syrian community when a section declared itself an autocephalous church and announced the re-establishment of the ancient Catholicosate of the East in India. This was not accepted by those who remained loyal to the Patriarch, and this group, popularly known as Patriarch's Party recognized the temporal power of the Patriarch over the assets of their church, while the other side, known as Metropolitan Party, accepted the supremacy of Patriarch only over the spiritual matters. The two sides filed a series of lawsuits in the civil courts and some parallel attempts to reconcile both the parties also took place. In 1958, bishops of both the parties sealed their reconciliation and signed a treaty which in turn recognized the autonomy of reunited factions, with its own synod of bishops under the presidency of the Catholocos.A History of Eastern Christianity – Taylor & Francis, pp. 372–374 The verdict of Supreme Court of India in 1959, legitimizing the autonomy of Kerala church, was also instrumental to keep this formal reconciliation between two sides. Nonetheless, in 1975, both the parties split again with the decision of Universal Syrian Synod, held in Damascus, to depose the Catholocos in Kerala. Today the East Syrian community is divided into Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (in Oriental Orthodox Communion, autocephalous), Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church (in Oriental Orthodox Communion, under Antioch).Vadakkekara, p. 94-96.
In 1930 a section of the Malankara Church under the leadership of Mar Ivanios and Mar Theophilus left the ChurchCherian, Dr. C.V., Orthodox Christianity in India. Academic Publishers, College Road, Kottayam. 2003.p. 354.  and came into communion with the Catholic Church. They are known as Syro-Malankara Catholic Church.
In 1961, there was a split in the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church which resulted in the formation of St. Thomas Evangelical Church.Rev. Thomas, P.T. & Rev. P.C. Zachariah. It Happened in The Mar Thoma Church. 1961.Thomas, K.T. & Rev. T.N. Koshy. Faith On Trial. Ernakulam. 1965.
Since the later 20th century, neo-charismatic churches have attracted some St. Thomas Christians. These are typically churches with doctrines and practices similar to traditional Pentecostal or Charismatic churches but without a formal denominational tie. The neo-charismatic movement can be found both within established St. Thomas Christian churches, such as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, and in newer independent denominations, including the New Apostolic Church, the Indian Pentecostal Church of God (IPC), the New Life Fellowship, and the Manna Full Gospel Churches.[tpl]cite journal|last=Burgess M.|first=Stanley|title=PENTECOSTALISM IN INDIA: AN OVERVIEW|journal=Asian Journal of Pentecostal Studies|date=January 2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=95–96|url=http://apts.edu/aeimages/File/AJPS_PDF/01-1-SBurgess.pdf|accessdate=3 March 2014[/tpl]

====Involvement in politics====

Participation based on caste and community divisions and sympathies has been a feature of politics in the present day state of Kerala and its predecessor entities. Until the mid-20th century the primary cause of the divisions between the various communities was competition for rights and resources, rather than any dislike of each other, but in more recent times there has been a rise in violence and antagonism that has coincided with a promotion of Hindu politics.[tpl]cite book |first1=J. |last1=Devika |first2=V.

Like other communities, Saint Thomas Christians have been involved in regional politics on a community basis. In 1888, Travancore became the first  princely state in India to establish a Legislative Council, which was reformed as the Sree Moolam Popular Assembly in 1904. A few Saint Thomas Christian leaders were elected to the Legislative Council but there was resentment that their share of the available seats was proportionately less than that of other prominent castes. This resentment led to a series of campaigns for equal representation both in the legislature and in government positions.Thomas Johnson Nossiter, Communism in Kerala: a study in political adaptation, University of California Press, 1982, pp. 78- 82, ISBN 0-520-04667-6 Newspapers such as Malayala Manorama and Nasrani Deepika disseminated the grievances.[tpl]cite book |first1=J. |last1=Devika |first2=V.

In 1918, Saint Thomas Christians formed the League for Equal Civic Rights, which sought the opening of all branches of government service to Christians, Muslims and  avarna Hindus, as well as an end to the practice of untouchability. Their demands were partially met in 1922 when the Revenue Department was separated from the Devaswom, a semi-government organization that managed the Hindu temples, thus removing the restriction on non-Hindus and avarnas in the executive service. In the 1920s, Saint Thomas Christian leaders such as George Joseph were advised by Mahatma Gandhi to detach from Vaikom Satyagraha, an agitation for the temple entry rights of avarna Hindus, as he considered the issue to be one of concern to Hindus alone.[tpl]cite journal |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |title=Temple Entry Movement in Travancore |journal=Social Scientist |volume=4 |issue=8 |date=March 1976 |pages=11–12 |url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/kandathi/vaikom_agitation.html |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl]
With the institution in 1932 of a bicameral legislature in Travancore, four Saint Thomas Christians found a place in among the 24 seats of the lower house, but not comparable with other forward castes. The partisan and oppressive behaviour of Diwan Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, especially towards the Saint Thomas Christians, further provoked the community members. Iyer reflected a concern among Hindus that the Christian population was rising and that there was a consequent danger of Travancore becoming a Christian state. The 1931 census recorded over 31 per cent of the population as being Christian, compared to around 4 per cent in 1820.[tpl]cite book |first1=J. |last1=Devika |first2=V.

In 1933, some prominent Saint Thomas Christians, including T. M. Varghese, worked to organize other communities on a common platform called the Joint Political Congress, which then decided to abstain from participation in the assembly elections, an action that has become known as the Abstention Movement. There followed a period of fierce confrontation between the Diwan and Saint Thomas Christians—many leaders were arrested, prominent news papers were banned and large banks owned by the community members were liquidated.Donald Eugene Smith et al.- South Asian politics and religion, Princeton University Press, 1966, p.190 But the agitations continued and to resolve the issue, government appointed a franchise and delimitation commissioner to solve the problem of representation in the legislator with special reference to backward communities. Though there was no definite assurance to Saint Thomas Christians, Joint Political Congress decided to withdraw the agitation. According to the recommendations of commissioner, franchise power was extended beyond the caste bars. In 1937, general elections were held and Joint Political Congress played a significant role to attain much better representation for allied communities.George Mathew – Communal Road To A Secular Kerala, Concept Publishing Company, 1989, ISBN 81-7022-282-6, pp.91–103 T.M. Varghese was elected as the Deputy President of the Assembly where Iyer was the ex officio President. But in 1938, he was ousted by Iyer for cooperating with rebels, which led to a worsening of relation between the Saint Thomas Christians and Iyer. On the collapse of Joint Political Congress due to internal conflicts, Saint Thomas Christian leaders allied with Nairs in a common platform- Travancore State Congress where they fought together for responsible government and also to oust Iyer. Many Saint Thomas Christian bishops like Mar James Kalaserry and Metropolitan Abraham Mar Thoma, supported the nationalistic movements in 1930s and 1940s.PR Saraswati – The Impact of Indian Christianity on Indian Society http://www.stichtingup.nl/Artikelen/008_theImpactofIndianChristianity.pdf Following intense agitations by the Travancore State Congress, the Maharaja of Travancore announced plans to establish a responsible Government. As per the announcement on 4 September 1947, the new Assembly called the Representative Body was formed to function as a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly held its first sitting on 20 March 1948 with President A. J. John, Anaparambil, a Saint Thomas Christian leader in the chair. In the three-member Cabinet of Travancore formed after the first general elections in 1948, Varghese was a Cabinet Minister.[tpl]cite web|url=http://keralaassembly.org/history/bicameral.html |title=www.keralaassembly.org |publisher=www.keralaassembly.org |accessdate=2012-06-16[/tpl] However the first Saint Thomas Christian to become a minister in the central government of India was Padma Vibhushan John Mathai, who served as India's first Railway Minister and subsequently as India's Finance Minister,[tpl]cite book|title=Reflections on Finance Education and Society|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publication|pages=114|isbn=9788120830752|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R5QxQ3sOVPcC|accessdate=2009-07-22[/tpl] taking office shortly after the presentation of India's first Budget, in 1948.

==Socio-cultural and religious identity==

St. Thomas Christians are a distinct community, both in terms of culture and religion. Though their liturgy and theology remained that of East-Syrian Christians of Persia, their life-style customs and traditions were basically Indian. It is oft-quoted: "Nazranis are Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Syrian in liturgy".[tpl]cite book |editor-first=Harold |editor-last=Coward |title=Hindu-Christian dialogue: perspectives and encounters |chapter=Dialogue between Hindus and the St. Thomas Christians |first=Anand |last=Amaladass |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6eHgNyNimoAC |page=16 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |edition=Indian |year=1993 |origyear=1989 (New York: Orbis Books) |isbn=81-208-1158-5[/tpl]
The presence of Jews among the early Malabar Nasrani Christians had significant effects on the liturgy and traditions of the entire community. The community maintained some of the original rituals of the early Jewish Christians, such as covering their heads while in worship. Their ritual services were and still are called the Qurbana (also spelled Kurbana), which is derived from the Aramaic and Hebrew term korban (קרבן), meaning "sacrifice".. The Nasrani Qurbana used to be held in Syriac.
Saint Thomas Christians typically followed the social customs of their Hindu neighbors, and the vestiges of Hindu symbolism could be seen in their devotional practices.Rajendra Prasad: A Historical-developmental study of classical Indian philosophy of morals – pp. 484–487, ISBN 81-8069-595-6 http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1gtxVmUr1ygC&pg=PA484 Social sins like Untouchability entered their practices and the Synod of Diamper abolished it.Rajendra Prasad: A Historical-developmental study of classical Indian philosophy of morals – pp. 482–483, ISBN 81-8069-595-6 The rituals related to birth, Vidyarambham, marriage, pregnancy, death etc. were also similar in both communities. Now also, tying Thaali, a Hindu symbol of marriage is the most important rite in the Christian marriages too. They used to learn temple arts[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] like Kathakali, Kooth and Thullal and their own art forms like Margam Kali and Parichmuttu Kali have some resemblance to Yathra kali Pattu of Brahmins in Kerala. In 1519, a Portuguese traveler Duarte Barbosa on his visit to Malabar commented on the practice of Saint Thomas Christian priests using Kudumi similar to that of Hindus, in his manuscript "Book of Duarte Barbosa".Paul M. Collins: Christian inculturation in India – Page 142 ISBN 0-7546-6076-1
In the social stratification of medieval Malabar, Saint Thomas Christians succeeded in relating their social status with that of upper-caste Hindus on account of their numerical strength and influence and observance of many Brahmin customs.L.Krishna Ananthakrishna Iyer: Anthropology of Syrian Christians – pp. 205–219 In 13th and 14th century, many Saint Thomas Christians were involved in the pepper trade for the local rulers and many were appointed as port revenue officers. The local rulers rewarded them with grants of land and many other privileges. With growing numerical strength, a large number of Saint Thomas Christians settled in the inland pepper-growing regions.Susan Bayly – Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society – ISBN 0-521-89103-5, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 246–247 They had the right to recruit and train soldiers and Christian trainers were given with the honorary title "Panikkar" like their Nair counterparts.S. G. Pothan – The Syrian Christians of Kerala, p. 58 Asia Pub. House, 1963 They were also entitled with the privilege to collect the tax, and the tax-collectors were honored with the title "Tharakan". Like Brahmins they had the right to sit before the Kings and also to ride on horse or elephant, like the royals. They were protectors of seventeen underprivileged castes and communities and hence they were called Lords of Seventeen Castes.Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007).

Until the 19th century, Saint Thomas Christians had the right of access to Hindu temples and some leading Saint Thomas Christians held the status of sponsors at Hindu shrines and temple festivals.Susan Bayly – Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society, Cambridge University Press, 2004 – ISBN 0-521-89103-5, p. 274-279 But in the 19th century, Saint Thomas Christian integration with the Hindu caste system was disrupted: their clean-caste status was questioned in some localities and they were denied access to many Hindu temples. They tried to retaliate by denouncing Hindu festivals as heathen idolatry. Clashes between upper-caste Hindus and Saint Thomas Christians occurred from the late 1880s, especially when festivals coincided. Internecine violence among various Saint Thomas Christian denominations aggravated their problems.Susan Bayly – Saints, Goddesses and Kings: Muslims and Christians in South Indian Society – ISBN 0-521-89103-5, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 310–315

==Church architecture==

The earliest documentary evidence is Tharisapally Copper Plate, which refers to the construction of the church of Tharisapally in Quilon between 823 and 849 CE. Antonio Gouvea, Portuguese envoy to Malabar, mentions in his 16th-century work Jornada that almost all the churches of Saint Thomas Christians followed the models of Hindu temples of that period, but were distinguished by the huge granite cross in the front yard of the church. Despite the external similarity with temples, the structuring of the interior space of the church always followed the East Syrian architectural theology. Thus the contemporary style is formed as an amalgamation of Indian architecture and Chaldean liturgical concepts.[tpl]cite book |first=Pius |last=Malekandathil |title=Maritime India: Trade, Religion and Polity in the Indian Ocean |publisher=Primus Books |location=Delhi |year=2010 |isbn=978-93-8060-701-6 |pages=48–50 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rN69iFj1PJoC |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl] The church is arranged east-to-west, with the interior structured into three levels: the madbaha (sanctuary), the qestroma (choir) and the haykla (nave).
The madbaha, arranged in the topmost platform at the eastern side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or two bells are installed in the back yard to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.[tpl]cite book |first=Samuel |last=Mateer |title=The Land of Charity: A Descriptive Account of Travancore and its People |publisher=J.

==Nasrani symbol==

The Saint Thomas Cross is widely perceived as the symbol of Saint Thomas Christians.  It is also known as Nasrani MenorahPaul M. Collins – Christian inculturation in India, pp.119, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, ISBN 0-7546-6076-1  or Mar Thoma Sliba.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nasrani.net/2010/10/09/saint-thomas-cross-a-religio-cultural-logo-of-saint-thomas-christians/ |title=NSC NETWORK: Saint Thomas Cross- A Religio Cultural Logo of Saint Thomas Christians |publisher=Nasrani.net |accessdate=2012-06-16[/tpl] There are several interpretations for the Nasrani Symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish  menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra).Paul M. Collins: Christian inculturation in India – Page 119 ISBN 0-7546-6076-1
The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolizing "joyfulness" points to the resurrection theology of St. Paul, the Holy Spirit on the top represents the role of Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The lotus symbolizing Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha. The 3 steps indicate Calvary and the rivulets, channels of grace flowing from the Cross.Dr. Geo Thadikkatt – Liturgical Identity of the Mar Toma Nazrani Church
Note that the Christian cross was not adopted as a symbol by Mediterranean and European Christianity until several centuries had passed.

==Saint Thomas Christians today==

Writing in 2010, Devika and Varghese noted that "St. Thomas Christians are at present a substantial minority, a powerful presence in all fields of life in Kerala."[tpl]cite book |first1=J. |last1=Devika |first2=V.

===Socioeconomic status===

Even though the Saint Thomas Christians had to compromise their social and religious privileges in the aftermath of Portuguese subjugation, they started reemerging as a powerful community from the 19th century onward. They played a pioneering role in many spheres such as Banking, Commerce, Cash crops etc.A Kumar — Social Reforms in Modern India, p. 180, Sarup and Sons 2001, ISBN 81-7625-227-1 Among Saint Thomas Christians, 17.4% of the adult population are self-employed - the highest rate statistically among all the communities in the state of Kerala.Kunniparampil Curien Zachariah et al. – Dynamics of migration in Kerala: dimensions, differentials, and consequences, pp. 85 – 89, Orient Blackswan, 2003, ISBN 81-250-2504-9 Saint Thomas Christians lead all others with respect to per capita ownership of land, with many of them owning large estates. With changing conditions, they have shifted from the agriculture of rice and coconut to plantation based agriculture and the trading of  rubber, spices and cash crops. They also take a prominent role in the educational institutions of Kerala and throughout India.('The Hindu' Syrian Christians are in a class of their own South Indian newspaper article 31 August 2001 They were quick to understand the benefits of academic education and in their educational achievements Saint Thomas Christians stand second to none. The educational accomplishments of the community have helped its members to attain a good proportion of the Central and State Government jobs. With their level of education and limited employment opportunities within the state of Kerala, they became the community with the highest rate of migration.  Their resultant foreign remittances have also helped the socioeconomic progress of the community. According to the Kerala Migration Survey (1998) by the Center for Developmental Studies, Kerala, Saint Thomas Christians top all other communities in Kerala with respect to the Socioeconomic Development Index which is based on parameters such as the possession of land,housing & consumer durables, education and employment status.K.C. Zachariah — The Syrian Christians of Kerala: demographic and socio-economic transition in the twentieth century, Orient Longman, 2006

===Existing traditions, rituals and social life===

Saint Thomas Christians still retain many of their ancient traditions and rituals, both in their social and religious life. Saint Thomas Christian services have many unique characteristics compared to others. Until the 1970s the Nasrani Qurbana was sung in Syriac. Many of the tunes of the Saint Thomas Christian worship in Kerala are remnants of ancient Syriac tunes of antiquity.Palackal, Joseph J. Syriac Chant Traditions in South India. Ph.d, Ethnomusicology, City University of New York, 2005. The Baptism is still known by the Aramaic term Mamodisa among Saint Thomas Christians and follows many of the ancient rituals of the ceremony. It is referred to in Malayalam as Njana Snanam ("Bath of Wisdom").[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Demographics===

Kunniparampil Zachariah notes that the 20th century was period of significant transition for the Saint Thomas Christians in terms of its demographic and socioeconomic status. Around 1900, the community was concentrated in a few areas, was geographically static and "... was characterised by very high death rate, very high birth rate, very early age at marriage, and 10 to 12 children per married woman". The population had increased eight-fold during the preceding century, from a base figure of about 100,000, and comprised nearly 50 per cent children. But, the population growth of Saint Thomas Christians came down drastically after 1960s, with the lowest birth rate, highest age at marriage, highest family planning user rate, and lowest fertility rate compared to other communities in Kerala. The proportion of children has come down to less than 25%. The absolute and relative size of the community is in a diminishing trend and it's approaching a Zero Population Growth regime.[tpl]cite book |title=The Syrian Christians of Kerala: Demographic and Socioeconomic Transition in the Twentieth Century |first=Kunniparampil Curien |last=Zachariah |publisher=Centre for Development Studies |location=Thiruvananthapuram |page=3 |date=November 2001 |url=http://www.cds.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wp322.pdf |accessdate=20 December 2012[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2001[/tpl], in Kerala, more than 85 per cent of the Saint Thomas Christian population live in the six central districts of the state - Pathanamthitta, Alapuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam and Trissur. They have also migrated to other cities in India like Ooty, Mangalore, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Delhi, Mumbai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Migration steeply increased in the post-independence period and major destinations were United States of America, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and the Middle East. According to a rough estimate, 20–25% of the Saint Thomas Christians live outside the state of Kerala.

==Caste status==

Christopher Fuller believes that Saint Thomas Christians, along with the Latin Christians and New Christians of the region, "may sensibly regarded as castes" but notes that "The word 'sensibly' is cautiously used for only as an ideal type can 'caste' be defined." He considers them to be "part of the total segmentary caste structure and ... ranked with respect to each other and to the Hindu castes".[tpl]cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Christopher J. |title=Kerala Christians and the Caste System |journal=Man |series=New Series |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=March 1976 |pages=55–56 |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |jstor=2800388[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] George Mathew, writing of the practice of untouchability in Kerala, makes a similar distinction in saying that "Technically, the Christians were outside the caste hierarchy, but in practice a system of inclusion and exclusion was developed ...".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC |title=Communal Road To A Secular Kerala |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |first=George |last=Mathew |chapter= |year=1989 |accessdate=11 May 2012 | isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |page=22[/tpl] Duncan Forrester observes that "... Nowhere else in India is there a large and ancient Christian community which has in time immemorial been accorded a high status in the caste hierarchy. ...

They tend to be endogamous, and tend not to intermarry even with other Christian groupings. Saint Thomas Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelized by St. Thomas.Fuller, C.J. "Indian Christians: Pollution and Origins." Man. New Series, Vol. 12, No. 3/4. (Dec., 1977), pp. 528–529.
Internal division of Saint Thomas Christians into Northists and Southists and also into a number of sects based on the ecclesiastical orientation makes the pattern of segmentation an exceedingly complex one. Fuller believes that the caste hierarchy among these Christian groupings in Kerala is more polarized than the Hindu system of gradation and ascribes this relatively high polar nature to the limited number of castes among Christians while innumerable castes and sub castes are arranged in the Hindu hierarchical order. Forrester suggests that the Northist-Southist division forms two groups within the Saint Thomas Christian community which are closely analogous to sub-castes. At the same time, different Saint Thomas Christian denominations like Catholic, Jacobite, Mar Thomite, etc. are better regarded as sects, rather than sub-castes, since the recruitment to these sects cannot be strictly ascribed to birth.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Christopher J. |title=Kerala Christians and the Caste System |journal=Man |series=New Series |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=March 1976 |pages=55, 68 |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |jstor=2800388[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl]  Also, internal mobility is allowed among these Saint Thomas Christian sects and the caste status is kept even if the sect allegiance is switched (for example, from Syrian Orthodox to Syrian Catholic).[tpl]cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Christopher J. |title=Kerala Christians and the Caste System |journal=Man |series=New Series |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=March 1976 |page=61 |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |jstor=2800388[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] That is, despite the sectarian differences, Saint Thomas Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as Forward Caste.
