The church building was built 1966 to Modernist designs by the architectural firm of Belfatto & Pavarini to resemble the prow of a ship. The nautical design references the titular saint, Saint Brendan the Navigator.Joe McMahon, Bronx Catholic, "This is an attempt to index references to The Bronx in "The Archdiocese of New York: the Bicentennial History," a marvelous 624-page book written by Thomas J. Shelley. The 2007 book may still be available at the St. Patrick Cathedral gift shop. The strength of this blog will be in the alphabetic list of labels to the right, or use the search box at top left. The blog format requires that entries move from recent to old. I continue to add photos and information." (Retrieved 11 May 2011) The rectory address is 333 East 206th St., Bronx NY 10467.
