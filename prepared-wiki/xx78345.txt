==Symbolism and design==

The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 before the proclamation of the country's first Constitution. The Sun of May represents a new nation in the world.
