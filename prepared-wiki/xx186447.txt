Rhynia is a single-species genus of Devonian vascular plants. Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii was the sporophyte[tpl]Cite journal |last=Edwards |first=D.S. |year=1980 |title=Evidence for the sporophytic status of the Lower Devonian plant Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii Kidston and Lang |journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology |volume=29 |pages=177–188 [/tpl] generation of a vascular, axial, free-sporing diplohaplontic embryophytic land plant of the Lower Devonian that had anatomical features more advanced than those of the bryophytes. Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii was a member of a sister group to all other eutracheophytes, including modern vascular plants.

==Description==

R. gwynne-vaughanii was first described as a new species by Robert Kidston and William H. Lang in 1917.[tpl]Cite journal |first1=R. |last1=Kidston |first2=W.H. |last2=Lang |year=1917|title=On Old Red Sandstone plants showing structure from the Rhynie chert bed, Aberdeenshire. Part I. Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii, Kidston and Lang |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=5 |pages=761–784 [/tpl] The species is known only from the Rhynie chert in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where it grew in the vicinity of a silica-rich hot spring. Rhynia was a vascular plant, and grew in association with other vascular plants such as Asteroxylon mackei,  a probable ancestor of modern clubmosses (Lycopsida),  and with pre-vascular plants such as Aglaophyton major, which is interpreted as basal to true vascular plants.[tpl]Cite journal|first1=D.S. |last1=Edwards |year=1986 |title=Aglaophyton major, a non-vascular land-plant from the Devonian Rhynie chert |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=93 |pages=173–204|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1986.tb01020.x|issue=2 [/tpl] 
Rhynia is thought to have had deciduous lateral branches, which it used to disperse laterally over the substrate[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=D.S. |year=1980|title=Evidence for the sporophyte status of the Lower Devonian plant Rhynia gwynne-vaughnii Kidston and Lang |journal=Rev.

A significant finding is that the axes were vascular, unlike almost all of the gametophytes of modern pteridophytes except for that of Psilotum.[tpl]Cite journal | last1=Holloway | first1=J.E. |year=1939 |title=The gametophyte, embryo and young rhizome of Psilotum triquetrum Schwarz |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=3 |pages=313–336 [/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

Two species of Rhynia were initially described by R. Kidston and W. H. Lang from the Rhynie chert bed: R. gwynne-vaughnii in 1917, and R. major in 1920.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Kidston |first=R. |last2=Lang |first2=W.H. |year=1920 |title=On Old Red Sandstone plants showing structure, from the Rhynie Chert Bed, Aberdeenshire.

A study of the vascular tissue of the two by David S. Edwards in 1986 lead to the conclusion that the cell structure of R. major lacked secondary thickening bars seen in the xylem of R. gwynne-vaughanii, and was more like the water-conducting system (hydrome) of moss sporophytes. His conclusion was that R. gwynne-vaughanii belongs in the vascular plants, while R. major belongs among the bryophytes. Accordingly he transferred it to a new genus as Aglaophyton, leaving R. gwynne-vaughnii as the only species of Rhynia.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Edwards |first=David S. |year=1986 |title=Aglaophyton major, a non-vascular land-plant from the Devonian Rhynie Chert |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=173–204 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1986.tb01020.x [/tpl] Rhynia is the type genus for the rhyniophytes, established as the subdivision Rhyniophytina by Banks,[tpl]Cite journal |last=Banks |first=H.P. |year=1975 |title=Reclassification of Psilophyta |journal=Taxon |volume=24 |pages=401–413 |doi=10.2307/1219491 |issue=4 [/tpl], cited in [tpl]Cite journal|last=Banks |first=H.P. |year=1980 |title=The role of Psilophyton in the evolution of vascular plants |journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology |volume=29 |pages=165–176 |doi=10.1016/0034-6667(80)90056-1 [/tpl] but since treated at various ranks.

In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram for the polysporangiophytes, in which Rynia and the other Rhyniaceae are placed as basal vascular plants (tracheophyes).[tpl]Cite journal |last=Crane |first=P.R. |last2=Herendeen |first2=P. |last3=Friis |first3=E.M. |year=2004 |title=Fossils and plant phylogeny |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=91 |pages=1683–99 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1683 |accessdate=2011-01-27 |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1683 |lastauthoramp=yes |issue=10 |pmid=21652317[/tpl]
