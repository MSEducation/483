Edna Eicke (1919–1979) was for many years an illustrator of distinctive covers for the New Yorker magazine. 'Do you have trouble letting go of old copies of The New Yorker?' asked John Updike in the foreword to an anthology of the magazine's covers. 'Blame the covers … We want to be where the cover is, whether it's a pricey night club by Peter Arno or an Eden-green lawn by Edna Eicke … ' John Updike, 'Foreword', in The Complete Collection of Covers from The New Yorker 1925–1989 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989), p. v.
She was married to the illustrator Tom Funk.
