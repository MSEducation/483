In 2007, scientists at Stanford University and the Advanced Light Source facility in Berkeley, California reported that powder diffraction experiments combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence analysis have showed that the process of producing Terracotta figures colored with Chinese purple dye consisting of barium copper silicate was derived from the knowledge gained by Taoist alchemists in their attempts to synthesize jade ornaments.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Loïc|coauthors=Robinet, Laurianne; Thoury, Mathieu; Janssens, Koen; Cohen, Serge X.; Schöder, Sebastian|title=Cultural heritage and archaeology materials studied by synchrotron spectroscopy and imaging|journal=Applied Physics A|date=26 November 2011|volume=106|issue=2|pages=377–396|doi=10.1007/s00339-011-6686-4|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00339-011-6686-4[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z.|coauthors=Mehta, A.; Tamura, N.; Pickard, D.; Rong, B.; Zhou, T.; Pianetta, P.|title=Influence of Taoism on the invention of the purple pigment used on the Qin terracotta warriors|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=November 2007|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1878–1883|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.01.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000131[/tpl]
Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the UCL Institute of Archaeology have been using analytical chemistry techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry of 40,000 bronze arrowheads bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows’ chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a cellular manufacturing system similar to the one used in a modern Toyota factory, as opposed to a continuous assembly line in the early days of automobile industry, was employed in the construction of the Terracotta Army.[tpl]cite web|last=Rees|first=Simon|title=Chemistry unearths the secrets of the Terracotta Army|url=http://www.rsc.org/eic/2014/03/terracotta-army-warriors-fluorescence-spectrometry|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=6 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Martinón-Torres|first=Marcos|coauthors=Li, Xiuzhen Janice; Bevan, Andrew; Xia, Yin; Zhao, Kun; Rehren, Thilo|title=Forty Thousand Arms for a Single Emperor: From Chemical Data to the Labor Organization Behind the Bronze Arrows of the Terracotta Army|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory|date=20 October 2012|doi=10.1007/s10816-012-9158-z|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10816-012-9158-z/fulltext.html[/tpl]
In addition, grinding and polishing marks visible under a scanning electron microscope provide evidence for the earliest industrial use of lathes for polishing.
