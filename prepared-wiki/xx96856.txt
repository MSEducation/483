Helmut Schmidt (February 21, 1928 - August 18, 2011) was a German-born physicist and parapsychologist.

==Biography==

Schmidt was born in Danzig, Germany. He was educated at the University of Göttingen (M.A., 1953) and obtained a Ph.D. in physics from University of Cologne in 1958.Helmut Schmidt Biography He taught theoretical physics at universities in America, Germany and Canada.Helmut Schmidt Obituary 
In the 1960s Schmidt carried out experiments into clairvoyance and precognition.C. E. M. Hansel. (1980). ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation. Prometheus Books. pp. 222-232 In the early 1970s he pioneered research into the effects of human consciousness on machines called random number generators or random event generators[tpl]cite book|author1=Daniel Druckman|author2=National Research Council (U.S.).

Schmidt's early psychokinesis experiments involved machines with one red and one green light. Subjects would attempt to make one light illuminate more than another. Schmidt has reported success rates of 1–2% above what would be expected at random over a large number of trials.Jim B. Tucker. (2006). Life Before Life. St. Martin's Press. p. 191

==Reception==

Critics have written Schmidt's experiments in parapsychology have not been replicated.George K. Zollschan, John F. Schumaker. (1989). Exploring the Paranormal: Perspectives on Belief and Experience. Unity Press. p. 175 Schmidt worked alone with no one checking his experiments. He was accused of being a careless experimenter.Gordon Stein. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 609 
The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel found flaws in all of Schmidt's experiments into clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. Hansel found that necessary precautions were not taken, there was no presence of an observer or second-experimenter in any of the experiments, no counterchecking of the records and no separate machines used for high and low score attempts. There were weaknesses in the design of the experiments that did not rule out the possibility of trickery. There was little control of the experimenter and unsatisfactory features of the machine employed. Regarding the machine used in the experiments, Hansel wrote:
 The most obvious weakness in Schmidt's machine is that the results are in no case recorded positively inside the machine. They are only revealed after processing data obtained from the resettable counters in the machine or from the paper punch connected it. While machines may be foolproof, human beings seldom are... If Schmidt had used two machines, his scores for high- and low-aiming runs could have been kept separate from the start. Nonresettable counters could have ensured that all attempts were recorded and some supervision of the use and recording of the counters would have instilled more confidence into readers of the reports than they are likely to have at present.   
According to the physicist Victor Stenger "While Schmidt claims positive results, his experiments also lack adequate statistical significance and have not been successfully replicated in the thirty-five years since his first experiments were reported."Can Prayer Change the Past? by Victor Stenger
The psychologist James Alcock wrote that he found "serious methodological errors" throughout Schmidt's work which rendered his conclusions of psychokinesis untenable.Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair by James Alcock
