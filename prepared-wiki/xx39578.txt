The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released in March 1982. It saw the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson, and the final appearance of drummer Clive Burr.
The Number of the Beast met with considerable critical and commercial success and was a landmark release for the band, becoming their first album to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, and be certified platinum in the US. The album also produced the singles "Run to the Hills" and "The Number of the Beast", the former of which was the band's first top-ten UK single. The album was also controversial – particularly in the US – due to the religious nature of its lyrics and its artwork.
Since the release of The Number of the Beast and its subsequent tour, The Beast on the Road, "The Beast" has become an alternate name for Iron Maiden, and was later used in the titles of some of their compilations and live releases, including Best of the Beast and Visions of the Beast.

==Writing and recording==

The Number of the Beast is Iron Maiden's only album to include songwriting credits from Clive Burr, and was the band's first album to feature writing by guitarist Adrian Smith.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=224[/tpl] In addition, the release saw Steve Harris adopt a different approach to writing, which would cater more for new vocalist Bruce Dickinson. The album's producer, Martin Birch, remarked, "I simply didn't think vocalist Paul Di'Anno was capable of handling lead vocals on some of the quite complicated directions I knew Steve wanted to explore... when Bruce joined, it opened up the possibilities for the new album tremendously."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=223[/tpl]
According to several interviews, Dickinson was heavily involved in writing several of the album's songs, and in particular the tracks "Children of the Damned", "The Prisoner" and "Run to the Hills".[tpl]cite web |url=http://livinglegendsmusic.com/library.php?personID=583 |title=Living Legends Music Bio on Bruce Dickinson |publisher=Livinglegendsmusic.com |accessdate=9 November 2010[/tpl] Due to his previous band Samson's ongoing contractual issues, Dickinson could not legally take part in any songwriting for the record,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=224[/tpl] and had to make what he called a "moral contribution", which meant he was able to influence particular tracks, but not provide enough creative input so as to earn a writing credit.[tpl]cite book |last1=Shooman |first1=Joe |title=Bruce Dickinson: Flashing Metal with Iron Maiden and Flying Solo |publisher=Independent Music Press |year=2007 |page=82 |isbn=0-9552822-4-1[/tpl] The recording and mixing of the album had to be completed in only five weeks,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=226[/tpl] after the band had spent too long constructing the new songs.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl] This was because the group were for the first time creating a new album from scratch, with very little material written prior to the record's pre-production stage.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=224[/tpl]
Music press reports told stories of unexplained phenomena occurring during the sessions at Battery Studios, such as lights turning on and off of their own accord and the recording gear mysteriously breaking down. This all climaxed when Birch was involved in a car accident with a mini-bus transporting a group of nuns, after which he was presented with a repair bill for £666.[tpl]cite journal |title=Devil Incarnate |journal=Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem |year=2005 |first=John |last=Doran |pages=140–141 |publisher=Future Publishing[/tpl]

==Songs==

"Run to the Hills" was released as a single on 12 February 1982, two weeks before Iron Maiden's UK tour, acting as a preview for the forthcoming album, which would not be released until two days after the British dates ended.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=226[/tpl] Released alongside a music video, made using live footage and clips from Buster Keaton films,[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=226[/tpl] the single performed remarkably well, earning the band their first top ten in the UK Singles Chart. As they were rushing to complete the album in time, as well as record and mix the single for an even earlier release, the band hastily selected "Total Eclipse" as the B-side.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl]
As they had written too much material, they had to choose between "Total Eclipse" and "Gangland" for the "Run to the Hills" single release, with the understanding that the other song would make it onto the album.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl] Several band-members have since expressed regret over the decision, with Steve Harris commenting, "We just chose the wrong track as the B-side. I think if 'Total Eclipse' had been on the album instead of 'Gangland' it would have been far better."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl] On top of this, Harris has stated that the record's opening track, "Invaders", was not good enough, commenting that it "could have been replaced with something a bit better, only we didn't have anything else to replace it with at the time. We had just enough time to do what we did, and that was it."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl]
While the title track was considered by many religious groups in the United States as evidence that Iron Maiden were a Satanic band, the song was in fact inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=224[/tpl] In addition, Harris has stated that the lyrics were also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. The track opens with a spoken introduction which draws mostly from Revelation 12:12 and 13:18, read by actor Barry Clayton.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=149&title=10_best_metal_intros&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |last=Parsons |first=Katie |title=The 10 Mightiest Intros in Metal |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |publisher=NME[/tpl] According to Dickinson, the band originally approached actor Vincent Price to record the passage, but asked Clayton after Price insisted on a fee of £25,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bruce-dickinson-iron-maiden-to-tour-in/ |title=Bruce Dickinson: Iron Maiden to tour in 2005 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |date=8 June 2004 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net[/tpl]
The closing song "Hallowed Be Thy Name" has remained in all but one of the band's setlists since the album's recording (the only exception being the Maiden England World Tour 2012–13). AllMusic describes the track as "perhaps the most celebrated of the band's extended epics; it's the tale of a prisoner about to be hanged, featuring some of Harris' most philosophical lyrics." Several band-members have since stated that it is one of their favourite tracks, with Dickinson describing it as "fantastic" and that performing it live is like "narrating a movie to the audience." A live version of the song was released in 1993, gaining the band another top ten placement in the UK Singles Chart.
"Children of the Damned" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/children-of-the-damned |title=Children of the Damned (1963) |accessdate=26 January 2012 |work=Time Out London[/tpl] On his last radio show for BBC Radio 6, during a segment in tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio, Dickinson mentioned that Children of the Damned was inspired by Black Sabbath's "Children of the Sea".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sj689 |title=Bruce Dickinson Friday Rock Show- 28/05/2010 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |publisher=BBC Online[/tpl]
"The Prisoner" was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the audio clips for the song and was extremely hesitant during his conversation with whom Smallwood himself describes as "a real bona fide superstar actor".[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=227[/tpl] McGoohan was reported to have said "What did you say the name was? A rock band, you say? Do it."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=227[/tpl] Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, "Back in the Village" from 1984's Powerslave.[tpl]cite journal |title=Show Me The Mummy |journal=Kerrang! Legends |first=Dom |last=Lawson |issue=2 |pages=46–47 |publisher=Bauer Media Group[/tpl]
"22 Acacia Avenue" is the second song in the "Charlotte the Harlot" saga, which was originally written by Adrian Smith several years earlier, while playing in his old band, Urchin. According to Smith, Steve Harris remembered hearing the song at an Urchin concert in a local park, and modified it for The Number of the Beast album.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=167[/tpl]

==Reception and controversy==

The album was strongly opposed by social conservatives – especially in the US, where Iron Maiden were accused of being Satanists. Public burnings of the band's catalogue were organised, although some religious groups smashed the records with hammers, for fear of inhaling fumes from burning vinyl.[tpl]cite journal |title=Raising Hell |journal=Kerrang! Legends |first=Simon |last=Young |issue=2 |page=32 |publisher=Bauer Media Group[/tpl] The Beast on the Road tour was subject to numerous boycotts and demonstrations: venues were sometimes surrounded by activists who handed out leaflets and, in one case, a 25-foot cross was carried in protest.[tpl]cite video |date=4 December 2001 |title=Classic Albums: Iron Maiden – The Number of the Beast |medium=DVD |publisher=Eagle Vision[/tpl] Harris has stated, "It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists."[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=228[/tpl] 
Since its release, the album has received consistent critical acclaim, with AllMusic describing it as "among the top five most essential heavy metal albums ever recorded. A cornerstone of the genre." Sputnikmusic calls it "a classic in the world of metal", while BBC Music praised the record's complex arrangements, stating "Whereas even some of the venerable HM institutions (think Black Sabbath) would struggle to make material that was something more than a collection of minor-key riffs, Iron Maiden pull this feat off with considerable élan." Q magazine placed the album at No. 100 in its list of the "100 Greatest British Albums Ever" in 2000; in 2001 named it one of the "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time";[tpl]cite journal |work=Q |title=Q 's 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time |year=July 2001 |page=86 |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50%20Heaviest |publisher=Bauer Media Group[/tpl] and in 2006 placed it at No. 40 in its "40 Best Albums of the '80s" list.[tpl]cite journal |title=The 40 Best Albums of the '80s |journal=Q (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Q |year=2006 |month=August |issue=241[/tpl] IGN and Metal Rules placed it third and second, respectively, in their lists of the Top Heavy Metal Albums,[tpl]cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/01/20/top-25-metal-albums?page=7 |title=Top 25 Metal Albums |accessdate=17 January 2009 |author=Spence D. |publisher=IGN |date=19 January 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://metal-rules.com/polls/index.php?id=6 |title=The Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums |accessdate=17 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Metal Rules |date=September 2003[/tpl] and Guitar World ranked it at No. 17 on their list of "100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time".[tpl]cite journal |title=Guitar World's 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time |date=October 2006 |pages= |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Boggs1027/guitar_worlds_100_greatest_guitar_albums_of_all_time |work=Guitar World[/tpl] Classic Rock placed it at No. 15 in their list of the "100 Greatest British Rock Albums", describing it as "the most important metal album of the decade",[tpl]cite journal |title=100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever |journal=Classic Rock |date=April 2006 |issue=91 |pages=64 |id= |publisher=Future Publishing[/tpl] and it was voted No. 1 in HMV's list of "The Best British Albums of the Past 60 Years" in 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/its-official-iron-maiden-are-better-than-led-zeppelin-and-the-beatles-number-of-the-beast-voted-best-british-album-of-the-past-60-years/ |title=It’s Official: Iron Maiden Are Better than Led Zeppelin and the Beatles – Number Of The Beast Voted Best British Album Of The Past 60 Years! |last=Alderslade |first=Merlin |accessdate=28 May 2012 |date=28 May 2012 |publisher=Metal Hammer[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9293231/Trainspotting-and-Iron-Maiden-top-Jubilee-poll.html |title=Trainspotting and Iron Maiden top Jubilee poll |accessdate=28 May 2012 |last=Hall |first=James |date=28 May 2012 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl] The Number of the Beast is one of two Iron Maiden records listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (1980's Iron Maiden being the other).[tpl]cite book |last=Lydon |first=Michael (preface) |title=1001 albums you must hear before you die |year=2008 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |isbn=978-1844036240 |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1001Albums.htm |edition=Updated ed. |editor=Dimery, Robert |accessdate=19 November 2012 |date=15 October 2008[/tpl]
In 2001, the BBC made a documentary about The Number of the Beast as part of the Classic Albums series, which was released on DVD in the same year.

==Album artwork==

Like all of Iron Maiden's album artwork during the 1980s and early 90s, it was painted by Derek Riggs. The cover was originally created for the song "Purgatory", but Rod Smallwood deemed it of too high a calibre for a single release and decided to save it for The Number of the Beast album instead.[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=135[/tpl] The original 1982 artwork includes a blue sky in the background; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.
The album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Eddie controlling Satan like a puppet, while Satan is also controlling a smaller Eddie. Smallwood explains that the concept was to ask "who's the really evil one here? Who's manipulating who?"[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=135[/tpl] According to Riggs this was inspired by a Doctor Strange comic book "which had some big villain with Doctor Strange dangling on some strings like a puppet, it was something I read as a child back in the 1960s I think", while the images of hell were "taken from my knowledge of medieval European Christian art which was full of such scenes."
The album's cover art has been parodied several times – by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger than the Devil, and on a T-shirt by Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/derek-riggs-iron-maiden-album-cover-artist-interviewed/ |title=Derek Riggs: Iron Maiden Album Cover Artist Interviewed |accessdate=30 March 2012 |last=Everley |first=Dave |date=30 March 2012 |publisher=Classic Rock |quote=How did you feel about some of the pastiches it inspired – ie, S.O.D.’s Bigger Than The Devil album cover, and Diamond Supply Co's T-shirts?[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.individualsole.com/2006/11/04/diamond-iron-maiden-tees/ |title=Diamond "Iron Maiden" Tees |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2011 |publisher=individualsole.com[/tpl]

==Release details and reissues==

The Number of the Beast was released on 22 March 1982 through EMI and its sister label Capitol in the United States. The album was reissued in 1995 with a bonus CD containing two songs ("Total Eclipse", and a live version of "Remember Tomorrow") that had been the b-sides of the album's two singles. The 1995 reissue incorrectly gives Paul Di'Anno a song-writing credit for "Total Eclipse"; the song had actually been written by Harris, Murray, and Burr.[tpl]cite book |last1=Iron Maiden |authorlink1=Iron Maiden |title=The Number of the Beast (remastered) Booklet |chapter=Album Credits |publisher=EMI |year=1998[/tpl]
The album was also reissued in 1998 by EMI and Sanctuary/Columbia in the US as an enhanced CD version, which included photos, band history and the music videos for the songs "The Number of the Beast" and "Run to the Hills", in addition to "Total Eclipse", which was restored to the album's track listing (having been excluded from the original edition due to space constraints).[tpl]sfn|Wall|2004|p=225[/tpl] This version mistakenly lists the track length for "22 Acacia Avenue" as 4:49 – it is in fact 6:37.
