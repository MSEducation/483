[[Praia do Burgau]]

CATEGORIES: Beaches of Algarve

Praia de Burgau, located in the town of Burgau, is a small but frequent beach during the summer. Because of the hills surrounding the beach, it is protected from the frequent north wind in this area of Algarve making it very pleasant for most of the people. It had two fishing companies with facilities near the beach that were closed; now they are used as a way where small boats can be transported from and to water. There is a small Barâ€“restaurant on the beach, the Beach Bar Burgau. There is another small beach with no land access west to Praia de Burgau which can be accessed by boat or renting a canoe on the beach. It is a frequented place for people making scuba-diving and fishing.
The beach does not have a Blue Flag because of its lack of showers for visitors.
