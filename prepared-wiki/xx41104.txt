Stockholm Arlanda Airport [tpl]Airport codes|ARN|ESSA[/tpl], is an international airport located in the Sigtuna Municipality of Sweden, near the town of Märsta, 37 km (23 miles) north of Stockholm and nearly 40 km (25 mi) south-east of Uppsala.
The airport is located within Stockholm County and the province of Uppland. It is the largest airport in Sweden, the third largest airport in the Nordic countries. The airport is the major gateway for international air travel in large parts of Sweden. Arlanda Airport was used by close to 21 million passengers in 2013, with 16 million international passengers and 5 million domestic.http://www.swedavia.se/PageFiles/420/docs/dec_13/pax_2013.pdf
Stockholm Arlanda Airport is the largest of the four major airports located in or near Stockholm (Stockholm-Bromma within the city, Stockholm-Skavsta in Nyköping about [tpl]convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] to the south and Stockholm-Västerås located in the city of Västerås about 100 kilometres to the west).

==History==

The airport was first used in 1959, but only for practice flights. In 1960, it opened for limited civil traffic, and in 1962 the official opening ceremony took place. It was used for intercontinental traffic already in 1960 since the runway at Bromma was too short. Scandinavian Airlines started using Douglas DC-8's on North American routes. The airport was also used very early by Pan American World Airways. The name Arlanda was decided after a competition prior to the airport opening. It is derived from Arland, an old name for the parish Ärlinghundra (now Husby-Ärlinghundra in Märsta) where the airport is situated. The '-a' was added in analogy with other Swedish place names ending with -landa, and also makes the name a play on the Swedish verb "landa", which means "to land". The 1960s and 70s saw increases in traffic with scheduled traffic and charter traffic. The Boeing 747 jumbojet was started to be used in the 1970s both on one stop scheduled flights to New York and on weekend nonstop charters to the Canary Islands. Domestic flights to Gothenburg, Malmö, Luleå and Kiruna were operated by SAS DC-9s from Arlanda since they were considered too noisy to be used at downtown Bromma. The rest of domestic traffic operated out of Bromma and all international traffic out of Arlanda.
In 1983 the domestic traffic operated by Linjeflyg moved from Bromma to Arlanda, using the terminal now known as Terminal 4. In 1990 two new domestic terminals called "Domestic 2 and 3" were built south of the first domestic terminal. In 1992 the terminal 2 was partly abandoned because of traffic decrease. It started to be used for international traffic the year after, and the main domestic and international terminals are renumbered into 4 and 5.The third runway was built 1998-2002. However, a recession in 2002 delayed till opening until 2003. At that time protests were raised by people living under its flight path in the municipality of Upplands Väsby. Traffic has recovered since and is now showing healthy increases but the third runway is only used during peak hours for environmental reasons. In September 2010 the first Airbus A380 superjumbo landed at the airport.Business Jet news blog[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Runways===

Arlanda has three runways: Runway 1 (01L/19R), Runway 2 (08/26), Runway 3 (01R/19L). Runway 1 is [tpl]Convert|3301|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] http://www.lfv.se/sv/FPC/IAIP/AD/AD2T/ESSA/ long and can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today. Runways 2 and 3 are [tpl]Convert|2500|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long. As indicated, runways 1 and 3 are parallel runways that can be operated independently of one another. Runways 1 and 3 are equipped with CAT III for instrument landings. The airport can handle simultaneous take offs and landings using runways 1 and 3 at the same time. Parallel takeoffs and landings can be performed in Instrument meteorological conditions, (IMC). Runway 3 (01R/19L) is reached from the main terminal area via taxiway bridges constructed to be able to handle the heaviest and largest airplanes in traffic. Since runway 3 (01R/19L) is located at a distance from the terminals a deicing area is placed close to the runway to avoid too long time between deicing and take off in winter conditions. Another deicing area is located in connection with the southern ramp area close to take off positions at runway 01L. There are high speed taxiway exits from all runways, except runway 08, to enable aircraft to exit the runways quickly after landing. This increases runway capacity during rush hours. Use of parallel taxiways around the terminal area separates arriving and departing traffic. Arlanda can handle all aircraft types in service including the Airbus A380.

===Terminals===

The airport has four terminals. Terminals 2 and 5 are used for international flights. Domestic flights are in Terminals 3 and 4. The new central building, Arlanda North, opened late 2003, connecting terminal 5 with the newly built Pier F. All international flights handled by SAS and its Star Alliance partners use the new central building. An Arlanda South building, connecting terminals 2, 3 and 4, was also planned, but construction is currently suspended due to lack of funds. In the terminal areas and the shopping area "Sky City" there are restaurants, shopping facilities, bars etc. to cater to the needs for passengers and visitors to the airport. There are hotels both at the airport in connection with the terminals and in its surroundings. The hotel capacity at the airport is being increased by the new Clarion Hotel Arlanda with 400 rooms set to open in November 2012. There are also conference facilities at the airport.

==Winter time operations and snow clearing==

Since its opening Stockholm Arlanda has always managed to continue its operations during heavy snowfall and difficult weather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infrastructures.com/0310/arlanda.htm |title=The World's Fastest Snow Plow |publisher=Infrastructures.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] Arlanda is exposed to lake-effect snowfalls, where ice cold air from northeast in combination with open water in the Baltic Sea causes heavy snowfall.
The airport administration claims to be world-leading at clearing snow from the runways. Arlanda has a policy to never close due to snowfall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information--services-to/Press/Facts/Snow-removal/ |title=Snow removal |publisher=Arlanda.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] Heavy snowfall can however cause delays. During heavy snowfall at least one runway stays open but in bad weather condition there may be delays even if flight operations continue at all times. Not just runways need to be cleared, aprons and aircraft parking areas need snow clearing as well. It is an advantage that there are three runways from 2003, allowing two open runways when one is cleared at lighter snowfall. The airport has a total of 250 000 m2 to clear from snow and ice, at the same time as the aircraft continue taking off and landing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information-about/About-the-airport/Filmer/World-class-snow-removal-at-Stockholm-Arlanda/ |title=World-class snow removal at Stockholm Arlanda |publisher=Arlanda.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] During the colder half of the year Stockholm Arlanda has about 65 seasonally hired snow removal staff. Together with permanent staff, they form a team of 100 people who provide snow removal services. Special routes are planned for sweeping teams, which clear each route at intervals of 35 to 45 minutes. The sweeping teams are directed via radio from the air traffic control tower. When snow removal is completed on each runway the surface is tested by a friction vehicle which measures friction value. The airport announces the friction value, and then it is each pilot who decides whether this value is sufficient for a landing. The friction value determines how often a runway must be ploughed and treated with anti-skid agent.

==Aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities==

SAS Technical Services, TUIfly Nordic and Priority Aero Maintenance. have large aircraft hangars and maintenance facilities at the airport. SAS Technical Services is headquartered at Arlanda and has hangar facilities suitable for widebody aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747-400s. The first part of this hangar complex was built to handle SAS' fleet of DC-8s. There are a number of positions on each side of the building initially built to handle this type. The hangar space are nowadays mostly used for Boeing 737s and MD-80s. The Boeing 747 hangar was inaugurated at the time when Scandinavian Airlines received their first Boeing 747s in the beginning of the 70s. It is large enough to handle a Boeing 747 and two MD-80 size airplanes at the same time. The offices of SAS Technical Services are situated in connection with the hangars. In the early days of the airport these hangars provided heavy maintenance for members of the KSSU group[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afiklmem.com/AFIKLMEM/en/g_page_tabs/GlobalSolutions/BoeingAircrafts/GlobalSolutions_BoeingAircrafts_747.html |title=Air France KLM Group |publisher=Afiklmem.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] which included KLM, SAS, Swissair and UTA. A number of other airlines, such as Thai Airways International, also maintained their aircraft in those hangars. Now the main user is Scandinavian Airlines. TUIfly Nordic has a hangar able to handle their largest aircraft which is the Boeing 767-300ER. Priority Aero Maintenance has its facilities in the eastern part of the airport. They provide heavy aircraft maintenance for a number of aircraft including MD-80 which is a common type to be overhauled by the company.
There is also a hangar in the southern part of the airport that was built by the former Swedish domestic airline Linjeflyg. This hangar is mainly used by regional aircraft.
Helicopter hangars and maintenance facilities are found at the very eastern part of the airport operated by Patria Helicopters.

==Hotels and hostels==

==VIP flights==

Arlanda, as the main airport serving the Swedish capital, is also used by VIP-flights[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information--services-to/Business/VIP-service/VIP-service-private-flight/ |title=VIP service for those travelling on their own private aircraft |publisher=Arlanda.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] using business jets. Government officials and celebrities are frequent visitors. In April 2011, the then-Chairman of the Russian Government Vladimir Putin visited Stockholm with a couple of large jet airplanes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Russia-State-Transport/Ilyushin-Il-96-300/1913721/L/ |title=Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin is taking off runway 08 after a visit to Stockholm to meet the King of Sweden and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt |publisher=Airliners.net |date=2011-04-27 |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] The Emperor of Japan has also visited Arlanda with his Boeing 747s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jetphotos.net/viewphoto.php?id=5723408 |title=Japan – Air Self Defence Force (JASDF) |publisher=Jetphotos.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] In September 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama, made an official visit to Sweden with Air Force One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/09/04/president-obama-visits-sweden |title= President Obama visits Sweden |publisher= whitehouse.gov |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] EU-meetings and exhibitions in the Stockholm area also bring special flights to the airport. Various private companies use their business jets to attend meetings in the Stockholm area. Some VIP-flights also go to downtown Bromma Airport, but since Bromma has limited operational hours many go to Arlanda instead. European Flight Service has a Grumman Gulfstream G550 based at Arlanda for VIP flights.

==Ground transportation==

===Stockholm===

====Rail====

The fastest way to the airport from Stockholm Central Station is the Arlanda Express high-speed train service, making the trip in 20 minutes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/to-from/train/ |title=Trains | Stockholm Arlanda Airport |publisher=Swedavia.com |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl]
It is possible to use the Stockholm commuter rail service (Pendeltåg) between Uppsala C and central and southern Stockholm. This route takes 38 minutes between Arlanda C station and Stockholm C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sl.se/sv/Om-SL/Nyheter/Ny-pendeltagslinje-till-Arlanda-och-Uppsala-startar-pa-sondag/ |title=Nu startar pendeltågslinjen till Arlanda och Uppsala – AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik |publisher=Sl.se |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] The fare is higher from Arlanda compared to other journeys on the commuter rail network.

====Bus====

Flygbussarna, Swebus and SL operate coaches to and from the airport which stop at several locations in northern Stockholm County as well as Stockholm City Centre and Stockholm Central Station. There is also a local bus line no 583 to Märsta, from where there are commuter trains to Stockholm and surroundings, the cheapest way of getting to/from Stockholm.

====Taxi====

All taxi companies are required to offer fixed prices when going from the airport, which takes away the guess-work of how much the fare will cost (one can still request use of the taxi meter). Most major companies also offer fixed prices to the airport.
Taxi fares are unregulated in Sweden nowadays, meaning taxis can claim any price as long as they follow the price list shown in the taxi and sticked on the side window.

===Uppsala and further north===

There is a Stockholm commuter rail service (Pendeltåg) between Uppsala and Stockholm, but on Uppsala county tickets north of Arlanda. This route takes 18 minutes from Arlanda Central to its Uppsala C terminus.
Buses operated by Upplands Lokaltrafik travel between Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Uppsala (bus no. 801 and 802) as well as Enköping to the west (bus no. 803).
Long-distance trains called Intercity, Regionaltåg (Regional train) or X2000 operated by SJ go to locations north of Stockholm Arlanda Airport and south of Stockholm. Passengers are not permitted to use long-distance trains to go to the Stockholm Central Station; no such tickets are sold.

===Airport parking===

Terminal parking, short-term and long-term parking is available at the airport. The low price long-term parking requires a free shuttle bus ride. The bus departs every 8–15 minutes.

==Environment==

There is an ongoing work to limit Arlanda's negative impact on the environment. In an effort to save electricity, buildings at Arlanda use district heating with biofuels and district cooling with water from a nearby lake. The take off charges for aircraft are partly based on the environmental performance of the aircraft and Arlanda is experimenting with Continuous Descent Approaches and landings, often referred to as "green landings".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.1383 |title="Gröna landningar" gör världspremiär på Arlanda |publisher=Idg.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] Jet fuel is since around 2006 delivered by boat to Gävle and via train to Brista close to Märsta and from there through pipeline. Previously fuel was delivered by ship to Värtahamnen in Stockholm and then by trucks through Stockholm city to Arlanda. The airport also takes measures to promote the use of bio fuel in taxis operating to and from the airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arlanda.se/en/Information--services-to/Press/Press-releases/Stockholm-Arlandas-taxi-system-wins-another-environmental-award/ |title=Stockholm-Arlanda's taxi system wins another environmental award |publisher=Arlanda.se |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl]
One of the most interesting eco-friendly systems Stockholm Arlanda Airport uses is their unique heating and cooling system for their hangar, terminals, and other buildings on the airfield. There innovative system uses a series of wells which are linked to a large underground aquifer. The water from this underground source is plumbed up and into the facilities air system which controls the temperature of the air coming from the vents. In the summertime, the underground water remains cooler than the surface. This allows the terminals to be cooled off without using extra energy that an air conditioner would require. Then, in the winter months, the underground water remains warmer than the surface. The water is then plumbed to a control/heating unit which uses bio-fuel to heat the water to a temperature appropriate for warming up the buildings. This heated water is also used to heat pads of cement on the ramp and near the large hangar doors. This is a very efficient way to keep the doors and ramps clear of ice. After the water is run through the system, it is then all replaced back into the aquifer to be used again. The unique aquifer system is one of Arlanda's most defining environmentally friendly designs.Swedavia. (2012). The Aquifer – The World's Largest Engergy Storage Unit. Retrieved from Arlanda.org
