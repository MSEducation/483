Turtleback Falls, also called Umbrella Falls, is a waterfall in Western North Carolina, located near Brevard.  The falls is located on the Horsepasture River. It is on Pisgah National Forest land just outside Gorges State Park.

==Geology==

The falls has a large, deep pool at the bottom commonly known as the "Chug Hole". The river flows over a large, sloping slab of rock before curving steeper and finally dropping into the pool. The appearance of the rock, similar to a turtle's shell, gives the falls its name.

==Visiting the Falls==

The falls is accessible by a short hike starting in Gorges State Park & passing through Pisgah National Forest property. From NC 281, drive [tpl]Convert|1.6|mi[/tpl] to a parking area & follow the trail-head at the corner of the lot. 
Follow the orange blazes along the gravel path for approximately 20 minutes until you pass into the Pisgah National Forest. From there, follow the dirt trail for 15 minutes through a primitive campsite to Rainbow Falls & take the right fork for a 5 minute hike up to the falls. 
Turtleback Falls is a popular place for swimming and people frequently slide over the falls into the Chug Hole during low water; however, the currents can be dangerous in higher flows and people have drowned at Turtleback, or have been swept downriver and over 125' Rainbow Falls.  There have been many people killed this way. The latest death was a 28 year old woman in June 2010.
