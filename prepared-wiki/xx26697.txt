</ref> explain that the study of human communication is conventionally divided into [[Syntax|syntactics]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] and that these subfields of [[linguistics]] are indivisible and interdependent. After [[Watzlawick]], Bradley and Biederman argue that "[s]uperimposed on these three aspects of communication is the ''context'' in which the communication occurs" and that this context is vital to understanding communication. Bradley and Biederman argue that Bandler and Grinder focus on syntactics and semantics and disregard pragmatics and context which are "the most intricate and important aspects" of communication. Bradley and Biederman argue that to this extent Bandler and Grinder have produced a very superficial analysis of verbal and non-verbal communication. It is also argued that this major deficiency in NLP cannot be remediated "as long as Bandler & Grinder refuse to acknowledge the need for empirical research."  Furthermore, "their theory is not clearly articulated; its terminology, premises, and assumptions are either specified in an ambiguous manner or not specified at all". Responding to Bandler and Grinder's maxim that they aren't interested in the "truth" but only in "what works", Bradley and Biederman state, "[i]t has yet to be empirically demonstrated that their [Bandler and Grinder] approach works". For example, a central supposition of NLP—that there exists a connection "between a client's distorted perceptions of the world and his/her distorted linguistic representations"—is undergirded only by [[faith]] and [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. Bradley and Biederman highlight that on the one hand Bandler and Grinder posit that there is no veridical relationship between ''reality'' and ''perception'' (an idea drawn from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]) yet on the other hand they offer only [[Anecdotal evidence|personal testimony]]—something which according to their own theoretical position is unreliable—in support of the accuracy of their theory.
