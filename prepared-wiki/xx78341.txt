==Flag of each emirate==

Each of the seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates has its own flag, except for Fujairah, which uses the federal flag as state flag too.
The flags are derived from the traditional red flags used traditionally by the different Arab emirates around the Persian Gulf. Under the protection of the British Empire from 1820, it was decided to add a white field at the hoist of the flag. The same basic pattern can be seen in the flag of Bahrain and the flag of Qatar, emirates who opted not to join the UAE when it was created in the 1970s.
