]]
The international governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is the International Rugby Board (IRB). The IRB headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland. The IRB, founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws and rankings. As of February 2014 the IRB recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 18 associate member countries. According to the IRB, rugby union is played by men and women in over 100 countries. The IRB controls the Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup,[tpl]cite web | work=rwcwomens.com |title = IRB Women's Rugby World Cup |url=http://www.rwcwomens.com/| accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Rugby World Cup Sevens,[tpl]cite web | work=stuff.co.nz |title = Russia to host 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/international/sevens/5634035/Russia-to-host-2013-Rugby-World-Cup-Sevens| accessdate=24 September 2011|date=15 September 2011[/tpl] IRB Sevens World Series,[tpl]cite web | work=irbsevens.com |title = Rules|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/seriesinfo/rules.html| accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] Junior World Championship,[tpl]cite web | work=IRB.com|title = Chile to host IRB Junior World Trophy |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2000098.html| accessdate=24 September 2011|date=31 August 2007[/tpl] Junior World Trophy,[tpl]cite web | work=IRB.com |title = IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy |url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html| accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Nations Cup[tpl]cite web | work=IRB.com |title =Nations Cup |url=http://www.irb.com/nationscup/news/index.html| accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] and the Pacific Nations Cup.[tpl]cite web | work=IRB.com |title =Pacific Nations Cup |url=http://www.irb.com/pacificnationscup/index.html| accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] The IRB holds votes to decide where each of these events are be held, except in the case of the Sevens World Series for which the IRB contracts with several national unions to hold individual events.
Six regional associations, which are members of the IRB, form the next level of administration; these are:
SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) is a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, the New Zealand Rugby Union and the Australian Rugby Union that operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina).[tpl]cite web | work=rugbyweek.com |title = SANZAR Boss Peters defends TriNations timing |url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/news/article.asp?id=31407| accessdate=24 September 2011 |date= 4 August 2011[/tpl] Although the Argentine Rugby Union initially has no representation on the SANZAR board, it has been granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allblacks.com/news/18009/SANZAR-remains-intact |title=SANZAR remains intact |first=James |last=Mortimer |work=AllBlacks.com |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl]
National unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to the IRB. The IRB Council has 26 seats. Each of the eight foundation unions – Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France – have two seats, and Argentina, [tpl]runion|Canada[/tpl], [tpl]runion|Italy[/tpl], [tpl]runion|Japan[/tpl] and the six regional associations each have one seat.[tpl]cite web | work=IRB |title =IRB Organisation| url= http://www.irb.com/aboutirb/organisation/index.html |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]

==Global reach==

The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were England, the country of inception, followed by the other three Home Nations, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel and over-seas university students.
The first rugby club in France was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year Argentina recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=11[/tpl]
At least six countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport; they are Fiji,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/4272324.stm |title=Fire and flair: Fijian rugby |publisher=BBC Sport|first=Sean |last=Davies |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl] Georgia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/news/newsid=2042633.html |title=Scene set for an exciting Junior Trophy |publisher=IRB |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2011[/tpl] New Zealand,[tpl]cite web|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/28/4/229.abstract |title=The New Zealand Rugby Injury and Performance Project: II.

===Oceania===

A rugby club was formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to New Zealand by Charles Munro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at Christ's College, Finchley.
Several island nations have embraced the sport of rugby. Rugby was first played in Fiji circa 1884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba on Viti Levu island.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=74[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5392022.stm | title=Fire and flair: Fijian rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date= 29 September 2006| accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl] Fiji then sent their first overseas team to Samoa in 1924, who in turn set up their own union in 1927.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=174[/tpl] Along with Tonga, other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include the Cook Islands, Niue, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.[tpl]cite web | url=http://oceaniarugby.com/member_unions/foru_member_union_american_samoa.html | title=Member Unions |work=oceaniarugby.com | accessdate=1 October 2011[/tpl]

===North America and Caribbean===

In North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, Canada's first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the United States, when students of McGill University played against a team from Harvard University in 1874.
Although the exact date of arrival of rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to British Guiana in 1933, switched their venue to Barbados; introducing rugby to the island.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=160[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=43[/tpl] Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include Jamaica[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html | title=Jamaica |work=IRB | accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] and Bermuda.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html | title=Bermuda |work=IRB | accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl]

===Europe===

The growth of rugby union in Europe  outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams have played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa whom where on a par with them and France. The rest of Europe were let to play amoungst themselves . During a period when they had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France lacking international competition became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia.[tpl]cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79–94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1[/tpl] In 1934, instigated by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRB. The founding members were [tpl]runion|ITA[/tpl], [tpl]runion|ROM[/tpl], [tpl]runion|NLD[/tpl], [tpl]runion|POR[/tpl], [tpl]runion|CSK[/tpl], and [tpl]runion|SWE[/tpl]. Other European rugby playing nations of note include Russia, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=148[/tpl] Rugby union in Portugal also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=130[/tpl]

===South America===

Although Argentina is the best-known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the Argentine Rugby Union in 1899,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8362870.stm | title=Puma power: Argentinian rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date=16 November 2009 | accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in Brazil since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when São Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=48[/tpl] It took Uruguay several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the Montevideo Cricket Club; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=166[/tpl] Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include Chile (1948),[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=58[/tpl] and Paraguay (1968).[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=127[/tpl]

===Asia===

Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby going back to the time of the British Empire. India began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the Calcutta Football Club forming in 1872. After the withdrawal of the British military from the area at the end of the decade, rugby in India faltered. India's lasting legacy to the sport was the presentation of the Calcutta Cup to the Rugby Football Union; the world's oldest international rugby trophy which is played for annually between England and Scotland.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=92[/tpl] Sri Lanka claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=152[/tpl] Malaysia also suffers from poor record keeping. Historically the first recorded match in Malaysia was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the HMS Malaya Cup which, named after the ship HMS Malaya, was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|pp=112–113[/tpl] Rugby union was introduced to Japan in 1899 by Ginnosuke Tanaka a student of Trinity Hall, Cambridge and Edward Bramwell Clarke, who studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=105[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/6157863.stm | title=Eastern Promise: Japanese rugby |work=BBC Sport |first=Sean|last=Davies | date=12 February 2007 | accessdate=20 September 2011[/tpl] The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented with the news that Japan will host the 2019 World Cup.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8170488.stm | title=England will host 2015 World Cup |work=BBC Sport  | date=28 July 2009 | accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl] It will be the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and is viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach, particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include Singapore, South Korea, China and The Philippines, while the former British colony of Hong Kong is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the Hong Kong Sevens tournament which was founded in 1976.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2042721.html | title=HSBC join Cathay as Hong Kong Sevens sponsors |work=IRB  | date=18 May 2011 | accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]
Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=42[/tpl] When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of Oman was formed in 1971, with His Majesty Qaboos bin Said al Said as Patron.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=126[/tpl] Bahrain founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the Dubai Sevens, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created by the Dubai Exiles Rugby Club. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with Israel, as of 2011, being the only member union from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |title=IRB World Rankings |publisher=IRB |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl]

===Africa===

In 1875, rugby was introduced to South Africa by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wesclark.com/rrr/kenya_rugby.html |title=A Review of Kenyan Rugby |publisher=wesclark.com|first=Michael Mundia |last=Kamau |accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895.[tpl]Harvnb|Godwin|1981|p=15[/tpl]
In more recent times the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century Madagascar has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4471650.stm |title=Madagascar rugby inspires new passion |publisher=BBC Sport|first=Tim |last=Cocks|date=26 November 2005 |accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be traced back to 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup four times since 1999.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8951401.stm |title=Namibia rugby: Out of Boks' shadow |publisher=BBC Sport|first=Sean |last=Davies|date=4 September 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] Other African nations to be represented in the IRB World Rankings as Member Unions include Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. South Africa and Kenya are among the 12 "core teams" that participate in every event of the IRB Sevens World Series.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/destination/edition=9/news/newsid=2048923.html#teams+announced+gold+coast+kick |title=Teams announced for Gold Coast kickoff |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]

==Women's rugby union==

Records of women's rugby football date back to the late 19th century, with the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, stating that she set up a rugby team in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/19918.php |title=Emily Valentine: First Lady Of Irish And World Rugby|work=IrishRugby.ie |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 November 2010[/tpl] Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the Cardiff Arms Park.[tpl]cite book |last=Davies |first=D.E. |title=Cardiff Rugby Club, History and Statistics 1876–1975 |year=1975 |publisher=The Starling Press |location=Risca|pages=70–71 |isbn=0-9504421-0-0[/tpl] In the past 30 years the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and, according to the IRB, is now played in over 100 countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/womensrugby/index.html |title=Great potential for Women's Rugby in Japan|work=IRB |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl]
The English based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland Ireland and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |title=RFUW: A Brief History |work=RFU |accessdate=28 September 2011[/tpl] This was replaced in 1994 by the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries. The premier international competition in rugby union for women is the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rwcwomens.com/history/index.html |title=Women's Rugby World Cup history|work=IRB |accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] Since 1994 it has been held every four years.

==Major international competitions==

The most important tournament in rugby union is the Rugby World Cup, a men's tournament that takes place every four years among the national rugby union teams. New Zealand is the current cup holder, winning the 2011 tournament held on home ground, beating France 8–7 in the final.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/15405316.stm |title=2011 Rugby World Cup final: New Zealand 8–7 France |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl] No World Cup winner has yet retained the trophy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/2015-rugby-world-cup/rugby/page/87752.html |title=Rugby World Cup |publisher=espn.co.uk|accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] England (2003) were the first team from the Northern Hemisphere to win, the previous champions being New Zealand (1987 and 2011), Australia (1991 and 1999), and South Africa (1995 and 2007). Major international competitions are the Six Nations Championship and The Rugby Championship, held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/trophys.htm |title=Rugby Trophys |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=4 October 2011[/tpl]
The Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams [tpl]nrut|England[/tpl], [tpl]nrut|France[/tpl], [tpl]nrut|Ireland[/tpl], [tpl]nrut|Italy[/tpl], [tpl]nrut|Scotland[/tpl] and [tpl]nrut|Wales[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/championship/history.php |title=Six Nations Championship: History |publisher=rbs6nations.com  |accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl] Each country plays the other five once. After the initial internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the Home International Championships. France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term Five Nations first appeared. However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/six-nations-2012/rugby/page/87742.html |title=Six Nations Championship |publisher=ESPN Scrum.com |accessdate=19 August 2011[/tpl] France then rejoined in 1939–1940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years. France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947. In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio, as the venue for their home games since 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/1633.php |title=Stadio Flaminio | publisher=rbs6nations.com |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] The current Six Nations champions are Ireland, who finished the tournament with a 22–20 victory over France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/26568235|title=Six Nations 2014: Ireland beat France to win title|first=Ben|last=Dirs|date=15 March 2014|accessdate=16 March 2014|publisher=bbc.co.uk[/tpl]
The Rugby Championship is the new name of the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rugbyweek.com/fournations/history.asp |title=TriNations Rugby | publisher=RugbyWeek.com |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/Boks-face-aerial-bombardment-20100630 |title=NZ expect aerial bombardment |publisher=sport24.co.za |first=J.J. |last=Harmse  |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date = 26 August 2010 | title = Preview: South Africa v Australia | work=Planet Rugby | publisher=365 Media | url = http://www.planetrugby.com/story/0,25883,16024_6340553,00.html | accessdate =27 August 2010[/tpl] The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice. In 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years. Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup, a number of commentators believed they should join the Tri-Nations,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/09/14/rugby.argentina.tri.nations/index.html  |title = Argentina invited to join Tri-Nations series|publisher=CNN|date = 14 September 2009|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] which came closer to reality after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, when SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) extended an official invitation to the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033716.html#irb+welcomes+argentina+four+nations+invite  |title = IRB welcomes Argentina Four Nations Invite|publisher=IRB |date = 14 September 2009|accessdate=4 September 2011[/tpl] The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams.

===Rugby tours===

During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888{–}the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/potted_history.php |title=The History |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |title=IRB Hall of Fame Welcomes Five Inductees |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 November 2008|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.[tpl]Harvnb|Griffiths|1987|p=ix[/tpl] "In the first century of rugby union's history the IRB only recognised matches with international status if both teams in a match came from a small pool of countries: Australia, British Lions, England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales." Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/the-new-zealand-natives-rugby-tour/nz-natives-rugby-tour |title=New Zealand Natives' rugby tour of 1888–9 |publisher=New Zealand History Online |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]  Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/78377.html |title=Take a trip down memory lane courtesy of our historian John Griffiths |publisher=espnscrum.com |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] "1 October: The original Wallabies beat a strong Gloucestershire XV 16–0 at Kingsholm, 2 October: The Invincible Second All Blacks have their toughest tour assignment when they are considered lucky to scrape home 13–10 against a star-studded Newport XV, 2 October: Argentina serve notice of their rapidly rising rugby stock by beating a Cardiff side captained by Gerald Davies."

===Rugby within international tournaments===

Rugby union was played at the Olympic Games in 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/history.html |title=Rugby in the Olympics: History |work=IRB |accessdate=16 August 2011[/tpl] As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17. In 1908, Australasia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport. In 2009 the International Olympic Committee voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the 2016 and 2020 games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/14/sports/14sports.html |title=I.O.C.

In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held in 2010, are Japan in the male event and Kazakhstan in the women's.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040867.html|title=Japan claim Asian Games gold |publisher=planetrugby.com  |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/regionalsports/newsid=2040914.html |title=Kazakhstan win first Asian Games women's gold |publisher=IRBSevens.com  |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl]

===Women's international rugby===

Women's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between France and Netherlands played in Utrecht.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rugbyrelics.com/museum/exhibitions/NR125/14.htm |title=Women's Rugby |work=rugbyrelics.com |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/119928-womans-rugby-beautiful-side-of-brutal-game |title=Women's Rugby: Beautiful Side of a Brtual Game |work=bleacherreport.com |first=Giorgi |last=Dolidze |date=5 February 2009  |accessdate=25 September 2011 [/tpl]
The first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Wales in 1991, and was won by the United States. The second tournament took place in 1994, and since that date the competition has been held every four years. The New Zealand Women's team have won the last four World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nz2011.govt.nz/news/february-2011/rugbys-prized-trophies-going-on-tour |title=Rugby’s prized trophies going on tour |work=nz2011.govt.nz |date= 6 February 2011 |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
As well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there are also other regular tournaments, including a Six Nations, run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in 1996 has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 13 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from 2006 to 2012.

==Variants==

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is Rugby sevens (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in Melrose, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the Hong Kong Sevens and Dubai Sevens, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game. A more recent variant of the sport is Rugby tens (10's or Xs), a Malaysian variant with ten players per side.[tpl]Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=71[/tpl]
Due to the physical nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/document/training/0/beginners20guide20en_7391.pdf|work=IRB |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=14|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Of these versions, Touch rugby, in which "tackles" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/getting-a-kick-out-of-touch/story-e6frep5o-1225699224845 |title=Touch rugby league growing in Brisbane |first=Karl|last=deKroo| work=The Courier-Mail |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/~/link.aspx?_id=A4A528E2CC22410390D89AE5E46D1EF9&_z=z |title=Touch Rugby | work=RFU |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] Tag Rugby, is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in the fact that kicking the ball is not allowed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/FormsOfRugby/Tag.aspx |title=Tag Rugby | work=RFU |date=11 April 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2011[/tpl] Mini rugby is another variant of rugby union aimed at fostering the sport in children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/downloads/REGULATIONS_Mini_Rugby_2012_to_2015(1).pdf |title=Mini and Leprechaun Rugby | work=irishrugby.ie |accessdate=27 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Rutherford |first=Don |title=The Complete Book of Mini Rugby |publisher=Partridge |year=1993 |location=London |page=2 |url= |isbn=1-85225-196-4 [/tpl] It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch. Similar to Tag Rugby, American Flag Rugby, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.americanflagrugby.com/about-afr.php |title=About AFR |work=americanflagrugby.com |accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ to Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.
Other less formal variants include beach rugby and snow rugby.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/news/newsid=2026163.html |work=IRB |title=Rugby X-treme hits the Andes|first=Frankie|last=Deges |date=15 July 2008|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]

==Influence on other sports==

Rugby union football, and its immediate ancestor rugby football, has had a strong influence on several other sports. Most obviously rugby league which originally was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing their laws and become a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.
The Gridiron codes, American football[tpl]Harvnb|Bath|1997|p=77[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=115[/tpl] and Canadian football,[tpl]Cite book |title=Encyclopedia Canadiana|volume = 8|editor=John Everett Robbins| year=1972 |publisher=Grolier of Canada|location=Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal |page=110 |isbn=0-7172-1601-2[/tpl] are derived from early forms of rugby. Confusingly, in Canada, Canadian football has also frequently been referred to as "rugby football", and a number of national and provincial bodies were called "Rugby Football Unions" or "Rugby Unions", such as the Ontario and Quebec Rugby Football Unions. For example, in the Encyclopedia Canadiana, the entry Rugby Football begins by referring to "the Canadian development of rugby union or "English rugger" introduced into Canada in the third quarter of the nineteenth century", but later states that "the Canadian game is a radical departure from rugby union".
The primary influence on early Australian rules football was rugby football and other games originating in English public schools.[tpl]cite book |last=Collins |first=Tony |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Wagg |title=Myths and Milestones in the History of Sport |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |pages=8–31 |chapter=Chapter 1: National Myths, Imperial Pasts and the Origins of Australian Rules Football |isbn=0-230-24125-5[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=A Game of Our Own: The Origins of Australian Football|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2010|pages=244–278|isbn=1-86395-347-7[/tpl] Tom Wills, who is recognised as one of the pioneers of Australian football, also attended Rugby School.[tpl]Cite book|last=de Moore|first=Greg|title=Tom Wills: His Spectacular Rise and Tragic Fall|publisher=Allen & Unwin|year=2008|pages=17–47|isbn=978-1-74175-499-5[/tpl]
James Naismith took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent basketball.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1027613/index.htm |last=Wolff |first=Alexander |title=The Olden Rules|work=Sports Illustrated |date=25 November 2002 |accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl] The most obvious contribution is the jump ball's similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport.

==Statistics and records==

According to a 2011 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport at Coventry University, there are now over four and a half million people playing rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/military-life/they-re-game-rugby-team-willing-to-play-all-takers-1.146065 |title=They're game: Rugby team willing to play all takers |first=Seth|last=Robson |publisher=stripes.com |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] This is an increase of 19 percent since the previous report in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/NewsMedia/MediaZone/02/04/22/88/2042288_PDF.pdf |title=Economic Impact Report on Global Rugby; Part III: Strategic and Emerging Markets |publisher=Centre for the International Business of Sport, Coventry University|first=Simon |last=Chadwick |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] The report also claimed that since 2007 participation has grown by 33 percent in Africa, 22 percent in South America and 18 percent in Asia and North America.
