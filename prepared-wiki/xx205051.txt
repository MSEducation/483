==History==

Bliss spa was founded by Marcia Kilgore, a Saskatchewan, Canada native who moved to Manhattan in 1987 to attend Columbia University. During college, she became a personal trainer to make money. Soon after she decided to take a course in skincare, largely because she had personally suffered from acne since her preteen years. Inspired by her classes, she began giving facials to her friends out of her East Village apartment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.karastan.com/statement_mk.asp |title=Make a statement.

==The brand==

Atmosphere
Bliss spa is known for introducing its spa atmosphere and is often credited for starting the mid 1990s spa boom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4018292.search?query=starwood+bliss |title=Industry News - Starwood Acquires Bliss from LVMH; Bliss Spas to Debut in W Hotels as Part of Acquisition of Spa, Catalog and Beauty Products Company |publisher=Hospitality Net |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2010[/tpl] A “sense of humor” is evident throughout the brand, with whimsically named spa treatments and products, such as “Quadruple Thighpass” for an anti-cellulite treatment.
Blissgirl
One of the most definitive images associated with the Bliss brand is their Blissgirl character, an illustrated girl who appears throughout Bliss-branded channels,
including Bliss catalog covers and blissworld.com. She is usually depicted using beauty products in playful ways, to align with Bliss’ playful brand personality.
Since her introduction, she has undergone several different illustration styles and characteristics, evolving over the years. She has been shown with almost every hair color, and has appeared as different races. She is almost always dressed in a signature white towel and Bliss’ Softening Socks and Glamour Gloves.
Products
The products are inspired by the company’s spa treatments, and many of them are meant to allow customers to recreate the spa experience at home.[tpl]cite web|author=By: Susan Lee (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/article/22259/29414 |title=DIY Spa Guide |publisher=Divinecaroline.com |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2010[/tpl] This is evident in such products as the Poetic Waxing Kit (the kit contains the same wax used during in spa waxing treatments) and the Triple Oxygen Instant Energizing Mask (a foaming mask that’s based on their Triple Oxygen Treatment facial).
Positioning
Bliss spa positions itself as "the young, modern antithesis to stuffy, intimidating spas", that includes rhythm & blues music, a brownie buffet, "movie-while-you-manicure" nail stations, and other features.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_July_19/ai_n14794978 |title=Bliss Opens Its First West Coast Spa At The W San Francisco; Bliss Continues to Grow with Spas Set to Debut at W Hotels in Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas | Business Wire | Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=July 19, 2005 |accessdate=August 10, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=United States |url=http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/features/attraction_detail.html?propertyID=97518&attractionId=1000621511 |title=W Hotels Los Angeles: W Los Angeles - Westwood - Hotel Rooms at whotels.com |publisher=Starwoodhotels.com |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2010[/tpl] The spa has attracted celebrity clientele including Oprah Winfrey, Julia Roberts, Uma Thurman, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna.
