The biological treatment of wastewater in the sewage treatment plant is often accomplished using conventional activated sludge systems. These systems generally require large surface areas for treatment and biomass separation units due to the generally poor settling properties of the sludge. In recent years, new technologies have been developed to improve settlability. The use of aerobic granular sludge technology is one of them. 

==Context==

Proponents of aerobic granular sludge technology claim "it will play an important role as an innovative technology alternative to the present activated sludge process in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment in the near future"[tpl]cite book|last=Ni|first=Bing-Jie|title=Formation, Characterization and Mathematical Modeling of the Aerobic Granular Sludge|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-31280-9|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/601/bfm%253A978-3-642-31281-6%252F1.pdf?auth66=1355393926_e27270dacd9faf9671be171972ced9d5&ext=.pdf[/tpl] and that it "can be readily established and profitably used in activated sludge plants". However in 2011 it was characterised as "not yet established as a large-scale application ... with limited and unpublished full-scale applications for municipal wastewater treatment."[tpl]cite journal|last=Gao|first=Dawen|author2=Liu, Lin|author3= Liang, Hong|author4= Wu, Wei-Min|title=Aerobic granular sludge: characterization, mechanism of granulation and application to wastewater treatment|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date=1 June 2011|year=2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=137–152|doi=10.3109/07388551.2010.497961|url=http://era.stanford.edu/pubs/Gao%20et%20al.%20%28CRB%29-2011_5579.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012[/tpl]

==Aerobic granular biomass==

The following  definition differentiates an aerobic granule from a simple floc with relatively good settling properties and came out of discussions which took place at the “1st IWA-Workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge” in Munich (2004):[tpl]cite book|last=Bathe|first=Stephan|title=Aerobic granular sludge : selected proceedings of the 1st IWA-workshop aerobic granular sludge organised by the Institute of water quality control and waste management of the technical University of Munich (TUM) in cooperation with the Institute of advanced studies on sustainability of the European Academy of sciences and arts (EASA) and the international water association (IWA)|year=2005|publisher=IWA publishing|location=Londen|isbn=978-1843395096|edition=1.ed.[/tpl]

==Formation of aerobic granules==

Granular sludge biomass is developed in sequencing batch reactors (SBR) and without carrier materials. These systems fulfil most of the requirements for their formation as:

==Advantages==

The development of biomass in the form of aerobic granules is being studied for its application in the removal of  organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds from wastewater.
Aerobic granules in aerobic SBR present several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge process such as:

==Treatment of industrial wastewater==

Synthetic wastewater was used in most of the works carried out with aerobic granules. These works were mainly focussed on the study of granules formation, stability and nutrient removal efficiencies under different operational conditions and their potential use to remove toxic compounds. The potential of this technology to treat industrial wastewater is under study, some of the results:  

==Pilot research in aerobic granular sludge==

Aerobic granulation technology for the application in wastewater treatment is widely developed at laboratory scales. The large-scale experience is still limited but different institutions are making efforts to improve this technology:
The feasibility study showed that the aerobic granular sludge technology seems very promising (de Bruin et al., 2004.de Bruin L.M.M., de Kreuk M.K., van der Roest H.F.R., Uijterlinde C. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge technology: and alternative to activated sludge. Water Science and Technology, Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 1–7) Based on total annual costs a GSBR (Granular sludge Sequencing Batch Reactors) with pre-treatment and a GSBR with post-treatment proves to be more attractive than the reference activated sludge alternatives (6-16%).
A sensitivity analysis shows that the GSBR technology is less sensitive to land price and more sensitive to rain water flow. Because of the high allowable volumetric load the footprint of the GSBR variants is only 25% compared to the references. However, the GSBR with only primary treatment cannot meet the present effluent standards for municipal wastewater, mainly because of exceeding the suspended solids effluent standard caused by washout of not well settleable biomass.

==Full scale application of aerobic granular sludge technology==

Aerobic granulation technology is already successfully applied for treatment of wastewater.
