==Political views==

Saifuddin Abdullah is known to be one of the more liberal politicians in Prime Minister Najib Razak's otherwise reactionary administration. For example, he criticised his own government's handling of the Bersih 2.0 rally in 2011, in which over 1,600 protestors were arrested on the streets of Kuala Lumpur.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/umno-deputy-minister-says-putrajaya-will-lose-moral-ground-with-uuca-appeal/|title=Umno deputy minister says Putrajaya will lose moral ground with UUCA appeal|last=Teoh|first=Shannon|date=5 November 2011|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl] In early 2013, he also stood up for a student who was humiliated by a government-linked panellist at a student forum in UUM.
