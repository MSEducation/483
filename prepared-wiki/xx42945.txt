==Plot==

The story is narrated by Sunny von Bülow who is in a coma after falling into diabetic shock after a Christmas party.  Her husband, the dissolute European aristocrat Claus von Bülow is charged with attempting to murder her by giving the hypoglycemic Sunny an overdose of insulin.  Claus' strained relationship with his wife and his cold and haughty personal demeanor lead most people to conclude that he is guilty.  In need of an innovative defense, Claus turns to law professor Alan Dershowitz.  Dershowitz is initially convinced of Claus' guilt, but takes the case because von Bülow agrees to fund Dershowitz' defense of two poor black teenagers accused of capital murder.  Employing his law students as workers, Dershowitz proceeds to defend Claus, wrestling with his client's unnerving personal style and questions of von Bülow's guilt or innocence.
