St Mary in the Marsh is a village near New Romney in Kent, England, situated in the heart of Romney Marsh in one of its least populated areas, but with New Romney just 3 miles away, there are plenty of amenities close by.
The village consists of a few homes, The Star Inn, which provides a focal point for the local community, and a church, “St Mary the Virgin”

==History==

It is probable that there was a Saxon church on the site originally known as "Siwold's Circe". This was superseded after the Norman invasion by a stone built church with a splendid three tier tower of Kentish ragstone. The oldest parts of the church are about 1133 AD. The chancel was extended in about 1220 AD. Inside is a plaque commemorating Edith Nesbit, author of The Railway Children, who lived at St. Mary's Bay and is buried in the churchyard. There are many interesting features of the building which warrant a visit.
St Mary in the Marsh is surrounded by the stark beauty of the marshes and the open landscapes of rich farmland
John Coleman (VC) was born in the village.
