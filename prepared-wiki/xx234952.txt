Hyundai Motor India Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Company in India. It is the 2nd largest automobile manufacturer in India.
Hyundai Motor India Limited was formed in 6 May 1996 by the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. When Hyundai Motor Company entered the Indian Automobile Market in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India. During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. Maruti, Hindustan, Premier, Tata and Mahindra. Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market with Cielo just three years back while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back.
For more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, Maruti Suzuki had a near monopoly over the passenger cars segment because TELCO and M&M were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products.
