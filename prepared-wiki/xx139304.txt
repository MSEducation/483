Complete Madness spent 99 weeks on the UK charts peaking at number 1. A accompanying VHS video was also released, containing all thirteen of the group's music videos up to that point (the twelve UK singles plus "Bed and Breakfast Man", which was a single in Canada).
The album was re-issued in 2010.
