==History==

===1988–1992===

The group first formed in the year of 1988. The band was originally called The Walls due to their original influence by the band Echoes; the frontman of Echoes, Jinsei Tsuji, was a political activist, and because of this The Walls too became a political band. Drummer Hideya Suzuki was not an original member of The Walls. When the original drummer departed, the band recruited Suzuki, who went to the same school as the other members. They changed their name in late 1988 after sending a demo tape that generated no interest from record companies, during a talk in a dinner. The group thought the word "children" had a nice ring to it, but because they were no longer children themselves, they decided to add Mr. in front of it. They credit this change as a new way they started to look at the group.Mr. Children 1992–1995 album booklet
After changing their name, Mr.Children auditioned at a music club called La Mama, failing to pass the first time, but passing a second audition to play at the club. After playing in the club, they were asked to try and debut as professionals. Mr.Children sent out five demo tapes; all failed to generate record label interest, and the group took a three-month hiatus in 1991. Suzuki Hideya worked as a receptionist at an economy hotel, while Kazutoshi Sakurai worked with his father who owned a construction company.Music Station SP' – Music Station, March 16, 2007, No. 881 When they returned, the group created a sixth demo tape and caught the attention of Toy's Factory. The label signed the group and had them play as the opening act for the rock group Jun Sky Walkers. It was also during this time that they were introduced to their long-time friend and producer Takeshi Kobayashi. Kobayashi was already known in the music industry as a music composer for Keisuke Kuwata of Southern All Stars and Kyōko Koizumi.

===1992–1994===

On May 10, 1992, Mr. Children's debut album, Everything, was released and represented the long journey they took to get to this point. Three months later their first single [tpl]Nihongo|"Kimi ga Ita Natsu"|君がいた夏[/tpl] was released on August 21, 1992. After the release of the single the group held two tours for the album, both held between September 23, 1992 and November 5 of the same year, the '92 Everything Tour comprising ten and the '92 Your Everything Tour consisting of twelve performances. To cap off the year and lead them into the next, Mr. Children released their second album, Kind of Love and their second single [tpl]Nihongo|"Dakishimetai"|抱きしめたい[/tpl] on December 1, 1992. "Dakishimetai" was later used as an insert song for the Japanese drama[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Nihongo|Pure|ピュア[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | title = The distance to "HOME" | publisher = Kadokawa television | series = 別冊カドカワ総力特集 Mr.Children |trans_title=Separate volume Kadokawa special issue Mr.Children | year = 2007 | pages = 167–170 | language = Japanese | isbn = 978-4-04-894488-5 [/tpl] Shortly after, a new tour called '92–93 Kind of Love Tour started and lasted from December 7, 1992 till January 25, 1993.
In 1993, with the completion of the band’s tour they began work on for their third album. The first single of the new year to be released was "Replay", released on July 1, 1993 and used in [tpl]Nihongo|Guriko Pokkii|グリコポッキー[/tpl] commercials. On September 9, 1993 their third album Versus was released, but failed to bring the group into the spotlight. They continued on and held a new tour. The '93 Versus Tour was held from September 23 until November 5 and had the band holding nine performances. Shortly after, "Cross Road" was released on November 10, 1993, which was used to promote the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Dousoukai|同窓会[/tpl]. The single was not a hit, but through word of mouth "Cross Road" gained popularity and after 22 weeks sold over a million copies and later, though released in 1993, managed to become the fifteenth best selling single in Oricon's 1994 yearly charts. Sakurai confessed years later as to not liking his works up to this point. According to him:
[tpl]cquote|I thought I had to be like Mr. Children's pop music star. That's why I tried my best to play the role.[tpl]cite news | title = BACKSTAGE PASS | pages = 8–24 | language = Japanese | publisher = Shinko music entertainment | date = April 1997 NO.176 [/tpl][/tpl]
On June 1, 1994 a new single called "Innocent World" was released and used a promotional song for the soft drink [tpl]Nihongo|Aquaerius Ioshisu|アクエリアス イオシス[/tpl]. The single solidified the groups popularity with its sales, managing to sell 1,935,830 copies and becoming the No. 1 selling single in Oricon's 1994 yearly charts. Afterwards work began on their fourth original album Atomic Heart. The album was released on September 1, 1994 and became the band's highest selling album to date.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/41005/ | title=ミスチル、ニューアルバム完成！|trans_title=Mr.Children and new album completion! | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=2007-06-22 | language=Japanese[/tpl] Due to the huge success the band received from the album and "Innocent World" single, the groups popularity built up creating the [tpl]Nihongo|"Mis-chil Phenomenon"|ミスチル現象[/tpl] in Japan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/11477/ | title=篠原涼子、"リレハンメル"でブレイク！ |trans_title=Ryoko Shinohara breaks away by "Lilly hammer"! | work=Oricon Style | publisher=Oricon | date=2006-02-07 | accessdate=2008-05-08 | language=Japanese[/tpl]

The band also released their sixth single "Tomorrow Never Knows" on November 10, 1994 which was used as the theme song to the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Wakamono no Subete|若者のすべて[/tpl]. The song was written while the group was on tour, was later voted in 2006 as fans No. 1 all-time favorite song on Music Station, and is currently the third highest selling drama tie-in single in Japan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/41246/ | title=2006年ドラマ主題歌No.1は!? |trans_title=2006's No.1 drama theme song? | work=Oricon Style | publisher=Oricon | date=2007-01-15 | accessdate=2007-06-16 | language=Japanese[/tpl] The next single, [tpl]Nihongo|"Everybody Goes (Chitsujo no Nai Gendai ni Drop Kick)"|everybody goes -秩序のない現代にドロップキック-[/tpl] was released on December 12, 1994, though originally intended to be the B-side of "Tomorrow Never Knows".Mr. Children 1996–2000 album booklet To end the year, "Innocent World" won the Song of the Year award at the 36th annual Japan Record Awards.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jacompa.or.jp/rekishi/d1994.htm | title=第36回日本レコード大賞 |trans_title=The 36th Japan Record Grand Prix | work=jacompa.or.jp | accessdate=2007-06-16 | language=Japanese[/tpl]

===1995–1997===

In 1995, the second half of the Atomic Heart tour started, lasting from January 1 to February 2. Mr. Children also became involved in charity work, doing a collaboration song with Keisuke Kuwata of Southern All Stars. The single [tpl]Nihongo|"Kiseki no hoshi"|奇跡の地球[/tpl] was used as the theme song for the Act Against AIDS campaign, was produced by Mr. Children and written by Kuwata. To promote the single and the campaign, they held a one month tour from April 18 until May 14, entitled [tpl]Nihongo|Live UFO '95 Rock Opera "Acoustic Revolution with Orchestra" Kiseki no hoshi|Live UFO '95 Rock Opera "Acoustic Revolution with Orchestra" 奇跡の地球[/tpl], where the group did cover songs of many English speaking artists such as The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/sas/live/data/liveufo95.html | title=LIVE UFO '95 桑田佳祐＆Mr. Children "Acoustic Revolution with Orchestra" 奇跡の地球(ほし) |trans_title='LIVE UFO '95 Kuwata Keisuke & Mr.Children "Acoustic Revolution with Orchestra" Kiseki no hoshi' | work=jvcmusic.co.jp | accessdate=2007-06-16 | language=Japanese[/tpl] During the tour the group was also filming a documentary/concert movie called Es ~Mr. Children in Film~.

Two months later the group held an open air tour titled [tpl]Nihongo|-Hounen Mansaku- Natsu matsuri tour Sora ku:|-Hounen Mansaku- 夏祭り1995 空ku:[/tpl] from July 16 to September 10, during which the ninth single, [tpl]Nihongo|"See-Saw Game (Yūkan na Koi no Uta)"|シーソーゲーム 〜勇敢な恋の歌〜[/tpl] was released on August 10.
On February 6, 1996 Mr. Children's tenth single [tpl]Nihongo|"Namonaki Uta"|名もなき詩[/tpl] was released, to promote the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Pure|ピュア[/tpl] and also for Daio Paper's [tpl]Nihongo|Elleair|エリエール[/tpl] commercial. The single went on to become Japan's highest first week selling single of all time (which was later broken by idol group AKB48) and is currently Japan's eighth highest selling drama tie-in single. The success of the single was also a surprise for Sakurai, who admitted to spending very little time writing the song. Two months later, on April 5, 1996 the group's eleventh single [tpl]Nihongo|"Hana (Mémento Mori)"|花 -Mémento-Mori-[/tpl] was released, followed by their fifth original album [tpl]Nihongo|Shinkai|深海[/tpl] on June 24 and their twelfth single [tpl]Nihongo|"Machine Gun o Buppanase (Mr. Children Bootleg)"|マシンガンをぶっ放せ -Mr.Children Bootleg-[/tpl], on August 8.

Mr. Children's 13th single, "Everything (It's You)", was released on February 5, 1997, with the title track used as the theme song to the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Koi no Bakansu|恋のバカンス[/tpl]. A month later, on March 5 Bolero, Mr. Children's sixth album was released. Soon after, rumors started of the group disbanding. Sakurai's reply: "The band will dissolve only when we have no more talent and have relationship problems with each other." Yet the group then decided to take some time off. Nakagawa and Suzuki start a side project band called Hayashi Hideo, and joined by Kenji Fujii from My Little Lover and Sawao Yamanaka from The Pillows, went on a club tour.

===1998–2000===

On February 11, 1998, they released their 14th single [tpl]Nihongo|"Nishi e Higashi e"|ニシエヒガシエ[/tpl], theme song to the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Kira kira Hikaru|きらきらひかる[/tpl].

Finally on October 21, 1998, Mr. Children officially re-grouped and released their 15th single, [tpl]Nihongo|"Owarinaki Tabi"|終わりなき旅[/tpl] with the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Naguru Onna|殴る女[/tpl] using it as their theme song. The song remains a public favorite in voting polls, Oricon citing its inspirational lyrics as the reason.[tpl]cite web | url=http://contents.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/45512/ | title=ZARDに支えられた･･･　夢を追いかけるときに聴きたい曲No.1 |trans_title=Supported by Zard… song I'd like to hear when running after the dream No.1 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=2007-07-15 | language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/43277/ | title=ZARD「負けないで」、14年経っても輝きは失われない |trans_title=ZARD 'Makenaide', 14 years later, blaze isn't lost | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=2007-07-15 | language=Japanese[/tpl]
On January 13, 1999, [tpl]Nihongo|"Hikari no Sasu Hou E"|光の射す方へ[/tpl], their 16th single, was released, followed by their seventh album, Discovery, on February 3, 1999. Sakurai compared his approach to the songwriting for the record to surfing:
Eleven days later they began the Discovery Tour '99, from February 14 to July 12, where the group visited 16 cities and held 42 shows. During the tour, Mr. Children released their 17th single "I'll Be" on May 12, which was used in [tpl]Nihongo|Shiseido's|資生堂[/tpl] Sea Breeze commercials. Though originally released on the Discovery album, the song was re-released as a single with a lighter beat. The single was not a success and became Mr. Children's lowest selling single since "Cross Road". During the Discovery Tour '99, an idea for a live album was brought up. It was released as a 500,000 copy limited edition on September 8, 1999 and called 1/42 (referring to one of the 42 shows in the tour). Most of the tracks were recorded on June 16, 1999 at the Makomanai ice arena, while the bonus track "Dakishimetai" was recorded at the Okinawa Ginowan-Shi seaside park.
At the beginning of a new century [tpl]Nihongo|"Kuchibue"|口笛[/tpl], released on January 13, 2000 became the groups 18th single. While "I'll Be" failed to be a success, "Kuchibue" proved to be a hit selling 724,070 copies.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/music/21151/ | title=Mr.Children、待望のニューシングル「箒星」リリース決定！|trans_title=Mr.Children, and long-awaited new single "Houkiboshi" release decision! | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=2007-10-04 | language=Japanese[/tpl] On August 9, 2000, their 19th single "Not Found" was also used as the theme song to the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Bus Stop|バスストップ[/tpl], followed a month later by their 9th original album Q on September 27, 2000.

Both albums went on to sell a combined total of 4,034,785 copies. According to an interview done with MTV Japan Sakurai stated the best of albums weren't something they had planned on doing yet. During this time, the group was finishing up work for their new upcoming album and had planned to start promoting singles on it. However it was decided that a best of album was needed and so they were released.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mtvjapan.com/music/interview/music_interview_detail.php?interview_id=79&pageid=1 | title=MTV Japan Vol.79 Mr.Children interview | work=mtvjapan.com | accessdate=2008-05-07 | language=Japanese[/tpl] Four days following the dual album release, the group launched the ‘popsaurus’ tour, visiting 10 cities and playing 15 shows, lasting from July 15, 2001 all the way through September 25, 2001. A month into the tour their 20th single [tpl]Nihongo|"Yasashii uta"|優しい歌[/tpl] was released and used to promote the beverage [tpl]Nihongo|Asahi inryo Wonda|アサヒ飲料 WONDA[/tpl]. Two months after the popsaurus tour ended, "Youthful Days" was released. Released on November 7, 2001, it was their 21st single and was an insert song for the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Antique ~seiyou kottou yougashiten~|アンティーク 〜西洋骨董洋菓子店〜[/tpl]. It ended up being their best selling single for the year. The b-side for the single, "Drawing", originally had no commercial tie-in, but two years later was used as the theme song to the 2003 Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Koufuku no ouji|幸福の王子[/tpl].
Mr. Children released their 22nd single [tpl]Nihongo|"Kimi ga Suki"|君が好き[/tpl] on January 1, 2002, which was used as a show song in the Japanese drama [tpl]Nihongo|Antique ~seiyou kottou yougashiten~|アンティーク 〜西洋骨董洋菓子店〜[/tpl]. Four months later their tenth original album It's a Wonderful World was released on May 10, the groups' tenth anniversary. The release of the album on their 10th anniversary was not something that had originally intended. As the group was wrapping up recording, Sakurai asked if the album could be released in the spring time. While the group and their management was trying to think of how to promote an album in the spring time, they came up with releasing the album on their 10th anniversary. A new tour, titled Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World was set to begin later that year.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.vibe-net.com/news/?news=0008004 | title=Mr.Children　ニュー・アルバムを引っ提げて、全国ツアーが決定 |trans_title=Mr.Children News – Nationwide tour and new album decided | work=vibe-net.com | accessdate=2008-08-09 | language=Japanese[/tpl] The previous single "I'll Be" from the Discovery album was selected to be used as an official theme for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/eng/koreajapan/ | title=2002 FIFA World Cup Official album: Songs of Korea Japan | work=sonymusic.co.jp | accessdate=2007-06-16 | language=[/tpl] On May 24, 2002 Mr. Children attended the first ever MTV Video Music Awards Japan and topped the awards show by winning 'Video of the year' for the song "Kimi ga suki".

==Fan club==

The official fan club of Mr. Children is called Father & Mother, the title being derived from their name.  The fan club, which started in 1994, was kept relatively secretive at first, as the group has never made any mention of it on their official website. In 2006, for the release of the group's 29th single "Shirushi", the official website was revamped and with it information about the fan club was finally added. Just like before however, the fan club can only be joined by mail and requires an admission fee of 3,500 yen, with yearly re-applications for membership.
