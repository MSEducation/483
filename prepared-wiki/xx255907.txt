[[Limits and fits]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanical engineering

In mechanical engineering, limits and fits are a set of rules how many thousandths of an inch or Milimetre a part's measurement is to be under or over the theoretical size to achieve various sorts of fit (sliding fit, rotating fit, non-sliding fit, loose fit, etc.)

LIMITS & FITS
LIMITS‐‐‐ High limit
Low limit
FITS‐‐‐	Clearance fit
Interference fit
Transition fit
LIMITS & FITS
LIMITS:‐ These are two extreme permissible sizes of dimension between which actual size of dimension is contained.The greater of these two is called high limit and the smaller low limit
LIMITS & FITS
FITS:‐
•	It is the relationship existing between two mating parts wrt amount of play or interference which is present when they are assembled together.
•	It is the degree of tightness or looseness between two mating parts to perform a definite function
Terms used in limits & fits:‐
•	Shaft
•	Hole
•	Basic size
•	Actual size
•	Limits of size– HL & LL
•	Tolerance = HL‐LL
•	Allowance = Difference between MMC of mating parts
Deviation‐‐• Upper deviation
•	Lower deviation
•	Mean deviation Zero Line
Fundamental Deviation
FITS
TYPES OF FITS‐
•	Clearance fit– Min & Max clearance
•	Interference,Press or Force fit– Min & Max       interference
•	Transition fit
HOLE/SHAFT BASIS SYSTEM
Various allowances for different fits maybe obtained in two ways:‐
•	Hole base system
•	Shaft base system
HOLE BASIS SYSTEM
•	HOLE SIZE IS KEPT CONSTANT AND SHAFT IS VARIED TO GIVE VARIOUS TYPES OF FIT.
•	BASIC SIZE TAKEN IS LOW LIMIT OF HOLE
•	HIGH LIMIT OF HOLE & TWO LIMITS (HL&LL) GIVE 
THE DESIRED FIT
HOLE BASIS SYSTEM
3
1	SHAFT
1 ‐‐‐ Clearance fit
2—Transition fit
3 Interference fit  
SHAFT BASIS SYSTEM
•	SHAFT SIZE IS KEPT CONSTANT & HOLE SIZE IS VARIED TO GIVE VARIOUS FITS.
•	BASIC SIZE IS TAKEN AS MAX LIMIT SIZE OF SHAFT.
•	LL OF SHAFT AND TWO LIMITS (HL & LL) OF HOLE GIVE THE DESIRED FIT.
•	METHOD NOT PREFERRED IN LARGE PRODUCTION
SHAFT BASIS SYSTEM

1	HOLE
1 ‐‐‐ Interference fit
2—Transition fit
3 ‐‐Clearance  fit  
TOLERANCE
•	Permissible variation in size or dimension is called tolerance.
•	Amount by which a job is allowed to go away from accuracy without any functional trouble 
25 ± 0.005 cm
ISO SYSTEM OF Limits & fits 
•	Covers holes and shafts up to 3150 mm
•	For any basic size there are 28 different holes progressively oversize and undersize.
•	28 holes are ‐‐
A,B,C,CD,D,E,EF,F,FG,G,H,J,JS,K,M,N,P,R,S,T,U,V,
X,Y,Z,ZA,ZB,& ZC
•	Each hole has a choice of 18 grades of tolerance i.e. IT01,ITO,IT1 to IT16 (Similarly for shafts)
•	Tolerance grades decide the accuracy of manufacture
