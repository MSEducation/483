The Cryptosporidium spore phase (oocyst) can survive for lengthy periods outside a host. It can also resist many common disinfectants, notably chlorine-based disinfectants.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/carpenter.htm |title=Chlorine Disinfection of Recreational Water for Cryptosporidium parvum |publisher=CDC |accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]

==Treatment and detection==

Many treatment plants that take raw water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for public drinking water production use conventional filtration technologies. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes including slow sand filters,  diatomaceous earth filter, and membranes will remove 99% of Cryptosporidium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/safewater/mdbp/ieswtrwhatdoesitmeantoyou.pdf |title=The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule – What Does it Mean to You? |publisher=USEPA |format=pdf |accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] Membranes and bag- and cartridge-filter products remove Cryptosporidium specifically.
Cryptosporidium is highly resistant to chlorine disinfection;Korich, D. G., J. R. Mead, et al. (1990). "Effects of ozone, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and monochloramine on Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst viability." Appl Environ Microbiol 56(5): 1423-8. but with high enough concentrations and contact time, Cryptosporidium inactivation will occur with chlorine dioxide and ozone treatment. In general, the required levels of chlorine preclude the use of chlorine disinfection as a reliable method to control Cryptosporidium in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate Cryptosporidium. Water Research Foundation-funded research originally discovered UV's efficacy in inactivating Cryptosporidium.[tpl]cite journal | title=Irreversible UV inactivation of Cryptosporidium spp. despite the presence of UV repair genes | pmid = 15537090 | journal = J Eukaryot Microbiol | date = Sep–October 2004 | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 553–62 | doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2004.tb00291.x | author=Rochelle, PAUL A. | last2=Fallar | first2=Daffodil | last3=Marshall | first3=Marilyn M. | last4=Montelone | first4=Beth A. | last5=Upton | first5=Steve J. | last6=Woods | first6=Keith [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.waterresearchfoundation.org/research/TopicsAndProjects/topicSnapshot.aspx?topic=uv |title=Ultraviolet Disinfection and Treatment |publisher=WaterResearchFoundation (formerly AwwaRF) |accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]
One of the largest challenges in identifying outbreaks is the ability to verify the results in a laboratory.  The oocytes may be seen by microscopic examination of a stool sample, but they may be confused with other objects or artifacts similar in appearance.[tpl]cite journal|last=Casemore|first=DP|coauthors=Armstrong, M; Sands, RL|title=Laboratory diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis|journal=Journal of clinical pathology|date=December 1985|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1337–41|pmid=2416782|url=http://jcp.bmj.com/content/38/12/1337.abstract|accessdate=28 July 2012|doi=10.1136/jcp.38.12.1337|pmc=499488[/tpl] Most cryptosporidia are 3-6 μm in size, although some reports have described larger cells. Real-time monitoring technology is now able to detect Cryptosporidium with online systems versus the spot testing and batch testing methods used in the past.
For the end consumer of drinking water believed to be contaminated by Cryptosporidium, the safest option is to boil all water used for drinking.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7589839.stmhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4484946.stm

==Exposure risks==

The following groups have an elevated risk of being exposed to Cryptosporidium:[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Cases of cryptosporidiosis can occur in a city with clean water; cases of cryptosporidiosis can have different origins. Like many fecal-oral pathogens, it can also be transmitted by contaminated food or poor hygiene.  Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Cryptosporidium typically does not cause serious illness in healthy people. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviours can transmit the parasite directly.
