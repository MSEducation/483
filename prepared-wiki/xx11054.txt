In Europe, Spanish is an official language of Spain, the country after which it is named and from which it originated. It is widely spoken in Gibraltar, although English is the official language.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gi.html |title=CIA World Factbook — Gibraltar |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl] It is also commonly spoken in Andorra, although Catalan is the official language.
Spanish is also spoken by small communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/spanish.shtml |title=BBC Education — Languages Across Europe — Spanish |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl] Spanish is an official language of the European Union. In  Switzerland, Spanish is the native language of 2.2% of the population.

===The Americas===

====Latin America====

Most Spanish speakers are in Latin America; of all countries with a majority of Spanish speakers, only Spain and Equatorial Guinea are outside the Americas. Nationally, Spanish is the official language—either de facto or de jure—of Argentina, Bolivia (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, and 34 other languages), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay (co-official with Guaraní), Peru (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]), Uruguay, and Venezuela.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=PY | title = Ethnologue | contribution = Paraguay | year = 2000[/tpl]. Guaraní is also the most-spoken language in Paraguay by its native speakers. Spanish is also the de facto and official language in Puerto Rico.
Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize; however, per the 2000 census, it is spoken by 43% of the population.[tpl]cite web| url= http://censos.ccp.ucr.ac.cr/ | title= Belize Population and Housing Census 2000 | publisher = UCR | location = CR | date= |accessdate=2010-04-21[/tpl]  Mainly, it is spoken by the descendants of Hispanics who have been in the region since the seventeenth century; however, English is the official language.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html | work = World Factbook | title = Belize |publisher= CIA |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl]
Due to their proximity to Spanish-speaking countries, Trinidad and Tobago and Brazil have implemented Spanish language teaching into their education systems.

===Africa===

In Africa, Spanish is official in Equatorial Guinea, as well as an official language of the African Union.  In Equatorial Guinea, Spanish is the predominant language when native and non-native speakers (around 500,000 people) are counted, while Fang is the most spoken language by number of native speakers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Equatorial+Guinea |title= Equatorial Guinea (2000) |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html |title=CIA World Factbook - Equatorial Guinea | date = 20 September 2007 | publisher =CIA |accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl]
Spanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in North Africa, which include the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, the Plazas de soberanía, and the Canary Islands, archipelago located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa
In Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, an unknown number of Sahrawis are able to read and write in Spanish.

Within Northern Morocco, a former Spanish protectorate that is also geographically close to Spain, approximately 20,000 people speak Spanish as a second language, while Arabic is the de jure official language. A small number of Moroccan Jews also speak the Sephardic Spanish dialect Haketia (related to the Ladino dialect spoken in Israel). Spanish is spoken by some communities in Angola because of the Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned in time for their country's independence.[tpl]Citation | publisher = Radio France International | language = Castilian | url = http://www.espanol.rfi.fr/africa/20110706-los-cubanos-la-elite-del-sudan-del-sur | title = Los cubanos, la élite de Sudán del Sur | accessdate = 20 December 2011 | place = FR | date = 2011-07-06[/tpl]

===Asia-Pacific===

Spanish is present on Easter Island, which was annexed as a Chilean province in 1888.
Spanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish rule in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During Spanish colonization (1565-1898), it was the language of government, trade and education, and spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos. In the mid-nineteenth century, the colonial government set up a free public education system with Spanish as the medium of instruction. This increased use of Spanish throughout the islands led to the formation of a class of Spanish-speaking intellectuals called the Ilustrados. However, Spanish was never spoken by the majority of the population.[tpl]cite web| language = Castilian | url = http://buscoenlaces.es/kaibigankastila/rivera4.html |title=Estadisticas: El idioma español en Filipinas |publisher= Busco enlaces | location = ES |date = 2000-11-15 |accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl]
Despite American administration after the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War in 1898, the usage of Spanish continued in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American rule. Gradually, however, the American government began increasingly promoting the use of English,  and it characterized Spanish as a negative influence of the past. Eventually, by the 1920s, English became the primary language of administration and education.[tpl]cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071204-104897/The_loss_of_Spanish |title=The loss of Spanish  |first=Ambeth |last=Ocampo|date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer (INQUIRER.net)|location=Makati City, Philippines |at=Opinion |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rVMuCBJ8 |archivedate=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2010[/tpl] But despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines when it became independent in 1946, alongside English and Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog.
Spanish was removed from official status in 1973 under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, but regained its status as an official language two months later under Presidential Decree No. 155, dated 15 March 1973.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno155.html |title=Presidential Decree No. 155 : PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES and CODES : CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24[/tpl] It remained an official language until 1987, with the ratification of the present constitution, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.Article XIV, Sec 7: "For purposes of communication and instruction, the official languages of the Philippines are Filipino and, until otherwise provided by law, English. The regional languages are the auxiliary official languages in the regions and shall serve as auxiliary media of instruction therein. Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis." In 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo encouraged the reintroduction of Spanish-language teaching in the Philippine education system. But by 2012, the number of secondary schools at which the language was either a compulsory subject or an elective had become very limited.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/264032/news/nation/pnoy-and-spains-queen-sofia-welcome-return-of-spanish-language-in-phl-schools |title=PNoy (President Benigno Aquino III) and Spain’s Queen Sofia welcome return of Spanish language in Philippine schools |first=Amita O. |last=Legaspi |date=July 3, 2012 |publisher=GMA News[/tpl] Today, despite government promotions of Spanish, less than 0.5% of the population report being able to speak the language proficiently.[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.census.gov.ph/data/sectordata/popproj_tab1r.html | publisher = National Statistics Office | title = Medium projection | date = Mid-2010 | place = PH[/tpl] Aside from standard Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language—Chavacano—developed in the southern Philippines.

Spanish was also used by the colonial governments and educated classes in the former Spanish East Indies, consisting of modern-day Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Micronesia, in addition to the Philippines.

===Spanish speakers by country===

The following table shows the number of Spanish speakers in some 79 countries.

==Dialectal variation==

There are important variations—phonological, grammatical, and lexical—in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.
The variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2, pp.154-155,  URLLope Blanch, Juan M. (1972) En torno a las vocales caedizas del español mexicano, pp.53 a 73, Estudios sobre el español de México, editorial Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México URL.
In Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as yeísmo and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television,[tpl]cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006  |publisher= Random House Inc. [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th  |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998  |publisher= MICRA, Inc.

[/tpl] and is the variety that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.[tpl]cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.. [/tpl]

===Phonology===

Three of the main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/θ/[/tpl] ("theta"), (2) the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ʎ/[/tpl] ("turned y"),The IPA symbol "turned y" (ʎ), with its "tail" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (λ), whose tail leans to the left. and (3) the debuccalization of syllable-final [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl].

===Grammar===

The main grammatical variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns: especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.

====Voseo====

Virtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular, and thus have two different pronouns meaning "you": usted in the formal, and either tú or vos in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of tú or vos varying from one dialect to another. The use of vos (and/or its verb forms) is called voseo. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used—usted, tú, and vos—denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Española |language= [tpl]es icon[/tpl] |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21[/tpl]
In voseo, [tpl]lang|es|vos[/tpl] is the subject form ([tpl]lang|es|vos decís[/tpl], "you say") and the form for the object of a preposition (voy con vos, "I'm going with you"), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with tú: Vos sabés que tus amigos te respetan ("You know your friends respect you"). Additional examples:  [tpl]lang|es|"Vos te acostaste con el tuerto" (Gené Ulf 1988); "Lugar que odio ... como te odio a vos" (Rossi María Rica 1985); "No cerrés tus ojos" (Flores Siguamonta 1993).[/tpl]
The verb forms of general voseo are the same as those used with tú except in the present tense (indicative and imperative) verbs. The forms for vos generally can be derived from those of vosotros (the traditional second-person familiar plural) by deleting the glide [tpl]IPA|/i̯/[/tpl], or [tpl]IPA|/d/[/tpl], where it appears in the ending: vosotros pensá'is'' > ''vos pensás''; ''vosotros volvéis'' > ''vos volvés'', ''pensad!'' (''vosotros'') > ''pensá!'' (''vos''), ''volved'! (vosotros) > volvé! (vos) .
In Chilean voseo on the other hand, almost all verb forms are distinct from their standard tú-forms.
The use of the pronoun vos with the verb forms of tú (e.g. vos piensas) is called "pronominal voseo". And conversely, the use of the verb forms of vos with the pronoun tú (e.g. tú pensás or tú pensái) is called "verbal voseo". 

In Chile, for example, verbal voseo is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun vos which is often reserved for deeply informal situations.
Although [tpl]lang|es|vos[/tpl] is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, although with wide differences in social consideration. Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of [tpl]lang|es|tuteo[/tpl] in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Peru and Venezuela, coastal Ecuador and the Caribbean coast of Colombia.
[tpl]lang|es|Tuteo[/tpl] (the use of tú) as a cultured form alternates with [tpl]lang|es|voseo[/tpl] as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers claim that voseo can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, while others assert that it is absent from the island.Katia Salamanca de Abreu, review of Humberto López Morales, Estudios sobre el español de Cuba (New York: Editorial Las Américas, 1970), in Thesaurus, 28 (1973), 138-146.
[tpl]lang|es|Tuteo[/tpl] exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar [tpl]lang|es|voseo[/tpl] in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia (Montería, Sincelejo, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Riohacha and Valledupar), in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.
Areas of generalized [tpl]lang|es|voseo[/tpl] include Argentina, Costa Rica, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia (the second largest in population), Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio, and parts of The Valle del Cauca department.

====Ustedes====

Ustedes functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Latin America, the Canary Islands, and some regions of Andalusia. In Seville, Cadiz, and other parts of western Andalusia, the familiar form is constructed as ustedes vais, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the formal/familiar distinction with ustedes and vosotros respectively.

====Usted====

Usted is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority ("you, sir"/"you, ma'am"). It is also used in a familiar context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica, and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of tú or vos. This usage is sometimes called ustedeo in Spanish.
In Central America, especially in Honduras, usted is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple.  Usted is also used in this way, as well as between parents and children, in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

====Third-person object pronouns====

Most speakers use (and the Real Academia Española prefers) the pronouns lo and la for direct objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning "him", "her", or "it"), and le for indirect objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning "to him", "to her", or "to it"). This usage is sometimes called "etymological", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.
Deviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called "leísmo", "loísmo", or "laísmo", according to which respective pronoun—le, lo, or la—has expanded beyond the etymological usage (i.e. le as a direct object, or lo or la as an indirect object).

===Vocabulary===

Some words can be different, even significantly so, in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms, even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish mantequilla, aguacate and albaricoque (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to manteca, palta, and damasco, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except manteca), Paraguay, Peru (except manteca and damasco), and Uruguay.
The everyday Spanish words coger ('to take'), pisar ('to step on') and concha ('seashell') are considered extremely rude in parts of Latin America, where the meaning of coger and pisar is also "to have sex" and concha means "vagina". The Puerto Rican word for "bobby pin" (pinche) is an obscenity in Mexico, but in Nicaragua it simply means "stingy", and in Spain refers to a chef's helper. Other examples include taco, which means "swearword" (among other meanings) in Spain, "traffic jam" in Chile and "heels" (shoe) in Argentina and Peru but is known to the rest of the world as a Mexican dish.
Pija in many countries of Latin America and Spain itself is an obscene slang word for "penis", while in Spain the word also signifies "posh girl" or "snobby". Coche, which means "car" in Spain, central Mexico and Argentina, for the vast majority of Spanish-speakers actually means "baby-stroller" or "pushchair", while carro means "car" in some Latin American countries and "cart" in others, as well as in Spain. Papaya is the slang term for "vagina" in parts of Cuba and Venezuela, where the fruit is instead called fruta bomba and lechosa, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cuban-food-usa.com/terms/fruta-bomba.html |title=3 Guys From Miami: Fruta Bomba |publisher=Cuban-food-usa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=papaya&defid=151242 |title=papaya |publisher=Urban Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21[/tpl] Also, in Argentina, one would say piña when talking about punching someone else, whereas in other countries, piña refers to a pineapple.

==Relation to other languages==

Spanish is closely related to the other Iberian Romance languages: Asturian, Aragonese, Catalan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese.
It should be noted that although Portuguese and Spanish are closely related, particularly in vocabulary (89% lexically similar according to the Ethnologue of Languages), syntax and grammar, there are also some differences. Spanish and Portuguese are widely considered to be mutually intelligible. Most Portuguese speakers can understand spoken Spanish almost perfectly, and Spanish speakers can with a little more effort understand spoken Portuguese quite easily. The written forms are considered to be equally intelligible, however.

===Vocabulary comparison===

At present, the lexical similarity with Italian is estimated at 82%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|publisher=ethnologue[/tpl] The lexical similarity with Portuguese is greater at 85%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or Romanian is lower (lexical similarity being respectively 75% and 71%): comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is low at an estimated 45%—the same as English. The common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages allow for a greater amount of interlingual reading comprehension than oral communication would.

1. Also [tpl]lang|pt|nós outros[/tpl] in early modern Portuguese (e.g. The Lusiads), and [tpl]lang|gl|nosoutros[/tpl] in Galician.

2. Alternatively [tpl]lang|fr|nous autres[/tpl] in French.

3. Also [tpl]lang|it|noialtri[/tpl] in Southern Italian dialects and languages.

4. Medieval Catalan (e.g. Llibre dels fets).

5. Depending on the written norm used (see Reintegracionism).

6. From Basque esku, "hand" + erdi, "half, incomplete". Notice that this negative meaning also applies for Latin sinistra(m) ("dark, unfortunate").

7. Note that Romanian caș (from Latin [tpl]smallcaps|cāsevs[/tpl]) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is brânză (from unknown etymology).Often considered to be a substratum word. Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin brandeum (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *brandea. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish manteca, Portuguese manteiga, probably from Latin mantica ('sack'), Italian formaggio and French fromage from formaticus.

===Judaeo-Spanish===

Judaeo-Spanish (also known as Ladino),[tpl]cite web |last=Alfassa |first=Shelomo |title=Ladinokomunita |url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/quickladino.html |date=December 1999 |publisher=Foundation for the Advancement of Sephardic Studies and Culture |accessdate=4 February 2010[/tpl] which is essentially medieval Spanish and closer to modern Spanish than any other language, is spoken by many descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century. Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers are currently almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece or the Balkans; current speakers mostly live in Israel and Turkey, and the United States, with a few pockets in Latin America. It lacks the Native American vocabulary which was influential during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.
Judaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly olim (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.
A related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.

==Writing system==

Spanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character [tpl]angle bracket|ñ[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|es|eñe[/tpl], representing the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ɲ/[/tpl], a letter distinct from [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl], although typographically composed of an [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl] with a tilde) and the digraphs [tpl]angle bracket|ch[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|es|che[/tpl], representing the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/t͡ʃ/[/tpl]) and [tpl]angle bracket|ll[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|es|elle[/tpl], representing the phoneme [tpl]IPA|/ʎ/[/tpl]). However, the digraph [tpl]angle bracket|rr[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|es|erre fuerte[/tpl], 'strong r', [tpl]lang|es|erre doble[/tpl], 'double r', or simply [tpl]lang|es|erre[/tpl]), which also represents a distinct phoneme [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl], is not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 [tpl]angle bracket|ch[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|ll[/tpl] have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remain a part of the alphabet. Words with [tpl]angle bracket|ch[/tpl] are now alphabetically sorted between those with [tpl]angle bracket|cg[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|ci[/tpl], instead of following [tpl]angle bracket|cz[/tpl] as they used to.  The situation is similar for [tpl]angle bracket|ll[/tpl].Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas, 1st ed.Real Academia Española, Explanation at Spanish Pronto [tpl]es icon[/tpl], [tpl]en icon[/tpl]
Thus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters and 2 digraphs:
The letters [tpl]angle bracket|k[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|w[/tpl] are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (kilo, folklore, whisky, William, etc.).
With the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as México (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including [tpl]angle bracket|y[/tpl]) or with a vowel followed by [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl] or an [tpl]angle bracket|s[/tpl]; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.
The acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare [tpl]lang|es|el[/tpl] ('the', masculine singular definite article) with [tpl]lang|es|él[/tpl] ('he' or 'it'), or [tpl]lang|es|te[/tpl] ('you', object pronoun) with [tpl]lang|es|té[/tpl] ('tea'), [tpl]lang|es|de[/tpl] (preposition 'of') versus [tpl]lang|es|dé[/tpl] ('give' imperative/third-person present subjunctive), and [tpl]lang|es|se[/tpl] (reflexive pronoun) versus [tpl]lang|es|sé[/tpl] ('I know' or imperative 'be').
The interrogative pronouns ([tpl]lang|es|qué[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|cuál[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|dónde[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|quién[/tpl], etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ([tpl]lang|es|ése[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|éste[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|aquél[/tpl], etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted in capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the Real Academia Española advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
When [tpl]angle bracket|u[/tpl] is written between [tpl]angle bracket|g[/tpl] and a front vowel [tpl]angle bracket|e i[/tpl], it indicates a "hard g" pronunciation. A diaeresis [tpl]angle bracket|ü[/tpl] indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., cigüeña, 'stork', is pronounced [tpl]IPA|θiˈɣweɲa[/tpl]; if it were written *cigueña, it would be pronounced *[tpl]IPA|θiˈɣeɲa[/tpl]).
Interrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks ([tpl]angle bracket|¿[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|¡[/tpl], respectively).

===Royal Spanish Academy===

The [tpl]lang|es|Real Academia Española[/tpl] (Royal Spanish Academy), founded in 1713,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl] together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.[tpl]cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tXQFT6TLHOTW2AWEjfm2Ag&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
Because of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

===Association of Spanish Language Academies===

The Association of Spanish Language Academies (Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española, or ASALE) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language. It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. It comprises the academies of 22 countries, ordered by date of Academy foundation: Spain (1713),[tpl]cite web | location = Spain | url = http://www.rae.es/rae/gestores/gespub000001.nsf/voTodosporId/CEDF300E8D943D3FC12571360037CC94?OpenDocument&i=0 |title=Real Academia Española | publisher = RAE | accessdate = 2010-11-06[/tpl] Colombia (1871),[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.asale.org/ASALE/ConAALEBD?IDDOC=30202&menu=2 | title= Academia Colombiana de la Lengua |language= Spanish | location = Colombia | accessdate= 2011-02-05[/tpl] Ecuador (1874),[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.asale.org/ASALE/ConAALEBD?IDDOC=30302&menu=2 | title= Academia Ecuatoriana de la Lengua |language= Spanish | location = Ecuador | accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl] Mexico (1875),[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.academia.org.mx/historia.php |title=Academia Mexicana de la Lengua | location = Mexico |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] El Salvador (1876),[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.asl.org.sv/Informacion%20institucional.htm |title= Academia Salvadoreña de la Lengua | location = El Salvador | accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl] Venezuela (1883),[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.asale.org/ASALE/ConAALEBD?IDDOC=30602&menu=2 |title=Academia Venezolana de la Lengua |language= Spanish | location = Venezuela |accessdate = 2011-02-05[/tpl] Chile (1885),[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.institutodechile.cl/lengua/resena.htm | title= Academia Chilena de la Lengua | location = Chile | accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl] Peru (1887),[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.academiaperuanadelalengua.org/academia/historia |title=Academia Peruana de la Lengua | location = Peru | accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl] Guatemala (1887),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/ConAALEBD?IDDOC=30902&menu=2 |title=Academia Guatemalteca de la Lengua | language= Spanish | location = Guatemala |accessdate= 2011-02-05[/tpl] Costa Rica (1923),[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.acl.ac.cr/i_q.php | title= Academia Costarricense de la Lengua | location = Costa Rica | accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] Philippines (1924),[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.asale.org/ASALE/ConAALEBD?IDDOC=31102&menu=2 |title= Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española | language = Spanish |publisher= Philippines |accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl] Panama (1926),[tpl]cite web|url = http://apalengua.apalengua.org/historia |title= Academia Panameña de la Lengua | location = Panama | accessdate= 2010-11-06[/tpl] Cuba (1926),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acul.ohc.cu/ |title=Academia Cubana de la Lengua | location = Cuba | accessdate=2010-11-06[/tpl]
