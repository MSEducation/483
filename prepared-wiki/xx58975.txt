He was raised in Alkrington as a Roman Catholic, in a working class family of Irish descent.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4709881/Steve-Coogan-in-persons.html|title=Steve Coogan in person|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|author=Allison Pearson|accessdate=23 August 2013|location=London|date=2 August 1997[/tpl] He attended Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n4754|title=Steve Coogan Archive|publisher=BBC Radio 4|author=Editorial Staff|accessdate=23 August 2013[/tpl] He has stated that he had a happy childhood, and in addition to having four brothers and two sisters, his parents fostered children on a short-term basis.
Coogan had a talent for impersonation, and wanted to go to drama school, despite being advised by a teacher that it could lead to a precarious profession.[tpl]cite episode|title=Desert Island Discs with Steve Coogan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n4754|series=Desert Island Discs|serieslink=Desert Island Discs|network=BBC|station=Radio 4|airdate=18 October 2009[/tpl] After five failed applications to various drama schools within London, he received a place at the theatre company New Music, before gaining a place at the Manchester Metropolitan School of Theatre.

==Career==

Coogan began his career as a comic and impressionist, performing regularly in Ipswich, before working as a voice artist for television advertisements and the satirical puppet show Spitting Image. In 1992, Coogan won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for his performance with long-time collaborator John Thomson, and starred alongside Caroline Aherne and John Thomson in a one-off Granada TV sketch show The Dead Good Show. His most prominent characters developed at this time were Paul Calf, a stereotypical working-class Mancunian, and his sister Pauline, played by Coogan in drag.

===Alan Partridge===

While working with Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris on the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour, Coogan conceived his most popular and developed character, a socially awkward and politically incorrect regional media personality. He appeared as a sports presenter on the television comedy The Day Today, before hosting his own chat show, Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. In 1997, Partridge returned in the sitcom I'm Alan Partridge, which was followed by a second series in 2002, and received five BAFTA nominations. Partridge featured in Coogan's 2008 stand-up tour.
He revisited the character in two one-off Sky Atlantic specials, including Alan Partridge: Welcome to the Places of My Life, which received a further two BAFTA nominations, as well as the mockumentary Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, which has been renewed for a second season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/13/alan-partridge-sky-atlantic|title=Alan Partridge to return in second Sky Atlantic series|publisher=The Guardian|author=Josh Halliday|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl] A feature-length film, Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, was released in 2013.

===TV roles===

Paul Calf first began as a character named 'Duncan Disorderly' in Coogan's early stand-up routines. Calf first came to wider public notice in 1993, with several appearances on Saturday Zoo, a late-night variety show presented by Jonathan Ross on Channel 4. Paul has appeared in two video diaries, an episode of Coogan's Run, and in various stand-up performances. He is an unemployed Mancunian wastrel with a particular hatred of students. His catchphrase is "Bag o' shite". Paul lives in a council house in the fictional town of Ottle with his mother and his sister, Pauline Calf (also played by Coogan). His father, Pete Calf (played by Coogan in Coogan's Run) died some time before the first video diary was made. For a long time he was obsessed with getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, Julie. Paul's best friend is "Fat" Bob (played by John Thomson), a car mechanic who eventually married Pauline. Paul supports Manchester City and is very partial to Wagon Wheels. He wears Burton suits, sports a bleached mullet and drives a Ford Cortina.
Other Coogan creations include Tommy Saxondale, Duncan Thicket and Portuguese Eurovision Song Contest winner Tony Ferrino. Duncan Thicket has appeared in a tour of live shows. Other TV shows he has starred in include Coogan's Run, Dr. Terrible's House of Horrible, Monkey Trousers and Saxondale. Coogan has provided voices for the animated series I Am Not an Animal and Bob and Margaret, two Christmas specials starring Robbie the Reindeer, and an episode of the BBC Radio Four spoof sci-fi series Nebulous.
He starred in BBC2's The Private Life of Samuel Pepys in 2003, and Cruise of the Gods in 2002. In 2006, he had a cameo in the Little Britain Christmas special as a pilot taking Lou and Andy to Disneyland. In 2007, Coogan played a psychiatrist on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, and in 2008, starred in the BBC1 drama Sunshine.
In 2010, he reunited with actor Rob Brydon and director Michael Winterbottom (both of whom he had worked with on the 2006 film A Cock and Bull Story (see Film Roles below)), for the partially improvised BBC2 sitcom The Trip, in which he and Brydon do a tour of northern restaurants, which he is writing up for the Observer. The Trip was nominated for a 2011 Television BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy, and Coogan won Best Male Performance in a Comedy Role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/winners-nominees-2011,1766,BA.html |title=Television Awards Nominees and Winners in 2011|publisher=Bafta.org|accessdate=2011-10-29[/tpl]

He also returned with his character Alan Partridge, in Alan Partridge – Welcome to the Places of My Life, which aired on Sky Atlantic.

===Film roles===

Notable film roles include Factory Records boss Tony Wilson in the film 24 Hour Party People, Mole in Terry Jones' The Wind in the Willows, Phileas Fogg in a comical version of Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days from Disney, with Jackie Chan, Ambassador Mercy in Marie Antoinette, Bruce Tick in Sweet Revenge, and Octavius in Night at the Museum (a role he reprised in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian). He has also played himself three times on screen. First, in one of the vignettes of Jim Jarmusch's 2003 film Coffee and Cigarettes, alongside Alfred Molina. Second, in 2006 Coogan starred with Rob Brydon in Michael Winterbottom's A Cock and Bull Story, a self-referential film of the "unfilmable" self-referential novel Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne. In the film, Coogan plays a fictional, womanising version of himself. Thirdly he played himself in the 2010 film The Trip. He worked again with director Winterbottom in The Look Of Love, about '50s porn-king Paul Raymond.
The first film which he co-wrote with Henry Normal was The Parole Officer, in which he also acted alongside Ben Miller and Lena Headey. Coogan has an uncredited cameo in Hot Fuzz, scripted by Shaun of the Dead writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.
Coogan's most acclaimed work to date is the drama-comedy Philomena, which he co-wrote, produced, and starred in with Judi Dench[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/09/philomena-trailer_n_3731192.html|title=Philomena Trailer: Judi Dench's Next Oscar Nomination Might Be Right Here|work=The Huffington Post|author=Editorial Staff|accessdate=23 August 2013|date=9 August 2013[/tpl] This performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination, among many other nominations (and some wins). Philomena was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (and Dench for Best Actress).

===Achievements===

Coogan's show Steve Coogan in character with John Thomson was winner of the Perrier Award for best show at the 1992 Edinburgh Fringe. He has won numerous awards for his work in TV including British Comedy Awards, BAFTAs and The South Bank Show award for comedy. In 2003, he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2005, a poll to find the Comedians' Comedian saw him being voted amongst the top 20 greatest comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[tpl]cite news|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews|accessdate=22 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 January 2005|location=London[/tpl]

===Stand-up comedy comeback tour===

In March 2008, it was confirmed that Coogan would return to doing stand-up comedy as part of his first stand-up tour in ten years. The tour, named "Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other less successful characters", saw the return of some of his old characters including Paul Calf and Alan Partridge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coogans-run.co.uk/h/steve-coogan-newsitem.php?id=703|title=First live dates in a decade|publisher=Coogans-run.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl] Reviews of the opening night were mixed,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Steve-Coogan-fails-sparkle/article-370087-detail/article.html|title=Steve Coogan fails to sparkle|publisher=Thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl] and such reviews continued as the tour progressed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/10/16/nothing-to-laugh-at-for-steve-coogan-s-angry-fans-64375-22045908/|title=Nothing to laugh at for Steve Coogan's angry fans|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/alan-partridges-less-successful-show-964292.html|title=Alan Partridge's less successful show|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2 November 2008|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Brown|date=17 October 2008[/tpl] Much of the criticism focused on the apparent unrehearsed quality of some of the performances and nervous stage presence of Coogan's. Chortle comedy guide wrote "Steve Coogan’s stage comeback after ten years is most definitely a show of two halves: the superlative Alan Partridge plus a collection of characters that are not only less successful, but woefully less funny."[tpl]cite web|last=Bennett|first=Steve|title=Steve Coogan As Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/tour/s/15969/steve_coogan_as_alan_partridge_and_other_less_successful_characters/review?id_review=15969|work=Chortle comedy review October 2008|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=25 November 2011[/tpl]

===Production work===

Coogan, along with his writing partner Henry Normal, founded Baby Cow Productions in 1999. Together, they have served as executive producers for shows such as The Mighty Boosh, Nighty Night, Marion and Geoff, Gavin and Stacey, Human Remains and Moone Boy, as well as the Alan Partridge feature film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. They have also produced Where Are the Joneses, an online sitcom which uses wiki technology to allow the audience to upload scripts and storyline ideas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wherearethejoneses.com |title=Where are the Joneses? |publisher=Wherearethejoneses.com|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl]

==In the media==

Coogan said he "liked to keep himself private", adding; "I have never wanted to be famous, as such – fame is a by-product".[tpl]cite news|title=Steve Coogan tells press standards inquiry he 'never signed away privacy'|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1465855_steve-coogan-tells-press-standards-inquiry-he-never-signed-away-privacy|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Manchester Evening News|date=22 November 2011[/tpl]
He has been a popular target of the British tabloid press since 1996, who he stated have subjected him to entrapment and blackmail, printed obvious falsehoods about him,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4172666.stm|title=Love and Coogan deny baby claim|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 November 2008| date=22 August 2005[/tpl] also targeting his family and friends in attempts to extract stories from them.[tpl]cite news|title=Steve Coogan's witness statement to the Leveson inquiry – full text|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/interactive/2011/nov/23/steve-coogan-witness-statement-leveson-inquiry|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 November 2011|location=London[/tpl]
Coogan in some cases gave a strong denial to allegations, but in others did not contest them because he wanted to shield vulnerable friends from adverse publicity.[tpl]cite web|title=Steve Coogan – Steve Coogan Tried To Protect 'Vulnerable' Owen Wilson|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/steve-coogan-tried-to-protect-vulnerable-owen-wilson_1264687|work=Contact music, 22 November 2011|publisher=Contactmusic.com Ltd|accessdate=24 November 2011[/tpl]
The tabloids also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of the broadsheet press, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005 he said "The Guardian tends to have its cake and eat it. It waits for the tabloids to dish the dirt and then it talks about the tabloids dishing the dirt while enjoying it themselves."[tpl]cite news|last=Woolaston|first=Sam|title=The Life and Opinions of Steve Coogan|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/oct/21/londonfilmfestival2005.londonfilmfestival|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 October 2005|location=London[/tpl]
However, Coogan later gave credit to the same newspaper for its investigation of the phone hacking scandal.[tpl]cite web|title=Steve Coogan rips into The News of the World|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkeSJLgzG8k|work=Youtube, 8 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 November 2011[/tpl]
Coogan said that because of the persistent intrusion into his private life, the press had effectively made him "immune" to further attack, as his "closet is empty of skeletons".[tpl]cite web|title=Steve Coogan gives evidence to Leveson Inquiry into media ethics|url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/pg/news/suchsmallportions/read/38613/steve-coogan-gives-evidence-to-levenson-inquiry-into-media-ethics|work=Such small portions the comedy digest|publisher=such.small.portions 2011|accessdate=24 November 2011[/tpl]

===Phone hacking===

Coogan became a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal as one of the celebrities who took action against the British tabloids in light of these events. He was made aware by his phone service provider of "possible anomalies" on his phone in 2005 and 2006.[tpl]cite news|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|title=Phone hackers targeted treasure trove of information, says Coogan|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/phone-hackers-targeted-treasure-trove-of-information-says-coogan-2215050.html|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 February 2011|location=London[/tpl] In 2010, Coogan's legal firm obtained a partially redacted version of Glenn Mulcaire's hacking notebook by a court order which showed Coogan had been targeted and his personal information was in the possession of Mulcaire.
Mulcaire was forced by the High Court of Justice to disclose to Coogan's legal team who amongst the staff at the News of the World ordered him to hack phones. This information was obtained by Coogan's lawyers on 26 August 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Chandrasekhar|first=Indu|title=Phone hacking: timeline of the scandal|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634176/Phone-hacking-timeline-of-a-scandal.html#2011|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=10 November 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London[/tpl]
Interviewed on Newsnight on 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was "delighted" by the closure of the News of the World and said it was a "fantastic day for journalism". He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a "smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle" and said the argument against press regulation was "morally bankrupt"
Coogan provided an 8-page witness statement to the Leveson Inquiry and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence. He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.[tpl]cite news|title='This is not the Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant show'|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/leveson-inquiry/42898/not-steve-coogan-and-hugh-grant-show|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Week|date=22 November 2011[/tpl]
