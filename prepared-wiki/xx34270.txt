CATEGORIES: Forms of Vishnu, Dwarves (mythology)

Vamana (Devanagari: वामन, IAST: Vāmana) is described in the Puranas as the fifth avatar of Vishnu, and the first incarnation of the Second Age or Treta yuga.[tpl]cite web|title=Vamana Avatar: Vishnu’s Fifth Incarnation|url=http://www.hinduexpressions.com/2008/11/vamana-avatar-vishnus-fifth-incarnation.html|accessdate=6 November 2008[/tpl]  He is the first avatar to appear without anthropomorphic features, although he does appear as a dwarf Namboothiri Brahmin. He is also known as Upendra, and Trivikrama.

==Origin==

Vamana was born to Aditi and Kashyapa.Account of the several Manus and Manwantaras Vishnu Purana, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, 1840, Book III: Chapter I. 265:22, at the request of the deities Vishńu was born as a midget, Vámana, the son of Adití by Kaśyapa. By applying to Mahabali for alms Kaśyapa was promised by the prince whatever he might demand, notwithstanding Śukra (the preceptor of the Daityas). The dwarf demanded as much space as he could step over at three steps and upon the assent of Mahabali he enlarged himself to such dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. Being worshipped however by Mahabali and his ancestor Prahláda, he conceded to them the sovereignty of Pátála. He is the twelfth of the Adityas. Vamana is also the younger brother of Indra.

===Hinduism===

thumb|Vamana as Trivikrama, depicted having three legs, one on the earth, a second raised in the heavens and a third on Bali's head. The Bhagavata Purana describes that Vishnu descended as the Vamana avatar to restore the authority of Indra over the heavens, as it had been taken by Mahabali, a benevolent Asura King. Bali was the grandson of Hiranyakshipu, the son of Prahlada. 
King Mahabali was a generous man who engaged in severe austerities and penance and won the praise of the world. This praise, from his courtiers and others, led him to think of himself as the greatest person in the world. He believed he can help any one any donate what ever they asked, even though benevolent he became pompous of his activities and forgot that the almighty is above him. The dharma says one has to do his duty and helping others is in fact his duty as a king. The king was a devoted worshiper of the Lord. The story is an ample example for this, the almighty, the Parabharma is neutral and unbiased he only tries to balance the nature. He showers his divine light to all irrespective of what they do.  
Vamana, in the guise of a short Brahmin carrying a wooden umbrella, went to the king to request three paces of land. Mahabali consented, against the warning of his guru, Sukracharya. Vamana then revealed his identity and enlarged to gigantic proportions to stride over the three worlds. He stepped from heaven to earth with the first step, from earth to the netherworld with the second. King Mahabali, unable to fulfill his promise, offered his head for the third. Vamana then placed his foot and gave the king immortality for his humility. 
In worshiping Mahabali and his ancestor Prahláda, he conceded sovereignty of Pátála, the netherworld. Some texts also report that Vamana did not step into the netherworld, and instead gave its rule to Bali. In giant form, Vamana is known as Trivikrama.[tpl]cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  [/tpl] 
Just before King Mahabali was pushed out of this earth, he was given permission by Vamana to visit his people once a year. The Onam festival is a celebration of welcoming Mahabali home to his lost kingdom. During this festival, beautiful floral decorations are made in every house and boat races are held throughout Kerala. A twenty-one-course feast is the most important part of the Onam festival.
Mahabali symbolizes ahankar, the three feet symbolizes the three planes of existence (Jagrat, Swapna and Sushupthi) and final step is on his head which elevates from all three states and he attains moksha. This is the moral of the story.

===Jainism===

Jainism also describes Vamana.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] In its scripture, an ill natured man has contention with Jain Munis, which results in the king banishing him from the kingdom. He traveled to a rival kingdom and managed to gain the favor and trust of its king, and is granted a wish. He asked to be made King for 4 months during Chaturmas, a holy time for the Jains. The evil man orders that he must be allowed a bite of every meal in Jain Muni, thus not allowing them not eat for the rest of the day as the food would be considered contaminated. The Jain Shravaks and Shravikas, recognizing his intent, consulted Vamana, the dwarf and avatar who had the capability to change his size.
Dressed up as a tiny Brahman, he went to the house of the evil Raja while he performed a pooja. Near its end, the practitioner must give something to those present. He asked the dwarf what he wished, and Vamana replied that he wanted three feet of land. The King consented. Vamana then grew so large that one foot covered the planet, another the heavens, and so there was no where to place the third. The evil king then realized his mistake, and in shame bowed his head down for the third footstep of Vamana.

==Symbolism==

Vamana taught King Mahabali that pride should be abandoned for advancement in life, and that wealth should be appreciated as it can easily disappear. Vamana then took the form of Mahavishnu and was pleased by King Mahabali's determination to keep his promise, despite the curse of his spiritual master and losing his wealth. Vishnu named the King Mahabali since he was a Mahatma (great soul). He allowed Mahabali to return to the spiritual sky to join Prahlada, the demoniac Hiranyakashipu's pious son, and other divine beings. Mahavishnu also declared that Mahabali would be able to rule the universe in the following yuga. Mahabali was the grandson of Prahlada, with his father being Virochana, who was killed in a battle with the Devas.
Mahabali is supposed to return every year to the land of his people, to ensure that they are prosperous.
