Kentucky [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Kentucky.ogg|k|ɪ|n|ˈ|t|ʌ|k|i[/tpl], officiaIIy the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.
Kentucky is known as the "Bluegrass State", a nickname based on the bluegrass found in many of its pastures because of the fertile soil. One of the major regions in Kentucky is the Bluegrass Region in central Kentucky which houses two of its major cities, Louisville and Lexington. It is a land with diverse environments and abundant resources, including the world's longest cave system, Mammoth Cave National Park, the greatest length of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous United States, and the two largest man-made lakes east of the Mississippi River.
Kentucky is also home to the highest per capita number of deer and turkey in the United States, the largest free-ranging elk herd east of the Mississippi River, and the nation's most productive coalfield. Kentucky is also known for horse racing, bourbon distilleries, automobile manufacturing, tobacco, bluegrass music, college basketball, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.

==Etymology==

The origin of Kentucky's name (variously spelled Cane-tuck-ee, Cantucky, Kain-tuck-ee, and Kentuckee before its modern spelling was accepted) has never been definitively identified, though some theories have been debunked. For example, Kentucky's name does not come from the combination of "cane" and "turkey", nor does it mean "dark and bloody ground" in any known Indian language. The most likely etymology is that it comes from an Iroquoian word for "meadow" or "prairie" c.f. Mohawk kenhta:ke, Seneca kehta'keh). Other possibilities also exist: The name Kentucky is of native American origin and has been attributed to several different Indian languages, with several different possible meanings including the Iroquois word "Ken-tah-ten," which means land of tomorrow.http://statesymbolsusa.org/Kentucky/KentuckyNameOrigin.html The suggestion of early Kentucky pioneer George Rogers Clark that the name means "the river of blood", a Wyandot name meaning "land of tomorrow", a Shawnee term possibly referring to the head of a river, or an Algonquian word for a river bottom."Kentucky Tourism Center "Kentucky", kentuckytourismcenter.com. Retrieved Sep 2013 Dragging Canoe, a young Cherokee chief opposed to selling ancestral hunting grounds, did warn the whites that they were purchasing a "dark and bloody ground."

==Geography==

Kentucky is situated in the Upland South.[tpl]cite book |title= Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher= Merriam–Webster |year= 2003 |edition= 11th |isbn= 978-0-87779-809-5 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=O78rzaI2XmUC&pg=RA1-PA1562 |page= 1562 |author= ed. in chief Frederick C. Mish |accessdate= January 17, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The North American Midwest: A Regional Geography|publisher=Wiley Publishers |location=New York, New York |year=1955[/tpl] A significant portion of eastern Kentucky is part of Appalachia.
Kentucky borders seven states, from the Midwest and the Southeast. West Virginia lies to the east, Virginia to the southeast, Tennessee to the south, Missouri to the west, Illinois and Indiana to the northwest, and Ohio to the north and northeast. Only Missouri and Tennessee, both of which border eight states, touch more states.
Kentucky's northern border is formed by the Ohio River and its western border by the Mississippi River.  The official state borders are based on the courses of the rivers as they existed when Kentucky became a state in 1792. In several places, the rivers have changed courses away from the original borders. For instance, northbound travelers on US 41 from Henderson, after crossing the Ohio River, will be in Kentucky for about two miles. Ellis Park, a thoroughbred racetrack, is located in this small piece of Kentucky. Waterworks Road is part of the only land border between Indiana and Kentucky.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=%5B1300-1699%5D+Waterworks+Rd&city=Evansville&state=IN&zipcode=47713 |title=Map of 1494–1557 Waterworks Rd Evansville, IN |accessdate=January 1, 2009[/tpl]
Kentucky is the only U.S. state to have a non-contiguous part existing as an exclave surrounded by other states. Fulton County, in the far west corner of the state, includes Kentucky Bend. This small part of Kentucky on the Mississippi River is only accessible by road via Tennessee.  The epicenter of the powerful 1811-1812 New Madrid Earthquakes was near here, even causing the river to flow backwards in some areas.  Though the series of quakes did change the area geologically and affect the (small number of) inhabitants of the area at the time, the Kentucky Bend was formed because of a surveying error, not the New Madrid Earthquake.[tpl]cite web | title=Life on the Mississippi | publisher=Kentucky Educational Television| date=January 28, 2002 | url=http://www.ket.org/kentuckylife/800s/kylife804.html | accessdate=November 29, 2006 [/tpl]

===Regions===

Kentucky can be divided into five primary regions: the Cumberland Plateau in the east, the north-central Bluegrass region, the south-central and western Pennyroyal Plateau, the Western Coal Fields and the far-west Jackson Purchase.
The Bluegrass region is commonly divided into two regions, the Inner Bluegrass—the encircling 90 miles (145 km) around Lexington—and the Outer Bluegrass—the region that contains most of the northern portion of the state, above the Knobs. Much of the outer Bluegrass is in the Eden Shale Hills area, made up of short, steep, and very narrow hills.

===Lakes and rivers===

Kentucky's [tpl]convert|90000|mi|km|-4[/tpl] of streams provides one of the most expansive and complex stream systems in the nation.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Ia7Rga26OkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=You Live Where?: Interesting and Unusual Facts about where We Live | publisher=iUniverse | author=Thompson, George E. | year=2009 | pages=39[/tpl] Kentucky has both the largest artificial lake east of the Mississippi in water volume (Lake Cumberland) and surface area (Kentucky Lake).
