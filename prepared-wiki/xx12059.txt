[[Wheel]]

CATEGORIES: Wheels

A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axial bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel.
Common examples are found in transport applications. A wheel greatly reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles. In order for wheels to rotate, a moment needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity, or by the application of another external force or torque.

==Etymology==

The English word wheel comes from the Old English word hweol, hweogol, from Proto-Germanic [tpl]lang|gem| *hwehwlan, *hwegwlan[/tpl], from Proto-Indo-European [tpl]lang|ine|*kwekwlo-[/tpl],[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=wheel|encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wheel[/tpl] an extended form of the root [tpl]lang|ine|*kwel-[/tpl] "to revolve, move around".
Cognates within Indo-European include Icelandic hjól "wheel, tyre", Greek [tpl]lang|grc|κύκλος[/tpl] kúklos, and Sanskrit [tpl]lang|sa|chakra[/tpl], the latter both meaning "circle" or "wheel".The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000

==History==

Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the second half of the 4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia (Sumerian civilization), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe, so that the question of which culture originally invented the wheeled vehicle remains unresolved and under debate.
The oldest securely dated wheel-axle combination, that from Stare Gmajne near Ljubljana in Slovenia (Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel) is now dated in 2σ-limits to 3340-3030 cal BC, the axle to 3360-3045 cal BC  A.

The earliest well-dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle (here a wagon—four wheels, two axles) is on the Bronocice pot, a c. 3500 – 3350 BC clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern Poland.[tpl]cite book |author=Anthony, David A. |title=The horse, the wheel, and language: how Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2007 |page=67 |isbn=0-691-05887-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
The wheeled vehicle spread from the area of its first occurrence (Mesopotamia, Caucasus, Balkans, Central Europe) across Eurasia, reaching the Indus Valley by the 3rd millennium BC. During the 2nd millennium BC, the spoke-wheeled chariot spread at an increased pace, reaching both China and Scandinavia by 1200 BC.
In China, the wheel was certainly present with the adoption of the chariot in c. 1200 BC,Dyer, Gwynne, War: the new edition, p. 159: Vintage Canada Edition, Randomhouse of Canada, Toronto, ON  although Barbieri-LowBarbieri-Low, Anthony, "Wheeled Vehicles in the Chinese Bronze Age (c. 2000-741 B.C.)", Sino-Platonic Papers, February 2000 argues for earlier Chinese wheeled vehicles, c. 2000 BC.
Although they did not develop the wheel proper, the Olmec and certain other western hemisphere cultures seem to have approached it, as wheel-like worked stones have been found on objects identified as children's toys dating to about 1500 BC. It is thought that the primary obstacle to large-scale development of the wheel in the Western hemisphere was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages. The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times, the American Bison, is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago, but ultimately went extinct.[ref]
