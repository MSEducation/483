The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is a metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York.OECD "OECD Territorial Reviews OECD Territorial Reviews: Toronto, Canada 2009" OECD Publishing, ISBN 92-64-07940-8 p37
As of early 21st century, the regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes extended to include the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, an urban area that has a total population ranked near the top 50 in the world.

==Etymology==

The term Greater Toronto has been used in writing as early as the 1900s, although at the time, the term only referred to the former City of Toronto and its immediate townships and villages, which became Metropolitan Toronto in 1954 and became the current city of Toronto in 1998.Solomon, Lawrence "Toronto sprawls: a history." University of Toronto Press; 1 edition, ISBN 0-7727-8618-6 p3 The usage of the term involving the four regional municipalities came into formal use in the mid-1980s, after it was used in a widely discussed report on municipal governance restructuring in the region and was later made official as a provincial planning area. However, it did not come into everyday usage until the mid- to late 1990s. In 2006, the term began to be supplanted in the field of spatial planning as provincial policy increasingly began to refer to either the "Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area" (GTHA) or the still-broader "Greater Golden Horseshoe".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/pdf/infrastructure/GrowthPlan_Brochure.pdf|title = Planning for Growth|work=Understanding the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe|publisher=Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal[/tpl] The latter includes communities like Barrie, Guelph and the Niagara Region. The GTA continues, however, to be in official use elsewhere in the Government of Ontario, such as the Ministry of Finance.

===Census metropolitan area===

Some municipalities that are considered part of the GTA are not within Toronto's Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) whose land area (5,904 km² in 2006)[tpl]cite web| url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=201&S=3&O=D&RPP=150| title=Population and dwelling counts, for census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2006 and 2001 censuses – 100% data| date=March 13, 2007| work=Statistics Canada, 2006 Census of Population| accessdate=March 13, 2007[/tpl] and population (5,583,064 as of the 2011 census) is thus smaller than the land area and population of the GTA planning area. For example, Oshawa, which is the centre of its own CMA, or Burlington, which is included in the Hamilton CMA are both deemed part of the Greater Toronto Area.[tpl]cite web|title=What's the difference between the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and CMA Toronto (census metropolitan area)?|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/datalib/caq/g1.htm|publisher=Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences University of Toronto|accessdate=March 2, 2010[/tpl] Other municipalities, such as New Tecumseth in southern Simcoe County and Mono Township in Dufferin County are included in the Toronto CMA but not in the GTA. These different border configurations result in the GTA's population being higher than the Toronto CMA by nearly one-half million people, often leading to confusion amongst people when trying to sort out the urban population of Toronto.
Other nearby urban areas, such as Hamilton, Barrie or St. Catharines-Niagara and Kitchener-Waterloo, are not part of the GTA or the Toronto CMA, but form their own CMAs that are in fairly close proximity to the GTA.[tpl]cite web|title=Population of census metropolitan areas (2006 Census boundaries)|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=March 2, 2010[/tpl] Ultimately, all the aforementioned places are part of the Golden Horseshoe metropolitan region, an urban agglomeration,[tpl]cite web|title=2006 Census: Portrait of the Canadian Population in 2006: Subprovincial population dynamics|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/p14-eng.cfm|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=March 2, 2010[/tpl] which is the fifth most populous in North America. When the Hamilton, Oshawa and Toronto CMAs are agglomerated with Brock and Scugog, they have a population of 6,170,072.[ref]
 The constituent CMAs are Toronto (5,113,149), Hamilton (692,911), Oshawa (330,594), Brock(11,979) and Scugog(21,439) for a total agglomerated population of 6,170,072.[/ref] It is part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, containing an estimated 54 million people.

===Extended area===

The term "Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area" (GTHA) refers to the usual GTA plus the former Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth, which was amalgamated to become the City of Hamilton in 2001.

==History==

===Before 1900===

The Greater Toronto Area was home to a number of First Nations groups who lived on the shore of Lake Ontario long before the first Europeans arrived in the region. At various times the Neutral,[tpl]cite book |title=The Archaeology Of Southern Ontario To A.D. 1650 |editors= Chris J.

The area would later become very crucial for its series of trails and water routes that led from northern and western Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Known as the "Toronto Passage", it followed the Humber River, as an important overland shortcut between Lake Ontario, Lake Simcoe and the upper Great Lakes.[tpl]cite web|title=The Toronto Carrying-place|url=http://www.natureconservancy.ca/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5666&news_iv_ctrl=0&abbr=on_ncc_|publisher=Nature Conservancy of Canada|accessdate=February 28, 2010[/tpl] For this reason area became a hot spot for French fur traders. The French would later establish two trading forts, Magasin Royale in the 1720s, although abandoned within the decade and Fort Rouillé in the 1750s, which would later be burnt down and abandoned in 1759 by the French garrison, who were retreating from invading British forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/toronto_e.php|title=The real story of how Toronto got its name|work=Mapping Services|author=Rayburn, Alan|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|date=September 18, 2007[/tpl]
The first large influx of European settlers to settle the region were the United Empire Loyalists arriving after the American Revolution, when various individuals petitioned the Crown for land in and around the Toronto area. In 1787, the British negotiated the purchase of more than a quarter million acres (1,000 km²) of land in the area of Toronto with the Mississaugas of New Credit.Missisaugas of the New Credit CURRENT LAND CLAIMS York County, would later be created by Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1792, which would at its largest size, comprise all of what is now Halton Region, Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and parts of the current Durham Regional Municipality.Ontario's Districts – 1798, Queen's Printer for Ontario.

===Since 1900===

The idea towards a streamlined local government to control local infrastructure was made as early as 1907 by member of federal Parliament, and founder of the Toronto Globe, William Findlay Maclean, who called for the expansion of the government of the former City of Toronto in order to create a Greater Toronto. The idea for a single government municipality would not be seriously explored until the late 1940s when planners decided that the city needed to incorporate its immediate suburbs. However, due to strong opposition from suburban politicians, a compromise was struck which resulted in the creation of Metropolitan Toronto.Solomon, Lawrence "Toronto sprawls: a history." University of Toronto Press; 1 edition, ISBN 0-7727-8618-6 p3-8 In 1953, the portion of York County south of Steeles Avenue, a concession road and township boundary, was severed from the county and incorporated as the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, Queen's Printer for Ontario. Retrieved on 2010-02-06. With the concession of Metro Toronto, the offices of York County were moved from Toronto to Newmarket.
Originally, the membership in Metropolitan Toronto included the former City of Toronto and five townships: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough and York; as well as seven villages and towns, which became amalgamated into their surrounding townships in 1967. The early Metro Toronto government debated over the annexation of surrounding townships of Markham, Pickering and Vaughan. The first Metro Toronto Chairman, Frederick Goldwin Gardiner, planned on the conversion of these townships into boroughs of the Metro Toronto government.Rose, Albert "Governing metropolitan Toronto: a social and political analysis, 1953–1971" Institute of Governmental Studies; University of California Press; 1st edition, ISBN 0-520-02041-3 p.107, 166 In 1971, the remaining areas of York County was replaced by the Ontario government with the Regional Municipality of York.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/counties/rm-york.aspx|title=Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and the Regional Municipality of York|author=Archives of Ontario|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|date=February 28, 2010[/tpl] In 1980, North York would be incorporated into a city, with York following suit in 1983 and Etobicoke and Scarborough in 1984, although still part of the Metropolitan Toronto municipal government.
In 1992, the Ontario government passed legislation requiring Metropolitan Toronto to include the rest of the Greater Toronto Area into its planning.Fletcher, Thomas Hobbs "From Love Canal to environmental justice: the politics of hazardous waste on the Canada-U.S. border" University of Toronto Press, ISBN 1-55111-434-8 p28 Despite this however, there was fear that different parts of the municipal system were working against one another and because of this, Bob Rae, then the Premier of Ontario, appointed Anne Golden to head a GTA task force to govern the region's quality of life, competitiveness and governance.Sanction, Andrew "Merger mania: the assault on local government" McGill-Queen's Press, ISBN 0-7735-2163-1 p.114 During this time, the Metro Toronto government advocated to the task force the creation of a new GTA authority, which would be made up of 21 of the 30 existing municipalities in the GTA at the time. The proposal from Metro Toronto would have resulted in 15 new municipalities. The City of Mississauga argued that consolidation should only take place in such a way that the new municipalities would have a population between 400,000 to 800,000.Sanction, Andrew "Merger mania: the assault on local government" McGill-Queen's Press, ISBN 0-7735-2163-1 p.115 The Town of Markham had similarly advocated municipal consolidation in York Region, although it was opposed to complete consolidation into a single municipality. Municipal consolidation faced stiff opposition however from smaller communities such as Ajax, Milton, and the borough of East York.Sanction, Andrew "Merger mania: the assault on local government" McGill-Queen's Press, ISBN 0-7735-2163-1 p.116 The incoming government of Mike Harris would later act on the recommendation of the task force with the elimination of Metro Toronto, consolidating the remaining municipalities into the new City of Toronto.City of Toronto Act, 1997, Queen's Printer for Ontario. Retrieved on 2010-02-06. The task force's recommendations towards a GTA-tier municipality however were not acted upon by the Harris government, as it similarly resembled the former Metro Toronto government.Sanction, Andrew "Merger mania: the assault on local government" McGill-Queen's Press, ISBN 0-7735-2163-1 p.121

==Geography==

The Greater Toronto Area covers a total area of [tpl]convert|7125|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].Population and land area figures for Toronto and the regional municipalities come from the 2006 Canadian census: http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=702&PR=35&SR=1&S=3&O=D. The region itself is bordered by Lake Ontario to the south, Kawartha lakes to the east, the Niagara Escarpment to the west, and Lake Simcoe to the north. The region creates a natural ecosystem known as the Greater Toronto Bioregion.
Vast parts of the region remain farmland and forests, making it one of the distinctive features of the geography of the GTA. Most of the urban areas in the GTA holds large urban forest. For the most part designated as parkland, the ravines are largely undeveloped. Rouge Park is also one of the largest nature parks within the core of a metropolitan area.About Us, Rouge Park. Retrieved on 2010-02-07. Much of these areas also constitute the Toronto ravine system, and a number of conservation areas in the region which are managed by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.Jurisdiction and Participating Municipalities, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. Retrieved on 2010-02-07.
In 2005, the Government of Ontario also passed legislation to prevent urban development and sprawl on environmentally sensitive land in the Greater Toronto Area, known as the Greenbelt, many of these areas including protected sections of the Oak Ridges Moraine, Rouge Park and the Niagara Escarpment.“Greenbelt Plan Area,” Greenbelt Protection. (Retrieved 2010-02-07.) Nevertheless, low-density suburban developments continue to be built, some on or near ecologically sensitive and protected areas. The provincial government has recently attempted to address this issue through the "Places to Grow" legislation passed in 2005, which emphasizes higher-density growth in existing urban centres over the next 25 years.“4 Million More People, But Without the Sprawl,” Toronto Star. (Retrieved 2010-02-07.)

===Climate===

The Greater Toronto Area is classified as a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa/Dfb/Cfa/Cfb), according to the Köppen climate classification. In winter, which begins in December and ends in March, typical high temperatures will range from [tpl]convert|-5|to|2|C|F[/tpl] and low temperatures from [tpl]convert|-11|to|-6|C|F[/tpl]. Occasional cold spells hold daytime highs below [tpl]convert|-10|C|F[/tpl] for several days, while low temperatures sometimes drop below [tpl]convert|-18|C|F[/tpl]. Mild spells are also a feature of Toronto's winter, with temperatures occasionally surpassing [tpl]convert|5|C|F[/tpl] for several days. Spring is short and often mild, although snow sometimes falls as late as April. Summer is warm, sometimes hot and humid and begins in June and ends in late-September. High temperatures typically range from [tpl]convert|24|C|F[/tpl] to 31C/88F while low temperatures hover around 15C/59F in the suburbs and 18-20C/64-68F downtown and near the lake. Although fairly sunny, summers do feature occasional heavy, thundery showers. Heat wave conditions featuring temperatures between 32C/90F and 35C/95F are not uncommon. Temperatures are lower near the lake and higher inland. Although rare, the mercury sometimes rises above 38C/100F. Autumn alternates between wet and dry periods. Temperatures fall sharply in November and by December, cold and snowy weather is not uncommon.

===Agriculture===

While it was once the most dominant industry for residents in the Greater Toronto Area, agriculture now occupies a small percentage of the population, but still a large part of land in the surrounding four regional municipalities. Census data from 2006 has shown that there are 3,707 census farms in the GTA, down 4.2% from 2001 and covering [tpl]convert|274,363|ha|acre|abbr=off[/tpl].GTA Agricultural Profile, Greater Toronto Area Agricultural Action Committee. Retrieved on 2010-02-12. Almost every community in the GTA is currently experiencing a decrease in the acreage of farmland, with Mississauga seeing the most significant. The only communities in the GTA which are experiencing a growth in the acreage of farmland are Aurora, Georgina, Newmarket, Oshawa, Richmond Hill and Scugog, with Markham experiencing neither any growth nor decline.“GREATER TORONTO AREA AGRICULTURAL PROFILE UPDATE,” Greater Toronto Area Agricultural Action Committee. (Retrieved 2010-02-12.) Most of the farmland in the GTA is located in Durham Region, with 55% of their total land area being farmland. This is followed by York Region with 41% of their lands being farm land, Peel Region with 34%, and Halton Region with 41%. Toronto's farmland is completely within Rouge Park. The average size of the farm in the GTA ([tpl]convert|183|acre|km2[/tpl]) is much lower than the farms in the rest of Ontario (averaging [tpl]convert|233|acre|km2[/tpl]). This has been attributed to the shift of farm types in the GTA, shifting from the traditional livestock and cash crop farms (requiring an extensive land base), towards more intensive enterprises including greenhouse, floriculture, nursery, vegetable, fruit, sheep and goats.
The most numerous farms types however in the GTA is miscellaneous specialty farms (including horse and pony, sheep and lamb, and other livestock specialty), followed by cattle, grain and oilseed, dairy and field crop farms. Although the output of dairy production has dropped with farms from within the GTA, dairy has remained the most productive sector in the agricultural industry by annual gross farm receipts. Despite the decreased amount of farmland around the region, farm capital value increased from $5.2 billion in 1996 to $6.1 billion in 2001, making the average farm capital value in the GTA continued to be the highest in the province.

===Communication===

The Greater Toronto Area is served by seven distinct telephone area codes. Before 1993, the GTA used the 416 area code. In a 1993 zone split, Metropolitan Toronto retained the 416 code, while the other municipalities of the Greater Toronto Area were assigned the new area code 905.[tpl]cite web|title=Area Why are some 905 numbers long distance while others aren’t?

Ten-digit telephone dialling, including the area code for local calls, is required throughout the GTA. In March 2013, two additional area codes would be introduced to the GTA: area code 437 in Toronto and area code 365 in the area currently served by 905 and 289.Telecommunications Alliance | New area codes for the Greater Toronto Area.

==Government==

The Greater Toronto Area is currently represented by 47 Members of Parliament in the Canadian House of Commons. Forty six Members of Provincial Parliament also represent the GTA in the Ontario Legislature. Five Senators from Ontario have also designated themselves as representatives of certain areas in the GTA in the Canadian Senate.[tpl]cite web|title=Senators in Alphabetical Order|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/senmemb/senate/isenator.asp|publisher=Senate of Canada|accessdate=February 26, 2010[/tpl]

===Federal politics===

Federally, the Conservatives, Liberals, and the New Democrats all hold several electoral districts in the GTA. The City of Toronto has often been supportive of the Liberal Party. Traditionally, Liberal support is strongest in Downtown Toronto, while Conservative support is stronger in the surrounding communities outside Toronto. The NDP also has a strong base within the GTA.[tpl]cite web|title=Tories struggle in Toronto's Liberal strongholds|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060116/elxn_toronto_060116/20060116?s_name=election2006|publisher=CTV News|accessdate=February 26, 2010[/tpl]
From 1993 to 2004, a centre-right party failed to win a single seat in the former Metro Toronto. In the 2011 election, this trend turned around completely, where the political leanings of Toronto began to shift to mirror the surround communities that had been more likely to lean towards the Conservative party in their voting patterns.
The election of 2011 indicated that Liberal support, based on votes in the GTA, had collapsed from 43.7% to 30.6%, giving the Liberals only 14.9% of the local seats in the House of Commons. However, the support of the Conservatives and NDP increased accordingly, with the Conservatives increasing their vote share from 31.5% to 42.2% (and capturing 68.1% of the GTA seats) and the NDP increasing from 14.6% to 23.2% of the vote and 17% of the local Federal ridings.

===Municipal Politics===

Currently 244 politicians govern the Greater Toronto Area below the provincial and federal levels, holding offices in cities, towns, and regional municipalities.Lorinc, John.

Unusual for a large North American urban agglomeration, the GTA has very few agencies with powers that can cross boundaries.
Attempts to create an interregional organization have been made, such as the Province of Ontario's Office of the Greater Toronto Area (OGTA) in 1988Sancton, Andrew "Merger Mania" McGill-Queen's Press, ISBN 0-7735-2163-1 p113 and the Greater Toronto Services Board (GTSB) in 1998,[tpl]cite news|title=GTA needs economic 'war cabinet'|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/666371#article|work=The Toronto Star|accessdate=February 26, 2010 | first=Vanessa | last=Lu | date=July 15, 2009[/tpl]e/?search=browseRepealed&context= Greater Toronto Services Board Act, 1998, Queen's Printer for Ontario.

==Demographics==

According to the latest census data from 2011 from Statistics Canada, the population of this area is 6,054,191. Population growth studies have projected the City of Toronto's population in 2031 to be 3,000,000 and the Greater Toronto Area's population to be 7,450,000,[tpl]cite web|title=Toward 2025: Assessing Ontario's Long-Term Outlook|url=http://www.toronto.ca/torontoplan/pdf/flash_sec2.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Finance (Ontario)|accessdate=February 28, 2010[/tpl] while the Ontario Ministry of Finance states that it could reach 7.7 million by 2025. Statistics Canada identified in 2001 that four major urban regions in Canada exhibited a cluster pattern of concentrated population growth among which included the Greater Golden Horseshoe Census Region, which includes all of the Greater Toronto Area (which includes Oshawa), as well as other Southern Ontario cities including Niagara, Hamilton, Guelph, Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo and Barrie. Combined, the Greater Golden Horseshoe has a population of 8,116,000 in 2006,http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9a_e.cfm, Statistics Canada. Retrieved on 2010-02-22. containing approximately 25% of Canada's population.
The Toronto CMA also has the largest proportions of foreign-born residents (46%) as a share of the total population out of all metropolitan areas in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Toronto region is also unusually diverse over the composition of its ethnicities. The four largest foreign born populations of Toronto only constitute 15% of the total foreign-born population. This is opposed to the four largest foreign born populations of other metropolitan areas such as New York and London, where they make up 25% of their respective foreign-born populations.
Statistics Canada also found that in 2006, there were 31,910 Aboriginal people living in the Greater Toronto Area, which represented 2.7 per cent of all Aboriginal persons in Canada and 13.2 per cent of those in Ontario.http://www.toronto.ca/toronto_facts/diversity.htm, City of Toronto.
