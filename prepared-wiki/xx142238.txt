Syria ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Syria.ogg|ˈ|s|ɪr|i|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SIRR|ee-ə [/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]big|سوريا[/tpl][/tpl] or [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]big|سورية[/tpl][/tpl], Sūriyā or Sūrīyah), officially the Syrian Arab Republic, is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Its capital Damascus is among the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Ramad.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111111827/http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Ramad.html |archivedate=2006-11-11 |title=Neolithic Tell Ramad in the Damascus Basin of Syria |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, it is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Alawite, Sunni and Christian Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Druze, Kurds, and Turks. Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria.
In English, the name "Syria" was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as al-Sham) while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the third millennium BC. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.
The modern Syrian state was established after the first World War as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–1971. Between 1958 and 1961, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is considered to be non-democratic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/syria |title=Freedom on the world report |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was in office from 1970 to 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67561/michael-broening/the-sturdy-house-that-assad-built |title=The Sturdy House That Assad Built |date= 7 March 2011 |author=Michael Bröning |publisher=The Foreign Affairs [/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Syria is derived from the ancient Greek name for Syrians: [tpl]lang|el|Σύριοι[/tpl], [tpl]transl|grc|Sýrioi[/tpl], or [tpl]lang|el|Σύροι[/tpl], [tpl]transl|grc|Sýroi[/tpl], which the Greeks applied without distinction to the Assyrians.Herodotus, The Histories, VII.63, s:History of Herodotus/Book 7.[tpl]cite web |first=John |last=Joseph |title=Assyria and Syria: Synonyms?|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v11n2/JohnJoseph.pdf |format=PDF |year=2008[/tpl] A number of modern scholars argued that the Greek word related to the cognate [tpl]lang|el|Ἀσσυρία[/tpl], [tpl]transl|grc|Assyria[/tpl], ultimately derived from the Akkadian [tpl]transl|akk|Aššur[/tpl].First proposed by Theodor Nöldeke in 1881; cf.

The area designated by the word has changed over time. Classically, Syria lies at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, between Arabia to the south and Asia Minor to the north, stretching inland to include parts of Iraq, and having an uncertain border to the northeast that Pliny the Elder describes as including, from west to east, Commagene, Sophene, and Adiabene.[tpl]cite book |author=Pliny |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/5*.html |title=Natural History |chapter=Book 5 Section 66 |publisher=University of Chicago|year=77 |isbn=84-249-1901-7[/tpl]
By Pliny's time, however, this larger Syria had been divided into a number of provinces under the Roman Empire (but politically independent from each other): Judaea, later renamed Palaestina in AD 135 (the region corresponding to modern-day Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan) in the extreme southwest, Phoenicia corresponding to Lebanon, with Damascena to the inland side of Phoenicia, Coele-Syria (or "Hollow Syria") south of the Eleutheris river, and Iraq.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578856/Syria/29905/Roman-provincial-organization#default |title=Syria :: Roman provincial organization|work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl]

==History==

===Ancient antiquity===

Since approximately 10,000 BC, Syria was one of centers of Neolithic culture (known as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A) where agriculture and cattle breeding appeared for the first time in the world. The following Neolithic period (PPNB) is represented by rectangular houses of Mureybet culture. At the time of the pre-pottery Neolithic, people used vessels made of stone, gyps and burnt lime (Vaisselle blanche). Finds of obsidian tools from Anatolia are evidences of early trade relations. Cities of Hamoukar and Emar played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps only preceded by those of Mesopotamia.

====Eblaites and Amorites====

The earliest recorded indigenous civilisation in the region was the Kingdom of EblaPettinato, Giovanni. The Archives of Ebla; Gelb, I. J.

One of the earliest written texts from Syria is a trading agreement between Vizier Ibrium of Ebla and an ambiguous kingdom called Abarsal c.2300 BC.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=u5DzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= On the Reliability of the Old Testament|author= Kenneth Anderson Kitchen|page= 285[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=Kw6U05qBiXcC&pg=PA285#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Justice Among Nations|author=  Stephen C.

Ebla was weakened by a long war with Mari, and the whole of Syria became part of the Mesopotamian Akkadian Empire after Sargon of Akkad and his grandson Naram-Sin's conquests ended Eblan domination over Syria in the first half of the 23rd century BC.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=q8Z7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author= Trevor Bryce|page= 16[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=0Rwals-oh6kC&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Eblaitica: Essays on the Ebla Archives and Eblaite Language, Volume 4|author= Cyrus Herzl Gordon,Gary Rendsburg,Nathan H. Winter|page= 68[/tpl]
Ebla was restored by Canaanite speaking Amorites, who came to dominate much of Syria from the 21st century BC, although parts of Syria were occupied in the 19th and 18th centuries BC by the Old Assyrian Empire ruled by the Amorite Dynasty of Shamshi-Adad I, and by the Babylonian Empire which was founded by Amorites. Syria was called the Land of the Amurru (Amorites) by their Assyro-Babylonian neighbours. The Northwest Semitic language of the Amorites is the earliest attested of the Canaanite languages.
Mari reemerged during this period, and saw renewed prosperity until conquered by Hammurabi of Babylon. Ugarit also arose during this time, circa 1800 BC, close to modern Latakia. Ugaritic was a Semitic language loosely related to the Canaanite languages, and developed the Ugaritic alphabet.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=0_KnI588AnkC&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Early Alphabet|author= John F.

From this time, Syria became a battle ground for various foreign empires, these being the Hittite Empire, Mitanni Empire, Egyptian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, and to a lesser degree Babylonia. The Egyptians initially occupied much of the south, while the Hittites, and the Mitanni, much of the north. However, Assyria eventually gained the upper, destroying the Mitanni Empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the Hittites and Babylon. Between 1365 and 1020 BC, Eastern Syria largely became a part of the Middle Assyrian Empire.Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq, 3rd ed., Penguin Books, London, 1991, p.381 while the west remained part of the Hittite empire until it's destruction.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=1A0OgvXfHlQC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Ugarit in Retrospect|author=Douglas Frayne|page= 23,24,25[/tpl]

====Arameans and Phoenicians====

Around the 14th century BC, various Semitic peoples appeared in the area, such as the semi-nomadic Suteans who came into an unsuccessful conflict with Babylonia to the east, and the West Semitic speaking Arameans who subsumed the earlier Amorites. They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The Egyptians fought the Hittites for control over western Syria; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the Battle of Kadesh.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=WOxnM3WJYJgC&pg=PA475#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Philosophy of Historiography|author= John Lange|page= 475[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=EClaAtUb2TAC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Ramses II and His Time|author=Immanuel Velikovsky|page= 23[/tpl]
With the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BC, the Aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior, founding states such as Bit Bahiani, Aram-Damascus, Hamath, Aram-Rehob, Aram-Naharaim, and Luhuti. From this point, the region became known as Aramea or Aram. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European Hittites, with the founding of a number of Syro-Hittite states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including Palistin, Carchemish and Sam'al.
A Canaanite group known as the Phoenicians came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and south west Turkey) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as Amrit, Simyra, Arwad, Paltos, Ramitha and Shuksi. From these coastal regions they eventually spread their influence throughout the Mediterranean, including building colonies in Malta, Sicily, the Iberian peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal), the coasts of North Africa, and most significantly, founding the major city state of Carthage (in modern Tunisia) in the 9th century BC which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the Roman Empire.
Syria and the entire Near East and beyond then fell to the vast Neo Assyrian Empire (911 BC - 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of their empire, This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire Near East until after the Arab Islamic conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon Eber-Nari. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacking coalition of their former subject peoples; the Medes, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians. During the fall of Assyria, the Scythians ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at Carchemish in northern Syria in 605 BC.
The Assyrian Empire was followed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (605 BC - 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of Egypt. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.

===Classic antiquity===

The Achaemenid Persians took Syria from Babylonia as part of their hegemony of Southwest Asia in 539 BC. The Persians, having spent four centuries under Assyrian rule, retained Imperial Aramaic as the language of the Achaemenid Empire (539 BC- 33O BC), and also the Assyrian name of the satrapy of Aram/Syria Eber-Nari.
Syria was conquered by the Greek Macedonian Empire, ruled by Alexander the Great circa 330 BC, and consequently became Coele-Syria province of the Greek Seleucid Empire (323 BC - 64 BC).
It was the Greeks who introduced the name "Syria" to the region. Originally an Indo-European corruption of "Assyria" in northern Mesopotamia, the Greeks used this term not only to describe Assyria itself but the lands to the west which had for centuries been under Assyrian dominion.Rollinger, Robert (2006). "The terms "Assyria" and "Syria" again" (PDF). Journal of Near Eastern Studies 65 (4): 284–287. [tpl]DOI|10.1086/511103[/tpl]. Thus in the Greco-Roman world both the Arameans of Syria and the Assyrians of Mesopotamia to the east were referred to as "Syrians" or "Syriacs", despite these being distinct peoples in their own right, a confusion which would continue into the modern world.
Palmyra, a rich and sometimes powerful native Aramean kingdom arose in northern Syria in the 4th century BC, independent of the Greeks. Eventually parts of southern Seleucid Syria were taken by Judean Hasmoneans upon the slow disintegration of the Hellenistic Empire.
Syria briefly came under Armenian control from 83 BC, with the conquests of Tigranes the Great, who was welcomed as a savior from the Seleucids and Romans by its people. The Armenians retained control of Syria for two decades before being driven out by the Romans.
Pompey the Great of the Roman Empire, who captured Antioch in 64 BC, turning Syria into a Roman province. Palmyra again remained largely independent, and in the late 3rd century AD it became the center of the short lived Palmyrene Empire, which briefly conquered Egypt, Syria, Palestine, much of Asia Minor, Judah and Lebanon, before being finally brought under Roman control in 273 AD.
The northern Mesopotamian Assyrian kingdom of Adiabene controlled areas of north east Syria between 10 AD and 117 AD, before it was conquered by Rome.Hist." xviii., vii. 1
Control of Syria eventually passed from the Romans to the Byzantines, with the split in the Roman Empire.
The largely Aramaic speaking population of Syria during the heyday of the empire was probably not exceeded again until the 19th century. The bulk of the population were Arameans, but Syria was also home to Greek and Roman ruling classes, Assyrians dwelt in the north east, Phoenicians along the coasts, and a Jewish community was also extant, and Nabateans and pre-Islamic Arabs such as the Lakhmids entered the deserts of southern Syria. Syria's large and prosperous population made Syria one of the most important of the Roman provinces, particularly during the 2nd and 3rd centuries (AD).[tpl]cite book | last = Cavendish Corporation | first = Marshall | title = World and Its Peoples | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7614-7571-0 | page = 183[/tpl]
The Roman Emperor Alexander Severus, who was emperor from 222 to 235, was an Aramean from Syria. His cousin Elagabalus, who was emperor from 218 to 222, was also from Syria and his family held hereditary rights to the high priesthood of the Aramean sun god El-Gabal at Emesa (modern Homs) in Syria. Another Roman emperor who was a Syrian was Philip the Arab (Marcus Julius Philippus), emperor from 244 to 249.
Syria is significant in the history of Christianity; Saulus of Tarsus, better known as the Apostle Paul, was converted on the Road to Damascus and emerged as a significant figure in the Christian Church at Antioch in ancient Syria, from which he left on many of his missionary journeys. ([tpl]Bibleverse|Acts|9:1–43|[/tpl])

===Middle Ages===

====Islamic Syria (al-Sham)====

By AD 640, Syria was conquered by the Arab Rashidun army led by Khalid ibn al-Walid. In the mid-7th century, the Umayyad dynasty, then rulers of the empire, placed the capital of the empire in Damascus. The country's power dramatically declined during later Umayyad rule; due mainly to the totalitarianism, corruption and the resulting revolutions by the oppressed.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] The Umayyad dynasty was then overthrown in 750 by the Abbasid dynasty, which moved the capital of empire to Baghdad.
Arabic — made official under Umayyad rule — became the dominant language, replacing Greek and Aramaic in the Abbasid era. In 887, the Egypt-based Tulunids annexed Syria from the Abbasids, and were later replaced by once the Egypt-based Ikhshidids and still later by the Hamdanids originating in Aleppo founded by Sayf al-Dawla.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578856/Syria |title=Syria: History |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]

====Crusaders, Ayubids and Mamluks====

Sections of Syria were  held by French, English, Italian and German overlords between 1098 and 1189 AD during the Crusades, and were known collectively as the Crusader states, the primary one in Syria being the Principality of Antioch.
The area was also threatened by Shi'a extremists known as Assassins (Hassassin). After a century of Seljuk rule, Syria was largely conquered (1175-1185) by the Kurdish warlord Saladin, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty of Egypt. Aleppo fell to the Mongols of Hulegu in January 1260, and Damascus in March, but then Hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to China to deal with a succession dispute.
A few months later, the Mamluks arrived with an army from Egypt and defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut in Galilee. The Mamluk leader, Baibars, made Damascus a provincial capital. When he died, power was taken by Qalawun. In the meantime, an emir named Sunqur al-Ashqar had tried to declare himself ruler of Damascus, but he was defeated by Qalawun on 21 June 1280, and fled to northern Syria. Al-Ashqar, who had married a Mongol woman, appealed for help from the Mongols. The Mongols of the Ilkhanate took the city, but Qalawun persuaded Al-Ashqar to join him, and they fought against the Mongols on 29 October 1281, in the Second Battle of Homs, which was won by the Mamluks.Timeframe pp. 59–75.
In 1400, the Muslim Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur Lenk (Tamurlane) invaded Syria, sacked Aleppo and captured Damascus after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans, who were deported to Samarkand Timur-Lenk also conducted specific massacres of the Aramean and Assyrian Christian populations, greatly reducing their numbers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1433425 |title=Battle of Aleppo |publisher=Everything2.com |date=2003-02-22 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/wae/ht08wae.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428055820/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/wae/ht08wae.htm|archivedate=2009-04-28 |title=The Eastern Mediterranean, 1400–1600 A.D |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=23 April 2011[/tpl] By the end of the 15th century, the discovery of a sea route from Europe to the Far East ended the need for an overland trade route through Syria.

===Ottoman Syria===

In 1516, the Ottoman Empire invaded the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, conquering Syria, and incorporating it into its empire. The Ottoman system was not burdensome to Syrians because the Turks respected Arabic as the language of the Koran, and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus was made the major entrepot for Mecca, and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/7.htm |title=Syria – Ottoman |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl]
Ottoman administration followed a unique system that led to a peaceful coexistence for centuries.[tpl]dubious|date=September 2013[/tpl] Each ethno-religious minority — ArabShia Muslim, Arab Sunni Muslim, Aramean-Syriac Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Maronite Christians, Assyrian Christians, Armenians, Kurds and Jewish — constituted a millet.a b Stanford J. Shaw, "Dynamics of Ottoman Society and administration", in "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey" The religious heads of each community administered all personal status laws and performed certain civil functions as well. In 1831, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt renounced his loyalty to the Empire and overran Ottoman Syria, capturing Damascus. His short-term rule over the domain attempted to change the demographics and social structure of the region: he brought thousands of Egyptian villagers to populate the plains of Southern Syria, rebuilt Jaffa and settled it with veteran Egyptian soldiers aiming to turn it into a regional capital, and he crushed peasant and Druze rebellions and deported non-loyal tribesmen. By 1840, however, he had to surrender the area back to the Ottomans.
From 1864, Tanzimat reforms were applied on Ottoman Syria, carving out the provinces (vilayets) of Aleppo, Zor, Beirut and Damascus Vilayet; Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon was created, as well, and soon after
the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem was given a separate status.
During World War I the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire Near East to the British Empire and French Empire. During the conflict, genocide was carried out by the Ottomans and their allies in the form of the Armenian Genocide and Assyrian Genocide, of which Deir ez-Zor, in Ottoman Syria, was the final destination of these death marches.Pouring a People into the Desert:The "Definitive Solution" of the Unionists to the Armenian Question, Fuat Dundar, A Question of Genocide, ed. Ronald Grigor Suny, Fatma Muge Gocek and Norman M. Naimark, (Oxford University Press, 2011), 280-281. In the midst of World War I, two Allied diplomats (Frenchman François Georges-Picot and Briton Mark Sykes) secretly agreed on the post-war division of the Ottoman Empire into respective zones of influence in the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916.  Initially, the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from Jordan to Iran. However, the discovery of oil in the region of Mosul just before the end of the war led to yet another negotiation with France in 1918 to cede this region to 'Zone B', or the British zone of influence. This border was later recognized internationally when Syria became a League of Nations mandate in 1920[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/III_-_Protmand_modifie_mandat.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626065208/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/III_-_Protmand_modifie_mandat.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-26 |title=Mandat Syrie-Liban |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] and has not changed to date.

===French Mandate===

In 1920, a short-lived independent Kingdom of Syria was established under Faisal I of the Hashemite family. However, his rule over Syria ended after only a few months, following the Battle of Maysalun. French troops occupied Syria later that year after the San Remo conference proposed that the League of Nations put Syria under a French mandate.[tpl]cite book |author=Peter N.

In 1925, Sultan al-Atrash led a revolt that broke out in the Druze Mountain and spread to engulf the whole of Syria and parts of Lebanon. Al-Atrash won several battles against the French, notably the Battle of al-Kafr on 21 July 1925, the Battle of al-Mazraa on 2–3 August 1925, and the battles of Salkhad, al-Musayfirah and Suwayda. France sent thousands of troops from Morocco and Senegal, leading the French to regain many cities, although resistance lasted until the spring of 1927. The French sentenced Sultan al-Atrash to death, but he had escaped with the rebels to Transjordan and was eventually pardoned. He returned to Syria in 1937 after the signing of the Syrian-French Treaty.
Syria and France negotiated a treaty of independence in September 1936, and Hashim al-Atassi was the first president to be elected under the first incarnation of the modern republic of Syria. However, the treaty never came into force because the French Legislature refused to ratify it. With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of Vichy France until the British and Free French occupied the country in the Syria-Lebanon campaign in July 1941. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalists and the British forced the French to evacuate their troops in April 1946, leaving the country in the hands of a republican government that had been formed during the mandate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/syria/85051.htm |title=Background Note: Syria |work=United States Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, May 2007[/tpl]

===Independent Syrian Republic===

Upheaval dominated Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s. In 1948, Syria was involved in the Arab-Israeli War, aligning with the other local Arab states attempting to prevent the establishment of the State of Israel.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578856/Syria/29922/World-War-II-and-independence |title=Syria: World War II and independence |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia[/tpl] Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the March 1949 Syrian coup d'état by Col. Husni al-Za'im, described as the first military overthrow of the Arab World since the start of the Second World War. This was soon followed by another overthrow, by Col. Sami al-Hinnawi, who was himself quickly deposed by Col. Adib Shishakli, all within the same year.
Shishakli eventually abolished multipartyism altogether, but was himself overthrown in a 1954 coup and the parliamentary system was restored. However, by this time, power was increasingly concentrated in the military and security establishment. The weakness of Parliamentary institutions and the mismanagement of the economy led to unrest and the influence of Nasserism and other ideologies. There was fertile ground for various Arab nationalist, Syrian nationalist, and socialist movements, which represented disaffected elements of society. Notably included were religious minorities, who demanded radical reform.
In November 1956, as a direct result of the Suez Crisis,[tpl]cite web|last=Robson |first=John |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/02/10/syria-hasnt-changed-but-the-world-has |title=Syria hasn't changed, but the world has |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-01-25[/tpl] Syria signed a pact with the Soviet Union. This gave a foothold for Communist influence within the government in exchange for military equipment. Turkey then became worried about this increase in the strength of Syrian military technology, as it seemed feasible that Syria might attempt to retake İskenderun. Only heated debates in the United Nations lessened the threat of war.[tpl]cite book |last = Brecher |first = Michael |coauthors = Jonathan Wilkenfeld |title = A Study of Crisis |publisher = University of Michigan Press |year = 1997 |pages = 345–346 |isbn = 0-472-10806-9 [/tpl]
On 1 February 1958, Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli and Egypt's Nasser announced the merging of Egypt and Syria, creating the United Arab Republic, and all Syrian political parties, as well as the communists therein, ceased overt activities. Meanwhile, a group of Syrian Ba'athist officers, alarmed by the party’s poor position and the increasing fragility of the union, decided to form a secret Military Committee; its initial members were Lieutenant-Colonel Muhammad Umran, Major Salah Jadid and Captain Hafez al-Assad. When Syria seceded on 28 September 1961, the ensuing instability culminated in the 8 March 1963 coup. The takeover was engineered by members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The new cabinet was dominated by Ba'ath members.

===Ba'athist Syria===

On 23 February 1966, the Military Committee carried out an intra-party overthrow, imprisoned President Amin Hafiz and designated a regionalist, civilian Ba'ath government on 1 March. Although Nureddin al-Atassi became the formal head of state, Salah Jadid was Syria's effective ruler from 1966 until 1970.[tpl]cite news|title=Salah Jadid, 63, Leader of Syria Deposed and Imprisoned by Assad|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/24/obituaries/salah-jadid-63-leader-of-syria-deposed-and-imprisoned-by-assad.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 24, 1993[/tpl] The coup led to a split within the original pan-Arab Ba'ath Party: one Iraqi-led ba'ath movement (ruled Iraq from 1968 to 2003) and one Syrian-led ba'ath movement was established.
In the first part of 1967 a low-key state of war existed between Syria and Israel. Dozens of attempts at infiltration of Israel were made by terrorists, and the Syrian armed forces shelled Israeli villages on multiple occasions, provoking retaliatory fire from Israel. Conflict over Israeli cultivation of land in the Demilitarized Zone led to  7 April prewar aerial clashes between Israel and Syria.[tpl]cite book|author=Mark A.

Disagreement developed between Jadid, who controlled the party apparatus, and Assad, who controlled the military. The 1970 retreat of Syrian forces sent to aid the PLO during the "Black September" hostilities with Jordan reflected this disagreement.[tpl]cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/28/nixon.papers/index.html |title=Jordan asked Nixon to attack Syria, declassified papers show – CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= 28 November 2007|accessdate=25 October 2008[/tpl] The power struggle culminated in the November 1970 Corrective Movement, a bloodless military overthrow that installed Hafez al-Assad as the strongman of the government.[tpl]cite book | last = Seale | first = Patrick | authorlink = Patrick Seale | title = Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East | publisher = University of California Press| year = 1988| isbn = 0-520-06976-5[/tpl]

In early 1976, Syria entered Lebanon, beginning the thirty-year Syrian military occupation. Over the following 15 years of civil war, Syria fought for control over Lebanon, and attempted to stop Israel from taking over in southern Lebanon, through extensive use of proxy militias. Syria then remained in Lebanon until 2005.
In the late 1970s, an Islamist uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood was aimed against the government. Islamists attacked civilians and off-duty military personnel, leading security forces to in turn kill civilians in a retaliatory strike.  The uprising had reached its climax in the 1982 Hama massacre,[tpl]cite web|author=Itzchak Weismann |url=http://www.ou.edu/mideast/Additional%20pages%20-%20non-catagory/Sufism%20in%20Syriawebpage.htm |title=Sufism and Sufi Brotherhoods in Syria and Palestine |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=2013-01-30[/tpl] when some 10,000 – 40,000 people were killed by regular Syrian Army troops.
