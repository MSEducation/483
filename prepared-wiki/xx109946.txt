Zoë Tamerlis Lund (February 9, 1962 – April 16, 1999), also known as Zoë Tamerlis and Zoë Tamerlaine, was an American musician turned model, actress, and screenwriter. She was best known for her association with Abel Ferrara, in whose movie Ms. 45 she starred. Some of her other acting work included a guest spot on Miami Vice and Larry Cohen's Special Effects.

Lund co-wrote the screenplay for Bad Lieutenant, and left behind much unpublished material. Although she had never met supermodel Gia Carangi, she was working on a biographical screenplay of Carangi's life at the time of her death, and she appeared posthumously in the documentary The Self-Destruction of Gia. From 1980 to 1985 she was the companion of Edouard de Laurot, prior to her marriage to Robert Lund in 1986.
Lund died in Paris on April 16, 1999, from heart failure due to extended cocaine use.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmfanatics.net/artist-detail.asp?ID=28 |title=Zoë Lund (Tamerlis) |work=filmfanatics.net |accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]
