The Indian National Army (INA; Azad Hind Fauj; [tpl]lang-hi|आज़ाद हिन्द फ़ौज[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ur|آزاد ہند فوج[/tpl]) was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists in 1942 in Southeast Asia during World War II. The aim of the army was to secure Indian independence with Japanese assistance. Initially composed of Indian prisoners of war captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore, it later drew volunteers from Indian expatriate population in Malaya and Burma.  The INA was also at the forefront of women's equality and the formation of a women's regiment, the Rani of Jhansi regiment was formed as an all volunteer women's unit to fight the British Raj as well as provide medical services to the INA.
Initially formed in 1942 immediately after the fall of Singapore under Mohan Singh, the first INA collapsed in December that year before it was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943 and proclaimed the army of Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind (the Provisional Government of Free India). This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma, Imphal and Kohima, and later, against the successful Burma Campaign of the Allies. The end of the war saw a large number of the troops repatriated to India where some faced trial for treason and became a galvanising point of the Indian Independence movement.[tpl]Harvnb|Sarkar|1983|p=420[/tpl]
The legacy of the INA is controversial given its associations with Imperial Japan, the course of Japanese occupations in Burma, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, its alliance with the Axis in Europe, as well as Japanese war crimes and the alleged complicity of the troops of the INA in these. However, after the war, the Red Fort trials of captured INA officers in India provoked massive public outcries in support of their efforts to fight for Indian independence against the Raj, eventually triggering the Bombay mutiny in the British Indian forces.[tpl]Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=496,498,499[/tpl] These events in the twilight of the Raj are accepted by historians to have played a crucial role in its relatively rapid end.[tpl]Harvnb|Chaudhuri|1953|p=349[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Sarkar|1983|p=411[/tpl]

Japan and Southeast Asia were major refuges for Indian nationalists living in exile before the start of World War II. Japan had sent intelligence missions, notably under Major Iwaichi Fujiwara, into South Asia even before the start of the war to garner support from the Malayan Sultans, overseas Chinese, the Burmese resistance and the Indian movement. These missions were successful establishing contacts with Indian nationalists in exile in Thailand and Malaya, supporting the establishment and organisation of the Indian Independence League (IIL).[tpl]Harvnb|Lebra|1977|p=23[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Lebra|1977|p=24[/tpl]
At the outbreak of World War II in South East Asia, 70,000 Indian troops were stationed in Malaya. After the start of the war, Japan's spectacular Malayan Campaign had brought under her control considerable numbers of Indian prisoners of war, nearly 55,000 after the Fall of Singapore alone. The conditions of service within the British Indian Army as well as the conditions in Malaya had fed dissension among these troops. From these troops, the First Indian National Army was formed under Mohan Singh and received considerable Japanese aid and support.[tpl]Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=94[/tpl]

==Second INA==

In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Subhas Chandra Bose, since a number of the officers and troops who had returned to PoW camps, or had not volunteered in the first place, made it known that they would be willing to join the INA only on the condition that it was led by Bose.[tpl]Harvnb|Lebra|1977|p=27[/tpl] Bose had, at the start of the war in Europe, escaped from house arrest[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv7n1/Bose.htm | title=Subhas Chandra Bose in Nazi Germany | publisher=South Asia Forum Quarterly | work=Sisir K.

In Germany he convinced Adolf Hitler, in a series of conferences, to support the cause of Indian Independence,[tpl]Harvnb|Tojo|1943|p=[/tpl] forming the Free India Legion and the Azad Hind Radio.[tpl]cite book | title=writings and speeches, 1941–1943 | publisher=Netaji Research Bureau | author=Bose | authorlink=Azad Hind: writings and speeches, 1941–1943 | year=2002 | location=Calcutta | pages=87 | isbn=81-7824-034-3[/tpl] By early 1943, Bose had turned his attention to Southeast Asia. With its large overseas Indian population, it was recognised that the region was fertile ground for establishing an anti-colonial force to fight the Raj. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.s1942.org.sg/s1942/indian_national_army/subhas.htm | title=Total Mobilisation | publisher=National Archives of Singapore | accessdate=August 12, 2011[/tpl] He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine, and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to the Indian communities, exhorting them to join in the fight for India's Independence.
On 15 February 1943, the Army itself was put under the command of Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani.[tpl]cite web | url=http://wn.com/Lt_Col_M_Z_Kiani | title=MZ kiani | publisher=World news | accessdate=August 12, 2011[/tpl] A policy forming body was formed with the Director of the Military Bureau, Lt. Col Bhonsle, in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col. Shah Nawaz Khan as Chief of General Staff, Major P.K. Sahgal as Military Secretary, Major Habib ur Rahman as commandant of the Officers' Training School and Lt. Col. A.C. Chatterji (later Major A.D. Jahangir) as head of enlightenment and culture.
On 4 July 1943, two days after reaching Singapore, Subhas Chandra Bose assumed the leadership of the IIL and the INA in a ceremony at Cathay Building. Bose's influence was notable. His appeal not only re-invigorated the fledgling INA, which previously consisted mainly of POWs, his appeals also touched a chord with the Indian expatriates in South Asia as local civilians, without caste, creed and religion- ranging from barristers, traders to plantation workers, including Khudabadi Sindhi Swarankar working as shop keepers – had no military experience joined the INA, doubled its troop strength.
An Officers’ Training School for INA officers, led by Habib ur Rahman, and the Azad School for the civilian volunteers were set up to provide training to the recruits. A youth wing of the INA, composed of 45 Young Indians personally chosen by Bose and affectionately known as the Tokyo Boys, were also sent to Japan's Imperial Military Academy to train as fighter pilots. Also, possibly the first time in Asia, and even the only time outside the Soviet Union, a women's regiment, the Rani of Jhansi regiment was raised as a combat force.
