The "Religious Freedom Watch" site is often cited by [[alt.religion.scientology]] users as a contemporary example of "dead agenting".
Dead agenting has also been carried out by flier campaigns against some critics—using so-called "DA fliers". Bonnie Woods, an ex-member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a "hate campaigner" with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed to issue an apologyChurch of Scientology apology to Bonnie Woods from the Church of Scientology and other defendants, 8 June 1999. and to pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 costs to the Woods.[ref]Stars' cult pays out £155,000 over hate campaign, Richard Palmer, The Express, 8 June 1999, courtesy link

==Allegations of criminality; criminal convictions of members==

Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology is reflected in the long list of legal incidents associated with the organization including the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization.
In 1978, a number of Scientologists including L. Ron Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard (who was second in command in the organization at the time) were convicted of perpetrating the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States called "Operation Snow White". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service. The judge who convicted Mrs. Hubbard and ten accomplices described their attempt to plead freedom of religion in defense:

Eleven church staff members including Mary Sue Hubbard and other highly placed officials, pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court based on evidence seized in the raids and received sentences from two to six years (some suspended).
Other noteworthy incidents involving criminal accusations and prosecutions against the Church of Scientology include:

==Treatment of members==

In 1997, a Sydney, Australia woman was charged with murdering her father and sister and seriously injuring her mother. Her parents had prevented her from seeking the psychiatric treatment she needed because of their Scientology beliefs, a court has been told.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,22042754-1702,00.html | title=Latest Stories From News.Com.Au[/tpl]
In 2011, Valeska Paris alleged that she had been kept prisoner on a Church of Scientology ship.
In 2012, Debbie Cook, who ran the "spiritual Mecca" for seventeen years, came forward and accused the church of repeated accounts of "screaming, slapping" and being "made to stand in a trash and water's poured over you" in efforts to confess her sins. This was all done in "The Hole", located at Scientology's International base in the California Desert. She claims that she was taken there against her will and forced to stay for seven weeks. The church states that she "voluntarily" participated in their program of "religious discipline".[tpl]cite web|author=02/29/2012 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/pr-crisis-scientology-15815353 |title=New PR Crisis for Scientology | Video - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]

===Lisa McPherson and the "Introspection Rundown"===

The most widely publicized death of one of the organization's members was that of 36-year-old Lisa McPherson while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in Clearwater, Florida, in 1995. McPherson, at the time, was displaying symptoms suggesting she was struggling with mental illness; in one case, she removed all of her clothes after being involved in a minor traffic accident, later remarking she had done so in hopes of obtaining counseling. The Church, however, intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment and to keep her in Church custody. Records show that she was then placed in a Scientology program, the Introspection Rundown, which was forced isolation used to handle a psychotic episode.[tpl]cite web | first = Thomas C.| last = Tobin| title = Scientologists decry toll of criminal case| url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/030900/TampaBay/Scientologists_decry_.shtml| publisher = St. Petersburg Times| date = 2000-03-09| accessdate = 2007-09-17[/tpl] Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. The autopsy identified multiple hematomas (bruises), an abrasion on the nose, and lesions that were consistent with "insect/animal bites".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shipbrook.com/jeff/CoS/autopsy.html |title=Web site: Lisa McPherson: Coroner's Report transcript |publisher=Shipbrook.com |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] An autopsy showed that she had died of a pulmonary embolism.
Florida authorities filed criminal charges against the Church of Scientology, who denied any responsibility for McPherson's death and vigorously contested the charges. The prosecuting attorneys ultimately dropped the criminal case. After four years, a $100 million civil lawsuit filed by Lisa McPherson's family was settled in 2004. The suit resulted in an injunction against the distribution of a film critical of Scientology, The Profit, which the Church claimed was meant to influence the jury. The terms of the settlement were sealed by the court.[tpl]cite web | first = Robert| last = Farley| title = Scientologists settle death suit| url = http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/29/Tampabay/Scientologists_settle.shtml| publisher = St. Petersburg Times| date = 2004-05-29| accessdate = 2007-09-17[/tpl]

===Noah Lottick===

Noah Lottick was an American student of Russian studies who committed suicide on May 11, 1990, by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands. After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents' concern over his membership in the Church of Scientology.
Noah Lottick had taken Scientology courses, for which he paid [tpl]Currency|5000[/tpl].Richard Behar, "Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", Time, May 6, 1991, see article: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power Lottick's friends and family remarked that after taking these courses he began to act strangely. They stated to Time magazine that he told them that his Scientologist teachers were telepathic, and that his father's heart attack was purely psychosomatic.  His parents said that he visited their home five days before his death, claiming they were spreading "false rumors" about him.
Lottick's suicide was profiled in a Time cover story that was highly critical of Scientology, "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", which received the Gerald Loeb Award, and later appeared in Reader's Digest.October 1991, Readers Digest, "A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream"
Lottick's father, Dr. Edward Lottick, stated that his initial impression of Scientology was that it was similar to Dale Carnegie's techniques. However, after his son's death, his opinion was that the organization is a "school for psychopaths".  He blamed Scientology for his son's death, although no direct connection was determined.  After Dr. Lottick's remarks were published in the media, the Church of Scientology haggled with him over [tpl]Currency|3000[/tpl] that Noah had allegedly paid to the Church and not utilized for services.  The Church claimed Lottick had intended this to be a donation.
The Church of Scientology sued Richard Behar and Time magazine for $416 million. Dr and Mrs Lottick submitted affidavits affirming "the accuracy of each statement in the article", and stating that Dr Lottick had "concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations". They said that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral of their son.Church of Scientology v. Time and Richard Behar, 92 Civ. 3024 (PKL), Opinion and Order, Court TV library Web site., retrieved 1 October 2006. All counts against Behar and Time were later dismissed."Judge Dismisses Church of Scientology's $416 Million Lawsuit Against Time Magazine", Business Wire, July 16, 1996. Lottick's father cited his son's suicide as his motivation for researching cults, in his article describing a survey of physicians that he presented to the Pennsylvania State Medical Society.Survey Reveals Physicians' Experience with Cults, Dr. Edward Lottick, Cult Observer, Volume 10, Number 3, 1993.
The Church of Scientology issued a press release denying any responsibility for Lottick's suicide.[tpl]cite news | first = Lucy | last = Morgan | title = Scientology got blame for French suicide | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/26196184.html?dids=26196184:26196184&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT | work = | publisher = St. Petersburg Times | date = 1998-02-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 [/tpl]  Spokesperson Mike Rinder was quoted in the St. Petersburg Times as saying that Lottick had an argument with his parents four days before his death.  Rinder stated, "I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror...I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable."

===Brainwashing===

The Church of Scientology is frequently accused by critics of employing brainwashing.[tpl]cite web|last=Friedman |first=Roger |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351426,00.html |title=Fox New: Actor Jason Beghe: Scientology Is 'Brainwashing' by Roger Friedman, Wednesday, April 16, 2008 |publisher=Foxnews.com |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
The controversy about the existence of cultic brainwashing has become one of the most polarizing issues among cult followers, academic researchers of cults, and cult critics. Parties disagree about the existence of a social process attempting coercive influence, and also disagree about the existence of the social outcome—that people become influenced against their will.[tpl]cite web|author= J. Gordon Melton |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton.htm |title=Brainwashing and the Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory |publisher=Cesnur.org |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
One alleged example of the Church's possible brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned to work off alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent's Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Brainwashing%20in%20Scientology%27s%20Rehabilitation%20Project%20Force%20(RPF).htm | title = Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) | work = Revised Version of a Presentation at the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, San Diego , California November 7, 1997 | first = Stephen | last = Kent | date = 1998-08-26 | accessdate = 2008-12-07[/tpl] Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.[tpl]cite web|author=moreorless |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2002/scient_rpf_01.htm |title=The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force |publisher=Cesnur.org |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl]
Critics of Scientology have also accused L. Ron Hubbard of authoring “The Brainwashing Manual”, but these accusations have not been confirmed. Hubbard did publish a copy of this manual on two technical bulletins, “for the benefit of the auditors who may face victims of brainwashing”. Hubbard discussed brainwashing in several of his works, but these, “expose brainwashing as something that should not be practiced”, and “the practice of brainwashing could only end up in disaster”.[tpl]cite web|author=moreorless - www.moreorless.net |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2005/brainwash_13.htm |title=L.

====The Anderson Report====

The final results of the Anderson Report in 1965 declared:
 
 "The Board is not concerned to find that the scientology techniques are brainwashing techniques as practiced, so it is understood, in some communist-controlled countries. Scientology techniques are, nevertheless, a kind of brainwashing...The astonishing feature of Scientology is that its techniques and propagation resemble very closely those set out in a book entitled Brain-washing, advertised and sold by the HASI".Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology, by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C., Published 1965 by the State of Victoria, Australia.

===Disconnection===

The Church of Scientology has been criticized for their practice of "disconnection" in which Scientologists are directed to sever all contact with family members or friends who criticize the faith. Critics including ex-members and relatives of existing members say that this practice has divided many families.[tpl]cite web|author=Sarah Collerton |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/12/2844150.htm?section=justin |title=Scientology insider's nightmare childhood  |publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] The disconnection policy is considered by critics to be further evidence that the Church is a cult. By making its members entirely dependent upon a social network entirely within the organization, critics assert that Scientologists are kept from exposure to critical perspectives on the church and are put in a situation that makes it extremely difficult for members to leave the church, since apostates will be shunned by the Church and have already been cut off from family and friends.[tpl]cite web | first = Mark | last = Sommer | title = Outside critics are unacceptable | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/Articles/buffalo-news-2005-02-02.html | work = Buffalo News | date = 2005-02-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-07 [/tpl]
The Church of Scientology acknowledges that its members are strongly discouraged from associating with "enemies of Scientology", and likens the disconnection policy to the practice of shunning in religions such as the Amish. However, there is a consensus of religious scholars who oppose Scientology's practice:
“I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it, the policy hurts everybody.” J. Gordon Melton, Institute for the Study of American Religion, Santa Barbara, California.[tpl]cite news |author = Robert Farley |url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml |title = The unperson |publisher = St. Petersburg Times |date = 2006-06-24 |pages = 1A, 14A|accessdate = 2006-06-25[/tpl]
“It has to do with feeling threatened because you're not that big. You do everything you can to keep unity in the group.” Frank K. Flinn, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.
“Some people I've talked to, they just wanted to go on with their lives and they wanted to be in touch with their daughter or son or parent. The shunning was just painful. And I don't know what it was accomplishing. And the very terms they use are scary, aren't they?” Newton Maloney, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California

===Use of donations and preferential treatment of Scientologist celebrities===

Andre Tabayoyon, a former Scientologist and Sea Org staffer, testified in a 1994 affidavit that money from not-for-profit Scientology organizations and labor from those organizations (including the Rehabilitation Project Force) had gone to provide special facilities for Scientology celebrities, which were not available to other Scientologists:
"A Sea Org staffer...was taken along to do personal cooking for Tom Cruise and [tpl]interpolation|David[/tpl] Miscavige at the expense of Scientology not for profit religious organizations. This left only 3 cooks at Gold [tpl]interpolation|Base[/tpl] to cook for 800 people three times a day...apartment cottages were built for the use of John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, Edgar Winter, Priscilla Presley, and other Scientology celebrities who are carefully prevented from finding out the real truth about the Scientology organization ... Miscavige decided to redo the meadow in beautiful flowers; Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the project so that [tpl]interpolation|Tom[/tpl] Cruise and [tpl]interpolation|Nicole[/tpl] Kidman could romp there. However, Miscavige inspected the project and didn't like it. So the whole meadow was plowed up, destroyed, replowed and sown with plain grass."Tabayoyon, Andre. 1994. 'Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon.' In Church of Scientology International v. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz. United States District Court, Central District of California. Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), (4 April): 64 pp
Tabayoyon's account of the planting of the meadow was supported by another former Scientologist, Maureen Bolstad, who said that a couple of dozen Scientologists including herself were put to work on a rainy night through dawn on the project. "We were told that we needed to plant a field and that it was to help Tom impress Nicole...but for some mysterious reason it wasn't considered acceptable by Mr. Miscavige. So the project was rejected and they redid it".[tpl]cite news |author = Hoffman, Claire |coauthors = Christensen, Kim |url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-scientology18dec18,0,7000009,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title = Tom Cruise and Scientology |work = Los Angeles Times |date = 2005-12-18 |accessdate = 2006-11-14[/tpl]

==Legitimacy of Scientology as a religion==

The nature of Scientology is hotly debated in many countries. The Church of Scientology pursues an extensive public relations campaign arguing that Scientology is a bona fide religion. The organization cites a number of studies and experts who support their position.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bonafidescientology.org/ |title=Church of Scientology: The Bonafides of the Scientology Religion |publisher=Bonafidescientology.org |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] Critics point out that most cited studies were commissioned by Scientology to produce the desired results.
Many countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom), while not prohibiting or limiting the activities of the Church of Scientology, have rejected its applications for tax-exempt, charitable status or recognition as a religious organization; it has been variously judged to be a commercial enterprise or a dangerous cult.
Scientology is legally accepted as a religion in the United States and Australia, and enjoys the constitutional protections afforded to religious practice in each country. In October 1993, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service recognized the Church as an "organization operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes".http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-97-50.txt The Church offers the tax exemption as proof that it is a religion. (This subject is examined in the article on the Church of Scientology).
In 1982, the High Court of Australia ruled that the State Government of Victoria lacked the right to declare that the Church of Scientology was not a religion.Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner Of Pay-roll Tax (Vict.) 1983, 154 CLR 120 The Court found the issue of belief to be the central feature of religion, regardless of the presence of charlatanism: Charlatanism is a necessary price of religious freedom, and if a self-proclaimed teacher persuades others to believe in a religion which he propounds, lack of sincerity or integrity on his part is not incompatible with the religious character of the beliefs, practices and observances accepted by his followers."
Other countries to have recognized Scientology as a religion include Spain, Portugal,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100579.htm |title=2007 U.S. Department of State – 2007 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Portugal |publisher=State.gov |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] Italy,Italian Supreme Court decision, The Court of Appeals of Milan Decision Sweden,[tpl]cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F89B7B2ED266F3F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title = Scientology church in Sweden granted religious status |date = 2000-03-15 |accessdate = 2008-05-19 |agency = Associated Press[/tpl], [tpl]cite web |url = http://www.cesnur.org/testi/scient_sweden2000.htm |title = Decision of March 13, 2000 registering Scientology as a "religious community" in Sweden |date = 2000-03-13 |accessdate = 2007-07-21 |publisher = CESNUR[/tpl][ref]
