Meinhard Nehmer (born 13 January 1941 in Boblin near Pölitz, Pomerania, Germany) is an East German bobsledder who competed from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Competing in two Winter Olympics, he won four medals with three golds (Two-man: 1976, Four-man: 1976, 1980) and one bronze (Two-man: 1980). Nehmer also carried the East German flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck.
He also won four medals at the FIBT World Championships with one gold (Four-man: 1977), two silvers (Two-man: 1978, Four-man: 1979), and one bronze (Four-man: 1978).
Prior to his role in bobsleigh, Nehmer competed in athletics as a javelin thrower.
Retiring from bobsleigh in the early 1980s, Nehmer worked for the Volksmarine, rising to the rank of Commander (Fregattenkapitän in [tpl]de icon[/tpl]), before being forced out following German reunification in late 1990.
After that, Nehmer worked as a bobsleigh coach for Germany, Italy, and the United States. He retired from coaching after the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.
