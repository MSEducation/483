The site is bounded by Goods Station Road, Camden Road, Calverley Road and Grosvenor Road. Some of the shops in RVP have two entrances - one to the internal mall and one onto Camden Road (such as Next) or Calverley Road (such as Marks & Spencer and Topshop). The bus stops on Mount Pleasant Road are close to RVP.
A small part of the centre lies above the railway line between Tunbridge Wells and High Brooms stations.
