The Liberal People's Party ([tpl]lang-no|Det Liberale Folkepartiet[/tpl], DLF) was a social liberal political party in Norway, established because of a split in the Liberal Party over the issue of Norway's accession to the European Economic Community in 1972. The new party, formed by the pro-EEC minority of the Liberal Party, originally wanted to call itself the "Popular Party - New Left" (Folkepartiet Nye Venstre), but was denied the use of this name, as it was deemed too similar to the Liberal Party, which in Norway is called "Venstre" (literally "Left"). Instead, the party called itself the New People's Party (Det Nye Folkepartiet). The name was in 1980 however changed to the Liberal People's Party. 
At the time of the split, eight of the thirteen Liberal Party MPs joined the new party. At the 1973 parliamentary election, the Liberal People's Party however won merely one seat, from Hordaland (the Liberal Party won two seats). At the next election, in 1977, the Liberal People's Party lost this seat, and was never represented in Parliament again. The party's popularity declined throughout the 1980s. In the local elections in 1987 the two parties ran on common lists in several counties and municipalities. In 1988, it was decided to officially merge back together with the Liberal Party.
In 1992, some of the old members decided to recreate DLF, reviving the Liberal People's Party name. However, the new party was later taken over by a group of objectivists and former members of the Progress Party.
