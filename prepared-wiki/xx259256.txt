Methiopropamine (MPA) is a thiophene ring-based structural analog of methamphetamine originally reported in 1942.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01255a001 |year=1942 |last1=Blicke |first1=F. F. |last2=Burckhalter |first2=J. H. |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=477–80 |title=α-Thienylaminoalkanes[/tpl] Chemically it is not a phenethylamine or amphetamine and is not their functional analog either. It originally appeared for public sale in the UK in December 2010 as a "research chemical" or "legal high", recently branded as Blow.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=21770051 |year=2011 |last1=Angelov |first1=D |last2=O'Brien |first2=J |last3=Kavanagh |first3=P |title=The syntheses of 1-(2-thienyl)-2-(methylamino) propane (methiopropamine) and its 3-thienyl isomer for use as reference standards |doi=10.1002/dta.298 |journal=Drug testing and analysis |pages=145–9 |volume=5 |issue=3[/tpl] It has limited popularity as a recreational stimulant.Methiopropamine Thread at UKChemicalResearch.org[tpl]rs|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

Methiopropamine functions as a selective norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is approximately 1.85 times more selective for norepinephrine than dopamine. It is approximately one third as potent as dextroamphetamine as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and one fifth as much as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It displays negligible activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.006[/tpl]

==Metabolism==

For N-alkyl amphetamines deamination and N-dealkylation are the major elimination pathways and renal excretion is a minor one.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0009-8981(71)90187-2 |title=Deuterium isotope effects in the metabolism of n-alkylsubstituted amphetamines in man |year=1971 |last1=Vree |first1=T.B. |last2=Gorgels |first2=J.P.M.C. |last3=Muskens |first3=A.Th.J.M. |last4=Van Rossum |first4=J.M. |journal=Clinica Chimica Acta |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=333–44 |pmid=5113570[/tpl] 
Methiopropamine is metabolized into active thiopropamine, 4-hydroxymethiopropamine and thiophene S-oxides.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja962466g |title=Chemical and Biological Oxidation of Thiophene:  Preparation and Complete Characterization of Thiophene S-Oxide Dimers and Evidence for Thiophene S-Oxide as an Intermediate in Thiophene Metabolism in Vivo and in Vitro |year=1997 |last1=Treiber |first1=Alexander |last2=Dansette |first2=Patrick M. |last3=El Amri |first3=Hamid |last4=Girault |first4=Jean-Pierre |last5=Ginderow |first5=Daria |last6=Mornon |first6=Jean-Paul |last7=Mansuy |first7=Daniel |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=119 |issue=7 |pages=1565–71[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-291X(05)81594-3 |title=Evidence for thiophene-s-oxide as a primary reactive metabolite of thiophene in vivo: Formation of a dihydrothiophene sulfoxide mercapturic acid |year=1992 |last1=Dansette |first1=P.M. |last2=Thang |first2=Do Cao |last3=Mansuy |first3=H.

Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid should be the final major metabolic product. It is very hydrophilic and is excreted in urine. Methiopropamine and especially thiopropamine are also excreted renally, unchanged.

==Synthesis==

There is a four step synthesis of methiopropamine.  It begins with (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide, which is reacted with propylene oxide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropane which is reacted with phosphorus tribromide, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-bromopropane which is finally reacted with methylamine, yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/microgram-journals/2011/mj8-2_53-57.pdf |title=Methiopropamine: An Analytical Profile |first1=John F. |last1=Casale |first2=Patrick A. |last2=Hays |year=2011 |journal=Microgram Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=53–7[/tpl]

==Legality==

Methiopropamine is not explictly a controlled substance, however its legal status under the Federal Analog Act is not certain. It may be considered an analog of methamphetamine for legal purposes, although its structure differs more than previous successful prosecutions under the same law. It is explicitly illegal in the state of Florida and in Germany.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methiopropamine/methiopropamine_law.shtml|title=Methiopropamine (MPA)Legal Status|date=2013-09-24|accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl]
