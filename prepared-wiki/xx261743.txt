==History==

===Formation in World War II===

The Squadron was supplied with Leigh light equipped Wellingtons from a flight of No. 172 Squadron RAF on 1 September 1942.  It was then stationed at Gibraltar, before operating patrols from airfields in the United Kingdom including RAF Chivenor, RAF Benbecula, RAF Predannack and RAF St Eval in Cornwall. 
In November 1944 the squadron converted to Warwick aircraft and in February 1946 one element of the squadron (179X) converted to Lancasters, while 179Y retained the Warwicks before it was renumbered No. 210 Squadron RAF.  No 179 squadron was finally disbanded on 30 September 1946.
