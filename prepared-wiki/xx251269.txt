The current Trail is a segment of a [tpl]convert|38|mi|1|adj=on[/tpl] right-of-way that has been set aside for rail trail use.  The entire right-of-way connects Girard, Illinois, on the south end, to Athens, Illinois, at the north end.  The right-of-way spans the western half of Sangamon County in a north-south direction, and also traverses small sections of Macoupin County and Menard County.    
The right-of-way occupies an abandoned segment of the St. Louis, Peoria and North Western Railway, later consolidated into the Chicago and North Western Railroad.  The primary metropolitan area served is the greater Springfield, Illinois metropolitan area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sj-r.com/carousel/x1377000876/West-side-bike-trail-work-could-start-this-spring|title=West side bike trail work could start this spring|accessdate=2010-01-09 |work=Tim Landis |publisher=State Journal-Register|date=2010-01-07 [/tpl]
