August Ferdinand Möbius (17 November 1790 – 26 September 1868; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈmøːbi̯ʊs[/tpl]) was a German mathematician and theoretical astronomer.
He is best known for his discovery of the Möbius strip, a non-orientable two-dimensional surface with only one side when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It was independently discovered by Johann Benedict Listing around the same time. The Möbius configuration, formed by two mutually inscribed tetrahedra, is also named after him. Möbius was the first to introduce homogeneous coordinates into projective geometry.
Many mathematical concepts are named after him, including the Möbius transformations, important in projective geometry, and the Möbius transform of number theory.  His interest in number theory led to the important Möbius function μ(n) and the Möbius inversion formula. In Euclidean geometry, he systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.[ref]Howard Eves, A Survey of Geometry (1963), p. 64

Möbius was born in Schulpforta, Saxony-Anhalt, and was descended on his mother's side from religious reformer Martin Luther.[tpl]cite book |last=Szpiro |first=George |title=Poincaré's Prize: The Hundred-Year Quest to Solve One of Math's Greatest Puzzles |year=2007|publisher=Plume|page=66 |isbn=978-0-525-95024-0[/tpl] He studied mathematics under Carl Friedrich Gauss and Johann Pfaff. Möbius died in Leipzig in 1868 at the age of 77.
