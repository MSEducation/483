Throughout the band’s evolution, Jarvis has remained as its main composer and producer. Jarvis is a synaesthete and his compositions and productions are largely based upon his timbre-to-shape synaesthetic visions.Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomena where two senses are intermingled.

In the fall of 2008, at the request of Kevin Shields from My Bloody Valentine, the Flowers Of Hell opened for MBV on one of the eight North American dates of the MBV reunion tour. Shields had seen the group perform a number of times in London at popular nugaze nights such as Sonic Cathedral.
Notable events in the group's history have also included NASA's mission control staff in 2009 declaring their fandom and synchronizing The Flowers of Hell song Sympathy For Vengeance with fresh Discovery shuttle footage.[ref]
