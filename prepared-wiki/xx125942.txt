The Bavanište Monastery ([tpl]lang-sr|Манастир Баваниште or Manastir Bavanište[/tpl]) is a 15th-century Serb Orthodox monastery located in Bavanište, Kovin in northern Serbia (Banat, Vojvodina). 
It was founded in the 15th century and eventually deserted when the Ottoman Turks advanced, subsequently conquering most Balkan states. It was destroyed in 1716. It was rebuilt in 1856-58. In 1997 the monastery was renovated and reinstituted as a working monastery. A healthy water spring exists in the monastery.http://www.spcportal.org/index.php?pg=1429&lang=en
