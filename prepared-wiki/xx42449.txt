[[Ash Wednesday]]

CATEGORIES: Wednesday, Christian festivals and holy days, Moveable holidays (Easter date based)

Ash Wednesday, a day of fasting, is the first day of Lent in Western Christianity. It therefore occurs 46 days before Easter and can fall as early as February 4 or as late as March 10. Ash Wednesday is observed by many Christian denominations, including Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Anglicans, and Presbyterians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ash-wednesday-today-christians-observe-first-day-of-lent-115628/|title=Ash Wednesday Today, Christians Observe First Day of Lent|date=5 March 2014|last=Koonse|first=Emma|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=19 April 2014|quote=Although some denominations do not practice the application of ashes to the forehead as a mark of public commitment on Ash Wednesday, those that do include Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and some Baptist followers.[/tpl]
According to the canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus Christ spent 40 days fasting in the desert, where he endured temptation by Satan.[tpl]cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2870| title = What is Lent and why does it last forty days? |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 24 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071007102320/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2870| archivedate= 7 October 2007 | deadurl=--~~~~ no[/tpl] Lent originated as a mirroring of this, fasting 40 days as preparation for Easter. Every Sunday was seen as a commemoration of the Sunday of Christ's resurrection and so as a feast day on which fasting was inappropriate. Accordingly, Christians fasted from Monday to Saturday (6 days) during 6 weeks and from Wednesday to Saturday (4 days) in the preceding week, thus making up the number of 40 days.Scott P. Richert: How Are the 40 Days of Lent Calculated? Why Sundays don't count during Lent
Ash Wednesday derives its name from the practice of blessing ashes made from palm branches blessed on the previous year Palm Sunday, and placing them on the heads of participants to the accompaniment of the words "Repent, and believe in the Gospel" or "Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return".Roman Missal: Ash Wednesday

==Observances==

===Ashes===

Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday, either by being sprinkled over their heads or, more often, by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross.
The words used traditionally to accompany this gesture are:
[tpl]Quote|Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return. (Based on Genesis [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Genesis|3:19|ESV[/tpl]).[/tpl]
In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite, an alternative formula was introduced and given first place:
[tpl]Quote|Repent, and believe in the Gospel. (Mark [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:15|ESV[/tpl]).[/tpl]
The old formula, based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin,The biblical text does not have the words "remember that", nor the vocative noun "homo" (human being) that is included in the original Latin version of the formula. reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus, implicitly, of their need to repent in time.Richard P. Bucher, "The History and Meaning of Ash Wednesday" The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old.
Various manners of placing the ashes on worshippers' heads are in use within the Catholic Church, the two most common being to use the ashes to make a cross on the forehead and sprinkling the ashes over the crown of the head. Other methods may also be used, since no rules have been laid down. Although the account of Ælfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were "strewn" on the head, the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English-speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the Occasional Offices of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, a publication described as "noticeably Anglo-Catholic in character". In its ritual of "Blessing of Ashes", this states that "the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist; and after they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people."[tpl]cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/PNG/special_days.html#ash_wednesday|title=Ash Wednesday Blessing of Ashes |work=Occasional Office |publisher=Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl] The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England speaks generically of "The Imposition of Ashes", without speciifying the manner of applying them, and says nothing of blessing them.Church of England, Lent Material, p. 230 On Ash Wednesday, the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina, where, in accordance with the custom in Italy and many other countries, ashes are sprinkled on his head, not smudged on his forehead, and he places ashes on the heads of  others in the same way.Order of Preachers, "Ash Wednesday: Pope Francis Celebrates at Santa Sabina"
The Papua New Guinea Anglican ritual states that, after the blessing of the ashes, "the priest marks his own forehead and then the foreheads of the servers and congregation who come and kneel, or stand, where they normally receive the Blessed Sacrament." The corresponding Catholic ritual for celebration within Mass, given in the Roman Missal, merely states: "Then the Priest places ashes on the head  of those present who come to him, and says to each one ..." Pre-1970 editions had much more elaborate instructions about the order in which the participants were to receive the ashes, but again without any indication of the form of placing the ashes on the head.Tridentine Roman Missal, "Feria IV  Cinerum"
The 1969 revision of the Roman Rite inserted into the Mass the solemn ceremony of blessing ashes and placing them on heads, but also explicitly envisaged a similar solemn ceremony outside of Mass.Roman Missal, Ash Wednesday The Book of Blessings contains a simple rite. While the solemn rite would normally be carried out within a church building, the simple rite could appropriately be used almost anywhere. While only a priest or deacon may bless the ashes, laypeople may do the placing of the ashes on a person's head. Even in the solemn rite, lay men or women may assist the priest in distributing the ashes. In addition, laypeople take blessed ashes left over after the collective ceremony and place them on the head of the sick or of others who are unable to attend the blessing.Edward McNamara, "Laypeople Distributing Ashes" (ZENIT News Agency, 5 February 2008) (In 2014, Anglican Liverpool Cathedral likewise offered to impose ashes within the church without a solemn ceremony.)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolcathedral.org.uk/404/section.aspx/403/ashes_to_go_this_ash_wednesday_|title=Cathedral offers visitors ‘Ashes to Go’ this Ash Wednesday|date=27 February 2014|publisher=Liverpool Cathedral (Anglican)|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl]
In addition, those who attend such Catholic services, whether in a church or elsewhere, traditionally take blessed ashes home with them to place on the heads of other members of the family,Ash Wednesday in Ireland and it is recommended to have envelopes available to facilitate this practice. At home the ashes are then placed with little or no ceremony.
Unlike its discipline regarding sacraments, the Catholic Church does not exclude from receiving sacramentals, such as the placing of ashes on the head, those who are not Catholics and perhaps not even baptized.[tpl]cite web |work=Catholics United for the Faith |title=Responses to frequently asked questions regarding Lenten practices |url=http://www.cuf.org/2013/02/are-you-ready-for-lent/ [/tpl] Even those who have been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to celebrate sacramentals are not forbidden to receive them.Code of Canon Law, canon 1331 §1 2° After describing the blessing, the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes (within Mass) states: "Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him." Methodists have taken a more restrictive line, saying that ashes may be received by all who profess the Christian faith and are baptized.[tpl]cite web |work=First United Methodist Church |title=Pastor's Message: Ash Wednesday, An Invitation To Lent |date=28 February 2001 |url=http://www.gbgm-umc.org/fumc-wallingford/sermons/sermons01/2001_02_28.html[/tpl]
Ashes are distributed outside of church buildings also. Suggested venues for such Catholic celebrations include shopping centres, nursing homes, factories.Website of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin. Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture (at least one) and prayers, and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed.Order for the Blessing and Distribution of Ashes
Since 2007, members of major Christian denominations in the United States, including Anglicans, Baptists, and Methodists, have participated in the Ashes to Go programme, in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places, such as downtowns, sidewalks and train stations, to impose ashes on passersby,[tpl]cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-02-21/lent-ash-wednesday-ashes-to-go/53195664/1|title=Episcopal priests offer 'Ashes to Go' as Ash Wednesday begins Lent|last=Grossman|first=Cathy Lynn|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2 April 2014|quote=Dubbed Ashes to Go, it's a contemporary spin on the Ash Wednesday practice followed chiefly in Episcopal, Anglican, Catholic and Lutheran denominations.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/03/05/photo-slideshow-ashes-go-meets-commuters-washington-d-c/|title=‘Ashes to Go’ meets commuters in Washington, D.C.|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|date=5 March 2014|quote=Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and members of St. Paul’s Parish in Washington, D.C., imposed ashes on commuters and other passers-by on Ash Wednesday (March 5) near the Foggy Bottom Metro station in the nation’s capital.|publisher=Religion News Service|accessdate=2 April 2014[/tpl] even on people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rethinkchurch.org/article/got-ashes-chicago-church-takes-lent-streets|title=Got ashes?

It's symbolic.[/tpl] while a Church of England publication says they "may be made" from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year and a Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea publication says that the ashes "are made" in that way. These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than, for the Catholic liturgy, a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them. An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes with a small amount of holy water or olive oil as a fixative.[tpl]cite web |title=Lent and Easter |work=The Diocese of London |date=17 March 2004 |url=http://www.london.anglican.org/NewsShow_2653|quote=Ash Wednesday marks the first day of Lent, the period of forty days before Easter.

Where ashes are placed on the head by smudging the forehead with a sign of the cross, many Christians choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day. The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule, and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them;Scott P.

===Anglican Commination Office===

Robin Knowles Wallace states that the traditional Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 (the Miserere), prayers of confession and the sign of ashes.[tpl]cite book|last=Wallace|first=Robin Knowles|title=The Christian Year: A Guide for Worship and Preaching|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m_P7BUQZVvsC&pg=PT49|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=2010-10-01|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426731303|page=49|quote=The service for Ash Wednesday has traditionally included Psalm 51, prayers of confession and the sign of ashes, often in the shape of a cross.[/tpl] No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements. The Anglican Church's traditional Ash Wednesday service, titled A Commination,[tpl]cite book|last2=Mant|first2=Richard|title=The Book of Common Prayer: And Administration of the Sacraments, and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, According to the Use of the United Church of England and Ireland: Together with the Psalter Or Psalms of David, Pointed as They are to be Sung Or Said in Churches; and the Form and Manner of Making, Ordaining, and Consecrating of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons; and the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion: with Notes Explanatory, Practical and Historical, from Approved Writers of the Church of England|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=1825|publisher=W. Baxter|page=510[/tpl] contains the first two elements, but not the third. On the other hand, the Catholic Church's traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but, while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 (the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days, including Ash Wednesday) are a part of its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy, they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes. The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970, when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass, at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm. Coincidentally, it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite of ashes.
In the mid-16th century, the first Book of Common Prayer removed the ceremony of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England and replaced it with what would later be called the Commination Office.The Oxford Guide to The Book of Common Prayer (Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 978-0-19972389-8), p. 584 In that 1549 edition, the rite was headed: "The First Day of Lent: Commonly Called Ash-Wednesday".[tpl]cite book|last2=Mant|first2=Richard|title=The Book of Common Prayer: And Administration of the Sacraments, and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, According to the Use of the United Church of England and Ireland: Together with the Psalter Or Psalms of David, Pointed as They are to be Sung Or Said in Churches; and the Form and Manner of Making, Ordaining, and Consecrating of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons; and the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion: with Notes Explanatory, Practical and Historical, from Approved Writers of the Church of England|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=1825|publisher=W. Baxter|location=Oxford|page=506[/tpl] The ashes ceremony was not forbidden, but was not included in the church's official liturgy and fell into complete disuse by the early 17th century. Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners, to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen.John Brand, Sir Henry Ellis, James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps, Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain (Bell & Daldy, 1873), vol. 1, p. 98"Commination" in Elizabeth A. Livingstone (editor), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2013 ISBN 978-0-19965962-3) The text of the "Commination or Denouncing of God's Anger and Judgments against Sinners" begins: "In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again, (which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time (in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences of God's cursing against impenitent sinners".Full text at the website of the Church of England In line with this, Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of The Commination was due to a desire of the reformers "to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church", but he added that this primitive practice "was indeed occasionally practised, at least until the latter part of the eighteenth century". He also said that "the sentences of the greater excommunication" within The Commination[tpl]What|date=April 2014|reason=what "sentences of the greater excommunication" are included in the Commination Office?[/tpl] corresponded to those in "the ancient services".[tpl]what|date=April 2014|reason="ancient services" perhaps applies to the late medieval practice is England of reading a list of sins for which latae sententiae excommunication was imposed, but the phrase, especially in the vicinity of a mention of "the primitive Church", might seem to refer to early Christianity and so requires clarification[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Maude|first=Joseph Hooper|title=The History of the Book of Common Prayer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n7cNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110|accessdate=12 April 2014|year=1901|publisher=E.S. Gorham|language=English|page=110|quote=The Commination. This service was composed in 1549. In the ancient services there was nothing that corresponded at all nearly to the first part of this service, except the sentences of the greater excommunication, which were commonly read in parish churches three or four times a year. Some of the reformers were very anxious to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church, which was indeed occasionally practised, at least until the latter part of the eighteenth century, and they put forward this service as a sort of substitute. The Miserere and most of what follows was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday.[/tpl] The Anglican Church's Ash Wednesday liturgy, he wrote, also traditionally included the Miserere, which, along with "what follows" in the rest of the service  (lesser Litany, Lord's Prayer, three prayers for pardon and final blessing), "was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday". From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes.Sylvia A. Sweeney, An Ecofeminist Perspective on Ash Wednesday and Lent (Peter Lang 2010 ISBN 978-1-43310739-9), pp. 107-110Bernard Reynolds, Handbook to the Book of Common Prayer (Рипол Классик ISBN 978-58-7386158-3), p. 431 In the Sarum Rite, the Miserere psalm was simply one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony, while of the much more numerous prayers in that rite only three were imitated in the Commination text, stripped of all reference to ashes.The Sarum Missal in English (Church Press Company 1868), pp. 52-27  These three prayers were kept when the Episcopal Church USA decided to omit the Commination Office.

===Low church ceremonies===

In some of the low church traditions, other practices are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned.[tpl]cite web |title=What is the significance of ashes being placed on the forehead on Ash Wednesday? |work=The United Methodist Church |url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2871 [/tpl]

==Biblical significance of ashes==

Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief. When Tamar was raped by her half-brother, "she sprinkled ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying" ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Samuel|13:19|GNT[/tpl]). The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults. In Job [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Job|42:3–6|KJV[/tpl], Job says to God: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying: "O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, roll in the ashes" (Jer 6:26). The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God: "I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes" (Daniel 9:3). Just prior to the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the Maccabees, prepared for battle using ashes: "That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes" (1 Maccabees 3:47; see also 4:39).
Examples of the practice among Jews are found in several other books of the Bible, including Numbers [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Numbers|19:9|HE[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Numbers|19:17|HE[/tpl], Jonah [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Jonah|3:6|HE[/tpl], Book of Esther [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Esther|4:1|ESV[/tpl], and Hebrews [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|9:13|KJV[/tpl]. Jesus himself is quoted as speaking of the practice in Matthew [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:21|ESV[/tpl] and Luke [tpl]bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:13|ESV[/tpl]: "If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago (sitting) in sackcloth and ashes."

==Christian use of ashes==

Christians continued the practice of using ashes as an external sign of repentance. Tertullian (c. 160 – c. 225) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in sackcloth and ashes.Tertullian, On Repentance, chapter 9 The historian Eusebius (c. 260/265 – 339/340) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion.Church History, book 5, chapter 28:12
John W Fenton writes that "by the end of the 10th century, it was customary in Western Europe (but not yet in Rome) for all the faithful to receive ashes on the first day of the Lenten fast. In 1091, this custom was then ordered by Pope Urban II at the council of Benevento to be extended to the church in Rome. Not long after that, the name of the day was referred to in the liturgical books as “Feria Quarta Cinerum” (i.e., Ash Wednesday)."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antiochian.org/content/orthodox-ash-wednesday|title=Orthodox Ash Wednesday ||last=Fenton|first=John W|year=2013|publisher=Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate|language=English[/tpl]
The public penance that grave sinners underwent before being admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent, on the first day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in sackcloth. When, towards the end of the first millennium, the discipline of public penance was dropped, the beginning of Lent, seen as a general penitential season, was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all.Encyclopæædia Britannica, "Ash Wednesday"  This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century.Fr Saunders, "What do the ashes mean?" About two centuries later, Ælfric of Eynsham, an Anglo-Saxon abbot, wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent.''The Lives of the Saints: "We read in the books both in the Old Law and in the New that the men who repented of their sins bestrewed themselves with ashes and clothed their bodies with sackcloth. Now let us do this little at the beginning of our Lent that we strew ashes upon our heads to signify that we ought to repent of our sins during the Lenten fast."The Lives of the Saints: https://archive.org/details/aelfricslivesof01aelf.
The article on Ash Wednesday in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica says that, after the Protestant Reformation, the ashes ceremony was not forbidden in the Church of England, a statement that may explain the claim by Blair Meeks that the Anglican tradition "never lapsed in this observance".[tpl]cite book|last=Meeks|first=Blair Gilmer|title=Season of Ash and Fire: Prayers and Liturgies for Lent and Easter|accessdate=17 April 2014|year=2003|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9780687044542|page=107|quote=In recent years Christians from the Reformed branch of the Protestant tradition have begun to recover a practice that dates in the Western church at least to the tenth century. That is to begin Lent on the Wednesday before the First Sunday in Lent with a service of repentance and commitment, including the imposition of ashes.

==Lent==

Ash Wednesday marks the start of a 40-day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to fast and pray. During this time he was tempted. [tpl]bibleref|Matthew|4:1–11[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref|Mark|1:12–13[/tpl], and [tpl]bibleref|Luke|4:1–13[/tpl].[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?art=5554&l=en | publisher=Asia News.it | date= 3 May 2006 | title=Lent with Jesus in the desert to fight the spirit of evil| quote=Turning to the gospel of the day, which is about Jesus' 40 days in the desert, "where he overcame the temptations of Satan" (cfr Mk 1:12–13), Pope Benedict XVI exhorted Christians to follow "their Teacher and Lord to face together with Him 'the struggle against the spirit of evil'." He said: "The desert is rather an eloquent metaphor of the human condition."[/tpl] While not specifically instituted in the Bible text, the 40-day period of repentance is also analogous to the 40 days during which Moses repented and fasted in response to the making of the Golden calf. (Jews today follow a 40-day period of repenting in preparation for and during the High Holy Days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur.)

==Fast and abstinence==

In the Catholic Church, Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting, abstinence from meat, and repentance—a day of contemplating one's transgressions. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer also designates Ash Wednesday as a day of fasting. In the medieval period, Ash Wednesday was the required annual day of penitential confession occurring after fasting and the remittance of the tithe. In other Christian denominations these practices are optional, with the main focus being on repentance. On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 (whose health enables them to do so) are permitted to consume only one full meal, which may be supplemented by two smaller meals, which together should not equal the full meal. Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations demanded by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat (mammals and fowl), as are all Fridays during Lent.1983 Code of Canon Law, canon 1251 Some Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] as was the Church's traditional requirement,''1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 1252 §§2–3 concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil.
As the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday comes the day after Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the last day of the Carnival season. Dutch tradition holds the custom to eat salted herring on Ash Wednesday to conclude the carnival in the Netherlands.

==Dates==

Ash Wednesday is a moveable fast, occurring 46 days before Easter. In future years Ash Wednesday will occur on these dates:
{{#ifexpr:[tpl]#time:Ymd|[tpl]LOCALTIME[/tpl][/tpl] 
The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is February 4 (in a common year with Easter on March 22), which happened in 1573, 1668, 1761 and 1818 and will next occur in 2285. The latest date is March 10 (when Easter Day falls on April 25) which occurred in 1546, 1641, 1736, 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038. Ash Wednesday has never occurred on Leap Year Day (February 29), and it will not occur as such until 2096. The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on February 29 are 2468, 2688, 2840 and 2992. (Ash Wednesday falls on February 29 only if Easter is on April 15 in a leap year.)

==Observing denominations==

These Christian denominations are among those that mark Ash Wednesday with a particular liturgy or church service.
The Eastern Orthodox Church does not, in general, observe Ash Wednesday; instead, Orthodox Great Lent begins on Clean Monday. There are, however, a relatively small number of Orthodox Christians who follow the Western Rite; these do observe Ash Wednesday, although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations, as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of Pascha, which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter.
