[[Management of multiple sclerosis]]

CATEGORIES: Autoimmune diseases, Multiple sclerosis, Medical treatments, Neurological disorders

Several therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) exist, although there is no known cure. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS).
The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.
The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.
This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; borderline forms of MS have particular treatments that are excluded.

==Acute attacks==

Administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established efficacy in promoting a faster recovery from disability after an attack.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, et al. |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

==Disease-modifying treatments==

As of April 2013, eight disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Japanese PMDA.
The approved drugs with their trademarks are interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif, CinnoVex, ReciGen), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), natalizumab (Tysabri),  fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio)[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm226755.htm|title=FDA approves first oral drug to reduce MS relapses  |publisher=US FDA |date=22 September 2010|accessdate=21 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm319277.htm |title=FDA approves new multiple sclerosis treatment Aubagio |publisher=US FDA|date=12 September 2012 | accessdate=21 January 2013[/tpl] and dimethyl fumarate (BG12, Tecfidera).[tpl]cite news|title=Biogen Idec's TECFIDERA™ (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved in US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1801165|date=27 March 2013|agency=Biogen Idec Press Release[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=NDA 204063 - FDA Approved Labeling Text |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/204063lbl.pdf |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency [/tpl] [tpl]cite web  |title=NDA Approval |date=27 March 2013 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2013/204063Orig1s000ltr.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2013 |publisher=US Food and Drug Agency [/tpl]

===Description of the drugs===

In 1993 interferon beta-1b was the first drug to ever be approved for MS, being soon followed by interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lublin|first=F|title=History of modern multiple sclerosis therapy.|journal=Journal of neurology|date=September 2005|volume=252 Suppl 3|pages=iii3-iii9|pmid=16170498|doi=10.1007/s00415-005-2010-6[/tpl] Interferon beta-1a is injected either weekly (intramuscular injection) or three times a week (subcutaneous injection) depending on commercial formulations,Interferon beta-1a Intramuscular Injection.

Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival.
Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random polymers of four amino acids which is antigenically similar to the myelin basic protein, a component of the myelin sheath of nerves with which it competes for presentation to T cells . It is injected subcutaneously on a daily basis.[tpl]cite journal|authors=Arnon, R., & Aharoni|title=Mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate in multiple sclerosis and its potential for the development of new applications|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2004|volume=101|pages=14593–14598[/tpl]Glatiramer injection.

Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant also used in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone.Natalizumab Injection.

In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell.[tpl]cite journal|authors=Zeyda M, Poglitsch M, Geyeregger R, Smolen JS, Zlabinger GJ, Hörl WH, Waldhäusl W, Stulnig TM, Säemann MD|title=Disruption of the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells by the active leflunomide metabolite teriflunomide: involvement of impaired integrin activation and immunologic synapse formation|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2005|volume=52|issue=9|pages=2730[/tpl] Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose.[tpl]cite book|title=Gylenya medication guide|year=2012|publisher=Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation|url=http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/cs/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/gilenya.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2013|page=2|format=pdf|month=May[/tpl] In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing drug), was approved by the FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.
Another oral drug, cladribine, was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of the promising efficacy of the drug. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications.[tpl]cite journal|last=Comi|first=G|coauthors=Hartung, HP; Kurukulasuriya, NC; Greenberg, SJ; Scaramozza, M|title=Cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.|journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy|date=January 2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=123–36|pmid=23256518|doi=10.1517/14656566.2013.754012[/tpl]
Most of these drugs are approved only for Relapsing-Remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

====Side effects====

Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous necrosis.  They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop.
Interferons, a subclass of cytokines, are produced in the body during illnesses such as influenza in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches.[tpl]cite journal|last=Eccles|first=R|title=Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.|journal=The Lancet infectious diseases|date=November 2005|volume=5|issue=11|pages=718–25|pmid=16253889|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70270-X[/tpl] Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines.[tpl]cite journal|last=Walther|first=EU|coauthors=Hohlfeld, R|title=Multiple sclerosis: side effects of interferon beta therapy and their management.|journal=Neurology|date=10 November 1999|volume=53|issue=8|pages=1622–7|pmid=10563602[/tpl] This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.
Glatiramer acetate is generally well tolerated.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carter|first=Natalie J.|coauthors=Keating, Gillian M.|title=Glatiramer Acetate|journal=Drugs|date=1 August 2010|volume=70|issue=12|pages=1545–1577|doi=10.2165/11204560-000000000-00000|pmid=20687620[/tpl] The most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin problem is a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require of additional treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678 |editor1-last=Munari |editor1-first=Luca M.[/tpl]
Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fox EJ |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clinical therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013[/tpl]
Heart problems (mainly systolic dysfunction) appear in over 10% of patients, while leukemia prevalence is 0.8%.[tpl]cite journal|last=Marriott|first=J. J.|coauthors=Miyasaki, J. M.; Gronseth, G.; O'Connor, P. W.|title=Evidence Report: The efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone (Novantrone) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: Report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal=Neurology|date=3 May 2010|volume=74|issue=18|pages=1463–1470|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181dc1ae0|pmid=20439849|pmc=2871006[/tpl]
Soon after its approval natalizumab was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).[tpl]cite journal|last=Kappos|first=L|coauthors=Bates, D; Edan, G; Eraksoy, M; Garcia-Merino, A; Grigoriadis, N; Hartung, HP; Havrdová, E; Hillert, J; Hohlfeld, R; Kremenchutzky, M; Lyon-Caen, O; Miller, A; Pozzilli, C; Ravnborg, M; Saida, T; Sindic, C; Vass, K; Clifford, DB; Hauser, S; Major, EO; O'Connor, PW; Weiner, HL; Clanet, M; Gold, R; Hirsch, HH; Radü, EW; Sørensen, PS; King, J|title=Natalizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis: updated recommendations for patient selection and monitoring.|journal=Lancet neurology|date=August 2011|volume=10|issue=8|pages=745–58|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70149-1|pmid=21777829[/tpl] PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all  in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.
During clinical trials fingolimod gave rise to side effects such as hypertension and bradycardia, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or reduction in lymphocite levels. Teriflunomide is considered a very safe drug. Nevertheless there have been reports of liver failure, and PML. Teriflunomide is also known to be dangerous for fetal development. Most common secondary effects of dimethyl fumarate during clinical trials were flushing and  gastrointestinal problems. These problems were generally mild and occurred more frequently during the first month of treatment. While dimethyl fumarate leads to a reduction in white blood cell count and levels should be monitored in patients, there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during the clinical trials. Moreover, fumaric acid is also used to treat psoriasis, another autoinmune disorder, and there is long term safety data from over 14 years of use without any indication of further dangerous secondary effects.

===Clinically isolated syndrome===

The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5[/tpl] Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bates|first=D|title=Treatment effects of immunomodulatory therapies at different stages of multiple sclerosis in short-term trials.|journal=Neurology|date=4 January 2011|volume=76|issue=1 Suppl 1|pages=S14-25|pmid=21205678|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182050388[/tpl]

===Relapsing-remitting MS===

Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon.  One of the factors related to non-respondance is the presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing  antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of  neutralizing  antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients.[tpl]cite journal|last=Plosker|first=Greg L.|title=Interferon-β-1b|journal=CNS Drugs|date=1 January 2011|volume=25|issue=1|pages=67–88|doi=10.2165/11206430-000000000-00000|pmid=21128695[/tpl] Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called "rapidly worsening MS" are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab.[tpl]cite journal |author=Boster A, Edan G, Frohman E, Javed A, Stuve O, Tselis A, Weiner H, Weinstock-Guttman B, Khan O |title=Intense immunosuppression in patients with rapidly worsening multiple sclerosis: treatment guidelines for the clinician |journal= Lancet neurology|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 173–83|year=2008 |pmid=18207115 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70020-6[/tpl]
Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halfs the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Comi G |title=Treatment of multiple sclerosis: role of natalizumab |journal=Neurol. Sci. |volume=Suppl 2 |issue= S2|pages=S155–8 |series=30 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19882365 |doi=10.1007/s10072-009-0147-2 [/tpl]
There are no official guidelines yet on the use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development.[tpl]cite journal|last=Killestein|first=Joep|coauthors=Rudick, Richard A; Polman, Chris H|title=Oral treatment for multiple sclerosis|journal=The Lancet Neurology|date=1 November 2011|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1026–1034|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70228-9|pmid=22014437[/tpl] While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially one of the most interesting oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.
While more studies of the long-term effects of the drugs are needed, specially for the newest treatments,[tpl]cite journal|last=He|first=D|coauthors=Xu, Z; Dong, S; Zhang, H; Zhou, H; Wang, L; Zhang, S|title=Teriflunomide for multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD009882|pmid=23235682|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009882.pub2[/tpl] existing data on the effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Freedman|first=M. S.|title=Long-term follow-up of clinical trials of multiple sclerosis therapies|journal=Neurology|date=27 December 2010|volume=76|issue=1, Supplement 1|pages=S26–S34|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318205051d|pmid=21205679[/tpl]
Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and many suffer subsequent disability.

===Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS===

Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.
Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2 |editor1-last=Martinelli Boneschi |editor1-first=Filippo[/tpl] In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing  MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.[tpl]cite cochrane|last=La Mantia|first=L|coauthors=Vacchi, L; Di Pietrantonj, C; Ebers, G; Rovaris, M; Fredrikson, S; Filippini, G|title=Interferon beta for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=18 January 2012|issue=1|review=CD005181|pmid=22258960[/tpl]

===Primary progressive MS===

Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole.Riluzole. US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (1 April 2003). Retrieved on 2 September 2007. PPMS patients have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leary SM, Thompson AJ |title=Primary progressive multiple sclerosis: current and future treatment options |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=369–76 |year=2005 |pmid=15907149 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200519050-00001[/tpl]

==Managing the effects of MS==

Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.
Both drug therapy and neurorehabilitation have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9[/tpl]

In regards to well-being, physical therapy focused on gait training can be vital to maximizing MS patient participation via reduction of fatigue during walking and activities of daily living (ADLs).Sacco, R., Bussman, R., Oesch, P., Kesselring, J., & Beer, S. (2011). Assessment of gait parameters and fatigue in MS patients during inpatient rehabilitation: a pilot trial. Journal of Neurology, 258:  889-894. Most gait training is performed over-ground (i.e., in a gym room or outside on uneven ground), on treadmills or, less commonly, using robotic-assisted devices.  Robotic-assisted body weight-supported treadmill training may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking impairments.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vaney C., Gattlen B., Lugon-Moulin V., Meichtry A., Hausammann R., Foinant D., Anchisi-Bellwald A.M., Palaci C., Hilfiker R. et al. | year = 2012 | title = Robotic-assisted step training (lokomat) not superior to equal intensity of over-ground rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Neurorehabiliation and Neural Repair | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 212–21 [/tpl]  In contrast, over-ground gait training may be most effective in improving gait speed in MS patients with less severe impairments.  Equine-assisted therapies such as therapeutic horseback riding and hippotherapy are additional treatments that can positively influence gait,[tpl]cite journal | author = Muñoz-Lasa S., Ferriero G., Valero R., Gomez-Muñiz F., Rabini A., Varela E. | year = 2011 | title = Effect of therapeutic horseback riding on balance and gait of people with multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = G Ital Med Lav Ergon | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 462–7 [/tpl] balance and quality of life in people with MS.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bronson C., Brewerton K., Ong J., Palanca C., Sullivan S.J. | year = 2010 | title = Does hippotherapy improve balance in persons with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review | url = | journal = European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 347–53 [/tpl]

Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training,[tpl]cite journal|author=Dalgas U, Stenager E, Jakobsen J et al.|title=Resistance training improves muscle strength and functional capacity in multiple sclerosis|journal=Neurology|year=2009|volume=73|pages=1478–1484|pmid= 19884575|issue=18|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181bf98b4 [/tpl] walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.
An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Davis|first=SL|coauthors=Wilson, TE, White, AT, Frohman, EM|title=Thermoregulation in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)|date=November 2010|volume=109|issue=5|pages=1531–7|pmid=20671034|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00460.2010|pmc=2980380[/tpl] The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.

===Medical treatments for symptoms===

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician.
Unfortunately, other symptoms, such as ataxia, tremor or sensory losses, do not have proven treatments.

==Therapies under investigation==

Research directions on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and the search for effective symptomatic treatments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen JA |title=Emerging therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=66 |issue=7 |pages=821–8 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19597083 |doi=10.1001/archneurol.2009.104 |url=[/tpl]
Advances during the last decades has led to the recent approval of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miller AE |title=Multiple sclerosis: where will we be in 2020? |journal=Mt. Sinai J. Med. |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=268–79 |year=2011 |pmid=21425270 |doi=10.1002/msj.20242 |url=[/tpl] Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones.[tpl]cite news|last=Jeffrey|first=susan|title=CONCERTO: A Third Phase 3 Trial for Laquinimod in MS|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/768902|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Medscape Medical News|date=9 August 2012[/tpl] Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kieseier BC, Calabresi PA |title=PEGylation of interferon-β-1a: a promising strategy in multiple sclerosis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=205–14 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22201341 |doi=10.2165/11596970-000000000-00000 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Biogen Idec|title=Biogen Idec Announces Positive Top-Line Results from Phase 3 Study of Peginterferon Beta-1a in Multiple Sclerosis-Press release|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1777510|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=24 January 2013[/tpl] Request for approval of peginterferon beta-1a is expected during 2013.
Monoclonal antibodies, which are drugs of the same family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of interest and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS.[tpl]cite journal |author=Saidha S, Eckstein C, Calabresi PA |title=New and emerging disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1247 |issue= |pages=117–37 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22224673 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06272.x |url=[/tpl] Nevertheless their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.
Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs.[tpl]cite journal |author=Milo R, Panitch H |title=Combination therapy in multiple sclerosis |journal=J. Neuroimmunol. |volume=231 |issue=1-2 |pages=23–31 |date=February 2011 |pmid=21111490 |doi=10.1016/j.jneuroim.2010.10.021 |url=[/tpl] The main rationale for polytherapy in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms of the disease and therefore their use is not necessarily exclusive. Moreover  synergies, in which a drug potentiates the effect of another are also possible. Nevertheless there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects. While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS.
Finally, regarding neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as stem cell therapy, while their research is considered of high importance at the moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches.[tpl]cite journal |author=Luessi F, Siffrin V, Zipp F |title=Neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis: novel treatment strategies |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1061–76; quiz 1077 |date=September 2012 |pmid=23039386 |doi=10.1586/ern.12.59 |url=http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/ern.12.59[/tpl] Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.
In 2008, vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves a vascular process he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media "liberation procedure" to correct it and claimed that 73% of participants improved.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, et al. |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J.
