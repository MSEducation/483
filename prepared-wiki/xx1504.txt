[[Clade]]

CATEGORIES: Phylogenetics, Words coined in the 1950s, Philosophy of biology

A clade (from Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|κλάδος[/tpl], klados, "branch") or monophylum (see monophyletic) is a group consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants, a single "branch" on the "tree of life".[tpl]cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245[/tpl] The ancestor may be an individual, a population or even a species (extinct or extant). Many familiar groups, rodents and insects for example, are clades; others, like lizards and monkeys, are not (lizards excludes snakes, monkeys excludes apes and humans). thumb|right|334 px|Cladogram (family tree) of a biological group. The red and blue boxes at right and left represent clades (i.e., complete branches). The green box in the middle is not a clade, but rather represents an evolutionary grade, an incomplete group, because the blue clade at left is descended from it, but is excluded. Increasingly, taxonomists try to avoid naming taxa that are not clades.

==Etymology==

The term "clade" was coined in 1957 by the biologist Julian Huxley to refer to the result of cladogenesis, a concept Huxley borrowed from Bernhard Rensch.[tpl]cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J.

==Definitions==

===Clade and ancestor===

A clade is by definition monophyletic, meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.[ref]
A semantic case has been made that the name should be "holophyletic," but this term has not acquired widespread use.

Taxa. |url=http://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/art1-3.html|year=2010|accessdate=22 September 2012[/tpl][ref]
</ref> The ancestor can be known or unknown; any and all members of a clade can be extant or extinct.

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called phylogenetics or cladistics, the latter term being derived from "clade" by Ernst Mayr (1965). The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called cladograms; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|coauthors=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other "Phylogenetic Systematics"|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x/pdf[/tpl]
Three methods of defining clades are featured in phylogenetic nomenclature: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based (see here for detailed definitions).

==Terminology==

The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:

==Nomenclature and taxonomy==

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-Darwinian Linnaean taxonomy, which was based by necessity only on internal or external morphological similarities between organisms – although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original Systema Naturae (notably among the vertebrate groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of convergent evolution is however responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.
With the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, the idea was born that groups used in a system of classification should represent branches on the evolutionary tree of life. In the century and a half since then, taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution. When it comes to naming, however, this principle is not always compatible with the traditional rank-based nomenclature. In the latter, only taxa associated with a rank can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades; also, taxon names cannot be defined in a way that guarantees them to refer to clades. For these and other reasons, phylogenetic nomenclature has been developed; it is still controversial.
