[[Falcipennis]]

CATEGORIES: Tetraonidae, Bird genera

Falcipennis is a genus of birds in the grouse family that comprises two very similar species:
Both inhabit northern coniferous forests and live on conifer needles during the winter.  Both have breeding systems with dispersed male territories, intermediate between the leks of some grouse and the monogamy of others (Storch and Bendell 2003).

==Etymology==

Falcipennis means "sickle-winged" in New Latin; the wings are swept back in flight (Holloway 2003).
