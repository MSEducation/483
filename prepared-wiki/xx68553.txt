City of Colorado Springs Municipal Airport [tpl]airport codes|COS|KCOS|COS[/tpl] (also known as Colorado Springs Airport) is a city-owned public civil-military airport 6 miles (10 km) southeast of Colorado Springs, in El Paso County, Colorado. It is the second busiest airport in the state. The airport is co-located with Peterson Air Force Base which is on the north side of runway 12/30.

==History==

In 1927 the airport opened on 640 acres (2.6 km²) seven miles east of the city, with two gravel runways. In the late 1930s the first scheduled airline flight went from El Paso, Texas, through Pueblo, Colorado Springs, to Denver and back.  The first municipal terminal was built in 1942 in an art deco style.  Soon after the terminal was built the field was taken over by the military in the months preceding World War II. After the war, the city regained control. 
In 1966 a new terminal was built on the west side of the runways, just east of Powers Boulevard. This terminal expanded by the 1980s, with a six gate addition. By 1991 the airport had three [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide runways, one [tpl]convert|13501|ft|m[/tpl] long, making it the longest runway in Colorado until 16R/34L, a [tpl]convert|16000|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] runway, opened at Denver International Airport in September 2003. In 1991 the city approved a new terminal, two miles east of the former terminal, in the south-center part of the airport. The [tpl]convert|280000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] terminal opened on October 22, 1994 with 12 gates; it was designed by the Van Sant Group and cost $140 million.Colorado Springs Airport – Colorado Springs Airport History
In the 1990s a second, 5-gate concourse was added on the east side of the main terminal.

==Operations==

Through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s the airport tried to expand service. The largest number of passengers was nearly 5 million in 1996 when now-defunct Western Pacific Airlines had a hub at COS (they moved it to Denver International Airport in late 1996). Their timetable for 15 June shows 33 daily departures to 20 airports between the west coast and Newark and Washington Dulles. (All their flights left from or landed at COS.)
Colorado Springs now has non-stop flights to 11 U.S. cities. Most are hubs, but Colorado Springs has had sporadic flights to non-hub cities.

==Facilities and aircraft==

The airport covers [tpl]convert|7,200|acre|ha[/tpl] and has three paved runways: 17L/35R, 13,501 x 150 ft (4,115 x 46 m) long, 17R/35L, 11,022 x 150 ft (3,360 x 46 m) and 12/30, 8,269 x 150 ft (2,520 x 46 m).  
Reached via Milton Proby Parkway, the terminal consists of two concourses. However only one, the larger concourse housing gates 1–12, has ever been put to commercial use; the second concourse (called the Western Pacific Airlines concourse) contains gates 14–18 (there is no gate 13.), and is now mainly used for meetings. Access between the concourses requires leaving the secure area, walking through the main terminal and down a long hallway.
Since September 2011 the airport terminal has been under renovation, that includes reconstruction of the TSA checkpoint to support full body scanners, expansion of office space behind the ticket counters, and new facilities for automated baggage screening.
Repairs to runway 17L/35R, first scheduled for 2011 but delayed by the FAA shutdown, will begin in spring 2012.
In the year ending September 30, 2013 the airport had 138,326 aircraft operations, an average of 378 per day: 58% general aviation, 18% air taxi, 14% scheduled commercial and 11% military. 292 aircraft were then based at the airport: 50% single-engine, 22% multi-engine, 12% jet, 1% helicopter and 16% military.
