The Aquatic Hall of Fame and Museum of Canada was located in the Pan Am Pool in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It closed in 2006.
The Museum was the oldest incorporated sports museum in Canada and had exhibits on swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo. It recognized athletes and coaches who have competed in the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Pan American Games and World championships.
The artifacts have been placed in storage in the hope that a new location will host the museum.
