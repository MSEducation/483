A secosteroid is a molecule similar to a steroid but with a "broken" ring. The word is from verb [tpl]lang-lat|secare[/tpl] = to cut,[tpl]cite book|last=Ayers|page=241[/tpl] - [tpl]lang-lat|stere[/tpl] "solid, three-dimensional",[tpl]cite book|last=Ayers|page=129[/tpl] - oid, from [tpl]lang-grc|ειδος, eidos[/tpl] "form".[tpl]cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-oid|accessdate=February 20, 2013[/tpl]   
Secosteroids are very similar in structure to steroids except that two of the B-ring carbon atoms (C9 and 10) of the typical four steroid rings are not joined, whereas in steroids they are.  
In humans, a well known secosteroid is vitamin D.
