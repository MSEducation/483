The term boot refers to a family of instruments of torture and interrogation variously designed to cause crushing injuries to the foot and/or leg. The boot has taken many forms in various places and times. Common varieties include the Spanish boot and the Malay boot. One type was made of four pieces of narrow wooden board nailed together. The boards were measured to fit the victim's leg. Once the leg was enclosed, wedges would be hammered between the boards, creating pressure. The pressure would be increased until the victim confessed or lost consciousness. Newer variants have included iron visessometimes armed with spikesthat squeezed feet and metal frames employed red-hot.

==Spanish boot==

The Spanish boot was an iron casing for the leg and foot. Wood or iron wedges were hammered in between the casing and the victim's flesh. A similar device, commonly referred to as a shin crusher, squeezed the calf between two curved iron plates, studded with spikes, teeth, and knobs, to fracture the tibia and fibula.[tpl]cite book |last=McCall |first=Andrew |title=The Medieval Underworld |location=London |year=1979 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=978-0-7509-3727-6 |oclc=56009769[/tpl]
Primitive forerunners of the archetype can be found dating back as far as a thousand years. The first Scottish effortalso referred to as a buskinmade use of a vaguely boot-shaped rawhide garment that was soaked with water, drawn over the foot and lower leg, and bound in place with cords. The contraption was slowly heated over a gentle fire, drastically contracting the rawhide and squeezing the foot until the bones were dislocated, though there would not have been sufficient pressure actually to crush the bones of the foot. A more progressive variant, found in both the British Isles and France, consisted of a trio of upright wooden boards that splinted around and between the feet and were tied in place by cords. Wedges were hammered between the boards and the feet to dislocate and crush the bones. A prototype hailing from Autun, France, consisted of high boots of spongy, porous leather that were drawn over the feet and legs. Boiling water was poured over the boots, eventually soaking through the leather and eating the flesh away from the entrapped limbs. Lastly, oversized boots of iron or copper (often soldered in place on the floor) received the prisoner's bare feet as he lay helplessly bound and gagged in a chair. The boots were slowly filled with boiling water or oil, or even molten lead, to consume the feet and legs. One variantapplied in Ireland to the martyr Dermot O'Hurleyconsisted of lightweight metal boots that were filled with cool water and heated with the feet inside over a fire until the water boiled aggressively.

==Foot press==

A similar implement, the foot press or foot screw, consisted of a pair of horizontal iron plates tightened around the foot by means of a crank mechanism to lacerate the flesh and crush the bones of the foot. Although it was quite standard to line the lower plate with ribs to prevent the bare foot from popping out of the grip of the instrument as it became sweatier, a crueler variant of this devicetypically encountered in Nuremberg, Germanylined the upper plate with hundreds of sharp spikes. A version from Venice, sometimes called the foot screw or toe breaker, connected the crank mechanism to a drill that slowly mutilated the foot by boring a hole through the center of the instep as the press was tightened. The instrument was of sufficient power and cruelty to pulverize the tiniest of toe bones.This family of torture devices is not widely recorded but is described by Richard Sair, deriving largely from the Earl of Shrewsbury's traveling exhibit of torture devices from Nuremberg Castle.

Medieval boots were built according to a wide array of architectures. One commonly encountered boot consisted fundamentally of a pair of parallel boards that splinted the bare foot from heel to toes and were connected by a screw mechanism. Turning the screw drives the boards together and inflicts untold lateral pressure on the metatarsal heads, causing agony. This is the type of boot commonly associated with the torture of Esmeralda in Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The cruelty of the torture could be increased by spacing the toes apart with stiff wooden pegs. Various extensions of the instrument were designed to crush the ankle, calf, and/or knee in addition to its primary target, the instep.
Although effective at forcing a confession, the technologically sophisticated boot illustrated by Donnelly and Diehl in their The Big Book of Pain[tpl]cite book |last1=Donnelly |first1=Mark |last2=Diehl |first2=Daniel  |title=The big book of pain: torture & punishment through history |year=2008 |publisher=Stroud: History Pres |isbn=9780750945837 |oclc=181926734[/tpl] seems to have been motivated at least as much by sadistic pleasure.[tpl]or?|date=February 2014[/tpl] The carefully contoured instrument is patterned after a comfortable open-backed clogexcept that its toe box offers, not soft leather, but a layer of iron spikes, burrs, and teeth carefully designed to attack the toes from every direction. The naked foot rests upon an iron skate that is slowly driven forward by a stout heel plate operated by a large crank handle. Steadily increasing pressure forces the toes and metatarsals against hundreds of sharp metal protrusions.
