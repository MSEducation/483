Coal (from the Old English term col, which has meant "mineral of fossilized carbon" since the 13th century)[tpl]OEtymD|coal[/tpl] is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. Coal is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly  hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.[tpl]cite web|last=Blander|first=M|title=Calculations of the Influence of Additives on Coal Combustion Deposits|url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/Volumes/Vol34-2.pdf|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=17 December 2011|page=315[/tpl]
Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and/or heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. A fossil fuel, coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over a long period. The Energy Information Administration estimates coal reserves at [tpl]val|948|e=9[/tpl] short tons (860 Gt). One estimate for resources is 18 000 Gt.[tpl]cite journal|title=Fire in the hole: After fracking comes coal|journal=New Scientist|date=Feb 15, 2014|pages=36–41|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129560.400-fire-in-the-hole-after-fracking-comes-coal.html?full=true|author=Fred Pearce|authorlink=Fred Pearce[/tpl]
Coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide releases. In 1999, world gross carbon dioxide emissions from coal usage were 8,666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.[tpl]Cite journal| url  = http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110523215823/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html|title = International Energy Annual 2006| year =  2008| publisher =  Energy Information Administration| archivedate = 23 May 2011[/tpl], see data tables In 2011, world gross emissions from coal usage were 14,416 million tonnes.[tpl]cite web|title=International energy statistics|url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&pid=1&aid=8&cid=regions&syid=2011&eyid=2011&unit=MMTCD|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl], see table Coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt-hour generated, which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant per megawatt-hour generated. Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the market in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.Nuwer, Rachel (2012-08-17).

Coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining, either underground by shaft mining, or at ground level by open pit mining extraction. Since 1983 the world top coal producer has been China. In 2011 China produced 3,520 millions of tonnes of coal – 49.5% of 7,695 millions tonnes world coal production. In 2011 other large producers were United States (993 millions tonnes), India (589), European Union (576) and Australia (416). In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes (27.1% of world coal export) and Indonesia with 316 millions tonnes (26.1%), while the largest importers were Japan with 207 million tonnes (17.5% of world coal import), China with 195 million tonnes (16.6%) and South Korea with 126 million tonnes (10.7%).

==Formation==

At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried under the soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water.  This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.[ref]

The wide, shallow seas of the Carboniferous Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.  The exception is the coal gap in the Permian–Triassic extinction event, where coal is rare.  Coal is known from Precambrian strata, which predate land plants — this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.[tpl]cite doi|10.1130/0016-7606(1957)681293:ACFPUH2.0.CO;2[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.2113/gsecongeo.76.4.951[/tpl]

==Types==

As geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic material over time, under suitable conditions it is transformed successively into:
The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However, the exact classification varies between countries. According to the German classification, coal is classified as follows:Eberhard Lindner; Chemie für Ingenieure; Lindner Verlag Karlsruhe, S. 258
The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the English-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal, while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite, but more inclusive (US anthracite has Cannel coal (sometimes called "candle coal") is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content. It consists primarily of "exinite" macerals, now termed "liptinite".

===Hilt's law===

Hilt's law is a geological term that states that, in a small area, the deeper the coal, the higher its rank (grade). The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical, but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

==Early uses as fuel==

Coal from the Fushun mine in northeastern China was used to smelt copper as early as 1000 BCE.coal. Encyclopedia Britannica. Marco Polo, the Italian who traveled to China in 13th century, described coal as "black stones ... which burn like logs", and said coal was so plentiful, people could take three hot baths a week.Marco Polo In China. Facts and Details. Retrieved on 2013-05-11. In Europe, the earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise On stones (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist Theophrastus (circa 371–287 BC):[tpl]Cite book| first=Mattusch|last= Carol |year=2008| title = Metalworking and Tools| editor-link=John Peter Oleson|editor-last = Oleson| editor-first= John Peter| work = The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World| publisher =  Oxford University Press| isbn= 978-0-19-518731-1| pages= 418–38 (432)| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]Cite book| url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qvTDGRMPU5kC|title = Greek Science of the Hellenistic Era: A Sourcebook| first = Georgia L.|last = Irby-Massie|first2 =  Paul T.| last2 = Keyser|publisher = Routledge| year = 2002 | at = 9.1 "Theophrastos", p.228| isbn= 0-415-23847-1| postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
