==Structure==

Mucin 16 is a membrane associated mucin that possesses a single transmembrane domain.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gipson IK | title = The ocular surface: the challenge to enable and protect vision: the Friedenwald lecture | journal = Invest.

==Function==

MUC16 is a component of the ocular surface (including the cornea and conjunctiva), the respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract epithelia. Since MUC16 is highly glycosylated it creates a hydrophilic environment that acts as a lubricating barrier against foreign particles and infectious agents on the apical membrane of epithelial cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Perez BH, Gipson IK | title = Focus on Molecules: human mucin MUC16 | journal = Exp.

==As a biomarker==

CA-125 is the most frequently used biomarker for ovarian cancer detection.[tpl]cite journal | author = Suh KS, Park SW, Castro A, Patel H, Blake P, Liang M, Goy A | title = Ovarian cancer biomarkers for molecular biosensors and translational medicine | journal = Expert Rev.

Around 90% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have elevated levels of CA-125 in their blood serum, making CA-125 a useful tool for detecting ovarian cancer after the onset of symptoms.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gupta D, Lis CG | title = Pretreatment serum albumin as a predictor of cancer survival: a systematic review of the epidemiological literature | journal = Nutr J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 69 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21176210 | pmc = 3019132 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-9-69 [/tpl] Monitoring CA-125 blood serum levels is also useful for determining how ovarian cancer is responding to treatment (with the duration of disease-free survival correlating with the rate of fall of CA-125)[tpl]cite journal | author = Bast RC, Klug TL, St John E, Jenison E, Niloff JM, Lazarus H, Berkowitz RS, Leavitt T, Griffiths CT, Parker L, Zurawski VR, Knapp RC | title = A radioimmunoassay using a monoclonal antibody to monitor the course of epithelial ovarian cancer | journal = N.

Also, an increase in CA-125 levels within individuals in a remission is a strong predictor of the recurrence of ovarian cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Santillan A, Garg R, Zahurak ML, Gardner GJ, Giuntoli RL, Armstrong DK, Bristow RE | title = Risk of epithelial ovarian cancer recurrence in patients with rising serum CA-125 levels within the normal range | journal = J.

Prognosis relates to both the initial and post-treatment CA-125 values. A preoperative value >65 U/mL suggests a poor prognosis.  Persistent elevations following chemotherapy indicate a poor prognosis.  The half-life of CA-125 after chemotherapy correlates with prognosis (patients with CA-125 half-life In April 2011 the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommended that women with symptoms that could be caused by ovarian cancer should be offered a CA-125 blood test.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/news/WomenShouldBeOfferedBloodTest.jsp | title = Women should be offered a blood test for ovarian cancer | date = 2011-04-27 | format = | work = NICE guidance | publisher = United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | accessdate = 2012-04-14 [/tpl] The aim of this guideline is to help diagnose the disease at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be successful. Women with higher levels of the marker in their blood would then be offered an ultrasound scan to determine whether they need further tests.
In one case, elevated serum levels of CA-125 were observed in a male patient with IgE myeloma, however more cases are needed to determine the clinical significance of CA-125 in myeloma.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wang ML, Huang Q, Yang T | title = IgE myeloma with elevated level of serum CA125 | journal = J Zhejiang Univ Sci B. | volume =10 | issue =7 | pages =559–562 |date=July 2009 | pmid = 19585675 | doi =10.1631/jzus.B0820399 | pmc=2704975[/tpl]

===Early detection of ovarian cancer===

The potential role of CA-125 for the early detection of ovarian cancer is controversial and has not yet been adopted for widespread screening efforts in asymptomatic women.[tpl]cite journal | author = Baron, JA | title = Screening for cancer with molecular markers: progress comes with potential problems | journal = Nat. Rev. Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 1379–80 |date=May 2012 | pmid = 22495319 | doi =10.1038/nrc3260 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Fritsche HA, Bast RC | title = CA 125 in ovarian cancer: advances and controversy | journal = Clin. Chem. | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 1379–80 |date=July 1998 | pmid = 9665412 | doi = [/tpl] The major issues with using the CA-125 biomarker are its lack of sensitivity, particularly for detecting early stages of ovarian cancer, and its lack of specificity, especially in premenopausal women.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nossov V, Amneus M, Su F, Lang J, Janco JM, Reddy ST, Farias-Eisner R | title = The early detection of ovarian cancer: from traditional methods to proteomics. Can we really do better than serum CA-125? | journal = Am. J. Obstet.

Clin. Pathol. | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–312 |date=September 2004 | pmid = 15735166 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2004.018077[/tpl]

===Specificity and sensitivity===

CA-125 has limited specificity for ovarian cancer because elevated CA-125 levels can be found in individuals without ovarian cancer. For example, while CA-125 is best known as a marker for ovarian cancer,[tpl]cite journal | author = Osman N, O'Leary N, Mulcahy E, Barrett N, Wallis F, Hickey K, Gupta R | title = Correlation of serum CA125 with stage, grade and survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer at a single centre | journal = Ir Med J | volume = 101 | issue = 8 | pages = 245–7 |date=September 2008 | pmid = 18990955 | doi =  [/tpl]  it may also be elevated in other cancers, including endometrial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bast RC, Xu FJ, Yu YH, Barnhill S, Zhang Z, Mills GB | title = CA 125: the past and the future | journal = Int. J. Biol. Markers | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 179–87 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10228898 | doi =  [/tpl] CA-125 may also be elevated in a number of relatively benign conditions, such as endometriosis,[tpl]cite journal | author = Bagan P, Berna P, Assouad J, Hupertan V, Le Pimpec Barthes F, Riquet M | title = Value of cancer antigen 125 for diagnosis of pleural endometriosis in females with recurrent pneumothorax | journal = Eur. Respir. J. | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 140–2 |date=January 2008 | pmid = 17804443 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.00094206  [/tpl] several diseases of the ovary, menstruation and pregnancy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sarandakou A, Protonotariou E, Rizos D | title = Tumor markers in biological fluids associated with pregnancy | journal = Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–78 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17364691 | doi = 10.1080/10408360601003143  [/tpl]  It also tends to be elevated in the presence of any inflammatory condition in the abdominal area, both cancerous and benign,[tpl]cite journal | author = Asher V, Hammond R, Duncan TJ | title = Pelvic mass associated with raised CA 125 for benign condition: a case report | journal = World J Surg Oncol | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 28 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20398372 | pmc = 2861664 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7819-8-28 [/tpl] as well as in cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus. [tpl]cite journal | author = Faulkner D, Meldrum C | title = Tumour markers | journal = Australian Prescriber | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 125–8 | year = 2012 [/tpl]  Thus, CA-125 testing is not perfectly specific for ovarian cancer and often results in false positives. 
The specificity of CA-125 is particularly low in premenopausal women because many benign conditions that cause fluctuations in CA-125 levels, such as menstruation, pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease, are seen in this population. 
CA-125 testing is also not perfectly sensitive for detecting ovarian cancer because not every patient with cancer will have elevated levels of CA-125 in their blood.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ferrini R | title = Screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer: American College of Preventive Medicine practice policy | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 444–6 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9415790 | doi = | url = http://www.acpm.org/resource/resmgr/policy-files/polstmt_ovary.pdf [/tpl] For example, 79% of all ovarian cancers are positive for CA-125, whereas the remainder do not express this antigen at all.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rosen DG, Wang L, Atkinson JN, Yu Y, Lu KH, Diamandis EP, Hellstrom I, Mok SC, Liu J, Bast RC | title = Potential markers that complement expression of CA125 in epithelial ovarian cancer | journal = Gynecol. Oncol. | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 267–77 |date=November 2005 | pmid = 16061277 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.06.040 [/tpl] Also, only about 50% of patients with early stage ovarian cancer have elevated CA-125 levels, meaning that CA-125 has particularly poor sensitivity for ovarian cancer before the onset of symptoms.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sasaroli D, Coukos G, Scholler N | title = Beyond CA125: the coming of age of ovarian cancer biomarkers. Are we there yet? | journal = Biomark Med | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–288 |date=June 2009 | pmid = 19684876 | pmc = 2726755 | doi = 10.2217/bmm.09.21 [/tpl] Poor sensitivity means that the use of CA-125 to detect ovarian cancer (especially in early stages of disease) can frequently lead to false negatives. Patients that receive false negatives are unlikely to seek further treatment for their disease.

===Ranges in ovarian cancer===

While this test is not generally regarded as useful for large scale screening by the medical community, a high value may be an indication that the woman should receive further diagnostic screening or treatment.  Normal values range from 0 to 35 (U/mL). Elevated levels in post-menopausal women are usually an indication that further screening is necessary. In pre-menopausal women, the test is less reliable as values are often elevated due to a number of non-cancerous causes, and a value above 35 is not necessarily a cause for concern.
In a patient who is clinically selected for testing due to the presence of an adnexal/pelvic mass, CA-125 has great utility to differentiate benign from malignant processes.  In a post-menopausal woman with a palpable adnexal mass and CA-125 level greater than 65 U/mL, the positive predictive value is >95% for ovarian malignancy.  In patients who are not as carefully selected clinically, the utility of this test decreases, thus highlighting the need for careful clinical scrutiny.

==Role in cancer==

MUC16 has been shown to play a role in advancing tumorigenesis and tumor proliferation by several different mechanisms. 

===Immune system evasion===

One way that MUC16 helps the growth of tumors is by suppressing the response of natural killer cells, which protects the cancer cells from the immune response.[tpl]cite journal | author = Patankar MS, Jing Y, Morrison JC, Belisle JA, Lattanzio FA, Deng Y, Wong NK, Morris HR, Dell A, Clark GF | title = Potent suppression of natural killer cell response mediated by the ovarian tumor marker CA125 | journal = Gynecol. Oncol. | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 704–13 |date=December 2005 | pmid = 16126266 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2005.07.030 [/tpl] Further evidence that MUC16 can protect tumor cells from the immune system is the discovery that the heavily glycosylated tandem repeat domain of MUC16 can bind to galectin-1 (an immunosuppressive protein).[tpl]cite journal | author = Seelenmeyer C, Wegehingel S, Lechner J, Nickel W | title = The cancer antigen CA125 represents a novel counter receptor for galectin-1 | journal = J. Cell. Sci. | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1305–18 |date=April 2003 | pmid = 12615972 | doi = [/tpl]

===Metastatic invasion===

MUC16 is also thought to participate in cell-to-cell interactions that allow for the metastasis of tumor cells. This is supported by evidence showing that MUC16 binds selectively to mesothelin, a glycoprotein normally expressed by the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity).[tpl]cite journal | author = Rump A, Morikawa Y, Tanaka M, Minami S, Umesaki N, Takeuchi M, Miyajima A | title = Binding of ovarian cancer antigen CA125/MUC16 to mesothelin mediates cell adhesion | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 279 | issue = 10 | pages = 9190–8 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 14676194 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M312372200 [/tpl] MUC16 and mesothelin interactions are thought to provide the first step in tumor cell invasion of the peritoneum.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gubbels JA, Belisle J, Onda M, Rancourt C, Migneault M, Ho M, Bera TK, Connor J, Sathyanarayana BK, Lee B, Pastan I, Patankar MS | title = Mesothelin-MUC16 binding is a high affinity, N-glycan dependent interaction that facilitates peritoneal metastasis of ovarian tumors | journal = Mol. Cancer | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 50 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17067392 | pmc = 1635730 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-5-50 [/tpl] 
Mesothelin has also been found to be expressed in several types of cancers including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and squamous cell carcinoma.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chang K, Pastan I | title = Molecular cloning of mesothelin, a differentiation antigen present on mesothelium, mesotheliomas, and ovarian cancers | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 136–40 |date=January 1996 | pmid = 8552591 | pmc = 40193 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.1.136 [/tpl] Since mesothelin is also expressed by tumor cells, MUC16 and mesothelial interactions may aid in the gathering of other tumor cells to the location of a metastasis, thus increasing the size of the metastasis.

===Induced motility===

Evidence suggests that expression of the cytoplasmic tail of MUC16 enables tumor cells to grow, promotes cell motility and may facilitate invasion. This appears to be due to the ability of the C-terminal domain of MUC16 to facilitate signaling that leads to a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and increase the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, which are expression patterns consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition.[tpl]cite journal | author = Thériault C, Pinard M, Comamala M, Migneault M, Beaudin J, Matte I, Boivin M, Piché A, Rancourt C | title = MUC16 (CA125) regulates epithelial ovarian cancer cell growth, tumorigenesis and metastasis | journal = Gynecol. Oncol. | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 434–43 |date=June 2011 | pmid = 21421261 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2011.02.020 [/tpl]

===Chemotherapy resistance===

MUC16 might also play a role in reducing the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug therapy. Overexpression of MUC16 has been shown to protect cells from the effects of genotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boivin M, Lane D, Piché A, Rancourt C | title = CA125 (MUC16) tumor antigen selectively modulates the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis | journal = Gynecol. Oncol. | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–13 |date=December 2009 | pmid = 19747716 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygyno.2009.08.007 [/tpl]

==Discovery==

CA-125 was initially detected using the murine monoclonal antibody designated OC125. Drs. Robert Bast, Robert Knapp and their research team first isolated this monoclonal antibody in 1981.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bast RC, Feeney M, Lazarus H, Nadler LM, Colvin RB, Knapp RC | title = Reactivity of a monoclonal antibody with human ovarian carcinoma | journal = J.
