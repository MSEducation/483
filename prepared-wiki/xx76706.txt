CATEGORIES: Chess checkmates, Chess terminology

Fool's Mate, also known as the "Two-Move Checkmate", is the quickest possible checkmate in chess. A prime example consists of the moves:
resulting in the position shown. (The pattern can have slight variations: White might play 1.f4 instead of 1.f3 or move the g-pawn first, and Black might play 1...e6 instead of 1...e5.)

==Details==

Fool's Mate received its name because it can only occur if White plays extraordinarily weakly (i.e. foolishly). Even among rank beginners, the mate almost never occurs in practice.

The same basic mating pattern can also occur later in the game. For instance, a well-known trap in the Dutch Defence  occurred in the game Frank Melville Teed vs. Eugene Delmar, 1896:Teed vs. Delmar
A similar mate can occur in From's Gambit: 1. f4 e5 2. g3? exf4 3. gxf4?? Qh4#
More generally, the term Fool's Mate is applied to all similar mates early in the game.  For example, in 1. e4 g5 2. d4 f6?? 3. Qh5#, the basic Fool's Mate pattern is the same: a player advances his f- and g-pawns, which permit the enemy queen to mate along the unblocked diagonal. One such Fool's Mate is widely reported to have occurred in a possibly apocryphal 1959 game between Masefield and TrinkaThe names are also recorded as Mayfield or Mansfield and Trinks or Trent depending on the source consulted. which lasted just three moves: 1. e4 g5 2. Nc3 f5?? 3.

Even more generally, the term Fool's Mate is used in chess variants to mean the shortest possible mate, especially those which bear a resemblance to the orthodox chess Fool's Mate.  For example, Fool's Mate in the variant Progressive chess is: 1. e4 2. f6 g5?? 3. Qh5#
