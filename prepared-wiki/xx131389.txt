Krueger developed and applied the method of natural experiments to study the effect of education on earnings, the minimum wage on employment, and other issues.
Krueger compared restaurant jobs in New Jersey, which raised its minimum wage, to restaurant jobs in Pennsylvania, which did not, and found that restaurant employment in New Jersey increased, while it decreased in Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/weekinreview/conversations-david-card-alan-krueger-two-economists-catch-clinton-s-eye-bucking.html|title=Conversations/David Card and Alan Krueger; Two Economists Catch Clinton's Eye By Bucking the Common Wisdom|first=Sylvia|last=Nasar|work=The New York Times|date=August 22, 1993|accessdate=August 29, 2011[/tpl] The results were later disputed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w5224|title=The Effect of New Jersey's Minimum Wage Increase on Fast-Food Employment: A Re-Evaluation Using Payroll Records|first1=David|last1=Neumark|first2=William|last2=Wascher|work=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=August 1995|accessdate=August 31, 2011[/tpl]
His books, Education Matters: Selected Essays by Alan B. Krueger and (with James Heckman) Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policies? review the available research relating to positive externalities accruing to society from increased government investment in educating the children of the poor.  His summary of the available research shows relatively high returns to society from educational investments that have been shown in numerous formal and natural experiments to reduce crime and recidivism.  At one point, he concluded he does "not envision investment in human capital development as the sole component of a program to address the adverse consequences of income inequality.  It is part of the solution, but not the whole solution.  In principle, the optimal governmental policy regarding income inequality would employ multiple instruments, up to the point at which the social benefit per additional dollar of cost of each instrument is equal across all instruments."Heckman and Krueger (2003, p. 62)
In his book, What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism (2007), he wrote that in contrast to the assumption that terrorists come from impoverished, uneducated environments, terrorists often come from middle-class, college-educated backgrounds.[tpl]cite book|last=Krueger|first=Alan B.|title=What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13438-3|pages=77[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62904/lawrence-d-freedman/the-history-of-terrorism-from-antiquity-to-al-qaeda-denial-of-sa|title=Review: What Makes a Terrorist|first=Lawrence D.|last=Freedman|date=Novemberâ€“December 2007|accessdate=August 29, 2011|work=Foreign Affairs[/tpl]
