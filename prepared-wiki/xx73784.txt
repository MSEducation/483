[[Barracudina]]

CATEGORIES: Paralepididae

Barracudinas are about 50 species of marine fishes of the family Paralepididae, found almost worldwide in deep waters. 
They are elongated, slender fish with large eyes, and a pointed snout containing fang-like teeth. This gives them some superficial resemblance to barracudas (family Sphyraenidae), although the two groups are not closely related, and the barracudinas lack a swim bladder. The largest species grow up to [tpl]convert|100|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Johnson, R.K. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 126|isbn= 0-12-547665-5[/tpl]
