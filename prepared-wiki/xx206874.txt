Wade, who helped put cities on the map as an academic subject and who advised Democratic candidates including Adlai Stevenson, Robert F.

He was 87. |work=New York Times |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl]  As a historian, he pioneered the application of social science techniques to the study of urban history and helped make cities an important academic subject.  His first book, The Urban Frontier (1959), was a challenge to Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, asserting that the catalysts for western expansion were the western cities like Pittsburgh, Louisville and Cincinnati, not the pioneer farmers.
