The High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Fiji is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of Fiji.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20121019001756/http://ukinfiji.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/our-high-commission/high-commissioner/previous-high-commissioners |title=Previous High Commissioners to Fiji |accessdate=2013-04-09[/tpl]
Fiji gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Fiji conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State. Therefore the countries exchange High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
The British High Commissioner to Fiji (or, from 1988 to 1997, the British Ambassador to Fiji) has also acted at various times as High Commissioner to the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Nauru, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu and the Republic of Vanuatu.
