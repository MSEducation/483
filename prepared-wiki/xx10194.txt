Red Dwarf is a British comedy franchise which primarily comprises ten series (including a ninth mini-series named Back To Earth) of a television science fiction sitcom that aired on BBC Two between 1988 and 1993 and from 1997 to 1999, and on Dave in 2009 and 2012, gaining a cult following.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2002/10_october/reddwarf.shtml |title=Worldwide Press Office - Red Dwarf on DVD |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-11-28[/tpl] The series was created by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. In addition to the television episodes, there are four bestselling novels, two pilot episodes for an American version of the show, a radio version produced for BBC Radio 7,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/12/04/infinity%2Dwelcomes%2Dcareful%2Dbroadcasters/ |title=Reddwarf.co.uk page on radio 7 broadcast[/tpl] tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.
Despite the pastiche of science fiction used as a backdrop, Red Dwarf is primarily a character-driven comedy, with off-the-wall, often scatological science fiction elements[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/mad-boffin-jailed-over-computer-virus-havoc-1582105.html|title=Independent Newspaper reports on activities of Red Dwarf fan | work=The Independent | location=London | first=Peter | last=Victor | date=16 November 1995 | accessdate=2010-05-22[/tpl] used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the "Odd Couple"-style relationship between the two central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other and are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate.  The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer; Kryten, a service mechanoid; and, as of Series VII to Back to Earth, Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love.
One of the series' highest accolades came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series, "Gunmen of the Apocalypse", won an International Emmy Award in the Popular Arts category, and in the same year the series was also awarded "Best BBC Comedy Series" at the British Comedy Awards.[tpl]cite web|title=Red Dwarf VI released on DVD 21.02.05|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/01_january/red_dwarf.shtml|accessdate= 2009-02-05[/tpl] The series attracted its highest ratings, of over eight million viewers, during the eighth series in 1999.[tpl]cite web|title=Red Dwarf VIII Aftermath|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=8&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath|accessdate= 2009-02-05[/tpl] The series was revived after a ten-year break, when digital channel Dave screened a three-episode production, titled Red Dwarf: Back to Earth, in April 2009 during the Easter weekend.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7851989.stm |title=BBC website |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-08-20[/tpl] This was followed by Series X, consisting of six episodes, which was first broadcast on Dave in October/November 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Red Dwarf Makes a Comeback on Dave|url=http://theglobalherald.com/red-dwarf-makes-a-comeback-on-dave/28563/|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Global Herald|date=1 October 2012[/tpl]

==Setting and plot==

thumb|right|250px|The second Red Dwarf ship model as used for series 5.The main setting of the series is the eponymous mining spaceship Red Dwarf,[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifidimensions.com/Feb03/reddwarf1.htm | title =Series I at Sci Fi Dimensions | publisher =www.scifidimensions.com |accessdate=2008-02-06[/tpl] which is [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|4|mi|km[/tpl] tall, and [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] wide and is operated by the Jupiter Mining Corporation.[tpl]cite book | last=Grant | first=Naylor | coauthors= | year=1989 | title=Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers | isbn=978-0-14-012437-8 | publisher=Penguin | location=London, England [/tpl] In the first episode set sometime in the late 22nd century, an on-board radiation leak of cadmium II kills everyone except for low-ranking technician Dave Lister, who is in suspended animation at the time, and his pregnant cat, Frankenstein, who is safely sealed in the cargo hold.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 45. Following the accident, the ship's computer Holly keeps Lister in stasis until the background radiation dies down – a process that takes three million years. Lister therefore emerges as the last human being in the universe – but not alone on-board the ship.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 46. His former bunkmate and immediate superior Arnold Judas Rimmer is resurrected by Holly as a hologram to keep Lister sane. At the same time, a creature known only as Cat is the last member on board of Felis sapiens, a race of humanoid felines that evolved in the ship's hold from Lister's cat, Frankenstein, and her kittens during the 3 million years that Lister was in stasis.
The main dramatic thrust of the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth, although the crew's ownership of an unlimited time-space travel drive in series seven was to later negate this intention.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw9510.html | title =Series I at SciFi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070817030011/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw9510.html |archivedate = 17 August 2007[/tpl] As their journey begins, the not-so-intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions, faster-than-light travel, mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years. During the second series, the group encounter the service mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p52. Initially, Kryten only appeared in one episode of series two, but by the beginning of series three he had become a regular character. At the end of series five, Red Dwarf itself is stolen by persons unknown, forcing them to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two series, with the side-effect that they lose contact with Holly.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =Series VI review at Sci- Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew found a parallel version of themselves from a universe
in which Kristine Kochanski, Lister's long-term love interest, had been put into stasis at the time of the leak and so became the last remaining human.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/red-dwarf-vii.html | title =Series VII review at DVD Active | publisher =www.dvdactive.com |accessdate =2008-02-20[/tpl] A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in "our" universe, where she is forced to join the crew. At the end of series seven, we learn that Red Dwarf had been stolen by Kryten's service nanobots, who had abandoned him years earlier.
At the beginning of the eighth series, Red Dwarf is reconstructed by Kryten's nanobots, who had broken it down into its constituent atoms.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html | title =Series VIII review at Sci-Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060720213246/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html |archivedate = 20 July 2006[/tpl] In the process, the entire crew of the ship – including a pre-accident Rimmer – are resurrected, but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig (at first, for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways, but later for using information from the confidential files). The series ends with a metal-eating virus loose on Red Dwarf. The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original dwarfers. In the cliffhanger ending, Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death (and promptly knees him in the groin and flees).[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.britannia.org/tvarchives/dwarf/episodes/series8.php | title =Episode Guide — Series 8 | publisher =www.britannia.org |accessdate =2008-02-06[/tpl]
Nine years later, the four are once more the only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is mourning Kochanski, lost to him out of an airlock some time previously. A chance to get back to Earth through a dimension warp presents itself, though it is not quite what it first appears to be, it results in giving Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.
The tenth series sees Lister continuing to travel with Rimmer, Kryten and Cat in Red Dwarf, in hopes of eventually locating Kochanski or returning to Earth, whichever comes first.

==Characters and actors==

==Production==

The first series aired on BBC2 in 1988. Ten further series have so far been produced, and a film has been in development almost continually since before series VIII in 1999.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Red Dwarf: The Movie | work = | publisher=www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk | url =http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm | doi = | accessdate =2007-12-06 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071128145914/http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm#filming  | archivedate = 2007-11-28[/tpl]

===Concept and commission===

The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch-series Dave Hollins: Space Cadet on the BBC Radio 4 show Son of Cliché in the mid-1980s, written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor.[tpl]cite book |last=Dessau |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Official Red Dwarf Companion |year=1992 |publisher=Titan |location=Red Dwarf Genesis |isbn=978-1-85286-456-9[/tpl] Their influences came from films and television programmes such as Silent Running (1972), Alien (1979), Dark Star (1974) and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1981), but also had a large element of British-style comedy and satire thrown into the mix, ultimately moulded into the form of a sitcom. Having first written the pilot script in 1983, the former Spitting Image writers had hawked their unusual and original script around but it was rejected by everyone at the BBC, as it was believed a sitcom based around science fiction would not be popular.
It was finally accepted by BBC North in 1986, a result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=genesis | title =Red Dwarf Series I Genesis | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17[/tpl] The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.

===Casting===

Alan Rickman and Alfred Molina auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina being cast as Rimmer.Interview: Norman Lovett, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 9, November 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603Red Dwarf Series 1 Episode One: The End, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 1, May 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603 However, after Molina had difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular, the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie, a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on Spitting Image, and with the producers on Happy Families and Jasper Carrott productions. Craig Charles, a Liverpudlian "punk poet", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the "Cat" character, as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 5. Charles described "Cat" as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 6. Laconic stand up comedian Norman Lovett, who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer, was kept in the show as Holly, the senile computer of the titular ship. A professional dancer and singer, Danny John-Jules, arriving half an hour late for his appointment, stood out as the Cat immediately. This was partly due to his "cool" exterior, dedicated research (reading Desmond Morris' book Catwatching), and his showing up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style zoot suit.

===Writing, producing, and directing===

Grant and Naylor wrote the first six series together (using the pseudonym Grant Naylor on the first two novels and later as the name of their production company, although never on the episodes themselves).Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 205. Grant left in 1995, to pursue other projects,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=6&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Series VI Aftermath | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl] leaving Naylor to write series VII and VIII with a group of new writers, including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn who portrayed the character Kryten.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =Series VII Writing | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl]
For the most part, Ed Bye produced and directed the series. He left before series V due to a scheduling clash (he ended up directing a show starring his wife, Ruby Wax) so Juliet May took over as director.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 16. May parted ways with the show halfway through the series for personal and professional reasons and Grant and Naylor took over direction of the series, in addition to writing and producing.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series V production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17[/tpl] Series VI was directed by Andy de Emmony, and Ed Bye returned to direct series VII and VIII. Series I, II and III were made by Paul Jackson Productions, with subsequent series produced by the writers' own company Grant Naylor Productions for BBC North. All eight series were broadcast on BBC2. At the beginning of series IV, production moved from the BBC North's New Broadcasting House in Manchester to Shepperton.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 13, 14.

===Theme song and music===

The theme tune and incidental music were written and performed by Howard Goodall, with the distinctive vocals on the closing theme tune courtesy of Jenna Russell. The first two series used a relatively sombre instrumental version of the closing theme for the opening titles; from series III onwards this switched to a more upbeat version. Goodall also wrote music for the show's various songs, including "Tongue Tied", with lyrics written by Grant and Naylor.Interview: Howard Goodall, Red Dwarf Smegazine, issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603 Danny John-Jules (credited as 'The Cat') re-orchestrated and released "Tongue Tied" in October 1993; it reached #17 on the UK charts.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.everyhit.co.uk/notauth.html | title =everyHit.com — UK Top 40 Chart Archive, British Singles & Album Charts | publisher =www.everyhit.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl] Goodall himself sang "The Rimmer Song" heard during the series VII episode "Blue", to which Chris Barrie mimed."Back from the Dead" featurette on the Series VII DVD release

===Remastered===

In 1998, on the tenth anniversary of the show's first airing (and between the broadcast of series VII and VIII), the first three series of Red Dwarf were remastered and released on VHS. The remastering included replacing model shots with computer graphics, cutting certain dialogue and scenes,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sci-fi-london.com/news/article/1195080035/3/red-dwarf-the-bodysnatcher-collection | title =Sci-Fi-London Film Festival — The Bodysnatcher Collection | publisher =www.sci-fi-london.com |accessdate =2008-01-28[/tpl] re-filming Norman Lovett's Holly footage, creating a consistent set of opening titles, replacing music and creating ambient sound effects with a digital master.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=remastering | title =Red Dwarf series I Remastering | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18[/tpl] The remastered series were released in a 4 disc DVD boxset "The Bodysnatcher Collection" in 2007.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2007/11/09/the-bodysnatcher-collection/ | title =The Bodysnatcher Collection | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl]

Three years elapsed between series VI and VII, partly due to the dissolving of the Grant and Naylor partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects. When the series eventually returned, it was filmised and no longer shot in front of a live audience, allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, location shooting and single camera techniques.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series VII Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-17[/tpl] When the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and returned to using a live audience.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=8&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=production | title =Red Dwarf series VIII Production | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18[/tpl]
The show received a setback when the BBC rejected proposals for a series IX. Doug Naylor confirmed that the BBC decided not to renew the series as they preferred to work on other projects.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a76992/report-bbc-rejects-new-red-dwarf-series.html | title =BBC rejects new 'Red Dwarf' series | publisher =www.digitalspy.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-18[/tpl] A short animated Christmas special was, however, made available to mobile phone subscribers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a82173/red-dwarf-returns-for-new-mobisodes.html | title ='Red Dwarf' returns for new a new animated Christmas special | publisher =www.digitalspy.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-18[/tpl] Ultimately, however, fans had to wait a decade before the series returned to television.

===Revival===

====Red Dwarf: Back to Earth====

In 2008, a three-episode production was commissioned by the digital channel Dave. Red Dwarf: Back to Earth was broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2009, along with a "making of" documentary.[tpl]cite news|title= Red Dwarf to return in new series|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/4348317/Red-Dwarf-to-return-in-new-series.html|date= 2008-09-26|accessdate= 2008-09-27 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Back To Earth: The Trilogy|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/02/20/back-to-earth-the-trilogy/|accessdate= 2009-02-20[/tpl] The episode was set nine years after the events of "Only the Good..." (with the cliffhanger ending of that episode left unresolved, a situation that would continue with Series X). The storyline involves the characters arriving back on Earth, circa 2009, only to find that they are characters in a TV show called "Red Dwarf". Kochanski is supposedly dead and Holly is offline due to water damage caused by Lister leaving a tap running.Red Alert, p. 8, SFX, Issue 181, April 2009 Actress Sophie Winkleman played a character called Katerina, a resurrected hologram of a Red Dwarf science officer intent on replacing Rimmer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dave.uktv.co.uk/library/red-dwarf/red-dwarf-news-new-character-revealed/ |title=Red Dwarf News: New character revealed! - Red Dwarf exclusive weekly news Library on Dave |publisher=Dave.uktv.co.uk |accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl]
To achieve a more cinematic atmosphere, Back to Earth was not filmed in front of a studio audience. Some previous Red Dwarf episodes had been shot in that way ("Bodyswap" and all of the seventh series), but Back to Earth represented the first time that a laughter track was not added before broadcast.[tpl]cite web|title=Red-Through: A high-definition start to the new Dwarf production.|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2009/02/13/red-through/|work=reddwarf.co.uk|date=13 February 2009|accessdate= 2009-02-13[/tpl] It was also the first episode of Red Dwarf to be filmed in high definition.
The specials were televised over three nights starting on Friday, 10 April 2009.

Since series X aired, which produced high ratings, Dave, Doug Naylor and the cast have shown a strong interest in doing another series with Naylor already starting on scripts, but this is dependent on UKTV commissioning the series. During the Dimension Jump fan convention in May 2013, Doug Naylor stated that discussions were happening with all involved parties but arrangements had not been finalized, but he hoped shooting could begin in February 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/reports/dimension-jump-17/index.cfm?page=sunday |title=Sunday: Dimension Jump XVII |publisher=www.reddwarf.co.uk |date=2013-05-05 |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl] In October 2013, Doug Naylor played down reports of a new series being commissioned;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a525448/red-dwarf-series-11-still-not-commissioned-says-doug-naylor.html |title='Red Dwarf' series 11 still not commissioned, says Doug Naylor |publisher=www.digitalspy.co.uk |date=2013-10-22 |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl] but in January 2014 Danny John-Jules stated that the eleventh series of Red Dwarf was currently being written.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a544203/red-dwarf-series-11-currently-being-written-says-danny-john-jules.html |title=Red Dwarf series 11 currently being written, says Danny John-Jules |publisher=www.digitalspy.co.uk |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2014-03-03[/tpl]

====Red Dwarf XI====

In October 2013, Robert Llewellyn posted on his blog, stating that "an eleventh series would happen" and that it would be "sometime in 2014". Llewellyn removed the post from his blog and Doug Naylor issued a statement on Twitter, saying: "Getting tweets claiming Red Dwarf XI is commissioned. Not true.

==Themes==

thumb|right|The episode "Polymorph" parodied the 1979 Alien filmRed Dwarf was founded on the standard sitcom focus of a disparate and frequently dysfunctional group of individuals living together in a restricted setting. With the main characters routinely displaying their cowardice, incompetence and laziness, while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue, the series provided a humorous antidote to the fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science fiction shows, with the main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative. The increasing science fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by Grant and Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television shows, films and books. These have included references to the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =2001: A Space Oddyssey paraody | publisher=Red Dwarf Official Website |accessdate =2008-01-17[/tpl] Top Gun (1986),[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=4&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=music | title =Top Gun influences |publisher=Red Dwarf Official Website |accessdate =2008-01-17[/tpl] RoboCop (1987), Star Wars (1977), Citizen Kane (1942), The Wild One (1953), High Noon (1952), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Easy Rider (1969), The Terminator (1984)Nazzaro, Joe. p. 39. Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993 and Pride and Prejudice (1813).
The writers based the whole theme of some episodes on the plots of feature films. The series III episode "Polymorph" references and parodies key moments from Alien (1979); series IV's "Camille" echoes key scenes from Casablanca (1942); "Meltdown" borrows the main plot from Westworld, (1973); and "Back to Earth" was partially inspired by Blade Runner (1982).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=121&title=red_dwarf_back_to_earth_this_weekend_s_e_1&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title='Red Dwarf: Back To Earth' - This Weekend's Essential Viewing |publisher=NME |date=09/04/09 |accessdate=2009-04-15[/tpl] The series' themes are not limited to films or television, having also incorporated historical events and figures.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 67, 68. Religion also plays a part in the series, as a significant factor in the ultimate fate of the Cat race, and the perception of Lister as their "God",Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 48, 49. and of the crew meeting a man they believe to be Jesus Christ in "Lemons". The series also makes a literary reference to the Samuel Beckett play Waiting for Godot in the title for the episode Waiting for God. The episode titled Ouroboros derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the same name.
The series explores many science fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the grandfather paradox), the question of determinism and free will (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near certainty of the human species' extinction some time in the far future.
Aliens do not feature in the series as Rob Grant and Doug Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens in the show. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a "Genetically Engineered Life Form" (GELF), an artificially created creature. Most of the enemies within the later series are some variant on GELFs or Simulants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/analysis/ten-moments-that-shaped-red-dwarf/index.cfm |title=Ten Moments That Shaped Red Dwarf | Features |publisher=Red Dwarf Official Website|date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-05[/tpl]

==Hallmarks==

The series developed its own distinct vocabulary. Words and phrases such as hologramatic [tpl]sic[/tpl], Dollarpound, Felis sapiens, Simulants, GELF, space weevil and Zero Gee Football appear throughout the series, highlighting a development in language, political climate, technology, evolution and culture in the future.[tpl]cite book |last=Howarth |first= Chris |authorlink= |coauthors=Steve Lyons |title=Red Dwarf Programme Guide: A-Z |year=1993 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=A-z |isbn=0-86369-682-1[/tpl] The creators also employed a vocabulary of fictional expletives in order to avoid using potentially offensive words in the show, and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language. "Smeg", "gimboid", "goit", and variants of "smeg" such as "smegging", "smegger", and "smeg-head" were used.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=1&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing | title =Red Dwarf series I Writing | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-18[/tpl]

==Reception and achievements==

===Mixed reactions===

The changes that were made to the series' cast, setting, creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans and critics alike as to the quality of certain series.Lyons, Steve & Nazzaro, Joe. p. 38, 39. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993 In the "Great Red Dwarf Debate", published in volume 2 issue 3 of the Red Dwarf Smegazine, science fiction writers Steve Lyons and Joe Nazzaro both argued on the pros and cons of the early series against the later series. Lyons stated that what the show "once had was a unique balance of sci-fi comedy, which worked magnificently."Lyons, Steve. p. 38. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993 Nazarro agreed that "the first two series are very original and very funny", but went on to say that "it wasn't until series III that the show hit its stride."Nazzaro, Joe. p. 39. The Great Red Dwarf Debate, Red Dwarf Smegazine, volume 2 issue 3, July 1993 Series VI is regarded as a continuation of the "Monster of the week" philosophy of series V, which was nevertheless considered to be visually impressive.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =series VI review at Sci Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Discussions revolve around the quality of series VI, seen by viewers as just as good as the earlier series',[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1823.html | title =Red Dwarf VI review at Sci-Fi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-01[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] but has been criticised as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reviewsbygavrielle.com/dwarf3.shtml | title =Red Dwarf VI review by Gavrielle | publisher =www.reviewsbygavrielle.com |accessdate =2008-02-01[/tpl]
The changes seen in series VII were seen by some as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from outright sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/red-dwarf-vii.html | title =series VII review at DVD Active | publisher =www.dvdactive.com |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl] Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html | title =series VIII review at Sci Fi Weekly | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060720213246/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw13179.html |archivedate = 20 July 2006[/tpl] There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however,[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue457/screen2.html | title =TV Reviews at SciFi.com | publisher =www.scifi.com |accessdate =2008-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070703001116/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue457/screen2.html |archivedate = 3 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php | title =series Reviews at DVD Direct | publisher =www.dvdverdict.com |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl] and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/560214/index.html | title =screenonline: Red Dwarf | publisher =www.screenonline.org.uk |accessdate =2008-02-11[/tpl]

==Spin-offs and merchandise==

The show's logo and characters have appeared on a wide range of merchandise.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 219. Red Dwarf has also been spun off in a variety of different media formats. For instance, the song "Tongue Tied", featured in the "Parallel Universe" episode of the show, was released in 1993 as a single and became a top 20 UK hit for Danny John Jules (under the name 'The Cat'). Stage plays of the show have been produced through Blak Yak, a theatre group in Perth, Western Australia, who were given permission by Grant Naylor Productions to mount stage versions of certain episodes in 2002, 2004 and 2006.[tpl]Citation | last =Mason | first =Fleur | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Feline funky with the help of James Brown | newspaper =Fremantle Gazette (Pert, W.A.) | pages = | date =5 September 2006 | url = [/tpl][tpl]Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Media man as the Cat | newspaper =Western Suburbs Weekly (Perth, W.A.) | pages = | date =12 September 2006 | url = [/tpl][tpl]Citation | last =Mason | first =Fleur | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =TV hits come alive on stage | newspaper =Southern Gazette (Perth, W.A.) | pages = | date =12 September 2006 | url = [/tpl][tpl]Citation | last =Cahill | first =Denise | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Recall for one cool cat | newspaper =Fremantle Gazette (Perth, W.A.) | pages = | date =16 March 2004 | url = [/tpl] In October 2006 an Interactive Quiz DVD entitled Red Dwarf: Beat The Geek was released, hosted by Norman Lovett and Hattie Hayridge, both reprising their roles as Holly.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/merchandise/index.cfm?itemID=162 | title =News report on Beat The Geek | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl]

===Novels===

Working together under the name "Grant Naylor", the creators of the series collaboratively wrote two novels. The first, Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, was published in November 1989, and incorporates plot lines from several episodes of the show's first two series. The second novel, Better Than Life, followed in October 1990, and is largely based on the second-series episode of the same name. Together, the two novels provide expanded backstory and development of the series' principal characters and themes. Retaining the show's offbeat sense of humor, the novels share some similarity with Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, also a science fiction comedy series.
The authors began work on a sequel to Better than Life, called The Last Human, but Rob Grant was drawn away from Red Dwarf by an interest in other projects.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]  Still owing Penguin Publishing two more Red Dwarf novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, is more in keeping with the previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.
An omnibus edition of the first two novels was released in 1992, including edits to the original text and extra material such as the original pilot script of the TV series.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 206. All four novels have been released in audiobook format, the first two read by Chris Barrie,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1897774109/ | title =Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf — Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1897774818/ | title =Amazon.co.uk: Red Dwarf — Better Than Life | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl] Last Human read by Craig Charles,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0007105657/ | title =Amazon.co.uk: Last Human | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl] and Backwards read by  author Rob Grant.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0140171509/ | title =Amazon.co.uk: Backwards (Red Dwarf) | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2007-12-19[/tpl]

===Home video releases===

For the initial release of the VHS editions, episodes of Red Dwarf were separated and two tapes were released for each series (except series VII, which was released on three separate tapes), labelled 'byte one' and 'byte two'. These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos. For series V, "Back to Reality" and "Quarantine" were given top billing on their respective video release.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf series V Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-01-07[/tpl] For the second VHS volume of series I, "Confidence and Paranoia" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being "Waiting for God" which shared its name with the title of another comedy series (set in a retirement home). Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context. All eight series were made available on VHS, and three episodes of series VII were also released as special "Xtended" sic versions with extra scenes (including an original, unbroadcast ending for the episode "Tikka To Ride") and no laugh track;[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf series VII Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl] the remastered versions of series I–III were also released individually and in a complete box-set.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CVR6/ | title =series I Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CW2Z/ | title =series III Remastered VHS at Amazon.co.uk | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.sendit.com/video/item/7000000047047| title=series I-III Remastered VHS Boxset at sendit.com | publisher =www.sendit.com |accessdate =2008-02-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080126152114/http://www.sendit.com/video/item/7000000047047 |archivedate = 26 January 2008[/tpl] Finally, two outtake videos were released, Smeg Ups in 1994, and its sequel Smeg Outs in 1995.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CPHB/ | title =Smeg Ups| publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00004CRCE/ | title =Smeg Outs | publisher =www.amazon.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl]

This release showcased a storyboard construction of "Bodysnatcher", an unfinished script from 1987, which was finally completed in 2007 by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor who were working together for the first time since 1993. In December 2008 an anniversary DVD set entitled Red Dwarf: All The Shows was released, reworking the vanilla disc content of the two Just The Shows sets within A4 packaging resembling a 'photo album', which carefully omitted information that no extras were included. This box-set was re-released in a smaller slip-case sized box, reverting to the Just the Shows title, in November 2009. The series is also available for download on iTunes.

===Magazine===

thumb|150px|right|Rimmer with a greyscale appearanceThe Red Dwarf Magazine – the magazine part of the title changed to "Smegazine" from issue 3 – was launched in 1992 by Fleetway Editions. It comprised a mix of news, reviews, interviews, comic strips and competitions. The comic strips featured episode adaptations and original material, including further stories of popular characters like Mr. Flibble, the Polymorph and Ace Rimmer.
Notably, the comic strip stories' holographic characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in greyscale. This was at the request of Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the technique for the television series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 217. Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.Smeg-Editorial, p. 2, Red Dwarf Smegazine, Volume 2 Issue 9, January 1994
Another Red Dwarf magazine was started called Red Dwarf: Better Than Life which is only available through the Red Dwarf Official Fan Club. It features cast interviews and the latest news. Each person gets four issues each year.

===U.S. version===

A pilot episode for an American version (known as Red Dwarf USA) was produced through Universal Studios with the intention of broadcasting on NBC in 1992.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 228. The show essentially followed the same story as the first episode of the original series, using American actors for most of the main roles:Howarth & Lyons (1993) p.225. Craig Bierko as Lister, Chris Eigeman as Rimmer, and Hinton Battle as Cat. Exceptions to this were Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress Jane Leeves, who played Holly. It was written by Linwood Boomer and directed by Jeffrey Melman, with Grant and Naylor onboard as creators and executive producers.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/features/history/red-dwarf-usa/ | title =Red Dwarf USA | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-06[/tpl] Llewellyn, Grant and Naylor travelled to America for the filming of the American pilot after production of the fifth season of the UK series. According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.
The studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227. The intention was to shoot a "promo video" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as "a garage". New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat and Rimmer, Terry Farrell and Anthony Fuscle respectively (the end result being an all-Caucasian cast, which differed from the racially diverse UK original). Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show. Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up. (Farrell was cast almost immediately afterwards for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, in which she was cast as Jadzia Dax.)
The cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of Red Dwarf USA, particularly the part of Lister who is portrayed in the British version as a likable slob but in the US version as somewhat clean cut. In the 2004 documentary Dwarfing USA, Danny John-Jules said the only actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was John Belushi. In a 2009 interview on Kevin Pollak's Chat Show, Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a "huge mistake" and also said a "John Belushi type" would have been better suited to the role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?p=68|title=Kevin Pollak's Chat Show Episode 28 – Craig Bierko|date=2 August 2009[/tpl]
The American pilot has been heavily bootlegged, but it has never been broadcast on TV in any country. Excerpts from the first pilot are included in Dwarfing USA, a featurette on the making of the pilots included on the DVD release of Red Dwarf's fifth series. Because of rights clearance issues, no footage from the second pilot is included in the featurette.

===Film===

Since the end of the eighth series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been attempting to make a feature length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was genuine and had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/archive/making_the_movie.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070710221153/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/archive/making_the_movie.html | archivedate=2007-07-10 | title =Making The Movie | publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07[/tpl] Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set in the distant future where Homo sapienoids - a fearsome flesh machine hybrid race — had taken over the solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... Red Dwarf.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm | title =Red Dwarf The movie | publisher =www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080204141520/http://www.thereddwarfzone.co.uk/movie.htm#filming  | archivedate =2008-02-04[/tpl]
Naylor had scouted Australia to get an idea of locations and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a44838/cult-spy-red-dwarf-the-movie-that-never-was.html | title =Red Dwarf — The Movie That Never Was | publisher =www.digitalspy.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-07[/tpl]
Contents from early drafts of the film were eventually used in the Series X finale "The Beginning".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/5045568.article | title =Red Dwarf X, Dave | publisher =www.broadcastnow.co.uk |accessdate =2012-11-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ganymede.tv/2012/08/doug-naylor-broadcast-interview/ | title =Doug Naylor Broadcast Interview | publisher =http://www.ganymede.tv |accessdate =2012-11-09[/tpl]

===Roleplaying game===

Deep7 LLC released Red Dwarf - The Roleplaying Game in February 2003 (although the printed copyright is 2002).[tpl]cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG at Deep7 | publisher = Deep7 | url=http://www.deep7.com/product.php?cat=reddwarf | accessdate = 2008-09-29 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080913040308/http://www.deep7.com/product.php?cat=reddwarf  | archivedate = 2008-09-13[/tpl] Based on the series, the game allows its players to portray original characters within the Red Dwarf universe. Player characters can be human survivors, holograms, evolved house pets (cats, dogs, iguanas, rabbits, rats and mice), various types of mechanoid (Series 4000, Hudzen 10 and Waxdroids in the corebook, Series 3000 in the Extra Bits Book) or GELFs (Kinatawowi and Pleasure GELF in the corebook, "Vindaloovians" in the Extra Bits Book).
A total of three products were released for the game: the core 176-page rulebook, the AI Screen (analogous to the Game Master's Screen used in other roleplaying games, also featuring the "Extra Bits Book" booklet), and the Series Sourcebook.[tpl]cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG at GameWyrd | publisher = GameWyrd |url=http://www.gamewyrd.com/review/469 | accessdate = 2008-09-29 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080820032605/http://www.gamewyrd.com/review/469  | archivedate = 2008-08-20[/tpl] The Series Sourcebook contains plot summaries of each episode of every series as well as game rules for all major and minor characters from each series.
The game has been praised for staying true to the comedic nature of the series, for its entertaining writing, and for the detail to which the background material is explained.[tpl]cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG review at scifi.com | publisher = scifi.com | url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/games.html | accessdate = 2008-09-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513083215/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue326/games.html |archivedate = 13 May 2008[/tpl] However, some reviewers found the game mechanics to be simplistic and uninspiring compared to other science fiction roleplaying games on the market.[tpl]cite web | title = Red Dwarf RPG review  at Realms | publisher = Realms.org.uk | url=http://www.realms.org.uk/cms/articles/reddwarfreview | accessdate = 2008-09-29[/tpl]

===Red Dwarf Night===

On 14 February 1998, the night before the tenth anniversary of the show's pilot episode broadcast, BBC2 devoted an evening of programmes to the series, under the banner of Red Dwarf Night. The evening consisted of a mixture of new and existing material, and was introduced and linked by actor and fan Patrick Stewart. In addition, a series of special take-offs on BBC2's idents, featuring the "2" logo falling in love with a skutter, were used.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=7&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath | title =Red Dwarf Series VII Aftermath| publisher =www.reddwarf.co.uk |accessdate =2008-02-04[/tpl] The night began with Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg, a spoof of the cookery programme Can't Cook, Won't Cook, presented by that show's host Ainsley Harriott who had himself appeared as a GELF in the series VI episode "Emohawk: Polymorph II". Taking place outside the continuity of the series, two teams (Kryten and Lister versus Rimmer and Cat, although Cat quickly departs to be replaced by alter ego Duane Dibbley) were challenged to make the best chicken vindaloo.
After a compilation bloopers show, featuring out-takes, the next programme was Universe Challenge, a spoof of University Challenge. Hosted by original University Challenge presenter Bamber Gascoigne, the show had a team of knowledgeable Dwarf fans compete against a team consisting of Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Robert Llewellyn, Chloë Annett and Danny John Jules. This was followed by The Red Dwarf A–Z, a half-hour documentary that chose a different aspect of the show to focus on for each letter of the alphabet. Talking heads on the episode included Stephen Hawking, Terry Pratchett, original producer Paul Jackson, and Patrick Stewart. Finally, the night ended with a showing of the episode "Gunmen of the Apocalypse".
