Knighton  [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|t|ə|n[/tpl] (Welsh: Tref-y-clawdd [tpl]IPA-cy|trɛvəˈklauð[/tpl] or Trefyclo) is a small market town and community situated chiefly in Powys, Wales, within the historic county boundaries of Radnorshire. Lying on the River Teme, the town straddles the English-Welsh border; Knighton railway station, as well as a small part of the town's built-up area, is located in Shropshire, England. Knighton is the sixth largest town in Powys. The name Knighton derives from Old English meaning 'A settlement of knights' or 'knights town'. This was both an Anglo-Saxon and later a Norman fortified boundary, a place where knights protected the borderlands from Welsh invaders. Tref-y-clawdd is not translated means 'town on the dyke' and not Knighton. If you were to translate Knighton into Welsh it would be called Tref marchogion or Aheddiad o farchogionn.

==History==

The name Knighton probably derives from the Old English words cniht and tūn meaning, respectively, "... a soldier, personal follower, young man, servant, thane, freeman" and "... farm, settlement, homestead". This implies that the settlement was perhaps founded as the result of a grant of land to freemen.[tpl]cite web | author=Institute for Name Studies| title=A Key to English Place-Names (Knighton Staffs but sharing same etymology |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=10017| accessdate=15 July 2009 [/tpl] By contrast the Welsh name officially given to the town in 1971 (Tref-y-Clawdd) is more straightforward and translates simply as the town on the dyke.

Inhabitants are Knightonians','Knightoners' or merely . . . from Knighton''.

Inevitably, Knighton's earliest history is obscure but there are local clues: Caer Caradoc (an Iron Age hillfort associated with Caradoc or Caractacus) is [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|0[/tpl] away and just off the road towards Clun.[tpl]cite web | author=| title= The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland (1868) |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/RAD/Knighton/Gaz1868.html| accessdate=19 February 2007 [/tpl] Watling Street, a Roman road, passes a few miles to the east at Leintwardine.
Any settlements around the Knighton area would have been part of the ancient Celtic kingdom of Cornovii which consisted of the modern-day counties as Cheshire, Shropshire, North Staffordshire, North Herefordshire, parts of Powys and Worcestershire.
Knighton is known for a well preserved section of Offa's Dyke. Intriguingly, Wat's Dyke also runs parallel to Offa's Dyke and a few miles to the east. An earthwork that runs north-south along the English/Welsh border from Basingwerk near Holywell to Oswestry.
The dykes aside, two Norman castles, constructed in the 12th century, are the oldest survivors in modern Knighton. The town became a borough in 1203, with a charter permitting a weekly market and annual fair.[tpl]cite web | author= | title= Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust|url= http://www.cpat.org.uk/educate/leaflets/medieval/medieval.htm | accessdate=19 February 2007 [/tpl] The castle was besieged by Owain Glyndŵr in 1402 and the castle and much of the town were destroyed.[tpl]cite book | author= Christopher Catling, Ronnie Catling| title= Glyndŵr's Way: A Welsh National Trail |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=hj7bx1cQDksC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=knighton+glyndwr+destroyed&source=web&ots=YktKeBOfZt&sig=xHzDY4lzA5IWxO8Lj8vP0f32cI4 | accessdate=19 February 2007 [/tpl] The major battle of the rebellion was fought at Pilleth (Welsh: Bryn Glas) [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of the town in the same year.
The town's church dates from the 11th century,  but much of it was rebuilt in the 19th century. It is one of only two in Wales dedicated to St Edward; the patron saint of England before St George. This dedication to an English saint is a symptom of the dual English/Welsh nature of the town that was not legally resolved until 1535 when Knighton was finally confirmed as part of Wales by the Acts of Union.[tpl]cite web | author= | title= AD 1535 Anno vicesimo septimo Henrici VIII c. 26 |url= http://owain.vaughan.com/1535c26/#section6 | accessdate=15 June 2009 [/tpl] Knighton also has a Baptist chapel and a small Catholic church.
Knighton first prospered as a centre of the wool trade in the 15th century[tpl]cite web | author= Samuel Lewis| title= 'Killymaenllwyd – Knighton', A Topographical Dictionary of Wales (1849), pp. 456–459 |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47839 | accessdate=15 June 2009 [/tpl] and was later an important point on the two drover routes from Montgomery to Hereford, and from London to Aberystwyth. Otherwise, Knighton was remote from the centres of commerce. It seemed likely that the railway revolution would also fail to reach the town; the 1840s and 1850s saw considerable railway building right across Great Britain but Radnorshire had a small population and little industry. The construction of the railway was made economically viable – just – by an entrepreneurial drive to connect the Mumbles and Milford Haven with the cities and factories of the industrial Midlands. The Knighton Railway Company was formed by local landowners and businessmen to build a line from Craven Arms to the town.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Seal of the Knighton Railway company|url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10271139&wwwflag=2&imagepos=1| accessdate=20 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author= | title=Powys County Council – transport in Knighton and district|url=http://history.powys.org.uk/school1/knighton/train2.shtml| accessdate=20 November 2007[/tpl] Work began in August 1858 and the line reached Knighton in March 1861. The station itself was built in 1865.

To mark the accession of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 the initials "ER" were planted out in deciduous trees within an evergreen forest on the hill to the north of the town.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Go2 Shropshire|url=http://www.go2.co.uk/About_GO2_Pages/TheGO2GuidetoKni.html | accessdate=20 November 2007[/tpl]
In August 1970, Knighton hosted a rock festival with bands such as The Move and the somewhat more obscure Pete Brown & Piblokto, Roger Bunn, Forever More, Clark-Hutchinson, James Litherland's Brotherhood (James was originally part of Colosseum) and Killing Floor. Comperes were radio DJ Pete Drummond and local resident and bluesman Alexis Korner, who also performed.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Marmalade Skies – original poster of the Knighton Concert|url=http://www.marmalade-skies.co.uk/aug1970.htm | accessdate=20 November 2007[/tpl]

==Governance==

===Politics===

After the Acts of Union, Knighton was for nearly 450 years part of the traditional County of Radnorshire. In common with many ancient counties Radnorshire ceased to exist in 1974 and was subsumed in the county of Powys.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Cyngor Sir Powys County Council |url=http://www.powys.gov.uk/index.php?id=45&L=0| accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl]
The town council of 13 councillors elects a largely ceremonial mayor.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Knighton Town Council |url=http://community-councils.powys.org.uk/knighton/| accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl]  The mayor for 2008 is Ken Fincham.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Knighton Town Council |url=http://knightontown.net/nfMembers.asp?Section=Town%20Council&ButtonPressed=Sadmin9552| accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl]  Real municipal authority lies with Powys County Council. Above the county council, the National Assembly for Wales forms the next tier of government.
Knighton falls within the Westminster constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire and the current MP is Roger Williams – a Welsh Liberal Democrat. The Principality forms one large Wales European Parliamentary constituency.  It is part of the National Assembly for Wales constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire and represented by Kirsty Williams AM; she is also a Welsh Liberal Democrat. The town returns a single councillor to Powys County Council; currently Mr K Harris (2011).[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Hereford Times |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/8901989.Knighton_mayor_and_Platform_pals_planting_cherry_trees/| accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]

====English part====

The few roads and houses that lie across the border in England are part of the civil parish of Stowe, in the county of Shropshire. This is part of the Westminster constituency of Ludlow and the current MP is Philip Dunne – a Conservative. It also lies in the European Parliamentary Constituency of West Midlands (European Parliament constituency).

===Public services===

Knighton has a fire station served by a part-time crew and part of the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service. Knighton's police station is also part-time; the local force is Dyfed-Powys Police.
Knighton has a hospital on Ffrydd Road on the site of and using some of the former buildings of the workhouse. It has maternity facilities but no accident and emergency capacity. Primary care is provided by two GP practices and a Boots pharmacy.[tpl]cite web | author= |title=BBC Wales microsite |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/healthandfitness/pages/jimjoyceprice.shtml| accessdate=23 January 2008[/tpl]

Social housing is largely provided by two housing associations; one based in Wales (Mid Wales Housing Association) and another in England (South Shropshire Housing Association).

===Twinning===

Knighton has been twinned with the small French town of Varades since August 2009.

==Demography==

==Geography==

===Location===

Knighton is [tpl]convert|137|mi|km|0[/tpl] from the UK capital city, London; [tpl]convert|86|mi|km|0[/tpl] from the Welsh capital of Cardiff; and, [tpl]convert|19|mi|km|0[/tpl] from the county town, Llandrindod Wells. For the smaller part of Knighton that is in Shropshire, the district administrative centre of Ludlow is [tpl]convert|16|mi|km|0[/tpl] distant and the county town of Shrewsbury is [tpl]convert|34|mi|km|0[/tpl] away.
The town is remote but is connected with the following towns and villages.

Knighton is a nucleated settlement centred on the clock tower with limited ribbon development along the A roads.

===Geology and geomorphology===

Knighton is at [tpl]Coord|52|20|40|N|3|03|0|W| region:GB_type:city[/tpl]. It is in a sparsely populated tract of mid-Wales and the English border characterised by a hilly plateau cut by narrow river-valleys with a broadly east-west axis. To the west, ground rises steeply towards Radnor Forest, and to the north, more gently, to the summit of Clun Forest. Turning east, the elevation falls gently to the Shropshire Plain.  To the south of the town stands Llan Wen hill.

The town centre lies at circa [tpl]convert|174|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level although the surrounding hills – Bailey Hill the highest – rise to [tpl]convert|418|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level.  The only major river is the River Teme.

According to Samuel Lewis (a mid 19th century visitor):

[tpl]quote|.... at the head of a deep vale sheltered on all sides by hills of lofty elevation, crowned with timber of luxuriant growth, and commanding extensive and finely varied prospects over the surrounding country[tpl]cite web | author= Samuel Lewis | title=Killymaenllwyd – Knighton – A Topographical Dictionary of Wales (1849)|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47839|accessdate=19 February 2007|authorlink= Samuel Lewis (publisher)[/tpl][/tpl]

===Climate===

The average temperature and rainfall figures taken between 1971 and 2000 at the Met Office weather station in Shawbury, are set out in the table below. Although [tpl]convert|35|mi|km|0[/tpl] away, Shawbury is the nearest recording station and has a similar climate. Knighton is in the rain shadow of the Cambrian Mountains and consequently is slightly warmer and substantially drier than the Wales average.Met Office average weather statistics for Wales 1971 to 2000
