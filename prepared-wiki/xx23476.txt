He was born of an aristocratic and secular Scottish family. A precocious boy, he was able to read at age three and was well versed with scientific terminology. His higher education was in mathematics and classics at New College, Oxford. He had no formal degree in science, but was an accomplished biologist. Since he was eight years old he worked with his physiologist father John Scott Haldane in their home laboratory. With his father he published his first scientific paper at age 20, while he was only a graduate student. His education was interrupted by the First World War during which he fought in the British Army. When the war ended he resumed as research fellow at Oxford. Between 1922 and 1932 he taught biochemistry at Trinity College, Cambridge. After a year as visiting professor at University of California at Berkeley, in 1933 he became full Professor of Genetics at University College London. He emigrated to India in 1956 to enjoy a lifetime opportunity of not "wearing socks". He worked at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and later in Orissa (now Odisha), where he spent the rest of his life.
His first paper in genetics, written with his sister Naomi, published in 1915 became a landmark as the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals. His subsequent works helped to establish a unification of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Along with Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright, he laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary synthesis, the concept more popularly known as "neo-Darwinism" (popularised by Richard Dawkins' 1976 work titled The Selfish Gene). Their pionering combination of mathematics with biology established a branch of science called population genetics. His article on "The origin of life" in 1929, though initially rejected, introduced a new hypothesis "primordial soup theory", now called abiogenesis, the process of formation of cellular life from inorganic molecules on primordial Earth. Independently developed by Russian biochemist Alexander Oparin, the concept came to be called Oparin-Haldane hypothesis, and is the foundation of modern understanding of the chemical origin of life. Haldane was also the first to construct human gene map for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome. His "malaria hypothesis" was confirmed to be the genetic basis of resistance to malaria among people with sickle-cell disease.
Haldane was socialist and a staunch Marxist. He served as chairman of the editorial board of Daily Worker, a Communist newspaper in London, between 1940 and 1949. However, disillusioned by the totalitarian Lysenkoism in Communist Russia, he denounced the party though he continued to admire Vladimir Lenin. Since childhood he was known to have strong opposition towards any form of authoritarianism. It was this political dissent made him leave England and became a "proud" citizen of India. He was particularly critical of Britain's role in the Suez Crisis for which he accused Britain as violating international law.
A renowned atheist, humanist, self-experimenter and prolific author, Haldane is remembered for his several extraordinary visions and witty remarks. He was the first to suggest the central idea of in vitrofertilisation (more popularly "test tube baby"), fictionalised in his book Daedalus. The concept of hydrogen economy for generating power originated from his Cambridge speech in 1923. Many scientific terms including cis, trans, coupling, repulsion, darwin (as unit of evolution). He also coined the term "clone" to describe the possibility of creating exact copies of humans. His imminent death due to colorectal cancer was lamented by himself in a poem Cancer's a Funny Thing. He willed his body for medical studies, as he wanted to remain useful even in death.[tpl]cite book|last=Yount|first=Lisa|title=A to Z of Biologists|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781438109176|pages=113–115|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pOdHrsTZ-RYC&dq[/tpl]

==Biography==

===Family background===

Haldane was born in Oxford to John Scott Haldane, a physiologist, and Louisa Kathleen Haldane (née Trotter), and descended from an aristocratic intellectual Scottish family (see Haldane family).[tpl]cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=JS Haldane, JBS Haldane, L Hill, and A Siebe: A brief resumé of their lives. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6016 |accessdate=12 July 2008 [/tpl] (He would later claim that his Y-chromosome could be traced back to Robert the Bruce, a thirteenth-century Scottish king.)[tpl]cite journal|last=Hedrick|first=Larry|title=J.B.S. Haldane: A Legacy in Several Worlds|journal=The World & I Online|year=1989|url=http://www.worldandischool.com/public/1989/december/school-resource15482.asp[/tpl] His younger sister, Naomi, became a writer. His uncle was Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, politician and one time Secretary of State for War; his aunt was the author Elizabeth Haldane. His father was a scientist, a philosopher and a Liberal, and his mother was a Conservative. Haldane took an interest in his father’s work very early in childhood. It was the result of this lifelong study of the natural world and his devotion to empirical evidence that he became an atheist. He felt that atheism was the only rational deduction available in light of all the evidence, saying, "My practice as a scientist is atheistic. That is to say, when I set up an experiment I assume no god, angel or devil is going to interfere with its course... I should therefore be intellectually dishonest if I were not also atheistic in the affairs of the world."Haldane, J. B. S., Fact and Faith. London: London, Watts & Co., 1934.

===Early life and education===

Haldane grew up in 11 Crick Road, North Oxford.[tpl]cite web|title=J. S. Haldane (1860–1936)|url=http://www.oxfordshireblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/haldane.html|publisher=Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board|accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl] A child prodigy, and influenced by his father, he learned to read and was already familiar with some scientific terminologies at age three. At four he injured himself on a forehead, and while a doctor was cleaning his blood, he asked, “Is this oxyhemoglobin or carboxyhemoglobin?”. His formal education began in 1897 at Oxford Preparatory School (now Dragon School), where his mathematical ability earned him several prizes including First Scholarship in 1904 to Eton. In 1899 his family moved to "Cherwell", a late Victorian house at the outskirts of Oxford having its private laboratory. It was in this laboratory that Haldane had his only scientific education. At age eight he joined his father in the laboratory where he experienced his first self-experimentation, the method he would later be famous for. They both would in turn served as their own "human guinea pigs" such as in their investigation on the effects of poison gases. In 1905 he joined Eton, where he experienced severe abuse from senior students on his part as being arrogant. The indifference of the authority left him with a lasting hatred for English education system. However the ordeal did not stop him from becoming Captain of the school. In 1911 he continued at New College, Oxford, and obtained first-class honours in mathematical moderations in 1912. He became engrossed in genetics and presented a paper on gene linkage in vertebrates in the summer of 1912. In June his first technical paper, a 30-page long article on haemoglobin function, was published, as a co-author alongside his father.[tpl]cite journal|last=Douglas|first=CG|coauthors=Haldane, JS; Haldane, JB|title=The laws of combination of haemoglobin with carbon monoxide and oxygen|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1912|volume=44|issue=4|pages=275–304|pmid=16993128|pmc=1512793[/tpl] He did all the mathematics. In the fall he changed his course to Greats (Classics covering ancient history and philosophy). He completed with first-class honours in 1914. He never earned any degree in science, as the First World War broke out.[tpl]cite book|last=Dronamraju|first=Krishna|title=Haldane, Mayr, and beanbag genetics|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199813346|pages=114–115|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=G1Imc_vSEgoC&dq[/tpl]

===Career===

Haldane joined the British Army during the First World War in the Black Watch regiment, being commissioned a second lieutenant on 15 August 1914.The London Gazette, 26 May 1915 He served in France and Iraq. Between 1919 and 1922 he was a Fellow of New College, Oxford, where he researched physiology and genetics. He then moved to the Cambridge University, where he accepted a Readership in Biochemistry at Trinity College and taught until 1932. During his nine years at Cambridge, Haldane worked on enzymes and genetics, particularly the mathematical side of genetics. He was also the Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution from 1930 to 1932. In 1932 he was a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley. The next year in 1933 he was appointed as Professor of Genetics at University College London, where he spent most of his academic career.[tpl]cite web|title=Full view of record Haldane|url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqSearch=RefNo==%27HALDANE%27&dsqDb=Catalog|work=UCL Archives|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|accessdate=19 February 2014[/tpl] Four years later he became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London.

===Physiology===

Following his father's expertise, Haldane's earliest works were in the study of blood. His first scientific publication was on the mechanism of gaseous exchange by haemoglobin. His subsequent works on the properties of blood became classic research.[tpl]cite journal|last=Davies|first=HW|coauthors=Haldane, JB; Kennaway, EL|title=Experiments on the regulation of the blood's alkalinity: I|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1920|volume=54|issue=1-2|pages=32–45|pmid=16993473[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=JB|title=Experiments on the regulation of the blood's alkalinity: II|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1921|volume=55|issue=3-4|pages=265–75|pmid=16993510[/tpl] He investigated several aspects of kidney functions and mechanism of excretion.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baird|first=MM|coauthors=Haldane, JB|title=Salt and water elimination in man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1922|volume=56|issue=3-4|pages=259–62|pmid=16993567[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Davies|first=HW|coauthors=Haldane, JB; Peskett, GL|title=The excretion of chlorides and bicarbonates by the human kidney|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1922|volume=56|issue=5|pages=269–74|pmid=16993528[/tpl]
In 1925, with G. E. Briggs, Haldane derived a new interpretation of the enzyme kinetics law described by Victor Henri in 1903, different from the 1913 Michaelis–Menten equation. Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten assumed that enzyme (catalyst) and substrate (reactant) are in fast equilibrium with their complex, which then dissociates to yield product and free enzyme. The Briggs–Haldane equation was of the same algebraic form, but their derivation is based on the quasi steady state approximation, that is the concentration of intermediate complex (or complexes) does not change. As a result, the microscopic meaning of the "Michaelis Constant" (Km) is different. Although commonly referring it as Michaelis–Menten kinetics, most of the current models actually use the Briggs–Haldane derivation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Briggs|first=GE|coauthors=Haldane, JB|title=A Note on the Kinetics of Enzyme Action|journal=The Biochemical journal|year=1925|volume=19|issue=2|pages=338–9|pmid=16743508|pmc=125918[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Chen|first=W.

===Genetics and evolution===

Haldane made many contributions to genetics and was the first to demonstrate linkage in mammals,[tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=J. B. S.|coauthors=Sprunt, A. D.; Haldane, N. M.|title=Reduplication in mice (Preliminary Communication)|journal=Journal of Genetics|year=1915|volume=5|issue=2|pages=133–135|doi=10.1007/BF02985370[/tpl] as well as chicken.[tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=JB|title=Linkage in poultry|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|year=1921|volume=54|issue=1409|page=663|pmid=17816160[/tpl]  He was one of the three major figures to develop the mathematical theory of population genetics. He is usually regarded as the third of these in importance, after R. A. Fisher and Sewall Wright. His greatest contribution was in a series of ten papers on "A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection", which was a major series of papers on the mathematical theory of natural selection. It treated many major cases for the first time, showing the direction and rates of changes of gene frequencies. It also pioneered in investigating the interaction of natural selection with mutation and with migration. Haldane's book, The Causes of Evolution (1932), summarised these results, especially in its extensive appendix. This body of work was a component of what came to be known as the "modern evolutionary synthesis", re-establishing natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics.[tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=JB|title=A mathematical theory of natural and artificial selection--I. 1924|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|year=1990|volume=52|issue=1-2|pages=209–40; discussion 201–7|pmid=2185859[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=JB|title=The theory of natural selection today|journal=Nature|year=1959|volume=183|issue=4663|pages=710–3|pmid=13644170[/tpl]
Haldane proposed the so-called "malaria hypothesis" in 1949 whereby he suggested that genetic disorders in humans living in malaria-endemic regions provide beneficial characters, and affected people are immune to malaria itself. He noted that red blood cell mutations such as sickle-cell anemia and various thalassemias were prevalent only in tropical regions where malaria was endemic. For example, most Africans did not suffer from malaria as would be expected. He predicted that such genetic disorders were favourable traits under natural selection that prevented individuals from malarial infection.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sabeti|first=Pardis C|title=Natural selection: uncovering mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation to infectious disease|journal=Nature Education|year=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=13|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/natural-selection-uncovering-mechanisms-of-evolutionary-adaptation-34539[/tpl] This concept of resistance to malaria was eventually confirmed by A.C. Allison in 1954.[tpl]cite journal|last=Allison|first=AC|title=The distribution of the sickle-cell trait in East Africa and elsewhere, and its apparent relationship to the incidence of subtertian malaria|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=1954|volume=48|issue=4|pages=312–8|pmid=13187561[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Hedrick|first=Philip W|title=Resistance to malaria in humans: the impact of strong, recent selection|journal=Malaria Journal|year=2012|volume=11|issue=1|page=349|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-349|pmid=23088866[/tpl]
Haldane introduced many quantitative approaches in biology such as in his essay On Being the Right Size. His contributions to theoretical population genetics and statistical human genetics included the first methods using maximum likelihood for estimation of human linkage maps, and pioneering methods for estimating human mutation rates. He was the first to estimate rate of mutation in humans, at 2 × 10−5 mutations per gene per generation for the X-linked haemophilia gene, and to introduce the idea of a "cost of natural selection".[tpl]cite journal|last=Haldane|first=J. B. S.|title=The rate of spontaneous mutation of a human gene|journal=Journal of Genetics|year=1935|volume=31|issue=3|pages=317–326|doi=10.1007/BF02982403[/tpl]
Haldane is also known for an observation from his essay On Being the Right Size, which Jane Jacobs and others have since referred to as Haldane's principle.  This is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have:  "Insects, being so small, do not have oxygen-carrying bloodstreams.  What little oxygen their cells require can be absorbed by simple diffusion of air through their bodies.  But being larger means an animal must take on complicated oxygen pumping and distributing systems to reach all the cells."   The conceptual metaphor to animal body complexity has been of use in energy economics and secession ideas.[tpl]cite book|last=Marvin|first=Stephen|title=Dictionary of Scientific Principles|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chicester|isbn=9781118582244|page=140[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Commons|first=House of|title=Putting science and engineering at the heart of Government policy : eighth report of session 2008-09|year=2009|publisher=The Stationery Office|location=London|isbn=9780215540348|page=40|coauthors=Innovation, ; Universities, ; Science, ; Committee, Skills[/tpl]

===Origin of life===

Haldane introduced the modern concept on the chemical origin of life. He propounded the theory in an eight-page article titled "The origin of life" in Rationalist Annual in 1929. According to Haldane's postulate the primitive ocean was a "vast chemical laboratory" containing a mixture of inorganic compounds – like a "hot dilute soup" (as imagined by Charles Darwin in 1871) – in which organic compounds could have formed. Under the solar energy the oxygenless atmosphere containing carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapour gave rise to a variety of organic compounds, "living or half-living things". The first molecules reacted with one another to produce more complex compounds, and ultimately the cellular components. At some point a kind of "oily film" was produced that enclosed self-reproducing molecules, thereby becoming the first cell. J.D. Bernal named the hypothesis biopoiesis or biopoesis, the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but nonliving molecules. The idea was generally dismissed as "wild speculation".[tpl]cite book|last=Fry|first=Iris|title=The Emergence of Life on Earth: A Historical and Scientific Overview|year=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=9780813527406|pages=65–66, 71–74|url=http://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Emergence_of_Life_on_Earth.html?id=6KoRvUeUUuEC&redir_esc=y[/tpl] In 1924 Alexander Oparin had suggested similar idea in Russian, and in 1936 he introduced it to the English-speaking people. The experimental basis of the theory began in 1953 with the classic Miller–Urey experiment. Since then the primordial soup theory became a dominant theory in the chemistry of life, and often is attributed as Oparin-Haldane hypothesis.[tpl]cite web|last=Gordon-Smith|first=Chris|title=The Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis|url=http://www.simsoup.info/Origin_Landmarks_Oparin_Haldane.html|accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Oparin-Haldane Theory of the Origin of Life|url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/vrchemistry/chapter26/page10.htm|publisher=Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford|accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lazcano|first=A.|title=Historical development of origins research|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2010|volume=2|issue=11|pages=a002089–a002089|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002089|pmid=20534710|pmc=2964185[/tpl]

===Experimentation===

Haldane's first experiment, independent of his father, was with his sister Naomi. They started their work in 1908 investigating Mendelian genetics. They initially used guinea pigs, but switched to mice as experimental models. Their research titled "Reduplication in mice" was published in 1915, which became their first technical work in genetics. He later preferred self-experimentation because he experienced that most of the time 'it is difficult to be sure how a rabbit feels at any time. Indeed many rabbits make no serious attempt to cooperate with scientists'. Continuing his father's method, he would readily exposed himself to danger to obtain data. To test the effects of acidification of the blood he drank dilute hydrochloric acid, enclosed himself in an airtight room containing 7% carbon dioxide, andn found that it 'gives one a rather violent headache'. One experiment to study elevated levels of oxygen saturation triggered a fit which resulted in him suffering crushed vertebrae.[tpl]cite journal|title=The unexpected always happens|journal=Investigative Genetics|year=2012|volume=3|issue=1|page=5|doi=10.1186/2041-2223-3-5|pmid=22357349|author=Jobling MA|pmc=3298498[/tpl] In his decompression chamber experiments, he and his volunteers suffered perforated eardrums, but, as Haldane stated in What is Life, "the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment."Bryson, Bill.

===Awards and honours===

Haldane was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1932. The French Government conferred him its National Order of the Legion of Honour in 1937. In 1952, he received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society. In 1956, he was awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. He received the Feltrinelli Prize from Academia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1961. He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Science, an Honorary Fellowship at New College, the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Anthropological Institute, and the Kimber Award of the US National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1958.[tpl]cite web|last=Mahanti|first=Subodh|title=John Burdon Sanderson Haldane: The Ideal of a Polymath|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/JBSHaldane.htm|work=Vigyan Prasar Science Portal|accessdate=19 February 2014[/tpl]

===Marriage===

In 1924, Haldane met Charlotte Burghes (née Franken), a young reporter for the Daily Express. So that they could marry, Charlotte divorced her husband, Jack Burghes, causing some controversy. Haldane was almost dismissed from Cambridge for the way he handled his meeting with her, which led to the divorce. They married in 1926.  Following their separation in 1942, the Haldanes divorced in 1945. He later married Helen Spurway.

===Political views===

Haldane became a socialist during the First World War, supported the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, and finally became a Communist. He was an enthusiastic, dialectical materialist Marxist, and wrote many articles in the Communist Daily Worker. He was the chairman of the editorial board of the London edition from 1940 to 1949.  His vision of the Socialist principle can be considered pragmatic. In On Being the Right Size, Haldane doubted that socialism could be operated on the scale of the British Empire or the United States or, implicitly, the Soviet Union: "while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious possibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely socialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a hippopotamus jumping a hedge."
In 1937, Haldane became a Marxist and an open supporter of the Communist Party, although not a member of the party. In 1938, he proclaimed enthusiastically that "I think that Marxism is true." He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1942. The first edition of his children's book My Friend Mr. Leakey contained an avowal of his Party membership which was removed from later editions.  Events in the Soviet Union, such as the rise of Trofim Lysenko and the crimes of Joseph Stalin, may have caused him to break with the Party later in life, although he showed a partial support of Lysenko and Stalin. Pressed to speak out about the rise of Lysenkoism and the persecution of geneticists in the Soviet Union as anti-Darwinist and the denouncement of genetics as incompatible with dialectical materialism, Haldane shifted the focus to the United Kingdom and a criticism of the dependence of scientific research on financial patronage.  In 1941 Haldane wrote about the Soviet trial of his friend and fellow geneticist Nikolai Vavilov:
His ambiguous attitude toward the persecution of Vavilov was explicable by the atmosphere of the period, where supporters of Communism needed to be unequivocal. His attitude changed dramatically at the end of the Second World War, when Lysenkoism reached a totalitarian influence in the Communist movement. He then became an explicit critic of the regime.  He left the Party in 1950, shortly after considering standing for Parliament as a Communist Party candidate. He continued to admire Stalin, describing him in 1962 as "a very great man who did a very good job".

===India===

In 1956, Haldane left his post at University College London, and moved to Calcutta, where he joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). Haldane's move to India was influenced by a number of factors. Officially he stated that his chief political reason was in response to the Suez Crisis. He wrote: "Finally, I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law." His interest in India was also because of his interest in biological research, belief that the warm climate would do him good, and that India offered him freedom and shared socialist dreams.[tpl]cite journal|title=On Some Aspects of the Life and Work of John Burdon Sanderson Haldane, F.R.S., in India|author=Krishna R.

The university sacked her and Haldane followed suit. On his lighter side his "reason for settling in India was to avoid wearing socks," and he concluded, "Sixty years in socks in enough."[tpl]cite book|last=deJong-Lambert|first=William|title=The Cold War Politics of Genetic Research: An Introduction to the Lysenko Affair|year=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400728394|page=150|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GzxvfRbIMbAC&pg|edition=2012.[/tpl] This could be partly true because Haldane always dressed up in Indian clothes, and was often mistaken to be a Hindu priest or guru.
At the ISI, he headed the biometry unit and spent time researching a range of topics and guiding other researchers around him. He was keenly interested in inexpensive research and he wrote to Julian Huxley about his observations on Vanellus malabaricus, the Yellow-wattled Lapwing, boasting that he observed them from the comfort of his backyard. Haldane took an interest in anthropology, human genetics and botany. He advocated the use of Vigna sinensis (cowpea) as a model for studying plant genetics. He took an interest in the pollination of the common weed Lantana camara. The quantitative study of biology was his main focus and he lamented that Indian universities forced those who took up biology to give up on an education in mathematics.[tpl]cite journal|author=Majumder PP|year=1998|title=Haldane's Contributions to Biological Research in India|journal=Resonance|pages=32–35|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Dec1998/pdf/Dec1998p32-35.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1007/BF02838095|volume=3|issue=12[/tpl] Haldane took an interest in the study of floral symmetry. His wife, Helen Spurway, conducted studies on wild silk moths. In January 1961 they befriended the young Canadian lepidopterist Gary Botting, who initially visited the Indian Statistical Institute to share the results of his experiments hybridising silk moths of the genus Antheraea. Uncomfortable with Haldane's "communist" sympathies, the United States cultural attache, Duncan Emery, summarily cancelled Gary Botting's attendance at a high-profile banquet to which the Haldanes had invited him to meet biologists from all over India. Haldane protested this "insult" by going on a much-publicized hunger strike.“Haldane on Fast: Insult by USIS Alleged,” Times of India, 19 January 1961; “Protest Fast by Haldane: USIS’s “Anti-Indian Activities,” Times of India, 18 January 1961; “Situation was Misunderstood, Scholars Explain,” Times of India, 20 January 1961;  “USIS Explanation does not satisfy Haldane: Protest fast continues,” Times of India, 18 January 1961; “USIS Claim Rejected by Haldane: Protest Fast to Continue,” Times of India, 18 January 1961; “Haldane Not Satisfied with USIS Apology: Fast to Continue,” Free Press Journal, 18 January 1961; “Haldane Goes on Fast In Protest Against U.S. Attitude,” Times of India, 18 January 1961; “Haldane to continue fast: USIS explanation unsatisfactory,” Times of India, 19 January 1961; “Local boy in hunger strike row,” Toronto Star, 20 January 1961; “Haldane, Still on Fast, Loses Weight: U.S.I.S.

C. Mahalanobis, confronted Haldane about both the hunger strike and the unbudgeted banquet, Haldane resigned his post (in February 1961) and moved to a newly established biometry unit in Odisha.
Haldane eventually became an Indian citizen.India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy, Ramachandra Guha, Pan Macmillan, 2008, pp. 769 - 770 He was also interested in Hinduism and after his arrival he became a vegetarian and started wearing Indian clothes. In Kolkata, the busy connecting road from Eastern Metropolitan Bypass to Park Circus area on which the Science City is located, is named after him.  In 1961, Haldane described India as "the closest approximation to the Free World." His American friend, Jerzy Neyman, a professor of Statistics in the University of California, Berkeley, objected to this premise. Neyman gave his impression that "India has its fair share of scoundrels and a tremendous amount of poor unthinking and disgustingly subservient individuals who are not attractive." Haldane retorted:
When on 25 June 1962, six years after Haldane's move to India, he was described in print as a "Citizen of the World" by an American science writer, Groff Conklin, Haldane's response was as follows:

===Author and visionary===

Haldane was a famous science populariser. His essay Daedalus; or, Science and the Future (1924) was remarkable in predicting many scientific advances but has been criticised for presenting a too idealistic view of scientific progress. Haldane’s book shows the effect of the separation between sexual life and pregnancy as a satisfactory one on human psychology and social life. The book was regarded as shocking science fiction at the time, being the first book about ectogenesis (the development of foetuses in artificial wombs) - "test tube babies", brought to life without sexual intercourse or pregnancy. His book, A.R.P. (Air Raid Precautions) (1938) combined his physiological research into the effects of stress upon the human body with his experience of air raids during the Spanish Civil War to provide a scientific explanation of the air raids that Britain was to endure during the Second World War, then imminent. Haldane wrote many popular essays on science; in 1927 these were collected and published in a volume titled Possible Worlds.
Haldane was a friend of the author Aldous Huxley, who parodied him in the novel Antic Hay (1923) as Shearwater, "the biologist too absorbed in his experiments to notice his friends bedding his wife". Haldane's discourse in Daedalus on ectogenesis was an influence on Huxley's Brave New World (1932) which features a eugenic society. Haldane's work was also admired by Gerald Heard."Mr. Wells' Apocalypse" by Gerald Heard. The Nineteenth Century, October 1933. Reprinted in The H. G. Wells Scrapbook by Peter Haining. London : New English Library, 1978. ISBN 0450037789 (pp. 108-114).
Haldane was one of those, along with Olaf Stapledon, Charles Kay Ogden, I. A. Richards, and H. G. Wells, whom C. S. Lewis accused of scientism, "the belief that the supreme moral end is the perpetuation of our own species, and that this is to be pursued even if, in the process of being fitted for survival, our species has to be stripped of all those things for which we value it—of pity, of happiness, and of freedom." Shortly after the third book of the Ransom Trilogy appeared, J.B.S. Haldane criticised all three of them in an article titled "Auld Hornie, F.R.S.". The title reflects the sarcastic tone of the article, Auld Hornie being the pet name given to the devil by the Scots and F.R.S. standing for "Fellow of the Royal Society".  In the essay, Haldane attacked Lewis for scientific inaccuracies, as well as what Haldane saw as Lewis' "complete mischaracterisation of science, and his disparagement of the human race".Adams, Mark B., "The Quest for Immortality: Visions and Presentiments in Science and Literature", in Post, Stephen G., and Binstock, Robert H., The Fountain of Youth:Cultural, Scientific, and Ethical Perspectives on a Biomedical Goal. Oxford University Press, 2004; ISBN 0195170083 (p. 57-58). Lewis’s response, "A Reply to Professor Haldane", was never published during his lifetime and apparently never seen by Haldane. In it, Lewis claims that he was attacking scientism, not scientists, by challenging the view of some that the supreme goal of our species is to perpetuate itself at any expense.
Haldane wrote a popular book for children titled My Friend Mr Leakey (first published in 1937) which contained the stories "A Meal With a Magician", "A Day in the Life of a Magician", "Mr Leakey's Party", "Rats", "The Snake with the Golden Teeth", and "My Magic Collar Stud". It was reprinted several times – in 1944, 1971, and 1972 with illustrations by Quentin Blake. When he appears as a character in the stories, several of which are written in the first person, he describes his job as a professor, or: "Doing sums to make new kinds of primroses and cats".
Haldane edited Gary Botting's manuscript on the genetics of giant silk moths with marginal notes. In his preface to The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses, Dr. Botting wrote that when he was a teenager Haldane showed him many species of birds.[tpl]cite book|title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses|year=1984|page=xvi|author=Botting, Gary|chapter=Preface[/tpl] Botting credited Haldane with throwing him a "lifeline" in the form of a demonstrable manifestation of Darwinian evolution, which, decades later, "rescued" him from the perils of religious fundamentalism, in particular creationism, that he had faced in his youth. Half a century later, Botting still regarded his visit with J. B. S. Haldane and Helen Spurway as the single most influential existential experience of his life.Tihemme Gagnon, "Introduction," Streaking! The Collected Poems of Gary Botting, Miami: Strategic, 2013.
In 1923, in a talk given in Cambridge titled "Science and the Future", Haldane, foreseeing the exhaustion of coal for power generation in Britain, proposed a network of hydrogen-generating windmills. This is the first proposal of the hydrogen-based renewable energy economy.[tpl]cite web|title=An Early Vision of Transhumanism, and the First Proposal of a Hydrogen-Based Renewable Energy Economy|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=4107|publisher=Jeremy Norman & Co., Inc.|accessdate=19 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Hordeski|first=Michael Frank|title=Hydrogen & Fuel Cells: Advances in Transportation and Power|year=2009|publisher=The Fairmont Press, Inc.|location=Lilburn, GA|isbn=9780881735628|pages=202–203|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LfFIEQg1iioC&pg=PA202&lpg[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Demirbas|first=Ayhan|title=Biohydrogen For Future Engine Fuel Demands|year=2009|publisher=Springer London|location=London|isbn=9781848825116|page=106|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1w9DMBh7JOUC&dq|edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl]
In his An Autobiography in Brief, written shortly before his death in India, Haldane named four close associates as those showing promise to become illustrious scientists: T. A. Davis, K. R. Dronamraju, S. D. Jayakar and S. K. Roy."Selected Genetic Papers of JBS Haldane", pp. 19–24, New York: Garland, 1990
Haldane was the first to have thought the genetic basis of creating identical copies of humans, and eventually super-talented individuals. For this he coined the term "clone", deriving it from a Greek word klon, which means "twig".[tpl]cite book|last=Thomas|first=Isabel|title=Should scientists pursue cloning?|year=2013|publisher=Raintree|location=London|isbn=9781406233919|page=5[/tpl] He introduced the term in his speech on “Biological Possibilities for the Human Species of the Next Ten Thousand Years” at the Ciba Foundation Symposium on Man and his Future in 1963.[tpl]cite book|editor=Wolstenholme, Gordon|title=Man and his future|year=1963|publisher=J. & A.

===Death===

Shortly before his death from cancer, Haldane wrote a comic poem while in the hospital, mocking his own incurable disease; it was read by his friends, who appreciated the consistent irreverence with which Haldane had lived his life:
 
 "Cancer’s a Funny Thing: 
I wish I had the voice of Homer 
To sing of rectal carcinoma, 
This kills a lot more chaps, in fact, 
Than were bumped off when Troy was sacked..."

The poem ends:
 
 "...I know that cancer often kills, 
But so do cars and sleeping pills; 
And it can hurt one till one sweats, 
So can bad teeth and unpaid debts. 
A spot of laughter, I am sure, 
Often accelerates one’s cure; 
So let us patients do our bit 
To help the surgeons make us fit."New Statesman, 21 February 1964

Haldane died on 1 December 1964. He willed that his body be used for study at the Rangaraya Medical College, Kakinada.
 
 "My body has been used for both purposes during my lifetime and after my death, whether I continue to exist or not, I shall have no further use for it, and desire that it shall be used by others. Its refrigeration, if this is possible, should be a first charge on my estate."[tpl]cite book |last=Murty |first=K.
