==History==

Blackwell Island, which was called Welfare Island from 1921 to 1973 and is now known as Roosevelt Island, was purchased by New York City in 1828. Various facilities on the island were built including a penitentiary, almshouse, city hospital, the New York Lunatic Asylum, and the Smallpox Hospital.[tpl]cite web |title = Timeline of Island History | work = Roosevelt Island | publisher = nyc10044.com | url = http://nyc10044.com/timeln/timeline.html |accessdate = 18 October 2009[/tpl]
In 1872, the City of New York built a lighthouse. The supervising architect was James Renwick, Jr., who also designed several other buildings on the island for the Charities and Correction Board as well as more famous works such as St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Legends abound about the construction of the lighthouse. Two names, John McCarthy and Thomas Maxey, are associated with the various legends. The 1870 report of the warden of the lunatic asylum indicated that an industrious patient had built a seawall near the Asylum that had reclaimed land. The legends indicate that an inmate of the asylum built a fort to defend the island against a British invasion that he feared. Some versions indicate that he had incorporated Civil War cannons. The legend indicates that builder was bribed with bogus money to demolish the fort for the construction of the lighthouse. Other stories indicate that an Asylum inmate constructed the lighthouse. For many years, a saying was inscribed in a stone near the lighthouse:[tpl]cite book | last = Berdy | first = Judith | authorlink = |author2=Roosevelt Island Historical Society | title = Roosevelt Island | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year = 2003 | location = Charleston, South Carolina | pages = 43, 53â€“54 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rrzQeLPyvygC&pg=PA53&dq=blackwell+island+lighthouse&lr=#v=onepage&q=blackwell%20island%20lighthouse&f=false | isbn = 0-7385-1238-9[/tpl]  This is the work  Was done by  John McCarthy  Who built the Light  House from the bottom to the  Top All ye who do pass by may  Pray for his soul when he dies. 
The lighthouse was operated by the City instead of the U.S. Lighthouse Board. In its 1893 annual report, the Lighthouse Board generally praised the operations of Blackwell Island Lighthouse, but indicated that the Board had been unfairly criticized because of the City's occasional failure to keep the light in operation. The Board advocated banning private lights.[tpl]cite book | last = U. S.

The light was operated until about 1940. In the 1970s, the lighthouse was partially restored. The restoration was completed in 1998.

==Architecture==

The lighthouse is approximately [tpl]convert|50|ft[/tpl] tall. It is constructed of gray gneiss, rough ashlar that was quarried on the island by inmates from the penitentiary. It has an octagonal base and an octagonal shaft. There is an entrance on the south side under a projecting gable and a pointed Gothic arch. Two south-facing slit windows in the shaft light the interior. At the top of the shaft there is a band of ornamented corbels below the gallery, which is surrounded by an iron railing. The lantern is octagonal with a shallow conical roof.

The optics were provided by the U.S. Lighthouse Board.
