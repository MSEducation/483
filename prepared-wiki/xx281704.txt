[[Dancin' On the Back Streets]]

CATEGORIES: Hard rock albums by American artists, 2005 albums

Dancin' On the Back Streets is the third album by the late-80's hard rock band Blue Tears. The band was one of many that were swept under the rug when alternative and grunge arrived, leaving lots of unreleased material shelved.
Long after the band members got involved in other projects, some of these unreleased material started to surface on the Internet. Band leader Gregg Fulkerson decided to compile an album of most of this material and release it officially. This was the 2nd compilation album, released the same year as Mad, Bad and Dangerous. It was released December 5, 2005.
