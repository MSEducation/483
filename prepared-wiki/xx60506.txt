==Early life==

Yusuf was born as Mark Hanson to two academics  in Washington State and raised in Northern California. He grew up a practicing Greek Orthodox Christian and attended prep schools on both the east and west coasts. In 1977, after a near-death experience and reading the Qur'an, he converted to Islam from Chrisitanity (he seemed destined for the Greek Orthodox priesthood at his early age).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/08/religion.uk | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jack | last=O'Sullivan | title=If you hate the west, emigrate to a Muslim country | date=October 7, 2001[/tpl]

==Education==

Soon after converting, Yusuf moved to England, Spain, and eventually Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates to pursue serious study of Islam.Raquel Ukeles, The Evolving Muslim Community in America: The Impact of 9/11, p 101 There he primarily studied Arabic and also served as a muezzin of a local mosque. There he was introduced to Mauritanian scholars and began more serious study of various Islamic disciplines including Maliki fiqh. This eventually led him to travel to Mauritania itself in order to study directly with the renowned scholar and sage of the land, Sidi Muhammad ould Fahfu al-Massumi, more famously known as Murabit al-Hajj.Z. Grewal, Islam Is a Foreign Country: American Muslims and the Global Crisis of Authority, p 161 During his intermittent stays there, Yusuf both lived and studied directly with Murabit al-Hajj.Another Mother of the Believers | AE

Yusuf has taken a stance against religious justifications for terrorist attacks.Charles L. Cohen, Ronald L. Numbers, Gods in America: Religious Pluralism in the United States, p 186 He described the 9/11 attacks as "an act of 'mass murder, pure and simple'".
