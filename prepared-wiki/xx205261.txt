==History==

MedStar Harbor Hospital was originally named the South Baltimore Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital and was established by Dr. Harry Peterman in 1903. It was located on Light Street in what was then an industrial area of Baltimore City.
When the hospital outgrew its original location, it purchased [tpl]convert|12|acre[/tpl] from Broening Park, formerly the site of the Maryland Yacht Club. Construction of the present MedStar Harbor Hospital began in 1967 and was completed in 1968. The present location, with its close proximity to the Inner Harbor, inspired the name, Harbor Hospital.
In 1996, Harbor Hospital became part of Helix Health, a regional health care network. Helix merged with Medlantic Healthcare Group in 1998 and in 1999 was renamed MedStar Health. http://www.medstarhealth.org/body.cfm?id=33
