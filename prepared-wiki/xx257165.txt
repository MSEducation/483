==Parish history==

An Immaculate Conception parish church was around in 1892 for the German community, located at 151st Street, near Third Avenue.The World Almanac 1892 and Book of Facts (New York: Press Publishing, 1892), p.390. That, and other Immaculate Conceptions (on Manhattan's 14th Street and in Queens) are not connected with this parish.
"In December, 1902, Cardinal Farley assigned to the Rev. Joseph Cirringione the task of organizing the parish of the Immaculate Conception for the Italians of this neighborhood." In November 1903, Rev. Patrick J. Lennon succeeded in the pastorate and began the work of building a church, which was contributed to by Cardinal Farley, Msgr. Lavelle, and the Jesuits of St. Ignatius and St. Francis Xavier. That first church structure "was dedicated October 8, 1905. It is situated on the corner of Maple and Briggs Avenues." In 1914, "the congregation numbers about 1,500, and the value of the church property is estimated at $23,000."
