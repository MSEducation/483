South Bruny National Park is located on Bruny Island, Tasmania, Australia, about 50 km south of Hobart.  The park contains the Cape Bruny Lighthouse.  The highest point of the park (and of Bruny Island) is Mount Bruny at 504 m.  The park also embraces the Labillardiere Peninsula, named in honour of the French botanist Jacques Labillardière author of the first general flora of Australia and a member of Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition.

Much of the park's vegetation is composed of dry sclerophyll communities such as eucalypt woodland as well as heathland and coastal communities.  There are also small patches of wet eucalypt forest and temperate rainforest.Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania: South Bruny National Park - landforms, flora and fauna downloaded 30 November 2007
