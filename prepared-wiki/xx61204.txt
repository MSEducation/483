</ref> The United States and Spain agreed not to incite native tribes to warfare. Previously, Spain had been supplying [[weapon]]s to local tribes for many years. Spain and the United States also agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels. The treaty also guaranteed navigation of the entire length of the river for both the United States and Spain. The territory ceded by Spain in this treaty was organized by the United States into the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1798.

==Manifest Destiny==

Grant (1997) argues that the Treaty was critical for the emergence of American expansionism (later known as "Manifest Destiny"), because control of the Natchez and Tombigbee districts were needed for America's dominance of the Southwest. The collapse of Spanish power in the region was inevitable as Americans poured into the district, and very few Spaniards lived there. Spain gave up the area for reasons of international politics, not local unrest. Spanish rule was accepted by the French and British settlers near Natchez.  Relations with the Indians were tranquil. However, with the loss of Natchez, Spain's frontier was no longer secure and the rest of her territory was lost piecemeal.

==Disputes==

Under the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Louisiana and an undefined portion of West Florida were formally transferred back to France, although the Spanish continued to administer it. The terms of the treaty did not specify the boundaries of the territory being returned. When France then sold the Louisiana Territory to the US in 1803, a dispute arose again between Spain and the US on which parts of West Florida exactly had Spain ceded to France, which would in turn decide which parts of West Florida were now US property versus Spanish property.
