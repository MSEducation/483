[[B vitamins]]

CATEGORIES: B vitamins

B   vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. Though these vitamins share similar names, research shows that they are chemically distinct vitamins that often coexist in the same foods. In general, supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific name of each vitamin (e.g., B1, B2, B3 etc.).

Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B-vitamins.  Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease.
