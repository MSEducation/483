===Clip Library===

The Clip Library is a TextPad sidebar that allows users to store small items persistently, and then use them easily. This is done by double clicking clip names in the Clip Library sidebar. In other editors such as Komodo, a clip library is known as "snippets".
TextPad comes with a number of pre-defined clip libraries, including ANSI characters, HTML characters and HTML tags. A very useful clip library is the Clipboard History. This is a list of previous Clipboard contents. So even though the standard Windows Clipboard can only hold one piece of information, the TextPad Clipboard History Clip Library can access a whole history of entries. See also clipboard managers.
You can create your own new clip libraries, and there are many clip libraries available.TextPad Add-ons: Clip Libraries

==Criticism==

A lot of the criticism about TextPad is related to the practices of Helios Software Solutions. After the release of TextPad 4.7.3 on June 4, 2004 the only statement that was released from Helios Software Solutions was that "TextPad is still in development". This had led many[tpl]Who|date=October 2010[/tpl] to believe TextPad was abandoned. Almost 3 years after the release of TextPad 4.7.3, TextPad 5.0 was released on March 3, 2007. In the release announcement it was stated that TextPad 5.0 is the "first of a planned series of upgrades to TextPad this year." There have been regular updates since then.Including 5.1.0 on January 11, 2008 and 5.20 on March 10, 2008
The release of TextPad 5.0, although a welcomed upgrade by many, received a large amount of criticism. TextPad 5.0 was seen as "beta quality" by many users,TextPad Forum – "Beta Test – Please" http://forums.textpad.com/viewtopic.php?t=8233 Accessed August 9, 2007 needing further development before release. Only a month after the release of TextPad 5.0, Helios Software Solutions released version 5.0.2 which either fixed issues introduced in TextPad 5.0 or reintroduced features from version 4.7.3.TextPad Release Notes – Version 5.0.0 http://www.textpad.com/support/relnotes.html#v500 Accessed August 9, 2007TextPad Release Notes – Version 5.0.2 http://www.textpad.com/support/relnotes.html#v502 Accessed August 9, 2007 The release of version 5.1.0 reintroduced other features from version 4.7.3 together with a German user interface.TextPad Release Notes – Version 5.1.0 http://www.textpad.com/support/relnotes.html#v510 Accessed January 21, 2008
Another criticism is that, as of version 7.1, TextPad is not Unicode-compatible, even though it offers UTF-8 and UTF-16 as encodings in which files can be loaded and saved.TextPad Forum – "Unicode Conformance" http://forums.textpad.com/viewtopic.php?t=4777  Characters not available in your system code page are changed to question marks.
