Elijah Jordan Wood (born January 28, 1981) is an American actor and film producer. He made his film debut with a minor part in Back to the Future Part II (1989), then landed a succession of larger roles that made him a critically acclaimed child actor by age 9, being nominated for several Young Artist Awards. As a child actor he starred in the films Radio Flyer (1992), The Good Son (1993), North (1994) and Flipper (1996), and began to transfer to teenage roles in the films The Ice Storm (1997), Deep Impact and The Faculty (both 1998). He is best known for his high-profile leading role as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003). Since then, he has resisted typecasting by choosing varied roles in critically acclaimed films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Sin City, Green Street and Everything Is Illuminated (all 2005) and Bobby (2006).
Wood has also provided the voices of the main character in the award-winning animated musical films Happy Feet (2006) and Happy Feet Two (2011), as well as the lead, 9, in the Tim Burton-produced action/science fiction film 9 (2009). In 2005, he started his own record label, Simian Records. He did the voice acting for Spyro in the Legend of Spyro trilogy. In 2012, he began voicing Beck in the animated series Tron: Uprising, and Sigma in the tenth season of the Rooster Teeth series Red vs. Blue.
Since 2011, Wood has been playing the role of Ryan Newman in FX's dark comedy Wilfred.

===1988–1998: Beginnings===

Wood modeled and did local commercials before moving with his family to Los Angeles in 1988, where he got his first break in the video for Paula Abdul's "Forever Your Girl", directed by David Fincher, followed by a pivotal role in TV film Child in the Night and a minor role in Back to the Future Part II as a boy playing video games in the 80s Cafe.

Wood was cast as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the first installment of director Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel.

The Lord of the Rings was filmed in New Zealand for over a year, and before the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo's sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic "hobbit feet" which were worn during filming. 
In 2002, Wood lent his voice to the direct-to-video release of The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. The second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy was also released, titled The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.

==Personal life==

Elijah Wood is an older brother of actress Hannah Blessing Wood and younger brother of Zachariah Nathaniel Wood, who is a video game producer.
In an interview about Everything Is Illuminated, director Liev Schreiber commented that Wood has a "generosity of spirit" and a "sincere goodness as a human being."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404030/maindetails | title=Everything Is Illuminated | publisher=IMDB | date=September 16, 2005 | accessdate=October 18, 2006 [/tpl] He supported campaigns for charity as Keep a Child Alive or ALDO/YouthAIDS. Wood is a music lover, owning a vast collection of roughly 4,000 vinyl records and CDs. He is quoted as citing his favorite band as The Smashing Pumpkins.[tpl]cite web|title=Elijah Wood's Charity Work, Events and Causes|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/413-elijah-wood|publisher=Look to the Stars|accessdate=March 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Elijah Wood|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/765/000022699/|publisher=Soylent Communications|accessdate=March 28, 2011[/tpl]
Wood has a tattoo of the word "nine" written in Tengwar script, but in the English language (rather than Quenya or Sindarin as is widely believed) below his waist on the right side, a reference to his character as one of the Fellowship of the Ring. It is simply a coincidence that he later starred in 9. The other actors of "The Fellowship" got the same tattoo with the exception of John Rhys-Davies. Rhys-Davies's stunt double from the film got the tattoo instead, thus the cast can still assert that "all" the members of the Fellowship acquired a tattoo.[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue348/interview.html |title = The stars of The Lord of the Rings trilogy reach their journey's end| publisher =SciFi.com| accessdate =May 31, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070306100400/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue348/interview.html  |archivedate = March 6, 2007[/tpl]
