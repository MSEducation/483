Alan James Healy, commonly known as A.J. Healy, is an Irish author of children's books, who commonly goes by the pen name A. J. Healy. He has written two books, Tommy Storm, and its sequel, Tommy Storm and the Galactic Knights. After a rocky childhood, and many jobs around the world, he settled back in Dublin, where he was born, to start writing books. In 2002, he finished Tommy Storm, but publishers didn't want to publish it because he was an unknown author. Four years later, he self-published the book, making 5,000 copies. A few months later, when approximately 3,000 books were sold, Quercus bought the rights to publish it properly. He is now married with a young child in Dublin, Ireland.
