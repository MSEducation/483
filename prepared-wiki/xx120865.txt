Grandes Éxitos 1991–2004 is the first greatest hits album from Spanish singer-songwriter Alejandro Sanz. The album assembles his previous hits in two CDs; the first contains songs from 1991 to 1996 of the albums Viviendo Deprisa, Si Tú Me Miras, Básico and 3 and the second the hits from 1997 to 2004 of the albums Más, El Alma al Aire, MTV Unplugged and No Es lo Mismo. For this album, Sanz recorded two new songs, the single "Tú No Tienes Alma" and "Cuando Sea Espacio". 
This album comes in two editions; the first, called "Jewel Box", contains the two CDs mentioned above, and a second edition, called "Digipack", with an extra CD that includes demos, duets and material previously unreleased. From this selection of 14 rarities, stands out the demo of "Corazón Partío" to guitar and voice, recorded as it was conceived by Sanz before starting the recording of the album Más.
Complementing the release of the album, the DVD Los Videos 1991–2004 was released, which includes all Alejandro Sanz's music videos up-to-date with additional content.
