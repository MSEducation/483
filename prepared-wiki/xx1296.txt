Chloramphenicol (INN) is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is a bacteriostatic and became available in 1949. It is considered a prototypical broad-spectrum antibiotic, alongside the tetracyclines, and as it is both cheap and easy to manufacture it is frequently an antibiotic of choice in the developing world.
Chloramphenicol, also known as chlornitromycin, is effective against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including most anaerobic organisms. Due to resistance and safety concerns, it is no longer a first-line agent for any infection in developed nations, with the notable exception of topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Nevertheless, the global problem of advancing bacterial resistance to newer drugs has led to renewed interest in its use.[tpl]cite journal | author = Falagas, M. E.; Grammatikos, A. P.; Michalopoulos, A. | title = Potential of old-generation antibiotics to address current need for new antibiotics | journal = Expert Review of Anti Infective Therapy | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 593–600 |date=October 2008 | pmid = 18847400 | doi = 10.1586/14787210.6.5.593 | url = http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14787210.6.5.593?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov [/tpl] In low-income countries, chloramphenicol is still widely used because it is inexpensive and readily available.
The most serious adverse effect associated with chloramphenicol treatment is bone marrow toxicity, which may occur in two distinct forms: bone marrow suppression, which is a direct toxic effect of the drug and is usually reversible, and aplastic anemia, which is idiosyncratic (rare, unpredictable, and unrelated to dose) and generally fatal.[tpl]cite journal | author = Rich, M.; Ritterhoff, R.; Hoffmann, R. | title = A fatal case of aplastic anemia following chloramphenicol (chloromycetin) therapy | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 1459–1467 |date=December 1950 | pmid = 14790529 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-33-6-1459 [/tpl]
Use of intravenous chloramphenicol has also been associated with gray baby syndrome, a phenomenon resulting from newborn infants' inability to metabolize chloramphenicol in the body. Other less serious reactions include fever, rashes, headache and confusion. Prescription use is usually done in association with monitoring of a patient's complete blood count. The drug should be discontinued upon appearance of reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia or any other abnormal blood study findings attributable to chloramphenicol.[tpl]cite web|title=Drug Insert from DailyMed|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08c16a42-1ad4-400f-b1b0-75303eb86713|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Medical uses==

The original indication of chloramphenicol was in the treatment of typhoid, but the now almost universal presence of multiple drug-resistant Salmonella typhi has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.  Chloramphenicol may be used as a second-line agent in the treatment of tetracycline-resistant cholera.
Because of its excellent blood-brain barrier penetration (far superior to any of the cephalosporins), chloramphenicol remains the first choice treatment for staphylococcal brain abscesses.  It is also useful in the treatment of brain abscesses due to mixed organisms or when the causative organism is not known.
Chloramphenicol is active against the three main bacterial causes of meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.  In the West, chloramphenicol remains the drug of choice in the treatment of meningitis in patients with severe penicillin or cephalosporin allergy and GPs are recommended to carry intravenous chloramphenicol in their bag.  In low income countries, the WHO recommend that oily chloramphenicol be used first-line to treat meningitis.
Chloramphenicol has been used in the U.S. in the initial empirical treatment of children with fever and a petechial rash, when the differential diagnosis includes both Neisseria meningitidis septicaemia as well as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, pending the results of diagnostic investigations.
Chloramphenicol is also effective against Enterococcus faecium, which has led to its being considered for treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
Although unpublished, recent research suggests chloramphenicol could also be applied to frogs to prevent their widespread destruction from fungal infections.[tpl]cite news | author = Griggs, K. | title = Frog killer fungus 'breakthrough' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7067613.stm | date = 2007-10-30 | publisher = BBC News [/tpl]  Chloramphenicol has recently been discovered to be a life-saving cure for chytridiomycosis in amphibians.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nzfrogs.org/site/nzfrog/files/poulter.pdf | format = pdf | title = Chloramphenicol cures chytridiomycosis | author = Poulter, R.

I.; Speare, R. | publisher = NZ Frogs [/tpl] Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease, blamed for the extinction of one-third of the 120 frog species lost since 1980.

===Spectrum of activity===

Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating ocular infections caused by a number of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Chloramphenicol is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant organisms.http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_507.html
Each of these concentrations are dependent upon the bacterial strain being targeted. Some strains of E. coli, for example, show spontaneous emergence of chloramphenicol resistance.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carone|first=BR|coauthors=Xu, T; Murphy, KC; Marinus, MG|title=High incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant cells in cultures of in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.|journal=Mutation research|date=Jan 2014|volume=759|pages=1–8|pmid=24361397[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Moore|first=AM|coauthors=Patel, S; Forsberg, KJ; Wang, B; Bentley, G; Razia, Y; Qin, X; Tarr, PI; Dantas, G|title=Pediatric fecal microbiota harbor diverse and novel antibiotic resistance genes.|journal=PloS one|date=2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78822|pmid=24236055[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

===Aplastic anemia===

The most serious side effect of chloramphenicol treatment is aplastic anaemia.  This effect is rare and is generally fatal:  there is no treatment and no way of predicting who may or may not get this side effect.  The effect usually occurs weeks or months after chloramphenicol treatment has been stopped, and there may be a genetic predisposition.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196907032810102 | author = Nagao, T.; Mauer, A. | title = Concordance for drug-induced aplastic anemia in identical twins | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 281 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–11 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5785754 | month = July [/tpl]  It is not known whether monitoring the blood counts of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a baseline blood count with a repeat blood count every 2–3 days while on treatment.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hammett-Stabler, C.; Johns, T. | title = Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 44| issue = 5 | pages = 1129–1140 |date=May 1988 | pmid = 9590397 [/tpl] Chloramphenicol should be discontinued if the complete blood count drops below 2.5 x 10 cells/L.  The highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol[tpl]cite journal | author = Holt, R. | journal = Lancet | title = The bacterial degradation of chloramphenicol | year = 1967 | volume = 289 | pages = 1259–1260 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(67)92720-1 | pmid = 4165044 | issue = 7502 [/tpl] (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000)[tpl]cite journal | author = Wallerstein, R.; Condit, P.; Kasper, C.; Brown, J.; Morrison, F. | title = Statewide study of chloramphenicol therapy and fatal aplastic anemia | journal = JAMA | volume = 208 | issue = 11 | pages = 2045–2050 |date=June 1969 | pmid = 5818983 | doi = 10.1001/jama.208.11.2045 [/tpl] and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than 1 in 224,716 prescriptions).
Thiamphenicol, a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in Italy and China for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl].  Thiamphenicol is available in the U.S. and Europe as a veterinary antibiotic, and is not approved for use in humans.

===Bone marrow suppression===

Chloramphenicol may cause bone marrow suppression during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human mitochondria.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yunis AA |title=Chloramphenicol toxicity: 25 years of research |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=87 |issue=3N |pages=44N–48N |date=September 1989 |pmid=2486534 [/tpl] This effect manifests first as a fall in hemoglobin levels, which occurs quite predictably once a cumulative dose of 20 g has been given. The anaemia is fully reversible once the drug is stopped and does not predict future development of aplastic anaemia. Studies in mice have suggested that existing marrow damage may compound any marrow damage resulting from the toxic effects of chloramphenicol.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morley|first=Alec|coauthors=Trainor, Kevin; Remes, Judith|title=Residual Marrow Damage: Possible Explanation for Idiosyncrasy to Chloramphenicol|journal=British Journal of Haematology|date=1 April 1976|volume=32|issue=4|pages=525–532|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00955.x[/tpl]

===Leukemia===

Leukemia is a type of cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells. There is an increased risk of childhood leukemia, as demonstrated in a Chinese case-controlled study,[tpl]cite journal | author = Shu, X.; Gao, Y.; Linet, M.; Brinton, L.; Gao, R.; Jin, F.; Fraumeni, J. | title = Chloramphenicol use and childhood leukaemia in Shanghai | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8565 | pages = 934–937 |date=October 1987 | pmid = 2889862 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(87)91420-6 [/tpl] and the risk increases with length of treatment.

===Gray baby syndrome===

Intravenous chloramphenicol use has been associated with the so-called gray baby syndrome.
[tpl]cite journal | author = McIntyre, J.; Choonara, I. | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate | journal = Biology of the Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–221 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656 [/tpl]
This phenomenon occurs in newborn infants because they do not yet have fully functional liver enzymes (i.e. UDP-glucuronyl transferase), so chloramphenicol remains unmetabolized in the body.
[tpl]cite journal | author = Piñeiro-Carrero, V.; Piñeiro, E. | title = Liver | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4 Supplement | pages = 1097–1106 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15060205 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_3/1097.full.pdf | format = pdf [/tpl]
This causes several adverse effects, including hypotension and cyanosis. The condition can be prevented by using the drug at the recommended doses, and monitoring blood levels.

===Hypersensitivity Reactions===

Fever, macular and vesicular rashes, angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis may occur. Herxheimer’s reactions have occurred during therapy for typhoid fever.

===Neurotoxic Reactions===

Headache, mild depression, mental confusion, and delirium have been described in patients receiving chloramphenicol. Optic and peripheral neuritis have been reported, usually following long-term therapy. If this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Chloramphenicol is extremely lipid soluble; it remains relatively unbound to protein and is a small molecule. It has a large apparent volume of distribution and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  Distribution is not uniform, with highest concentrations found in the liver and kidney, with lowest in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid.  The concentration achieved in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is around 30 to 50%, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.
Chloramphenicol increases the absorption of iron.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Pill Book, The | title = Iron Supplements | pages = 593–596 | editor = Harold M. Silverman, Pharm.D. (editor-in-chief) | publisher = Bantam Dell | location = New York | edition = 12th revised | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-553-58892-7 [/tpl]

===Use in special populations===

Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol glucuronate (which is inactive).  In liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced.  There is no standard dose reduction for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.
The majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  Only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  Chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous prodrug form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Chloramphenicol passes into breast milk, so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk Retrieved on June 19, 2009

===Dose monitoring===

Plasma levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and in patients with abnormal liver function.  Plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly and patients with renal failure.
Because efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol are associated with a maximum serum concentration, peak levels (one hour after the IV dose is given) should be 10-20mcg/mL with toxicity >40mcg/mL; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be 5-10mcg/mL.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hammett-Stabler|first=C|coauthors=Johns, T.|title=Laboratory guidelines for monitoring of antimicrobial drugs|journal=Clinical Chemistry|date=May 1988|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1129–1140|pmid=9590397|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Chloramphenicol (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://online.lexi.com.proxy1.lib.tju.edu/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6582|work=Lexi-Comp Online|accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]

===Drug interactions===

Administration of chloramphenicol concomitantly with bone marrow depressant drugs is contraindicated, although concerns over aplastic anaemia associated with ocular chloramphenicol have largely been discounted.PRACTICE GUIDANCE: OTC CHLORAMPHENICOL EYE DROPS June 2005.

==Mechanism of action==

Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic drug that stops bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis.  Chloramphenicol prevents protein chain elongation by inhibiting the peptidyl transferase activity of the bacterial ribosome. It specifically binds to A2451 and A2452 residues in the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch170/ch170d.html | title = Chloramphenicol | work = The Merck Manual | publisher = Merck [/tpl] While chloramphenicol and the macrolide class of antibiotics both interact with  ribosomes, chloramphenicol is not a macrolide. It directly interferes with substrate binding, whereas macrolides sterically block the progression of the growing peptide.

==Resistance==

There are three mechanisms of resistance to chloramphenicol: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50S ribosomal subunit and elaboration of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.  It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol in vitro by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  High-level resistance is conferred by the cat-gene; this gene codes for an enzyme called chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two acetyl groups, derived from acetyl-S-coenzyme A, to the hydroxyl groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. The acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.
Chloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  One example is the ACCoT plasmid (A=ampicillin, C=chloramphenicol, Co=co-trimoxazole, T=tetracycline), which mediates multiple-drug resistance in typhoid (also called R factors).
Currently, some Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are resistant to chloramphenicol. Some Veillonella app. and Staphylococcus capitis strains have also developed resistance to chloramphenicol to varying degrees.[tpl]cite web|title=Chloramphenicol spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120618001452.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl]

==History==

Chloramphenicol was originally derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae, isolated by David Gottlieb, and introduced into clinical practice in 1949, under the trade name Chloromycetin. It was the first antibiotic to be manufactured synthetically on a large scale.
The topical formulation of chloramphenicol was commonly used as eye drops as first-line treatment of conjunctivitis. The first fatality from eye drops was reported in 1955.[tpl]cite journal | author = R.L. Rosenthal, A. Blackman | title = Bone-marrow hypoplasia following use of chloramphenicol eye drops | journal = JAMA | volume = 191 | issue = 3 | pages = 136–137 | date=1965[/tpl]
In 2007, the accumulation of reports associating aplastic anemia and blood dyscrasia with chloramphenicol eye drops lead to the classification of “probable” according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, based on the known published case reports and the spontaneous reports submitted to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fraunfelder, F.; Fraunfelder, F | title = Restricting Topical Ocular Chloramphenicol Eye Drop Use in the United States. Did We Overreact? | journal = American Journal of Ophtalmology | volume = 156| issue = 3 | pages = 420–422 |date=September 2013 | pmid = 23953152 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2013.05.004[/tpl]

==Formulations==

Chloramphenicol is available as 250 mg capsules or as a liquid (125 mg/5 mL).  In some countries, it is sold as chloramphenicol palmitate ester (CPE).  CPE is inactive, and is hydrolysed to active chloramphenicol in the small intestine.  There is no difference in bioavailability between chloramphenicol and CPE.
Manufacture of oral chloramphenicol in the U.S. stopped in 1991, because the vast majority of chloramphenicol-associated cases of aplastic anaemia are associated with the oral preparation.  There is now no oral formulation of chloramphenicol available in the U.S.
In molecular biology, chloramphenicol is prepared as 25–50 mg/mL stock in ethanol.

===Intravenous===

The intravenous (IV) preparation of chloramphenicol is the succinate ester, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water.  This creates a problem: Chloramphenicol succinate ester is an inactive prodrug and must first be hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; however, the hydrolysis process is often incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost and removed in the urine.  Serum concentrations of IV chloramphenicol are only 70% of those achieved when chloramphenicol is given orally.[tpl]cite journal | author = Glazko, A. J.; Dill, W. A.; Kinkel, A.

===Oily===

Oily chloramphenicol (or chloramphenicol oil suspension) is a long-acting preparation of chloramphenicol first introduced by Roussel in 1954; marketed as Tifomycine, it was originally used as a treatment for typhoid.  Roussel stopped production of oily chloramphenicol in 1995; the International Dispensary Association has manufactured it since 1998, first in Malta and then in India from December 2004.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lewis, R.

Oily chloramphenicol is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first-line treatment of meningitis in low-income countries, and appears on the WHO essential drugs list.  It was first used to treat meningitis in 1975[tpl]cite journal | author = Rey, M.; Ouedraogo, L.; Saliou, P.; Perino, L. | title = Traitement minute de la méningite cérébrospinale épidémique par injection intramusculaire unique de  chloramphénicol (suspension huileuse) | journal = Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses | language = french | year = 1976 | volume = 6 | pages = 120–124 | doi = 10.1016/S0399-077X(76)80134-5 | issue = 4 [/tpl] and numerous studies since have demonstrated its efficacy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wali, S.; Macfarlane, J.; Weir, W.; Cleland, P.; Ball, P.; Hassan-King, M.; Whittle, H.; Greenwood, B. | title = Single injection treatment of meningococcal meningitis. 2.

It has the great advantage of requiring only a single injection, whereas ceftriaxone is traditionally given daily for five days.  This recommendation may yet change, now that a single dose of ceftriaxone (cost US$3) has been shown to be equivalent to one dose of oily chloramphenicol.[tpl]cite journal | title = Ceftriaxone as effective as long-acting chloramphenicol in short-course treatment of meningococcal meningitis during epidemics: a randomised non-inferiority study | journal = Lancet | author = Nathan, N.; Borel, T.; Djibo, A. | year = 2005 | volume = 366 | issue = 9482 | pages = 308–313 | pmid = 16039333 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66792-X [/tpl]
