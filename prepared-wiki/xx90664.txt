Mollies are members of a genus of fish: Poecilia in family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes.[tpl]ITIS | id = 165897 | taxon = Poecilia | accessdate = June 8, 2006[/tpl] They are native to fresh, brackish and salt water in the Americas, and some species in the genus are euryhaline. They are often seen as live-bearing aquarium fish. All species in Poecilia are called mollies except for the Endler's livebearer (P. wingei) and the well-known guppy (P. reticulata). 
It has been proposed that the genus Micropoecilia should be included as a sub-genus of Poecilia.Bragança, P. H. N.  and W. J. E. M.

Along with their platy cousins, the mollies are part of a pivotal aquaculture group of livebearers, which can live in water from fresh to fully marine, and a wide range of other conditions. They feed on smaller insects, animals, and vegetation.

The generic name Poecilia derives from the Greek ποικίλος (variegated), in reference to the fishes' coloration. Mollies need to live in water that is [tpl]convert|25|to|28|C|F[/tpl].
