==History of the monument==

In 1837 the Radical politician Joseph Hume MP initiated a plan to erect a monument to the five men. Hume chaired a London-based committee to raise public subscriptions in support of the monument and settled on its location being in Edinburgh. In that year a William Tait of Edinburgh wrote on their behalf to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh requesting that land be made available on Calton Hill for this end.http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/117414/details/edinburgh+waterloo+place+old+calton+burial+ground+obelisk/?date=asc

On February 1852 Hume initiated the construction of a second Monument at Nunhead Cemetery in London. This monument stands at 33 feet high."The Scottish Martyrs" by Wally MacFarlane, a pamphlet published by the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery.

==Commemoration==

The five men commemorated—two from Scotland and three from England—were imprisoned for campaigning for parliamentary reform under the influence of the ideals of the French Revolution. The five were accused of sedition in a series of trials and transported to Australia in 1794 and 1795, with varying sentences. In 1796 Gerrald died from tuberculosis and Skirving from dysentery. In the same year Muir, with the help of a French sailor, had escaped on an American ship, but had some disastrous experiences before finally making his way to revolutionary France. He took part in revolutionary intrigue but died in 1799 of illness and injuries received in his travels to France. 
Fyshe Palmer and Margarot survived their sentences of 14 years but Fyshe Palmer died of fever while attempting a trading voyage back to England. Only Margarot returned to Great Britain.
