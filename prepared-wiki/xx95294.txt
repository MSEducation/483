Twizel [tpl]IPAc-en|'|t|w|aɪ|z|əl[/tpl] is a town in the Mackenzie District, in New Zealand's South Island. Its residential population is [tpl]NZ population data|Twizel Community|y||y[/tpl] but in summer the population more than triples.

==History==

The present town was built in 1968 as a greenfields project to service the Upper Waitaki Hydroelectricity Scheme. The scheme consisted of 50 km of canals, two dams, and four powerhouses (Tekapo B, Ohau A, Ohau B and Ohau C) producing 848 MW of electricity. At the height of the project in the 1970s, had a population peaked of around 6,000.
The town was laid out in a 'Scandinavian' fashion, featuring looping roads and pedestrian ways, making it usually far more direct to walk than use a car. Shops, school, and recreational parkland formed a hub in the centre of the town, around which the residential area were built. A previous version of this layout had been tried at Otematata. Accommodation was highly segregated: in addition to single men's quarters in the middle of town, there was a series of different houses available, with the smallest for workers, staff houses for teachers and professionals, and the largest for engineers and other high-status residents.
As the intention was for the town to revert to farmland, there were many 'temporary' features. For example, instead of putting in kerbing, channels, and footpaths at the edge of the road, a single expanse of seal was contoured in a very flat 'W' shape: the seal was highest at the outer edge (footpath) and in the middle (centreline), with a lower area serving as a channel and delineation between the roadway and footpath. Likewise, most of the town's telephone local loop is strung above ground to save the task of burying and then removing the lines. Most houses were prefabricated, and intended to be portable. Some were brought from Otematata, and some were later moved to Clyde for the next hydroelectricity project. However in 1983, as the hydroelectric project was winding up, residents successfully fought to save the town itself.
