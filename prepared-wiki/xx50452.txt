[[Olduvai theory]]

CATEGORIES: Futurology, Peak oil

The Olduvai theory states that industrial civilization (as defined by per capita energy production) will have a lifetime of less than or equal to 100 years (1930-2030).  The theory provides a quantitative basis of the transient-pulse theory of modern civilization.  The name is a reference to the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.

==History==

The Olduvai theory was introduced in 1989 by power system engineer Richard C. Duncan as the "transient-pulse theory of industrial civilization".[ref]OT_1989.pdf - Duncan, R. C. (1989). Evolution, technology, and the natural environment: A unified theory of human history. Proceedings of the Annual Meeting, American Society of Engineering Educators: Science, Technology, & Society, 14B1-11 to
14B1-20. [/ref]  with further details in the 1993 paper "The life-expectancy of industrial civilization: The decline to global equilibrium".Duncan, R. C. (1993). The life-expectancy of industrial civilization: The decline to global equilibrium. Population and Environment, 14(4), 325-357.
In June, 1996, Duncan introduced a paper titled "The Olduvai Theory: Sliding Towards a Post-Industrial Stone Age" where the term "Olduvai Theory" replaced "transient-pulse theory" used in previous papers."The Olduvai Theory:Sliding Towards a Post-Industrial Stone Age - Richard C. Duncan (1996), www.dieoff.org  Duncan further updated his theory in "The Peak of World Oil Production and the Road to the Olduvai Gorge", at the Summit 2000 Pardee Keynote Symposium of the Geological Society of America, on November 13, 2000."The Peak Of World Oil Production And The Road To The Olduvai Gorge" - Richard C. Duncan (2000), www.dieoff.org  In 2005, Duncan extended his data set to include up to 2003 in "The Olduvai Theory Energy, Population, and Industrial Civilization"."The Olduvai Theory Energy, Population, and Industrial Civilization" - Richard C. Duncan (2005/2006), www.TheSocialContract.com

==Details of theory==

Industrial civilization is defined in Duncan's paper as the time between energy production per capita rising above 37% of its eventual peak value, and it falling back below 37% of the peak value later. In 1996 he estimated this period to be from 1930 until approximately 2025, with the per capita peak having occurred in 1977. In 2009, he considered separately the peaks of standard of living in OECD countries, non-OECD countries (specifically China, India and Brazil), and the USA. He found that the standard of living in the US peaked in 1973, that of OECD countries in 2005, while that of the non-OECD countries was still rising in 2007. He predicted a global peak in standard of living 2010, followed by a decline to the 1930 level by 2030.
The Olduvai theory claims that exponential growth of energy production ended in 1979, that energy use per capita will show no growth through 2008, and that after 2008 energy growth will become sharply negative, culminating, after a Malthusian catastrophe, in a world population of 2 billion circa 2050. 
The Olduvai theory divides human history into three phases. The first "pre-industrial" phase stretches over most of human history when simple tools and weak machines limited economic growth. The second "industrial" phase encompasses modern industrial civilization where machines temporarily lift all limits to growth. The final "de-industrial" phase follows where industrial economies decline to a period of equilibrium with renewable resources and the natural environment.
The decline of the industrial phase is broken into three sections:

==Criticism==

===Data===

At the time of Duncan's paper, the peak in per capita energy consumption was 11.15 boe/c/yr (barrels of oil equivalent per capita per year) and occurred in 1979; however, since then energy use per capita has increased beyond that level, with 2006 providing a peak value of 12.12 boe/c/yr.World Per Capita Total Primary Energy Consumption, 1980-2006 - Energy Information Administration, 2006 (Excel Sheet)Energy Units and Conversions - Dennis Silverman, UC Irvine  This increase directly contradicts Postulate 2 of the most recent version of the theory, namely that "''per capita energy will show no growth from 1979 to circa 2008".  Duncan has responded to this criticism in a 2009 essay entitled The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living."The Olduvai Theory - Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living" - Duncan, R. C. (2009), www.TheSocialContract.com The response is that certain non-OPEC countries such as China and India have increased their per capita'' energy usage whilst efficiency improvements within the USA & OPEC have reduced their requirements for energy without impacting the quality of life. The theory is then re-assessed from the standpoint OPEC, non-OPEC and USA energy consumption. 
Proponents note that the current trend of increasing per capita energy consumption may be difficult to sustain in the face of limits on finite resources such as oil, coal, and natural gas.Revisiting the Olduvai Theory - The Oil Drum, March 6, 2006  Critics[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] argue that this demonstrated lack of predictive power renders the theory's other predictions unreliable, while others[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] cite this as only compounding the warnings the theory gives.

==Quote==

In justification of his reference to Olduvai Gorge, Duncan writes: Richard C. Duncan, World Energy Production, Population Growth, And the Road to the Olduvai Gorge, Institute on Energy and Man, As published in Population and Environment, May-June 2001, v. 22, n. 5. url
 ...(1)  it is famous for the myriad hominid fossils and stone tools discovered there, (2) I've been there, (3) its long hollow sound is eerie and ominous, and (4) it is a good metaphor for the 'Stone Age way of life'.
