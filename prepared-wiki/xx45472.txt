==Career==

Locklear attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and pledged Chi Omega and Delta Delta Delta, but was never initiated into either sorority. While at UCLA, she began modeling and working in commercials for the school store. She made her earliest screen appearances in the early 1980s with small roles in episodes of CHiPs, 240-Robert, and Eight Is Enough, before beginning a long-term collaboration with Aaron Spelling. Spelling cast her in the role of Sammy Jo Dean during the second season of his TV series Dynasty, and the following year he cast her in the cop show T.J. Hooker with William Shatner. Until the mid-1980s, Locklear appeared as a series regular on T.J. Hooker, while making semi-regular appearances on Dynasty. She was a full-time cast member on Dynasty from 1985 until its cancellation in 1989. In 1991, the cast of Dynasty (including Locklear) reconvened for the four-hour mini-series Dynasty: The Reunion.
Following Dynasty, Locklear had a starring role in the movie The Return of Swamp Thing (for which she won the satirical Razzie Award for Worst Actress[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=29|title= Razzie Awards 1989[/tpl]) and also starred in the short-lived sitcom Going Places.
In 1993, she began playing what would be another of her best known roles, that of Amanda Woodward on Aaron Spelling's drama series Melrose Place, which was a spin-off of Beverly Hills, 90210. Spelling originally signed Locklear for a limited four-episode run, the first of which aired on January 27, 1993. Locklear became a full-time cast member (though she continued to be billed as "Special Guest Star" in the opening credits) until its cancellation in 1999. Throughout her career, Locklear has appeared in eight television productions made by Aaron Spelling, these being Dynasty, T.J. Hooker, Matt Houston, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat, Hotel, Melrose Place, and the made-for-TV movie Rich Men, Single Women.
Locklear was the guest host on Saturday Night Live on May 14, 1994. Two of her best-known skits included her as an elderly Jewish woman on Coffee Talk with Mike Myers, and her acting as Amanda Woodward in a Wayne's World skit with Myers, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and Phil Hartman, where Wayne has a dream that he is a character on Melrose Place. Locklear also made a cameo in Wayne's World 2 in 1993. In 1996, she appeared as the main guest on Muppets Tonight, performing in a muppet-style spoof of Melrose entitled "Muppet Heights". Locklear was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine on May 19, 1994, as Melrose Place reached the height of its popularity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/5392236/1994_rolling_stone_covers/photo/9/large/therollingstones |title=1994 Rolling Stone Covers : Photos |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 19, 1994 |accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl] She was named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People twice, first in 1994,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/heather_locklear/biography |title=Heather Locklear Biography |work=People  |accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl] and again in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134393,00.html |title=Heather Locklear: Actress – Most Beautiful, Heather Locklear |work=People  |date=May 14, 2001 |accessdate=March 22, 2010[/tpl] She was also the subject of a Lifetime Intimate Portrait special, and of an E!

The series ended in 2002, but Locklear earned two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy. In 2002, Locklear had a brief recurring role on the sitcom Scrubs. In 2003, she starred in a pilot for her own comedy series, Once Around the Park, but this was unsuccessful. The same year, Locklear appeared in the theatrical film Uptown Girls. In 2004, Locklear made a guest appearance on the sitcom Two and a Half Men, which starred her former Spin City co-star Charlie Sheen. She then starred in the short-lived television drama series LAX set in the airport of the same name. She was also executive producer on the series, but it was canceled after 11 episodes. In 2005, Locklear appeared in the theatrical film The Perfect Man with Hilary Duff. The same year, she had a brief recurring role on the series Boston Legal, which starred her former T.J. Hooker co-star William Shatner. She was also featured in a Biography Channel special. In 2006, Locklear starred in another television pilot, Women of a Certain Age, but this was unsuccessful.
In 2007, Locklear made another pilot for ABC, See Jayne Run, about a business woman who juggles a career with single motherhood, but this was also unsuccessful. She guest-starred on the series Hannah Montana and in the sitcom Rules of Engagement, and was placed 25 on TV Guide & Entertainment Weekly's "100 Greatest TV Icons" list.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20159773,00.html#20366195|title=50 Greatest TV Icons|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]
In 2009, Locklear joined the cast of The CW's updated version of Melrose Place. Beginning on November 17, 2009, she reprised her role as Amanda Woodward and appeared in eight episodes.

===Driving controversies===

In September 2008, Locklear was pulled over and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence by a California Highway Patrol officer just outside Santa Barbara after she was seen driving erratically.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE48S38J20080929|agency=Reuters|title=Heather Locklear Arrested in California|date=September 19, 2008[/tpl] Police had been tipped off about Locklear's driving by Jill Ishkanian, a former reporter and editor at Us Weekly magazine, who saw Locklear outside a market in Montecito, California. Ishkanian photographed the incident and then sold the photos to celebrity news website TMZ.com for $27,500, though she claims it was entirely a chance meeting and denies following Locklear or setting her up in order to obtain photographs. Locklear was formally charged on November 17, 2008, with one misdemeanor count of driving under the influence.[tpl]cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=6272693&page=1|work=ABC News|title= Heather Locklear charged with DUI|date=November 19, 2008[/tpl] A blood test detected no alcohol or illegal narcotics, but Santa Barbara County Deputy District Attorney Lee Carter stated that they believe the prescription medications she consumed for her anxiety and depression "could have impaired her ability to safely drive a motor vehicle".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.usmagazine.com/news/heather-locklear-charged-with-dui|work=Us Weekly|date= November 17, 2008|title=Heather Locklear Charged With DUI[/tpl] On January 2, 2009, Locklear pleaded no contest to reckless driving, and in return the district attorney dismissed the DUI charges.

On April 21, 2010, Locklear was arrested on suspicion of hit and run, when a no-parking sign was wrecked at 4 a.m. and vehicle debris was found. Police discovered that her car, parked in her garage, showed apparently matching damage. Her lawyer confirmed that Locklear had been cited for a traffic misdemeanor as the vehicle's owner, but said it was not clear who was driving at the time of the accident.[tpl]Citation|title=Actress Heather Locklear arrested for hit-and-run|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1267854/Actress-Heather-Locklear-arrested-hit-run.html|date=April 22, 2010|work=Daily Mail |location=London |postscript=|accessdate=April 22, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Citation|title=Locklear cited for hit & run in 4 am crash|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/04/22/entertainment-us-people-heather-locklear_7537901.html|date=April 22, 2010|work=San Francisco Chronicle|series=Associated Press|postscript=|accessdate=April 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100425062702/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/04/22/entertainment-us-people-heather-locklear_7537901.html|archivedate=April 25, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] On May 26, 2010, the Ventura County District Attorney announced that no criminal charges will be filed because there was “insufficient evidence” to determine who was driving the car at the time of the collision.[tpl]Citation|title=District Attorney Gregory D.

===911 calls===

In March 2008, a 911 call was made by someone who claimed to be Locklear's doctor and said that Locklear was trying to commit suicide.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-529888/Police-called-Heather-Locklears-home-fears-commit-suicide.html|work=Daily Mail |location=London |title= Police called to Heather Locklear's home after 'fears she would commit suicide[tpl]'-[/tpl]|date=March 10, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20183713,00.html |title = Locklear 911 Caller: Actress May Be 'Suicidal[tpl]'-[/tpl]|work=People|date=March 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.showbizspy.com/article/60343/cops-probe-heather-locklear-suicide-sttempt.html |title = Cops probe Heather Locklear 'suicide attempt[tpl]'-[/tpl]|work=Showbiz Spy|date=March 10, 2008[/tpl] Emergency responders were dispatched to Locklear's home. Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as she appeared to be fine. They did, however, state that they believed the call to be genuine. On June 24, 2008, she checked into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological issues including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication in order to receive proper diagnosis and treatment.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20208453,00.html | title=Heather Locklear in Treatment for 'Anxiety and Depression[tpl]'-[/tpl]| last=Chiu|first= Alexis | work=People| date=June 24, 2008 | accessdate=June 24, 2008[/tpl] Her agent confirmed that she was suffering from anxiety and depression.[tpl]cite web|first=Tracy|last=Phillips|url= http://www.comcast.net/tv/seenontv/3576/heatherlocklearintreatment/|title= Heather Locklear in Treatment |publisher=comcast.net|work=My TV|date=June 24, 2008[/tpl] On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20214386,00.html | title=Heather Locklear Leaves Treatment Center| last=Chiu|first= Alexis | work=People| date=July 23, 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2008[/tpl]
On January 12, 2012, Locklear's sister called 911 when she believed Locklear was in danger after reportedly taking prescription drugs and alcohol.
