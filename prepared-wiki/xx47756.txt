Eyewitness to History was a CBS Friday night public affairs program which was initially hosted by veteran broadcaster Charles Kuralt (1960-'61), followed by Walter Cronkite (1961-'62), and Charles Collingwood (1962-'63).  It aired from September 30, 1960 through July 26, 1963, sponsored by Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

The show's title was shortened to Eyewitness in 1961. Coincidentally, many local CBS affiliates adopted the branding "Eyewitness News" for their local newscasts in the 1960s.
One of the show's producers, Av Westin, went on to become executive producer of ABC Evening News and, later, 20/20.
