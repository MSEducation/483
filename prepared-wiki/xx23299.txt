[[Bilateria]]

CATEGORIES: Animals

The bilateria [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|b|aɪ|l|ə|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə[/tpl] are all animals having a bilateral symmetry, i.e. they have a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. In contrast,  radially symmetrical animals like jellyfish have a topside and downside, but no front and back. The bilateria are a major group of animals, including the majority of phyla but not sponges, cnidarians, placozoans and ctenophores. For the most part, bilateral embryos are triploblastic having three germ layers  endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Nearly all are bilaterally symmetrical, or approximately so; the most notable exception is the echinoderms, which achieve near-radial symmetry as adults, but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae. Except for a few phyla (i.e. flatworms and gnathostomulids),  bilaterians have complete digestive tracts with a separate mouth and anus. Some bilaterians lack body cavities (acoelomates, i.e. Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha and Gnathostomulida), while others display primary body cavities (deriving from the blastocoel, as pseudocoel) and/or secondary cavities  (that appear de novo, for example the coelom).

==Evolution==

The hypothetical last common ancestor of all bilateria is termed the "Urbilaterian".Knoll, Andrew H. and Sean B. Carroll.

One side suggests that acoelomates gave rise to the other groups (planuloid-aceloid hypothesis by von Graff, Metchnikoff, Hyman, or Salvini Plawen), while the other poses that the first bilaterian was a coelomate organism and the main acoelomate phyla (flatworms and gastrotrichs) have lost body cavities secondarily (the Archicoelomata hypothesis and its variations such as the Gastrea by Haeckel or Sedgwick, the Bilaterosgastrea by  Jägersten, or the Trochaea by Nielsen).
The first evidence of bilateria in the fossil record comes from trace fossils in Ediacaran sediments, and the first bona fide bilaterian fossil is Kimberella, dating to [tpl]Ma|555[/tpl].For refs see Ediacara biota Earlier fossils are controversial; the fossil Vernanimalcula may be the earliest known bilaterian, but may also represent an infilled bubble.For refs see Vernanimalcula Fossil embryos are known from around the time of Vernanimalcula ([tpl]Ma|580[/tpl]), but none of these have bilaterian affinities.For refs see Fossil embryos Burrows believed to have been created by bilaterian life forms have been found in the Tacuarí Formation of Uruguay, and are believed to be at least 585 million years old.[tpl]cite journal | title=Bilaterian burrows and grazing behavior at >585 million years ago | author=Aubet, Natalie R., et al. | journal=Science | volume=336 | issue=6089 | pages=1693+ | doi=10.1126/science.1216295 | date=June 29, 2012 | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science[/tpl]

==Phylogeny==

There are two or more superphyla (main lineages) of Bilateria. The deuterostomes include the echinoderms, hemichordates, chordates, and possibly a few smaller phyla. The protostomes include most of the rest, such as arthropods, annelids, mollusks, flatworms, and so forth. There are a number of differences, most notably in how the embryo develops. In particular, the first opening of the embryo becomes the mouth in protostomes, and the anus in deuterostomes. Many taxonomists now recognize at least two more superphyla among the protostomes, Ecdysozoa[tpl]cite journal|last=Halanych|first=K.|coauthors=Bacheller, J.; Aguinaldo, A.; Liva, S.; Hillis, D.; Lake, J.|title=Evidence from 18S ribosomal DNA that the lophophorates are protostome animals|journal=Science|date=17 March 1995|volume=267|issue=5204|pages=1641–1643|doi=10.1126/science.7886451|pmid=7886451[/tpl]  (molting animals) and Lophotrochozoa. Within the latter, some researchers also recognize another superphylum, Platyzoa,[tpl]cite journal|last=Giribet|first=Gonzalo|author2=at al|title=Triploblastic relationships with emphasis on the acoelomates and the position of Gnathostomulida, Cycliophora, Plathelminthes, and Chaetognatha: a combined approach of 18S rDNA sequences and morphology.|journal=Systematic Biology|date=September 2000|volume=49|issue=3|pages=539–62|pmid=12116426|url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/3/539.abstract[/tpl] while others reject the Platyzoa monophyly.[tpl]cite journal|last=Paps|first=J.|coauthors=Baguna, J.; Riutort, M.|title=Bilaterian Phylogeny: A Broad Sampling of 13 Nuclear Genes Provides a New Lophotrochozoa Phylogeny and Supports a Paraphyletic Basal Acoelomorpha|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=14 July 2009|volume=26|issue=10|pages=2397–2406|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp150|pmid=19602542[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Telford|first=Maximilian J.|title=Resolving Animal Phylogeny: A Sledgehammer for a Tough Nut?|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=14|issue=4|pages=457–459|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2008.03.016[/tpl]The Invertebrate Animals The arrow worms (Chaetognatha) have proven particularly difficult to classify, with some taxonomists placing them among the deuterostomes and others placing them among the protostomes.
