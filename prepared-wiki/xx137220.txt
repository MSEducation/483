The Norfolk Ballerz are an inactive team of the American Basketball Association.
They played part of the 2006-07 ABA season as the Richmond Ballerz before ending their season on February 23, 2007 due to scheduling problems attributed to several nearby ABA franchises failing to start the 2006-07 season or folding early in the season.  The Richmond Ballerz were coached by former Virginia Tech guard Michael Davis.
In March 2007, the Ballerz announced that they would move to the Hampton Roads area in order to be closer to their owner, Ann Iverson, mother of Memphis Grizzlies star Allen Iverson.  The Ballerz may change their formal name for the 2007-08 season, but intend to use the name Ballerz as an informal nickname.  The press release indicated that another ABA franchise would be placed in Richmond for 2007-08.  According to ABALive.com, the team is now the Norfolk Ballerz.  In July 2007, both the Ballerz and the tentative Richmond franchise were removed from the ABALive.com website.
The team was originally going to be called the Richmond Warriors, but the ABA made them change the name out of respect for the NBA's Golden State Warriors, despite the existence of another ABA team with a similar nickname, the Twin City Ballers, and the existence of another ABA team with a nickname shared with the NBA, the Peoria Kings.
