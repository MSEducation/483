Bristol ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Bristol.ogg|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|s|t|əl[/tpl]) is a city, unitary authority area and ceremonial county in South West England, with an estimated population of 433,100 for the unitary authority in 2009, and a surrounding Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) with an estimated 1,070,000 residents in 2007. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city,[tpl]cite web|title=Bristol Facts|url=http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/whyuwe/unbeatablebristol/aboutbristol/bristolfacts.aspx|publisher=University of the West of England|accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] one of the Core Cities Group and the most populous city in South West England.
Historically in Gloucestershire, the city received a Royal charter in 1155[tpl]cite web|url=http://visitbristol.co.uk/media-and-press/press-releases/2010/11/1/overview-of-history-facts-and-visiting-bristol-for-media-a1076|title=Overview of history, facts and visiting Bristol for media|publisher=Visit Bristol|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] and was granted County status in 1373. From the 13th century, for half a millennium, it ranked among the top three English cities after London, alongside York and Norwich, on the basis of tax receipts, until the rapid rise of Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester during the Industrial Revolution in the latter part of the 18th century. It borders the counties of Somerset and Gloucestershire, and is also located near the historic cities of Bath to the south east and Gloucester to the north. The city is built around the River Avon, and it also has a short coastline on the Severn Estuary, which flows into the Bristol Channel.
Bristol is the largest centre of culture, employment and education in the region. Its prosperity has been linked with the sea since its earliest days. The commercial Port of Bristol was originally in the city centre before being moved to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth; Royal Portbury Dock is on the western edge of the city boundary. In more recent years the economy has depended on the creative media, electronics and aerospace industries, and the city centre docks have been regenerated as a centre of heritage and culture.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/oct/30/property |title=Bristol: seemingly unstoppable growth |accessdate=18 December 2007 | work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media| date= 30 October 2007|last=Norwood|first=Graham | location=London[/tpl] There are 34 other populated places named Bristol, most in the United States, but also in Peru, Canada, Jamaica, Barbados,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.runbarbados.org/about/history.aspx |title=Run Barbados – History |author=staff writer |year=2011 |publisher=Run Barbados |archiveurl= |accessdate=27 January 2013 |quote=Speightstown, the northern commercial centre, took its name from an English Family which owned property in the area.

Renewed growth came with the 17th century rise of England's American colonies and the rapid 18th century expansion of England's part in the Atlantic trade in Africans taken for slavery in the Americas. Bristol, along with Liverpool, became a centre for the Triangular trade. In the first stage of this trade manufactured goods were taken to West Africa and exchanged for Africans who were then, in the second stage or middle passage, transported across the Atlantic in brutal conditions. The third leg of the triangle brought plantation goods such as sugar, tobacco, rum, rice and cotton and also a small number of slaves who were sold to the aristocracy as house servants, some eventually buying their freedom. During the height of the slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slaving ships were fitted out at Bristol, carrying a (conservatively) estimated half a million people from Africa to the Americas and slavery.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/pdf/pressoffice/press_release_13_12_05.pdf|format=PDF |title=Lottery Fund rejects Bristol application in support of a major exhibition to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade |accessdate=10 March 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=British Empire & Commonwealth Museum [/tpl]

Fishermen from Bristol had fished the Grand Banks of Newfoundland since the 15th century and began settling Newfoundland permanently in larger numbers in the 17th century establishing colonies at Bristol's Hope and Cuper's Cove. Bristol's strong nautical ties meant that maritime safety was an important issue in the city. During the 19th century Samuel Plimsoll, "the sailor's friend", campaigned to make the seas safer; he was shocked by the overloaded cargoes, and successfully fought for a compulsory load line on ships.
Competition from Liverpool from c. 1760, the disruption of maritime commerce caused by wars with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the North of England and the West Midlands. The passage up the heavily tidal Avon Gorge, which had made the port highly secure during the Middle Ages, had become a liability which the construction of a new "Floating Harbour" (designed by William Jessop) in 1804–9 failed to overcome, as the great cost of the scheme led to excessive harbour dues.[tpl]cite book|last1=Buchanan|first1=R A|last2=Cossons|first2=Neil|title=The Industrial Archaeology of the Bristol Region|publisher=David & Charles|location=Newton Abbot|year=1969|pages=32–33|chapter=2|isbn=978-0-7153-4394-4[/tpl] Nevertheless, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801) quintupled during the 19th century, supported by new industries and growing commerce.[tpl]cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Charles|last2=Press|first2=Jon|title=Industrial Change in Bristol Since 1800.

By 1901, some 330,000 people were living in Bristol and the city would grow steadily as the 20th century progressed. The city's docklands were enhanced in the early 1900s with the opening of Royal Edward Dock.[tpl]cite web|title=Royal Edward Dock, Avonmouth|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1059|publisher=Engineering Timelines|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] Another new dock – Royal Portbury Dock – was opened in the 1970s.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.eon-uk.com/downloads/Appendix_H_Cultural_Heritage.pdf |title=Appendix H Cultural_Heritage  |format=PDF|page=H–4 |last=Wessex Archaeology |work=eon-uk.com |date=November 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2011[/tpl]

The rebuilding of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s & 70's Skyscrapers, Mid-Century Modern architecture, and the improvement of road infrastructure. Since the 1980s another trend has emerged with the closure of some main roads, the restoration of the Georgian era Queen Square and Portland Square, the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping area, and the loss of one of the city centre's tallest Mid-Century Modern towers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/4608986.stm |title=Demolition of city tower begins |accessdate=10 March 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date= 13 January 2006[/tpl]
Bristol's road infrastructure was altered dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at an interchange just north of the city and give the city direct motorway links with London (M4 eastbound), Cardiff (M4 westbound across the Estuary of the River Severn), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).
The removal of the docks to Avonmouth Docks and Royal Portbury Dock, [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|1[/tpl] downstream from the city centre during the 20th century has also allowed redevelopment of the old central dock area (the "Floating Harbour") in recent decades, although at one time the continued existence of the docks was in jeopardy as it was viewed as a derelict industrial site rather than an asset. However the holding, in 1996, of the first International Festival of the Sea in and around the docks, affirmed the dockside area in its new leisure role as a key feature of the city.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=David|last2=Laurier|first2=David|title=A sanitised city?

Although the rugby club was landlord when the football club arrived at the stadium as tenants, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes shortly afterwards led to the football club becoming landlord and the rugby club becoming the stadium's tenants. Bristol Rovers had spent the previous 10 years playing their home games outside the city following the closure of their Eastville stadium in 1986, before returning to the city to play at the Memorial Ground.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/bristol_rovers/|title=Bristol Rovers FC | publisher=Football Ground Guide | accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl]
However, Bristol Rovers have generally been overshadowed by their local rivals Bristol City in terms of footballing success. Unlike Rovers, City have enjoyed top flight football. Their first spell in the Football League First Division began in 1906, and they ended their first season among the elite in fine form by finishing second and only narrowly missing out on league title glory. Two years later, they were on the losing side in the final of the FA Cup, and were relegated back to the Football League Second Division two years later. It would be another 65 years before First Division status was regained, in 1976. This time they spent four years among the elite before being relegated in 1980 – the first of a then unique three successive relegations which led to them slipping into the Fourth Division in 1982.

==Government==

Bristol City Council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards. They are elected in thirds with two councillors per ward, each serving a four-year term. Wards never have both councillors up for election at the same time, so effectively two-thirds of the wards are up each election.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=29953068& |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ln2egxnZ |archivedate=5 December 2009 |title= Wards up for future elections|accessdate=22 July 2007 |publisher=Bristol City Council [/tpl]
The Council has long been dominated by the Labour Party, but recently the Liberal Democrats have grown strong in the city and as the largest party took minority control of the Council at the 2005 election. In 2007, Labour and the Conservatives joined forces to vote down the Liberal Democrat administration, and as a result, Labour ruled the council under a minority administration, with Helen Holland as the council leader.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/6682343.stm |title=Council leader battle resolved |date=27 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
In February 2009, the Labour group resigned, and the Liberal Democrats took office with their own minority administration. At the council elections on 4 June 2009 the Liberal Democrats gained four seats and, for the first time, overall control of the City Council. The Lord Mayor is Councillor Faruk Choudhury.[tpl]cite web|title=Council elects Lord Mayor and approves the appointment of City Director |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/press/council-and-democracy/council-elects-lord-mayor-and-approves-appointment-city-director|publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl] The most recent City council elections were in May 2011. The next are expected in May 2013. On 3 May 2012, Bristol held a referendum to decide whether the city should have a directly elected mayor to replace the leader elected by councillors. The result was announced on 4 May. 41,032 voted for an elected mayor and 35,880 voted against, with a turnout of 24%. An election for the new post was held on 15 November 2012 with Independent candidate George Ferguson becoming Mayor of Bristol.
Bristol constituencies in the House of Commons cross the borders with neighbouring authorities, and the city is divided into Bristol West, East, South and North-west. In the recent 2010 General Election in May, the boundaries were changed to coincide with the county boundary. There are two Labour members of parliament (MPs), one Liberal Democrat and one Conservative.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/5576 |title=Bristol's Members of Parliament and Members of the European Parliament |accessdate=27 January 2013 |publisher=Bristol City Council | year= 2005 [/tpl]
After the 2010 British General election, the new political representation the city was composed of two Labour MPs, and one MP each for the Lib Dems and the Conservatives. The Conservatives gained Bristol North-West from the Labour Party.
Bristol has a tradition of local political activism, and has been home to many important political figures. Edmund Burke, MP for the Bristol constituency for six years from 1774, famously insisted that he was a member of parliament first, rather than a representative of his constituents' interests. The women's rights campaigner Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol. Tony Benn, a veteran left-wing politician, was MP for Bristol South East from 1950 to 1960 and again from 1963 until 1983. In 1963, there was a boycott of the city's buses after the Bristol Omnibus Company refused to employ black drivers and conductors. The boycott is known to have influenced the creation of the UK's Race Relations Act in 1965.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/nov/10/race.immigrationpolicy |title=In praise of ... the Race Relations Acts |accessdate=12 May 2007 |author=Alan Rusbridger |authorlink=Alan Rusbridger |date=10 November 2005 |publisher= The Guardian |archiveurl= |quote= | location=London[/tpl]
The city was the scene of the first of the 1980s riots. In St. Paul's, a number of largely Afro-Caribbean people rose up against racism, police harassment and mounting dissatisfaction with their social and economic circumstances before similar disturbances followed across the UK. Local support of fair trade issues was recognised in 2005 when Bristol was granted Fairtrade City status.
Bristol is unusual in having been a city with county status since medieval times. The county was expanded to include suburbs such as Clifton in 1835, and it was named a county borough in 1889, when the term was first introduced. However, on 1 April 1974, it became a local government district of the short-lived county of Avon. On 1 April 1996, it regained its independence and county status, when the county of Avon was abolished and Bristol became a Unitary authority. Despite this fact, many official records still state Bristol as being in Avon.

==Geography and environment==

===Boundaries===

There are a number of different ways in which Bristol's boundaries are defined, depending on whether the boundaries attempt to define the city, the built-up area, or the wider "Greater Bristol". The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which takes in a large section of the Severn Estuary west as far as, but not including, the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1312817302&type=-1&title=Bristol%3b+City+of+UA+|title= Area boundary for the Bristol unitary authority | work=NOMIS Labour market statistics | publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] A slightly less narrow definition is used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS); this includes built-up areas which adjoin Bristol but are not within the city council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway, Bradley Stoke, and excludes non-built-up areas within the city council boundary.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_fopm_urbanareas.pdf |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628203215/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_FOPM_UrbanAreas.pdf |archivedate= 28 June 2011 |title=The UK's major urban areas |format=PDF |first=Graham |last=Pointer|work=Focus on People and Migration |publisher= Office for National Statistics|year=2005|accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] The ONS has also defined an area called the "Bristol Urban Area," which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D8271.xls|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110628203914/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D8271.xls|archivedate=28 June 2011|title=Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas | publisher=Office for National Statistics|format=xls|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] The term "Greater Bristol", used for example by the Government Office of the South West,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southwesteip.co.uk/downloads/documents/sts.pdf|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120311210020/http://www.southwesteip.co.uk/downloads/documents/sts.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2012|title=Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study|last=Atkins|year=2005|publisher=South West Regional Assembly|format=PDF|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] usually refers to the area occupied by the city and parts of the three neighbouring local authorities (Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire), an area sometimes also known as the "former Avon area" or the "West of England".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12354243 |title=Avon and Somerset safety camera team to be disbanded |first= |last=Staff |work=BBC News |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011[/tpl] The North Fringe of Bristol, a largely developed area within South Gloucestershire, located between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named as part of a 1987 Local plan prepared by Northavon District Council.[tpl]cite news|title=Town and Country Planning Acts|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/51007/pages/9483/page.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=London Gazette|date=24 July 1987|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Physical geography===

Bristol is in a limestone area, which runs from the Mendip Hills to the south and the Cotswolds to the north east.[tpl]cite web | title= CotswoldS AONB | url= http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=Map | publisher=Cotswold AONB| accessdate=12 June 2011[/tpl] The rivers Avon and Frome cut through this limestone to the underlying clays, creating Bristol's characteristic hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshy before the growth of the city. To the west, the Avon has cut through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, partly aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Alfred Brian|year=1973|title=The geology and slopes of the Bristol region|journal=Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology|publisher=Geological Society of London|location=London|volume=6|issue=3–4|pages=185–205|doi=10.1144/GSL.QJEG.1973.006.03.02[/tpl] The gorge helped to protect Bristol Harbour, and has been quarried for stone to build the city. The land surrounding the gorge has been protected from development, as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The gorge and estuary of the Avon form the county's boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. There is also another gorge in the city, in the Blaise Castle estate to the north.

===Climate===

Situated in the south of the country, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK, with a mean annual temperature of 10.2–12 °C (50–54 °F).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif |title=Average annual temperature |accessdate=12 May 2007 |publisher=Meteorological Office | year= 2000 [/tpl] It is also amongst the sunniest, with 1,541–1,885 hours sunshine per year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif |title=Average annual sunshine |accessdate=12 May 2007 |publisher=Meteorological Office |year= 2000[/tpl]
The city is partially sheltered by the Mendip Hills, but exposed to the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel. Rainfall increases towards the south of the area, with annual totals north of the Avon River in the 600-[tpl]convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] range, up to the 900-[tpl]convert|1200|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] range south of it.[tpl]cite web |publisher=UKMO |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/swengland/7100_1km/Rainfall_Average_1971-2000_17.gif |title=Local Rainfall Map|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] Rain is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, although autumn and winter are the wettest seasons.
The Atlantic strongly influences Bristol's weather, maintaining average temperatures above freezing throughout the year. However, cold spells in winter often bring frosts. Snow can fall at any time from early November through to late April, but it is an infrequent occurrence. Summers are drier and quite warm, with variable amounts of sunshine, rain and cloud. Spring is unsettled and changeable, and has brought spells of winter snow as well as summer sunshine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif |title=Average annual rainfall |accessdate=12 May 2007 |publisher=Meteorological Office |year= 2000 [/tpl]
The nearest weather stations to Bristol for which long-term climate data are available are Long Ashton (about [tpl]convert|5|mi[/tpl] south-west of the city centre) and Bristol Weather Station (within the city centre). However, data collection at these locations ceased in 2002 and 2001 respectively, and Filton Airfield is now the closest weather station.[tpl]cite web | publisher = UKMO | url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/networks/images/map5.gif | title = Weather Station Location|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] The temperature range at Long Ashton for the period 1959–2002 has spanned from [tpl]convert|33.5|C|F[/tpl] during July 1976,[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=13&year=1976&indexid=TXx&stationid=1638 | title = 1976 temperature|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] down to [tpl]convert|-14.4|C|F[/tpl] in January 1982.[tpl]cite web | publisher = KNMI | url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=7&year=1982&indexid=TNn&stationid=1638 | title = 1982 temperature|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]

Like many large cities, Bristol experiences an urban heat island effect, with night-time averages at Bristol Weather Centre, in the city centre generally being just under 2 °C milder than those at Long Ashton, just outside the urban area.

===Environment===

Based on its environmental performance, quality of life, future-proofing and how well it is addressing climate change, recycling and biodiversity, Bristol was ranked as Britain's most sustainable city, topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's Sustainable Cities Index 2008.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-Britain-s-greenest-city/story-11233026-detail/story.html | title=Bristol is Britain's greenest city | last=Staff writer|date= 9 November 2008 |work=Evening Post|publisher=Bristol News and Media|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.forumforthefuture.org/sustainable-cities08 | title=Sustainable Cities Index 2008 | date= 25 November 2008 | publisher=Forum for the Future | accessdate=5 July 2009 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090418005928/http://www.forumforthefuture.org/sustainable-cities08  | archivedate=18 April 2009[/tpl] Notable local initiatives include Sustrans, who have created the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977,Sustrans, 2002.

==Economy and industry==

As a major seaport, Bristol has a long history of trading commodities, originally wool cloth exports and imports of fish, wine, grain and dairy produce, later tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods; major imports now are motor vehicles, grain, timber, fresh produce and petroleum products. Deals were originally struck on a personal basis in the former trading area around The Exchange in Corn Street, and in particular, over bronze trading tables, known as "The Nails". This is often given as the origin of the expression "cash on the nail", meaning immediate payment, however it is likely that the expression was in use before the nails were erected.[tpl]cite book|last=Knowles|first=Elizabeth|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-19-860219-7[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
As well as Bristol's nautical connections, the city's economy is reliant on the aerospace industry, defence, the media, information technology and financial services sectors, and tourism.[tpl]cite web|title=Bristol Local Economic Assessment March 2011|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/sites/default/files/assets/documents/Bristol%20local%20economic%20assessment%20March%202011_0.pdf|publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=29 March 2014|format=PDF[/tpl] The former Ministry of Defence (MoD)'s Procurement Executive, later the Defence Procurement Agency, and now Defence Equipment and Support, moved to a purpose-built headquarters at Abbey Wood, Filton in 1995. The site employs some 7,000 to 8,000 staff and is responsible for procuring and supporting much of the MoD's defence equipment.
In 2004, Bristol's GDP was £9.439 billion, and the combined GDP of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and North Somerset was £44.098 billion. The GDP per head was £23,962 (US$47,738, €35,124) making the city more affluent than the UK as a whole, at 40% above the national average. This makes it the third-highest per-capita GDP of any English city, after London and Nottingham, and the fifth highest GDP per capita of any city in the United Kingdom, behind London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Nottingham.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls |title= Sub-regional: Gross value added1 (GVA) at current basic price | format=xls | publisher=Office for National Statistics | accessdate=12 June 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511222553/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls  |archivedate=11 May 2011[/tpl] In March 2007, Bristol's unemployment rate was 4.8%, compared with 4.0% for the south west and 5.5% for England.
Although Bristol's economy is no longer reliant upon the Port of Bristol, which was relocated gradually to the mouth of the Avon to new docks at Avonmouth (1870s) and Royal Portbury Dock (1977) as the size of shipping increased, the city is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Since the port was leased in 1991, £330 million has been invested and the annual tonnage throughput has increased from 3.9 million long tons (4 million tonnes) to 11.8 million long tons (12 million tonnes).[tpl]cite web|title=Bristol (Avonmouth)|url=http://www.ports.org.uk/port.asp?id=219|publisher=Ports and Harbours of the UK|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] The tobacco trade and cigarette manufacturing have now ceased, but imports of wines and spirits by Averys continue.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.averys.com/jsp/common/uk/common/content.jsp?currentPage=homepage&page=about_averys |archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120415204436/http://www.averys.com/jsp/common/uk/common/content.jsp?currentPage=homepage&page=about_averys|archivedate=15 April 2012|title= About Averys Wine Merchants |first= |last=|work=Averys of Bristol |year=2011 |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]

In the 1950s it became one of the country's major manufacturers of civil aircraft, with the Bristol Freighter and Britannia and the huge Brabazon airliner. The Bristol Aeroplane Company diversified into car manufacturing in the 1940s, producing hand-built luxury cars at their factory in Filton, under the name Bristol Cars, which became independent from the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1960.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.boc.net/history.html | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061007123103/http://www.boc.net/history.html | archivedate= 7 October 2006 | publisher=Bristol Owners Club | title= A brief history of the Bristol Marque | accessdate=29 August 2007[/tpl] The city also gave its name to the Bristol make of buses, manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983, first by the local bus operating company, Bristol Tramways, and from 1955 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.
In the 1960s Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner project. The Bristol Aeroplane Company became part of the British partner, the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Concorde components were manufactured in British and French factories and shipped to the two final assembly plants, in Toulouse and Filton. The French manufactured the centre fuselage and centre wing and the British the nose, rear fuselage, fin and wingtips, while the Olympus 593 engine's manufacture was split between Rolls-Royce (Filton) and Snecma (Paris). The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/2/newsid_2514000/2514535.stm |title=BBC On This Day: 2 March 1969: Concorde flies for the first time |first= |last=Staff |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |accessdate=22 June 2011 |date=2 March 1969[/tpl]
In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to cease flying the aircraft and to retire them to locations (mostly museums) around the world. On 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Filton airfield to be kept there permanently as the centrepiece of a projected air museum. This museum will include the existing Bristol Aero Collection, which includes a Bristol Britannia aircraft.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.concordeatfilton.org.uk/ |title=Concorde at Filton |publisher=BAC Trading Ltd |accessdate=20 December 2008 [/tpl]

Bristol has 51 Grade I listed buildings, 500 Grade II* and over 3,800 Grade II buildings, in a wide variety of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to the 21st century. In the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, of which several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout the city. Surviving elements of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era,[tpl]cite book |last=Burrough |first=THB |title=Bristol |year=1970 |publisher=Studio Vista |location=London |isbn=0-289-79804-3 [/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] also some churches dating from the 12th century onwards.[tpl]cite web | title=Church of St James | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380890 |publisher=English Heritage | accessdate=15 March 2009[/tpl]

===Sport and leisure===

The city has two Football League clubs: Bristol City and Bristol Rovers, as well as a number of non-league clubs. Bristol City was formed in 1897, became runners-up in Division One in 1907, and losing FA Cup finalists in 1909. They returned to the top flight in 1976, but slowly descended to the bottom professional tier where, after bankruptcy in 1982 they reformed and climbed the league again. They were promoted to the second tier of English football in 2007. The team lost in the play-off final of the Championship to Hull City (2007–08 season). City announced plans for a new 30,000 all-seater stadium to replace their home, Ashton Gate. Bristol Rovers is the oldest professional football team in Bristol, formed in 1883. During their history, Rovers have been champions of the third tier (Division Three South in 1952–53 and Division Three in 1989–90), Watney Cup Winners (1972, 2006–07), and runners-up in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. The Club have planning permission to build a new all seater stadium on land at the University of the West of England's Frenchay campus. Construction of the new stadium is due to commence in Summer 2014 after a 12-month delay caused by a local pressure-group launching a Judicial Review over the redevelopment at the Memorial Stadium site.
The city is also home to Bristol Rugby rugby union club, a first-class cricket side, Gloucestershire C.C.C. and a Rugby League Conference side, the Bristol Sonics. The city also stages an annual half marathon, and in 2001 played host to the World Half Marathon Championships. There are several athletics clubs in Bristol, including Bristol and West AC, Bitton Road Runners and Westbury Harriers. Speedway racing was staged, with breaks, at the Knowle Stadium from 1928 to 1960, when it was closed and the site redeveloped. The sport briefly returned to the city in the 1970s when the Bulldogs raced at Eastville Stadium.[tpl]cite book | last = Bamford | first = Roger | title = Bristol Bulldogs Speedway : Bristol Bulldogs Speedway | publisher=NPI Media Group| date = 30 September 2003 | page = 128 | isbn = 978-0-7524-2865-9[/tpl] In 2009, senior ice hockey returned to the city for the first time in 17 years with the newly formed Bristol Pitbulls playing out of Bristol Ice Rink.
Motor racing has strong roots in Bristol with Joe Fry setting many records in the Freikaiserwagen and events held around the city. Speed trials have been staged in Clapton-in-Gordano, Shipham, Backwell, Naish, Dyrham Park, Filton Airfield and in Whitchurch (then Bristol's airport). A stage of the 1983 RAC Rally was held in the Ashton Court Estate. To this day, a sporting trial is held in woodland on the outskirts of the city and a classic trial is held in the hills surrounding the city.
The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, a major event for hot-air ballooning in the UK, is held each summer in the grounds of Ashton Court, to the west of the city. The fiesta draws substantial crowds even for the early morning lift beginning at about 6.30 am. Events and a fairground entertain visitors during the day. A second mass ascent is made in the early evening, again taking advantage of lower wind speeds. Until 2007 Ashton Court also played host to the Ashton Court Festival each summer, an outdoor music festival known as the Bristol Community Festival.
Mountain biking in Bristol, the main area is around the Ashton Court estate with the Timberland trails being the main route. There are also routes across the road in the Plantation and 50 acre wood and Leigh Woods.[tpl]cite web|title=Bristol Mountain Bike Club|url=http://www.north-bristol-mountain-bike-club.co.uk/|publisher=Bristol Mountain Bike Club|accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]

===Dialect===

A dialect of English is spoken by some Bristol inhabitants, known colloquially as Bristolian, "Bristolese" or even, following the publication of Derek Robson's "Krek Waiters peak Bristle", as "Bristle" or "Brizzle". Bristol natives speak with a rhotic accent, in which the post-vocalic r in words like car and card is still pronounced, having been lost from many other dialects of English, notably BBC English, or RP, i.e., "received pronunciation". The unusual feature of this accent, unique to Bristol, is the so-called Bristol L (or terminal L), in which an L sound appears to be appended to words that end in an 'a' or 'o'. There is some dispute about whether this is broad "l" or "w".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/sop/brizzle/story.shtml |title=Calling All Bristolians |last=Staff|work=BBC Bristol |date=14 August 2003 |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] Thus "area" becomes "areal" or "areaw", etc. The "-ol" ending of the city's name is a significant example of the occurrence of the so-called "Bristol L". Bristolians using the dialect, tend to pronounce "a" and "o" at the end of a word almost as "aw", hence "cinemaw". To the stranger's ear this pronunciation sounds as if there is an "L" after the vowel. For example the statement "Africa is a malaria area", spoken with a Bristolian accent will sound like "Africal is a malarial areal" or "Africaw is a malariaw areaw". Another example of the Bristol accent is broad a before "l", thus "Awbert" for "Albert", "fawt" for "fault".
Further Bristolian linguistic features are the addition of an additional "to" in questions relating to direction or orientation, or using "to" instead of "at" (features also common to the coastal towns of South Wales probably reflecting the use of "tu" in Welsh, e.g., "Y mae efe tu maes" – "That is he to outside" = "He/It is outside"); and using male pronouns "he", "him" instead of "it". For example, "Where is it?" would be phrased as "Where's he to?" and "Where's that" as "Where's that to", a structure exported to Newfoundland English.[tpl]cite web | title=An Introduction to Newfoundland Vernacular English | work=Language Variation in Canada | url=http://www.unh.edu/linguistics/courses/790CS/final.papers/NF.English.paper.htm | accessdate=28 January 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080629051238/http://www.unh.edu/linguistics/courses/790CS/final.papers/NF.English.paper.htm|archivedate=29 June 2008[/tpl]
Until recent times the dialect was characterised by retention of the second person singular as in the famous piece of doggerel, "Cassn't see what bist looking at? Cassn't see as well as couldst, casst? And if couldst, 'ouldn't, 'ouldst?" Notice the use of West Saxon "bist" for English "art".
And children could be admonished with, "Thee and thou, the Welshman's cow". As in French and German, use of the second person singular to a superior or parent was not permitted in Bristolese (except by Quakers with their notions of equality for all).
The pronoun form 'thee' is also used in the subject position (e.g., 'What bist thee doing?') while 'I'/'he' are used in the object position (e.g., 'Give he to I.').
The accent might have been influenced by immigration from the English Midlands, Wales, Cornwall and Ireland, since there is no evidence of the voicing of 's' and 'f', e.g., 'zummer' for 'summer' and 'vader' for 'father', which was characteristic of the surrounding Western counties and as far afield as Oxfordshire and Hampshire. In fact the Bristol accent is less like those of neighbouring Somerset and Gloucestershire than is the traditional accent of Berkshire.
Stanley Ellis, a dialect researcher, found that many of the dialect words in the Filton area were linked to work in the aerospace industry. He described this as "a cranky, crazy, crab-apple tree of language and with the sharpest, juiciest flavour that I've heard for a long time".[tpl]cite book|last=Elmes|first=Simon|title=Talking for Britain: A Journey Through the Nation's Dialects|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-051562-6|page=39[/tpl]

The city has many Christian churches, the most notable being the Anglican Bristol Cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe and the Roman Catholic Clifton Cathedral. Nonconformist chapels include Buckingham Baptist Chapel and John Wesley's New Room in Broadmead. St James's Presbyterian Church of England church (at [tpl]coord|51.4587|-2.5920[/tpl]) was just south of the current coach station. The church was bombed on 24 November 1940 never to be used as a church again. The tower remains but the nave has been converted to offices.
In Bristol, other religions are served by eleven Mosques,[tpl]cite web|title=Mosques in Bristol|url=http://www.allmosquestogether.org/mosques/|publisher=All Mosques Together|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] several Buddhist meditation centres, a Hindu temple, Progressive and Orthodox synagogues, and four Sikh temples.

==Education, science and technology==

Bristol is home to two major institutions of higher education: the University of Bristol, a "redbrick" chartered in 1909, and the University of the West of England, formerly Bristol Polytechnic, which gained university status in 1992. In addition The University of Law has a campus in the city. Bristol also has two dedicated further education institutions, City of Bristol College and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, and three theological colleges, Trinity College, Wesley College and Bristol Baptist College. The city has 129 infant, junior and primary schools,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/schoolfinder?Task=type&SchoolType=Primary&SchoolType=None |title=List of primary schools in Bristol |accessdate=27 January 2013 |publisher=Bristol City Council [/tpl]
17 secondary schools,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/schoolfinder?Task=type&SchoolType=Secondary&SchoolType=None |title=List of secondary schools in Bristol |accessdate=27 January 2013 |publisher=Bristol City Council [/tpl]
and three city learning centres. It has the country's second highest concentration of independent school places, after an exclusive corner of north London.[tpl]cite news |first=Curtis |last=Polly |title=To have and have not |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/jan/29/publicschools.schools |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2008 [/tpl] The independent schools in the city include Colston's School, Clifton College, Clifton High School, Badminton School, Bristol Grammar School, Redland High School, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital (the only all-boys school) and Red Maids' School, which claims to be the oldest girls' school in England, having been founded in 1634 by John Whitson.
In 2005, Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised Bristol's ties to science and technology by naming it one of six "science cities", and promising funding for further development of science in the city,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/university/vc/science-city.html |title=Vice-Chancellor's speeches and articles |accessdate=6 May 2007 |publisher=University of Bristol | date= 11 November 2005 [/tpl]

As well as research at the two universities, Bristol Royal Infirmary, and Southmead Hospital, science education is important in the city, with At-Bristol, Bristol Zoo, Bristol Festival of Nature and the Create Centre[tpl]cite web|title=Create Centre|url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/899|publisher=Bristol City Council|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] being prominent local institutions involved in science communication. The city has a history of scientific luminaries, including the 19th century chemist Sir Humphry Davy, who worked in Hotwells. Bishopston gave the world Nobel Prize winning physicist Paul Dirac for crucial contributions to quantum mechanics in 1933. Cecil Frank Powell was Melvill Wills Professor of Physics at Bristol University when he was awarded the Nobel prize for a photographic method of studying nuclear processes and associated discoveries in 1950. The city was the birthplace of Colin Pillinger, planetary scientist behind the Beagle 2 Mars-lander project, and was home to the neuropsychologist Richard Gregory, founder of the Exploratory, a hands-on science centre, precursor of at-Bristol.
Initiatives such as the Flying Start Challenge help encourage secondary school pupils around the Bristol area to take an interest in Science and Engineering. Links with major aerospace companies promote technical disciplines and advance students' understanding of practical design.
The Bloodhound SSC project, aiming to break the land speed record, is based at the Bloodhound Technology Centre on Bristol's harbourside.

==Transport==

Bristol has two principal railway stations. Bristol Temple Meads is near the centre and sees mainly First Great Western services including regular high speed trains to London Paddington as well as other local and regional services and CrossCountry trains. Bristol Parkway is located to the north of the city and is mainly served by high speed First Great Western services between Cardiff and London, and CrossCountry services to Birmingham and the North East. There is also a limited service to London Waterloo from Bristol Temple Meads, operated by South West Trains. There are also scheduled coach links to most major UK cities.[tpl]cite web|title=West of England Joint Local Transport Plan 3 2O11 – 2O26|url=http://travelplus.org.uk/media/205985/jltp3%20march%202011.pdf|publisher=West of England Partnership|accessdate=29 March 2014|format=PDF[/tpl] 
The city is connected by road on an east–west axis from London to West Wales by the M4 motorway, and on a north–southwest axis from Birmingham to Exeter by the M5 motorway. Also within the county is the M49 motorway, a short cut between the M5 in the south and M4 Severn Crossing in the west. The M32 motorway is a spur from the M4 to the city centre.
The city is served by Bristol Airport (BRS), at Lulsgate, which has seen substantial investments in its runway, terminal and other facilities since 2001.
Public transport in the city consists largely of its bus network, provided mostly by FirstGroup, formerly the Bristol Omnibus Company – other services are provided by Abus,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abus.co.uk/ |title=Abus |accessdate=20 December 2008 [/tpl]

Since 2000 the city council has included a light rail system in its local transport plan, but has so far been unwilling to fund the project. The city was offered European Union funding for the system, but the Department for Transport did not provide the required additional funding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/sus_2.pdf |title=Memorandum on Government Discrimination against Innovative Low-cost Light Rail in favour of Urban Diesel Buses |date=March 2006 | accessdate=1 January 2009 |format=PDF |work=Sustraco / H.M.

As well as support for public transport, there are several road building schemes supported by the local council, including re-routing and improving the South Bristol Ring Road.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gbsts.com/ |title=Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study Chapter 6 |accessdate=12 May 2007 |author=Atkins |year= 2005 |work=|pages= |archiveurl= |quote= [/tpl]
There are also three park and ride sites serving the city, supported by the local council.[tpl]cite web |url=http://travelwest.info/parkandride |title=Park and Ride |accessdate=29 March 2014 |publisher=Travel West[/tpl]
The central part of the city has water-based transport, operated by the Bristol Ferry Boat, Bristol Packet and Number Seven Boat Trips providing leisure and commuter services on the harbour.
Bristol's principal surviving suburban railway is the Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and Severn Beach. The Portishead Railway was closed to passengers under the Beeching Axe, but was relaid for freight only in 2000–2002 as far as the Royal Portbury Dock with a Strategic Rail Authority rail-freight grant. Plans to relay a further [tpl]convert|3|mi|km[/tpl] of track to Portishead, a largely dormitory town with only one connecting road, have been discussed but there is insufficient funding to rebuild stations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-01-24a.134.0 |title=Bristol-Portishead Rail Link |accessdate=12 May 2007 |authorlink= |date=24 January 2005 |work=House of Commons Debate |publisher=Hansard |language= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Rail services in Bristol suffer from overcrowding and there is a proposal to increase rail capacity under the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.
Bristol was named "England's first 'cycling city[tpl]'"[/tpl] in 2008, and is home to the sustainable transport charity Sustrans. It has a number of urban cycle routes, as well as links to National Cycle Network routes to Bath and London, to Gloucester and Wales, and to the south-western peninsula of England. Cycling has grown rapidly in the city, with a 21% increase in journeys between 2001 and 2005.
