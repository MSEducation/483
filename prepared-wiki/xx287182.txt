==History==

Hublished was co-founded by high school friends Ben Borodach, Nis Frome, and Yair Aviner, along with Ryan Kuhel, Carlos Ospina, Alex Lau, Chris Dilks, Kyle Byrne, and Alex Topchishvili.Team » Hublished Blog Frome and Aviner previously operated a web design and digital marketing company called Take It Worldwide during which time Frome conceived the idea for Hublished.  Recalling his experience in digital marketing, Frome said that "this content marketing revolution exploding...But there wasn’t really a site to hold all this content. You would have to already know the brand, go to their website, sign up for it there...very, very fragmented."Hublished Wants to Connect Businesses Through Content
The founders had the idea for Hublished for nearly a year before pursuing the project. Kuhel entered the concept for Hublished into the "Ready, FIRE!, Aim" competition run through FirstMark Capital Managing Director, Lawrence Lenihan's class at NYU.  The Hublished team initially lost the competition, but pursued the venture at the urging of Lenihan, who cited their lack of initiative as one of the reason they lost the competition.
Twelve months later, Lenihan reversed his decision, awarding an investment of $12,500 to Hublished. He wrote on his blog "Since the class ended, they have kept focus and have kept growing their business despite setbacks and obstacles."Hublished Wins My Salary! - Lawrence Lenihan's Blog  Soon after, Lenihan appeared in a TechCrunch interview with two of the Hublished founders.Hublished Gets Funding From NYU Prof. (AKA FirstMark Capital’s Lawrence Lenihan) During Spring Class | TechCrunch
