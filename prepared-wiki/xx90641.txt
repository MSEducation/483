Coulsdon South railway station serves Coulsdon in the London Borough of Croydon, and is in Travelcard Zone 6, on the Brighton Main Line. The station is served by Southern.

==History==

Coulsdon is on a stretch of line between Croydon and Redhill which the UK Parliament insisted should be shared by the London and Brighton Railway (L&BR) route to Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway (SER) route to Dover. As a result there have been a number of railway stations at Coulsdon.

===Stoat's Nest===

The first station in Coulsdon was opened by the L&BR in July 1841, named after a nearby settlement. It lay one mile south of Godstone Road (later called Purley), and was the first station to serve Epsom Downs Racecourse, some eight miles distant.[tpl]Cite book| last= Turner | first= John Howard | year=1977 | title= The London Brighton and South Coast Railway 1 Origins and Formation | publisher=Batsford | isbn= 0-7134-0275-X[/tpl] p.166. It was in service until December 1856, by which time the L&BR successor, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) had its own route from Croydon to Epsom.

===Coulsdon South===

This station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 1 October 1889. The line is on a steep gradient climbing towards Merstham Tunnel. It has two platforms. It was originally called Coulsdon and Cane Hill, referring to the nearby psychiatric hospital: a covered way, supposedly built because of the hospital, has been removed.
David Bowie's half-brother, a patient at the nearby Cane Hill psychiatric hospital, committed suicide by lying down on the tracks at Coulsdon South station.see   Documenting Cane Hill's Spooky Tales (Croydon Guardian)

===Ticketing===

The station remains staffed for most of the operational day, with a booking office located on the up (west) side of the station. At the entrance to the ticket office from the station approach road, there are two self-service ticket machines, one of which, most unusually, is wall-mounted.
A PERTIS self-service 'Permit to Travel' ticket machine was previously provided here but has been removed. Automatic Ticket Barriers were installed at the station in spring 2011
