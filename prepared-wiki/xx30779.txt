==Anglo Saxon church & chapel==

Deerhurst has an Anglo Saxon partly 10th century monastic building still standing, St Mary's Priory Church. It is notable among Anglo-Saxon buildings for the many features of the period which can be observed.Taylor, H.M. & Joan, Anglo-Saxon Architecture Cambridge 1965.Biddulph, Joseph,  Getimbrod: A Love of Anglo-Saxon Architecture  Pontypridd 2004.

Remarkably, there is a second important Anglo-Saxon building in the village, Odda's Chapel, a Saxon church, lying about 200 yards south-west of the church. An inscription dates this precisely to the reign of King Edward the Confessor.Higgitt, John, Odda, Orm and others: Patrons and Inscriptions in Later Anglo-Saxon England  Deerhurst Lecture 1999.
