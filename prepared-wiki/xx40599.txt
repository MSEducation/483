The Free State Project (FSP) is a political migration, founded in 2001, to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas.[tpl]cite news |title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all |first=Pam |last=Belluck |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 27, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl] The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of limited-government activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.
Participants sign a statement of intent declaring that they intend to move to New Hampshire within five years of the drive reaching 20,000 participants. [tpl]Asof|January 2014[/tpl], over 15,300 people have signed this statement of intent and more than 1,560 people are listed as "early movers" to New Hampshire on the FSP website, saying they have made their move prior to the 20,000-participant trigger.Live Free or Move

The Free State Project is a social movement generally based upon decentralized decision making. The group hosts various events, but most of FSP's activities depend upon volunteers, and no formal plan dictates to participants or movers what their actions should be in New Hampshire.

==History==

===Origins===

The Free State Project was founded in 2001 by Jason Sorens, then a Ph.D. student at Yale University.[tpl]cite web| author=Larry Clow | url= http://www.wirenh.com/Features/Cover_Story/the_Free_State_turns_two_20051005785.html | title= The Free State turns two | publisher=The Wire | date= October 5, 2005[/tpl]  Sorens published an article in The Libertarian Enterprise highlighting the failure of libertarians to elect any candidate to federal office, and outlining his ideas for a secessionist movement, and calling people to respond to him with interest.[tpl]cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe131-20010723-03.html | title=Announcement: The Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=131 | date=July 23, 2001[/tpl]  The movement never adopted the secessionist idea, with Sorens publishing a note in the journal to this effect two weeks after the original essay.[tpl]cite journal| last=Sorens | first= Jason | url= http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle2001/libe133-20010806-02.html | title=Update: Free State Project | journal=The Libertarian Enterprise | volume=132 | date=August 6, 2001[/tpl]  Sorens has stated that the movement continues an American tradition of political migration, which includes groups such as Mormon settlers in Utah, and Amish religious communities.[tpl]cite web| author=Joanna Walters | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/oct/01/usa.joannawalters | title=Free staters pick New Hampshire to liberate for sex, guns and drugs | publisher= The Guardian | date=October 1, 2003[/tpl]
The organization began without a specific state in mind.  A systematic review started by narrowing potential states to those with a population of less than 1.5 million, and those where the combined spending in 2000 by the Democratic and Republican parties was less than $5.2 million, the total national spending by the Libertarian Party in that year.  Hawaii and Rhode Island were eliminated from this list because of their propensity for centralized government.Joseph Spear, "An Experiment in Civic Engagement: The Free State Project", Oklahoma Policy Studies Review, Vol. 5, No. 1.

===State selection===

In September 2003 the state vote was held.  Participants voted using the Condorcet method to choose the state.Pete Camp, "Free State Project Picks New Hampshire", Up & Coming Magazine, October 8, 2003.  New Hampshire was the winner, with Wyoming coming in second by a 57% to 43% margin. Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont were also on the list.
New Hampshire was chosen because the perceived individualist culture of New Hampshire was thought to resonate well with libertarian ideals.  The Free State Project, however, has drawn criticism from some New Hampshire residents concerned about population pressure and opposition to increased taxation.  Some Republicans,Meredith Goldstein, "Free State Project pushes limits of liberty in N.H.", Boston Globe, October 19, 2003. on the other hand, have responded more favorably to the project, because of their espoused agreement on small government.

===Intent===

The FSP mission statement, adopted in 2005, states:
"Life, liberty, and property" are rights that were enumerated in the October 1774 Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress[tpl]cite web| title= Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress | url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp | date= October 14, 1774 | work= Avalon Project | publisher= Yale Law School | accessdate=2010-11-11| quote=That the inhabitants of the English colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS:  Resolved, N.C.D. 1. That they are entitled to life, liberty and property: and they have never ceded to any foreign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent.[/tpl] and in Article 12 of the New Hampshire state constitution.NH.gov constitution
To become a participant of the Free State Project, a person is asked to agree to the Statement of Intent (SOI):

===Recent events===

In December 2012, state representative Cynthia Chase (D-Keene) said "Free Staters are the single biggest threat the state is facing today."http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/27/new-hampshire-democrat-free-staters-are
In 2012, the Concord Police Department applied for $258,000 in federal government funding to buy a Lenco BearCat armored vehicle for protection against terrorist attacks, riots, or shooting incidents. The application said, "Groups such as the Sovereign Citizens, Free Staters and Occupy New Hampshire are active and present daily challenges." The grant from the US Department of Homeland Security was successful and the Concord City Council unanimously approved of the grant, after having revised the application to remove references to those political movements. http://www.unionleader.com/article/20130728/NEWS07/130729284
