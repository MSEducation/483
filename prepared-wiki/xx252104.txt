Husky is a line of hand tools, pneumatic tools, and tool storage products. Though founded in 1924, it is now best known as the house brand of The Home Depot, where it is exclusively sold. Its hand tools are manufactured for Home Depot by Stanley Black & Decker, Western Forge, Apex Tool Group, and Iron Bridge Tools.[tpl]cite web|author=Do-It-Yourself Retailing|title=The Stanley Works forms stronger alliance with Home Depot|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-84842694.html|date=2002-04-01|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] Its slogan is "The toughest name in tools." Home Depot also carries a higher-end line of tools marked Husky Pro.
Husky hand tools were formerly manufactured exclusively in the United States[tpl]cite web|author=The Home Depot|title=Weekly sales flyer|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m7w0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=pT8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4563,8654098&dq=husky+tools+made+in+usa&hl=en|date=1996-12-11|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] but are now largely made in China and Taiwan. All Husky hand tools have a lifetime warranty.[tpl]cite web|author=The Home Depot|title=Weekly sales flyer|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kvghAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VaIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5634,3439621&dq=husky+tools&hl=en|date=2004-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl] In the past, Home Depot had a program offering consumers an exchange of their broken Sears Craftsman or other brand of hand tool for a comparable Husky tool at no charge. This program has since been discontinued.

==History==

Husky Wrench was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on January 29, 1924 by Sigmund Mandl, who had immigrated to the United States from Czechoslovakia. By 1928, Husky had established a significant collaboration with the J.H. Williams Tool Group, with Williams distributing Husky wrenches in its mechanic's tool sets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~alloy-artifacts/husky-wrench.html|title=Husky Wrench, The Common Sense Tool Company|publisher=Alloy Artifacts|date=2009-02-10|accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl]
In January 1929, the Husky name was sold to the Olsen Manufacturing Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin. The company relocated to Kenosha and changed its name to the Husky Corporation. Mandl went on to work for Blackhawk Manufacturing  of Milwaukee.
Sometime before 1932, the Husky name was again sold, this time to the New Britain Machine Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which was purchased by Litton Industries in the 1970s. When Litton dissolved its hand tools division in the 1980s, it sold the Husky brand (and other assets, including the Blackhawk brand[tpl]cite web|title=Blackhawk Manufacturing: The Spirit of Innovation|url=http://home.comcast.net/~alloy-artifacts/blackhawk-innovation.html|publisher=Alloy Artifacts|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2010-03-08[/tpl]) to National Hand Tool. The Stanley Works acquired the Husky brand with its 1986 acquisition of National Hand Tool.[tpl]cite web|work=The New York Times|title=Company Briefs|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/01/business/company-briefs-623187.html?pagewanted=1|date=1987-01-01|accessdate=2010-03-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~alloy-artifacts/newbritain-nonebetter.html|title=The New Britain Machine Company|publisher=Alloy Artifacts|date=2009-09-07|accessdate=2010-01-12[/tpl] In 1992, Stanley began supplying the Husky brand exclusively to The Home Depot,[tpl]cite web|work=The Hartford Courant|title=Stanley to supply Home Depot|url=http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-31/business/0000110473_1_supply-home-depot-stanley-works-sears-craftsman|date=1992-10-31|accessdate=2010-03-08[/tpl] and sometime later transferred the rights to the name to Home Depot.

==Budget brands==

Home Depot's Workforce brand of tools was a budget brand slotted below Husky in quality and cost. It has largely been phased out and replaced by the HDX brand of tools and supplies, introduced in 2012.[tpl]cite web|last=Durham|first=Christopher|work=My Private Brand|title=Fifty2, The MPB Project: Home Depot â€“ HDX|url=http://mypbrand.com/2013/09/06/fifty2-the-mpb-project-home-depot-hdx/|date=2013-09-06|accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Davis|first=Scott|work=Forbes|title=How Target, Walgreens And Home Depot Have Forever Changed The Private Label Game|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottdavis/2013/05/23/how-target-walgreens-and-home-depot-have-forever-changed-the-private-label-game/|date=2013-05-23|accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl] These brands do not have lifetime warranties as Husky tools do.
