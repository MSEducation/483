==History==

Formed in 1969, the Graduate School of Business Administration enrolled its first class of 20 students in 1970.[tpl]cite web|title=About the Fuqua School of Business|url=http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/about/|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=31 March 2014[/tpl] In 1974, Thomas F. Keller, a 1953 Duke graduate, became the graduate school's new dean.  In three years, Keller's capital campaign raised $24 million, $10 million of which came from businessman and philanthropist J.B. Fuqua.  The graduate school's name was then changed to The Fuqua School of Business.[tpl]cite web|title=Annual Report 1997/98|url=https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/admin/extaff/news/report/report_98.pdf|publisher=The Fuqua School of Business|accessdate=31 March 2014[/tpl]
J.B. Fuqua was raised by his grandparents on a tobacco farm in Prince Edward County, Virginia.  Fuqua began his relationship with Duke University when he borrowed books by mail from the Duke library. J.B. Fuqua's cumulative giving to Duke was nearly $40 million at the time of his death on April 5, 2006.http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/about/leadership/jb_fuqua/

==Honor Code==

Some research shows that students studying business describe themselves as being academically dishonest more often than students pursuing other types of degrees.http://softwaresecure.typepad.com/multiple_choice/files/mba_cheaters_article.pdf To address such concerns, the school instituted an extensive honor code.http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2007/bs20070430_110466_page_2.htm At the end of the 2006–2007 academic year, Fuqua initiated a disciplinary action that was taken against 34 of the school's first-year MBA students — almost 10% of the school's 2008 class — for cheating on an open-book, take-home final exam.http://blog.clearadmit.com/2010/11/trivia-tuesday-honor-codes-at-tuck-yale-som-and-dukefuqua-4/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2007/bs20070430_110466.htm The Fuqua Judicial Board ruled in late April 2007 that 9 students should be expelled and 15 students receive a one-year suspension and a failing grade in the course. Nine others received a failing grade in the course and one student received a failing grade on an exam. All convictions and penalties were upheld by the school's appeals committee.http://dukechronicle.com/article/convicted-fuqua-case-cry-out
