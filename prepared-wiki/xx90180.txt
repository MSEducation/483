==Playing career==

===New York Yankees===

Rivera was signed by the New York Yankees as a non-draft amateur free agent in 1996 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 2001 against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was hitless in four at-bats in three games that first season. He returned to the Yankees on June 5, 2002 and recorded his first hit, a double, against the Baltimore Orioles. He hit a .265 batting average with one home run in 2002, Nevertheless, it was enough to warrant Baseball America naming him the #1 prospect in the Yankees organization. His strengths were described as 'above-average raw power', 'crushes fastballs' and had excellent defense. However, in spite of good contact, an impatient hitter and an average runner who would likely get slower with age.[tpl]cite news |last=Boyd |first=Josh |title=New York Yankees Top 10 Prospects |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/features/yankeestop03.html |date=December 2, 2002 |publisher=Baseball America [/tpl]
Rivera was again recalled in 2003, 2013-present this time to hit seven homers (including a multi-homer game) with 26 RBI and a .266 batting average.

===Montreal Expos===

He, along with Nick Johnson and Randy Choate were traded to the Montreal Expos before the 2004 season for Javier Vázquez. In 134 games with Montreal in 2004, he finished with a .307 batting average, 12 homers and 49 RBI.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===

On November 19, 2004, the Expos (on the verge of becoming the Washington Nationals) traded Rivera and shortstop Maicer Izturis to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for outfielder José Guillén. In his first season as an Angel, Rivera saw playing time as both an outfielder and a designated hitter. Although he started the season slowly, he stepped up his play in the final months of 2005 and finished with a .271 batting average and a then-career high 15 home runs and 59 RBIs in 106 games.
During the 2006 campaign, Rivera was made an everyday player, either starting at left field or serving as the designated hitter when veteran Garret Anderson played left. He finished the season with his best statistical year yet, batting .310 with 23 home runs and 85 RBI.
Juan Rivera was the starting left fielder for the Venezuelan team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic.
While playing for Oriente in Venezuela's winter ball, Rivera broke his leg sliding for first and was placed on the disabled list by the Angels. This injury kept him out for most of the 2007 season, with the exception of a brief appearance for 14 games in September.
On December 19, 2008, Juan Rivera re-signed with the Angels for three years worth $12.75 million through 2011.[tpl]cite web |title=Cot's Contracts |url=http://mlbcontracts.blogspot.com/2005/01/los-angeles-angels-of-anaheim.html Cot's Baseball Contracts Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim[/tpl]
Rivera had a good hitting season, especially in the months of May to July. He hit 25 home runs, batted for an average of .287, and had an on-base plus slugging of .810.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riverju01.shtml |title=Juan Rivera Statistics |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl] However, in contrast to the rest of the team, his baserunning was generally poor. Noted baseball analyst Bill James rated him the worst baserunner in the MLB in his annual book, because of his overaggressive tactics including being thrown out 8 times on attempts at going from first to third, costing his team an estimated 40 runs.[tpl]cite book |last=James |first=Bill |title=The Bill James Handbook (2010) |pages=313–314 |year=2009 [/tpl]
Rivera got 2010 off to a slow start, batting just .235 over the first two months of the season. He finished the season hitting .243 with 15 home runs.

===Toronto Blue Jays===

After the 2010 season, Rivera was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for outfielder Vernon Wells.[tpl]cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110121&content_id=16479674&vkey=news_tor&c_id=tor |title=Blue Jays trade Vernon Wells to Angels for Mike Napoli and Juan Rivera | bluejays.com: News |publisher=Toronto.bluejays.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2012[/tpl]
