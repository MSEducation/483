==History==

The Committee was first created after a large undercount was found in California after the 1990 decennial census.  It is estimated that because of the undercount, California lost billions of dollars in federal resources and congressional representation.http://www.csus.edu/calst/Government_Affairs/reports/A_REVIEW_OF_THE_CENSUS_UNDERCOUNT_ISSUE.pdf California State University Sacramento: A Review of the Undercount Issue
