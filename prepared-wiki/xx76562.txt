Yale Law School (often referred to as Yale Law or YLS) is the law school of Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The school's small size and prestige makes its admissions process the most selective of any law school in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilrg.com/rankings/law/index.php/1/asc/Accept/avg |title=2009 Raw Data Law School Rankings: Acceptance Rate (Ascending) |publisher=Internet Legal Research Group |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl] Established in 1824, Yale Law offers the J.D., LL.M., J.S.D. and M.S.L. degrees in law. Starting in 2013, YLS will also offer a Ph.D. in law. Ph.D. Program | Yale Law School. Law.yale.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-12. Yale Law has been ranked the number one law school in the country by U.S. News and World Report every year since the magazine began publishing law school rankings.ABA Journal, "It’s Official: Yale Law School Tops US News Rankings," Apr. 23, 2009 (2010 rankings). See also: Yale Daily News, "Yale Law still number one," Mar. 16, 2011 (2012 rankings). 
Yale Law has produced a large number of luminaries in law and politics, including United States Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton. The law school's Lillian Goldman Law Library has been memorialized as the meeting place of Bill Clinton and fellow student Hillary Clinton, the 67th Secretary of State. Former President William Howard Taft was a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School from 1913 until he resigned to become Chief Justice of the United States in 1921. Alumni also include current United States Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor, as well as a number of former Justices, including Abe Fortas, Potter Stewart and Byron White; several heads of state around the world, including Karl Carstens, the fifth President of Germany, and Jose P. Laurel, the president of the Republic of the Philippines; and the current deans of six of the ten top-ranked law schools in the United States: Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Chicago, Virginia, and Penn.
Each class in Yale Law's three-year J.D. program enrolls approximately 200 students. The school's law library, the Lillian Goldman Law Library, is one of the largest law libraries in the world. Yale's flagship law review is the Yale Law Journal.

==Culture==

The institution is known for its scholarly orientation; a relatively large number of its graduates (13%) choose careers in academia within five years of graduation, while a relatively low number (48%) choose to work in law firms five years after graduation.http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/cdo-summary_memo_96_00.pdf Another feature of Yale Law's culture since the 1930s, among both faculty and student graduates, has been an emphasis on the importance of spending at least a few years in government service.Statement of Dean Harold H. Koh, “Yale Law School Expands Public Interest Program, Financial Support for Graduates,” April 14, 2008. A similar emphasis has long been placed on service as a judicial law clerk upon graduation.Top-law-schools.com. Its 7.5 student-to-faculty ratio is the lowest among U.S. law schools.See 2009 Top-law-schools.com.
Yale Law does not have a traditional grading system, a consequence of student unrest in the late 1960s.Kalman, Laura, Yale Law School and the Sixties: Revolt and Reverberations (Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 2005) Instead, it grades first-semester first-year students on a simple Credit/No Credit system. For their remaining two-and-a-half years, students are graded on an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail system. Similarly, the school does not officially rank its students. It is also notable for having only a single semester of required classes, instead of the full year most U.S. schools require. Unusually, and as a result of unique Connecticut State court rules, Yale Law allows first-year students to represent clients through one of its numerous clinics; other law schools typically offer this opportunity only to second- and third-year students.
Students publish nine law journals that, unlike those at most other schools, mostly accept student editors without a competition. The only exception is YLS's flagship journal, the Yale Law Journal, which holds a two-part admissions competition each spring, consisting of a four or five-hour "bluebooking exam," followed by a traditional writing competition. Although the Journal identifies a target maximum number of members to accept each year, it is not a firm number. Other leading student-edited publications include the Yale Law and Policy Review, the Yale Journal on Regulation, and the Yale Journal of International Law.
In November 2013, it was announced that a $25 million donation would bring student dormitory living back onto campus, with renovations to begin in 2018.[tpl]cite news|title=Yale Law Will Bring Back Dorms Thanks To $25M Donation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/yale-law-dorms-donation_n_4234910.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2013|first=Tyler|last=Kingkade|date=2013-11-07[/tpl]

==Rankings and reputation==

Yale Law has been ranked the number one law school in the country by U.S. News and World Report in every year in which the magazine has published law school rankings.2009 Top-law-schools.com ("Since US News began ranking schools, Yale Law School has always held the #1 position...."). See also ABA Journal, "It’s Official: Yale Law School Tops US News Rankings," Apr. 23, 2009 (2010 rankings). The school also saw a greater percentage of its students go on to become Supreme Court clerks between the 2000 and 2010 terms than any other law school.Leiter Rankings: Clerkship Placement Additionally, a 2010 survey of "scholarly impact," measured by per capita citations to faculty scholarship, found Yale's faculty to be the most cited law school faculty in the United States.Leiter Rankings: Scholarly Impact

==History==

===Legal Realism movement===

Beginning in this period, a special relationship or connection developed between YLS and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Professors Clark and Frank, among others, became judges on that court. Some of the faculty members who became Second Circuit judges continued to teach courses at YLS and chose their clerks from student graduates. These judges influenced thinking in general at YLS and particularly reinforced student interest in public service, a characteristic tradition at YLS since the New Deal.[tpl]fact|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===Early 21st century===

The law school's 15th Dean, Harold Koh (2004-2009), made human rights a focus of the law school's work, building on a tradition that had developed over the previous two decades. On March 23, 2009, the White House announced the appointment of Koh to the United States Department of State as the Legal Adviser of the Department of State. Robert C. Post was selected to replace him as Dean of the Law School.Viewers of Le’s records may be fired | Yale Daily News | Page 28203. Yale Daily News (2009-10-07). Retrieved on 2013-08-12.

==Admissions==

Yale Law School enrolls about 200 new students a year, one of the smallest numbers among U.S. law schools. Its small class size and prestige combine to make its admissions process the most competitive in the United States. Half of the class that entered in 2006 had a GPA above 3.91 and/or an LSAT score above 173 (on a possible scale of 120 to 180) or 99th percentile.[ref]

After an initial round of screening by the admissions department, approximately 25% of applications are independently evaluated by three different faculty members. Each application is scored from 2–4 at the discretion of the reader. All applicants with a perfect 12 (i.e., a 4 from all three faculty members) are admitted, upon which they are immediately notified by the school. There are also 50–80 outstanding students admitted each year without going through this review process.[ref]

The LL.M. Program and the Visiting Researchers Program at Yale Law are amongst the smallest and most selective graduate law programs in the United States. Yale Law admits around 25 LL.M. students and around 10 visiting researchers every year.– p. 141 These programs are usually limited to those students who intend to pursue a career in legal academia.
Yale Law admitted only men until 1918, when it began admitting women.Stevens, Robert Bocking. Law school: legal education in America from the 1850s to the 1980s p. 84. Link to page in Google Book Search.
