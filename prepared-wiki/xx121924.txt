[[Trigonometry in Galois fields]]

CATEGORIES: Finite fields, Trigonometry

In mathematics, trigonometry analogies are supported by the theory of quadratic extensions of finite fields, also known as Galois fields. The main motivation to deal with a finite field trigonometry is the power of the discrete transforms, which play an important role in engineering and mathematics. Significant examples are the well-known discrete trigonometric transforms (DTT), namely the discrete cosine transform and discrete sine transform, which have found many applications in the fields of digital signal and image processing. In the real DTTs, inevitably, rounding is necessary, because the elements of its transformation matrices are derived from the calculation of sines and cosines. This is the main motivation to define the cosine transform over prime finite fields. In this case, all the calculation is done using integer arithmetic.
In order to construct a finite field transform that holds some resemblance with a DTT or with a discrete transform that uses trigonometric functions as its kernel, like the discrete Hartley transform, it is firstly necessary to establish the equivalent of the cosine and sine functions over a finite structure.

==Trigonometry over a Galois field==

The set GI(q) of Gaussian integers over the finite field GF(q) plays an important role in the trigonometry over finite fields. If q = pr is a prime power such that −1 is a quadratic non-residue in GF(q), then GI(q) is defined as
where j is a symbolic square root of −1 (that is j is defined by j2 = −1). Thus GI(q) is a field isomorphic to GF(q2).	        	
Trigonometric functions over the elements of a Galois field can be defined as follows:

==Unimodular groups==

To determine the elements of the unimodular group it helps to observe that  if ζ = a + jb is one such element, then so is every element in the set ζ = {b + ja, (p − a) + jb, b + j(p − a), a +j(p − b), (p − b) + ja, (p − a) + j(p − b), (p − b) + j(p − a)}.

===Example===

Unimodular groups of GF(72) and GF(112). In each case, table III lists the elements of the subgroups G1 of order 8 and 12, and their orders.

==Polar form==

Let Gr and Gθ be subgroups of the multiplicative group of the nonzero elements of GI(p), of orders (p − 1)/2 and 2(p + 1), respectively. Then all nonzero elements of GI(p) can be written in the form ζ = α·β, where α ∈ Gr and β ∈ Gθ.
By analogy, the modulus operation in GF(p) is such that it always results in a quadratic residue of p.
The modulus of an element of GF(p) is a quadratic residue of p.
The modulus of an element a + jb ∈ GI(p), where p = 4k + 3, is
In the continuum, such expression reduces to the usual norm of a complex number, since both, a2 + b2 and the square root operation, produce only nonnegative numbers.

==The Z plane in a Galois field==

The complex Z plane (Argand diagram) in GF(p) can be constructed from the supra-unimodular set of GI(p):

===Examples===

The number of elements of a given order as elements of GI(7) in the z plane over GF(7) is given in the inset of figure 2.
