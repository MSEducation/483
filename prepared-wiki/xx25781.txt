In the 2010 general election, the Sweden Democrats for the first time crossed the four percent threshold necessary for parliamentary representation. This increase in popularity has been compared by international media to other similar anti-immigration movements in Europe.Castle, Stephen Swedish Anti-Immigration Party Claims Seats, in nytimes global edition, September 19, 2010.

==History==

===Early years (1988–1995)===

The Sweden Democrats were founded on 6 February 1988[tpl]cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/vart-parti/partiets-historik-i-kronologisk-ordning/|work=Sweden Democrats|title=Partiets historik i kronologisk ordning|accessdate=25 January 2011|language=Swedish[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl][tpl]Third-party-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl] as a successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been founded in 1986 by the merger of the racist organisation Bevara Sverige Svenskt (BSS, English: Keep Sweden Swedish) and a faction of the xenophobic and populist Progress Party. The roots of the party can be found in Swedish fascism. One of the party's early chairmen, Anders Klarström, was formerly active in the Nazi Nordiska rikspartiet (Nordic Reich Party).[tpl]Citation |first=Anders |last=Widfeldt |title=A fourth phase of the extreme right? Nordic immigration-critical parties in a comparative context |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |year=2010 |number=1/2 |pages=7–31 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2010-1/widfeldt-anders-7/XML/[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sr.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1316&artikel=2728776|title=Det dubbla ansiktet – Sverigedemokraterna granskas|publisher=Sveriges Radio|year=2009[/tpl] The party was characterized initially by right-wing extremism and activism. In 1999 they rejected Nazism,Rydgren, 2006, pp. 108-109. although SD's long used logo in the 1990s and to 2006 was a Swedish version of the NF torch. While opinion on the early SD vary, it is generally agreed (including by the Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism and Expo) that the SD has never been a Nazi party, although various "connections" have existed through their members.[tpl]cite news|url=http://expo.se/2011/sa-ljuger-sd-om-sin-historia_3612.html|title=Så ljuger SD om sin historia|work=Expo|first=Daniel|last=Poohl|accessdate=24 January 2011|language=Swedish[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.skma.se/nov06/sverigedemokrater.pdf|title=Sverigedemokraterna inga arvtagare till nationalsocialisterna|work=Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism|first=Heléne|last=Lööw|accessdate=24 January 2011|language=Swedish[/tpl] The party did sponsor the music of a nationalist Viking rock band Ultima Thule, and various party leaders today acknowledge that the band's music figured prominently in their decision to become politically engaged.Teitelbaum 2013 The party's first auditor Gustaf Ekström was a Waffen-SS veteran and had been a member of the national socialist party Svensk Socialistisk Samling in the 1940s. Since the late 1990s, the party nevertheless underwent an extensive moderation policy.Rydgren, 2006, p. 108.

===Moderation (1995–2010)===

From 1995, the party's new leader Mikael Jansson (previously a member of the Centre Party) strove to make the party more respectable, and introduced a uniform ban in 1996, possibly as a result of photographs of members posing in Nazi uniforms at party meetings reaching the media.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/09/12/magasinet/politikk/utenriks/sverige/sverigedemokraterna/13277818/ |title=Gikk med naziuniform, hakekors og brunskjorte |newspaper=Dagbladet |first=Astrid |last=Meland |date=12 September 2010[/tpl] During the 1990s, the party became more influenced by the French National Front, as well as the Freedom Party of Austria, Danish People's Party, German The Republicans and Italian National Alliance. SD received economic support for the 1998 election from the French National Front, and was active in Le Pen's Euronat from the same time.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.expo.se/2010/sverigedemokraterna---fran-gatan-till-parlamentet_3279.html |title=Sverigedemokraterna - från gatan till parlamentet |publisher=Expo Idag |date=25 August 2010[/tpl] In 1999, however, SD left its membership in Euronat to its youth organisation. In 2001, the more radical faction in the party was expelled, which later led to the establishment of the National Democrats.Rydgren, 2006, p. 109.
Since the 2000s (decade), the so-called "Scania gang" or "Gang of Four"; Jimmie Åkesson (party leader since 2005), Björn Söder, Mattias Karlsson and Richard Jomshof continued the moderation policy which included ousting openly extremist members.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/verden/1.7304305|title=Fra kjelleren til Riksdagen|work=Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|first=Laila Ø.|last=Bakken|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2010-11-13[/tpl] Before the 2002 election, former Moderate Party MP Sten Christer Andersson defected to SD, citing that the party had gotten rid of its extreme right elements. In 2003, the party declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be a cornerstone of its policies.Rydgren, 2006, p. 116. In 2006, the party changed its logo from the torch, to featuring an Anemone hepatica, reminiscent of the party's very first, but short-lived logo: a stylized Myosotis scorpioides.

===In parliament (2010–present)===

In the 2010 general election, SD won representation in the Swedish Riksdag for the first time, with 5.7% of the vote and 20 MPs.
Swedish Democratic MP William Petzäll was persuaded to leave the party on 26 September 2011 while still retaining his parliamentary seat.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/avslojar/1.2572011/sd-ledamoten-william-petzall-lamnar-partiet-blir-politisk-vilde|title=SD-ledamoten William Petzäll lämnar partiet - blir politisk vilde|work=Expressen|first=David|last=Baas|date=2011-09-26|accessdate=2011-10-09[/tpl] This was done because of Petzäll's alcoholism and the problem that might cause for SD's public image. Petzäll later died of an overdose, and the seat was turned over to Stellan Bojerud in September 2012.
In November 2012, videos recorded in August 2010 were released in chunks over three days by Swedish newspaper Expressen. The videos, recorded by MP Kent Ekeroth , and featuring him and fellow Sweden Democrats Erik Almqvist (MP) and Christian Westling, showed Almqvist arguing with comedian Soran Ismail, among other things referring to Sweden as "my country, not your country". They were also shown threatening a drunken man, calling a woman a whore, and picking up iron bars[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44440/20121115/|title=Swedish press: scandal shows 'true face' of Sweden Democrats|publisher=The Local|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] only to leave them when they heard police sirens approaching. Only a month after party leader Åkesson had instated a zero-tolerance policy towards racism in the party,[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/akesson-stadar-upp-i-sd_7578948.svd|title=Åkesson städar upp i sd|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] the video caused Almqvist to leave his position as the party's economic policy spokesperson and his place in the executive committee on November 14. He excused himself as having been under a lot of pressure and threats of violence at the time.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44418/20121114/|title=Top Sweden Democrat quits after racist film|publisher=The Local|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] As more of the video was released revealing the other two men's involvement, the party announced on November 15 that Ekeroth would take a break from his position as the party's justice policy spokesman.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44432/20121115/|title=Ekeroth takes 'break' after new revelations|publisher=The Local|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] Almqvist and Ekeroth both took time off from their parliament seats. Sweden Democratic Youth president Gustav Kasselstrand and vice president William Hahne criticized the decision to remove Almqvist and Ekeroth in an op-ed in Dagens Nyheter, arguing that the party should not give in to media pressure.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sdu-fel-peta-almqvist_7671922.svd|title=SDU: Fel peta Alqvist|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl]
Only two weeks after Almqvist and Ekeroth were forced to step down, fellow MP Lars Isovaara reported being robbed of his backpack and pushed out of his wheelchair by "two unknown men of an immigrant background". When trying to get into the Riksdag, Isovaara was himself reported by the police for racial abuse against safety guards.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44724/20121128/|title=Oinking Sweden Democrat spat at guard|publisher=The Local|date=28 November 2012[/tpl] The Sweden Democrats initially defended Isovaara, but backed down when Expressen revealed that Isovaara had actually forgot his backpack at a restaurant, and that the two men had helped him when he fell out of his wheelchair.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/44726/20121129/|title=Found bag puts Sweden Democrat MP in doubt|publisher=The Local|date=29 November 2012[/tpl] He left his seat in the Riksdag on November 29, and was replaced by Markus Wiechel.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/isovaaras-ersattare-tidigare-domd-for-fortal/|title=Isovaaras ersättare tidigare dömd för förtal|publisher=Expressen|first=Oscar|last=Julander|date=29 November 2012[/tpl]

==Ideology and political positions==

The Sweden Democrats' party programme is based on nationalism and social conservatism.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://hsf.bgu.ac.il/europe/index.aspx?pgid=pg_127842651505941456|title=Radical Right-wing Populism in Sweden and Denmark|publisher=The Centre for the Study of European Politics and Society (Jens Rydgren)|accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl] The Sweden Democrat's ideological pillar is described in their manifesto first published on 4 May 2003 during Jansson leadership and then revised on 8 May 2005 (one day after Åkesson became the new chairman).[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/07/Sverigedemokraternas-principprogram-2005.pdf|title=Sverigedemokraternas principprogram|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|date=2005-05-08|accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl][tpl]Third-party-inline|date=August 2011[/tpl] The journalist and historical author Henrik Arnstad has characterized the party as fascist.DN: ”Sverigedemokraterna är ett fascistiskt parti” Nordic Studies scholar Benjamin Teitelbaum has called them radical nationalist. The party has been described by sociologist Jens Rydgren, and others, as xenophobic, racist and right-wing populist.Rydgren, Jens (2005). Från skattemissnöje till etnisk nationalism: Högerpopulism och parlamentarisk högerextremism i Sverige.

In 2013, a Sveriges Radio journalist called the party xenophobic, which resulted in a complaint lodged to the broadcasting regulator. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission determined that this description was acceptable to use.SvD: Granskningsnämnden: Tillåtet att kalla SD främlingsfientligt

===Immigration===

The Sweden Democrats believe that the current Swedish immigration and integration policies have been a failure.[tpl]cite web|last=Tamas|first=Gellert|title=För Sverigedemokraterna är Zlatan inte svensk|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/debatt-essa/for-sverigedemokraterna-ar-zlatan-inte-svensk|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|accessdate=1 August 2012|language=Swedish[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ullenhag|first=Erik|title=Sverigedemokraterna saknar integrationspolitik|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/14224/a/168696|publisher=Regeringskansliet|accessdate=1 August 2012|language=Swedish[/tpl] 
SD is the only party in the Swedish Parliament without an integration policy.[tpl]cite web|last=Tamas|first=Gellert|title=För Sverigedemokraterna är Zlatan inte svensk|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/debatt-essa/for-sverigedemokraterna-ar-zlatan-inte-svensk|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ullenhag|first=Erik|title=Sverigedemokraterna saknar integrationspolitik|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/14224/a/168696|publisher=Regeringskansliet|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl] 
They oppose integration because they believe that integration involves "meeting in the middle" and do not think that the Swedish people should have to bear the burden of what they see as a reckless immigration policy.[tpl]cite web|last=Åkesson|first=Jimmie|title=Vår politik A till Ö|url=https://sverigedemokraterna.se/vara-asikter/var-politik-a-till-o/#I|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]third-party-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl]
SD feels that the current situation with a large number of immigrants living in cultural enclaves is not beneficial for the country. The immigrants themselves are rootless, there have been rising antagonistic tensions between various population groups (socially, ethnically, religiously and culturally), and the immigration in itself, SD says, has caused social and economic strains on the country.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
As the party considers Sweden to have had too much immigration in later years, which it claims have seriously threatened national identity and societal cohesion, SD wants to reinstate a common Swedish national identity which in turn would mean a stronger inner solidarity. SD rejects the policy of multiculturalism, but accepts a multiethnic society where cultural assimilation is promoted. SD wishes to strongly restrict immigration, and give generous support for immigrants who instead of wanting to assimilate in Sweden voluntarily prefer to emigrate back to their country of origin. As more state funds are made free from funding mass immigration, SD believes that Sweden in turn will have the possibility to better help refugees in their own nearby locations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
SD has referred to the recommendations from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which state that the return of refugees should be the solution to refugee problems. Former party secretary between 2003–2004, Torbjörn Kastell had said in 2002 that the party wanted "a multicultural world, not a multicultural society. In a 2008 survey, a significant minority of 39 percent of all Swedes thought that there were "too many foreigners in the country", and in 2007 a survey showed that 49 percent of all Swedes wanted to restrict the number of asylum seekers.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_208921.svd|title=Folk tycker inte som journalister|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet—Göteborg TT|date=2007-09-26|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl] In recent years, SD has tried to approach the immigration policy of the Danish People's Party, which from 2001 to 2011 provided parliamentary support for the former Danish liberal/conservative government in return for a tightening of Danish immigration policies and stricter naturalization laws.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/46003/article/item/null|title=Vil kopiere Dansk Folkeparti|publisher=Klassekampen|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl]
According to Aftonbladet, 14% of SD members are of immigrant origin,[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/valet2010/article7178127.ab|title=Invandrare—och Sverigedemokrat |publisher=Aftonbladet|date=2010-05-24|accessdate=2010-10-22[/tpl][tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/index.php?showtopic=31568|title=Immigrants and Sverigedemokrat|publisher=The Local|date=2010-05-24|accessdate=2010-10-22[/tpl] which corresponds to the proportion of foreign-born in Sweden.http://www.scb.se/Pages/PublishingCalendarViewInfo259923.aspx?PublObjId=11400 For the 2010 election in the municipality of Södertälje (Stockholm County), SD was the only party with a majority of immigrants on its electoral list, mostly Chaldean Christians from the Middle East.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://lt.se/nyheter/1.810001-sd-har-flest-invandrare-pa-vallistan|title=SD har flest invandrare på vallistan|publisher=LT|date=2010-04-23|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl] Polling 7.31% (3,447 votes), SD's municipal list in Södertälje got 5 of the 65 municipal seats.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2010/valsedlar/K/kommun/01/81/valsedlar.html#id0110|title=Val till kommunfullmäktige i Södertälje—Valsedlar|publisher=Val.se|date=2010-09-21|accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl] Nader Helawi and 4 other Swedes from immigrant origin will sit as municipal councilors.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2010/slutresultat/protokoll/protokoll_0181K.pdf|title=Slutlig rösträkning och mandatfördelning—Val till kommunfullmäktige 2010-09-19—Södertälje kommun|publisher=Val.se|date=2010-09-20|accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl]

===The elderly===

SD wishes to lower the tax rate for the elderly, as well as increase subsidized housing for the elderly. SD also wishes to allocate additional resources to municipalities in order to provide seniors with greater food assistance and, in general, improve quality of life. SD has also emphasized a desire to crack down on abuses and crimes which, in particular, targets the elderly.https://sverigedemokraterna.se/vara-asikter/vara-viktigaste-fragor/en-trygg-och-vardig-alderdom/[tpl]third-party-inline|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Sami people===

The Sweden Democrats are critical of the special rights given to the indigenous Sami people of northern Sweden. It has been argued that the Sweden Democrats want to abolish their constitutional status as "indigenous" and even deport members of other ethnic groups.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsmill.se/artikel/2009/10/22/aven-samerna-ar-med-pa-sds-lista-over-oonskade-raser|title=Även samerna är med på SD:s lista över oönskade "raser"|publisher=Newsmill|date=2009-10-22|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl] In 2008, the party accepted a motion against the rights to reindeer husbandry. They have argued that those "who do not involve themselves with reindeer husbandry are treated as second class citizens" and that the privileges the herders have are "undemocratic". They want to restructure the councils and funds that are used to benefit the Sami population, so that they are used "regardless of ethnic identity and business operations." They also want to abolish the Sami Parliament which claims special privileges for an "ethnic minority while the society claims equal rights for others."[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sd-till-attack-mot-renagande-samer_1204465.svd|title=SD till attack mot renägande samer|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl]

===Law and order===

SD wishes to instate the possibility of life without parole for the worst crimes and to repatriate foreign citizens found guilty of serious crime (which already is general practice in Sweden, though the repatriation is usually limited to a few years after which the offenders are welcome to reapply for asylum). SD also wants to establish a public register of convicted pedophiles.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/valet-2010/krafttag-mot-brottsligheten/|title=Krafttag mot brottsligheten|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl]

===Foreign policy===

The Sweden Democrats in their foreign policy reject joining the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, are opposed to the Accession of Turkey to the European Union and want to renegotiate Swedish membership of the European Union.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/files/2010/09/Valmanifest_2010.pdf|title=Valmanifest 2010|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|date=2010-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-14[/tpl][tpl]third-party-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Culture===

The Sweden Democrats advocate a cultural policy that would strip funding for multicultural initiatives and strengthen support for traditional Swedish culture. This agenda has often manifest in opposition to state funding of immigrant cultural organizations and festivals, and support for traditional Swedish craft, folk music, and folk dance groups. The party also tends to oppose state-support for cultural initiatives deemed provocative or elitist.Teitelbaum 2013:242-265

===Family===

The Sweden Democrats are in favour of the traditional nuclear family and believe that every child should have "one father and one mother", according to their website. According to Social Democrat Björn Andersson's blog, SD is opposed to adoption rights for homosexual couples, and to letting lesbian women become inseminated.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.s-info.se/page/blogg.asp?id=1749&blogg=28025|title=Sverigedemokraternas syn på homosexuella!|publisher=S-info.se|date=2008-11-23|accessdate=2010-08-16[/tpl] Although SD strongly criticizes what it calls a Homosex Lobby, the party claims that it is not hostile to homosexuals. Furthermore, party leader Jimmie Åkesson expressed concern that what he describes as Islamization of Sweden will eventually lead to the rights of sexual minorities being violated.http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/sd-siktar-in-sig-pa-hbt-roster_5054837.svd

==Controversies==

During the 1990s, many outspoken far-right people were involved with the party.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9912/02/nazi1.html|title=Ett nätverk för nazister|publisher=Aftonbladet|date=1999-12-02|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl] The party was supported financially in the 1998 general election by the French National Front,[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_2275826.asp|title=Extremparti får mothugg|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=2002-05-04|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sverigedemokraterna.se/sd/asikter_skolwebb_utl.shtml|title=Sverigedemokraternas utländska kontakter|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|accessdate=2006-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040617030323/http://www.sverigedemokraterna.se/sd/asikter_skolwebb_utl.shtml||archivedate=2004-06-17[/tpl] and for the 2004 European election by Belgian Bernard Mengal.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://hd.se/inrikes/2004/01/27/extremist-ska-finansiera-sd-s-eu/|title=Extremist ska finansiera sd:s EU-val|publisher=Helsingborgs Dagblad|date=2004-01-27|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=128678|title=Sverigedemokraterna får miljoner av rik rasist|publisher=Expressen|date=2004-04-24|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl]

===The Sweden Democrats' response===

The party claims to dissociate itself from all forms of totalitarianism and racism and states that it considers the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights a fundamental component of its politics. Furthermore, the party says that its fundamental goal is to combine the principle of social and economic justice with traditional conservative values. For this reason, the party believes that it is not easily pinpointed on the traditional left-right political spectrum in Swedish politics.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://sverigedemokraterna.se/info/|title=Info om Sverigedemokraterna|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|accessdate=2010-10-01[/tpl] Also, the Sweden Democrats say they have expelled all openly extremist members from the party, and refuse membership to anyone who has extremist views.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Media boycott===

The Sweden Democrats have complained about difficulties buying advertising space due to the media banning the party from advertisement,[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ChapterID=239&CountryID=51&ReportID=83|title=Swedish General Election 2002 : media coverage|publisher=British Helsinki Human Rights Group|accessdate=2006-08-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927212926/http://www.bhhrg.org/CountryReport.asp?ChapterID=239&CountryID=51&ReportID=83|archivedate=2007-09-27[/tpl] which has been criticised by free speech organisations.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalfreepresssociety.org/2009/09/locking-out-the-sweden-democrats/|title=Locking Out the Sweden Democrats|publisher=International Free Press Society (IFPS)|date=2009-09-18|accessdate=2010-11-08[/tpl] On June 16, 2006, however Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet decided to stop their boycott. Expressen though still retains the ban on Sweden Democrat advertising.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fritt-fram-for-sverigedemokraterna-att-annonsera-1.654627|title=Fritt fram för Sverigedemokraterna att annonsera|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-06-16|accessdate=2006-08-01[/tpl]

===The Muhammad cartoon debate===

After the Danish daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten published twelve cartoons depicting Muhammad and ignited the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy during the 2005 autumn and winter, the Sweden Democrats gave their unreserved support to the publication with reference to the freedom of speech. SD stated that it saw no reason why a Danish newspaper should be forced to abide by Muslim rules and prohibitions regarding expression. When the boycott of Danish products was launched in the Middle East, SD launched a "Buy Danish" campaign in support of Danish workers.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sverigedemokraterna.net/kampanj_dk.php?action=fullnews&id=569|title=Stöd Danmark—Köp danskt!|publisher=Sverigedemokraterna.se|date=2006-02-13|accessdate=2006-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060502182151/http://www.sverigedemokraterna.net/kampanj_dk.php?action=fullnews&id=569|archivedate=2006-05-02[/tpl][tpl]third-party-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl] In 2006 SD entered to the Muhammad cartoon debate by publishing a Mohammed-depicting cartoon on its youth league (SDU) and SD-Kuriren websites. The cartoon showed Muhammad from behind holding a mirror in front of his face. However, instead of any facial features, the mirror showed only a blank head. The cartoon was captioned "Muhammad's Face" ([tpl]lang-sv|Muhammeds ansikte[/tpl]).[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/muhammedteckningar-borta-efter-saposamtal-1.628077|title=Muhammedteckningar borta efter Säposamtal|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl]
The publication attracted the attention of the Swedish government which informed internet service provider Levonline about the SD's publications. Subsequently, Levonline shut down SD’s web page. The government and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, denied any direct interference. However, at the same time Laila Freivalds condemned the publication as a provocation.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/regeringen-har-inte-varit-inblandad-1.674039|title=Regeringen har inte varit inblandad|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-26[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-forsvarar-beslut-att-stanga-sd-sajt-1.773593|title=Säpo försvarar beslut att stänga SD-sajt|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-26[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mycket-kravs-for-sajtstangning-1.681494|title=Mycket krävs för sajtstängning|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-26[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/sapo-lagger-locket-pa-1.659632|title=Säpo lägger locket på|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl] Freivalds then resigned as Minister after being accused of interference with press freedom and lying about such actions.
This event spurred debate on government censorship in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats also had a hate speech charge filed against them due to the posted caricature.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/centerpartist-polisanmaler-sverigedemokraterna-1.505666|title=Centerpartist polisanmäler Sverigedemokraterna|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=2006-02-14|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl] Similar hate speech charges were filed against other Swedish publishers who depicted Muhammad. However, these charges were immediately deemed to be unfounded by the Swedish Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern).[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_11790299.asp|title=Kritik mot stängning av nättidning|publisher=Svenska Dagbladet|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-25[/tpl]
The Sweden Democrats originally planned to publish a set of cartoons in their newspaper SD-Kuriren. However, after the controversy erupted, Jimmie Åkesson issued a statement on SD's website on 9 February 2006, stating that it would refrain from further publications online and in print, due to concerns that it might spur hostile actions against Swedes and Swedish interests.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1369|title=Vädjanden från landsmän fick oss att stanna upp|publisher=SD Kuriren|date=2006-02-09|accessdate=2006-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060908135455/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1369|archivedate=2006-09-08[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1372|title=Sverigedemokratisk Ungdom tar bort bilder efter samtal med SÄPO|publisher=SD Kuriren|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2006-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060922073908/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1372|archivedate=2006-09-22[/tpl][tpl]sv icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1368|title=Sverigedemokraterna avstår från vidare publicering av Muhammedbilder av hänsyn till svenska liv|publisher=SD Kuriren|date=2006-02-09|accessdate=2006-05-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807130853/http://www.sdkuriren.se/nyheter.php?action=fullnews&id=1368|archivedate=2007-08-07[/tpl][tpl]third-party-inline|date=September 2012[/tpl]
