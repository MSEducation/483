Illinois ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Illinois.ogg|ˌ|ɪ|l|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɔɪ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|IL|i|NOY|'[/tpl]) is a state in the Midwestern United States. It is the 5th most populous and 25th most extensive state, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country.[tpl]cite news|first=Stephen|last=Ohlemacher|title=Analysis ranks Illinois most average state|url=http://www.southernillinoisan.com/articles/2007/05/17/top/20300809.txt|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Southern Illinoisan|location=Carbondale, Illinois|date=May 17, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2009[/tpl] With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean; as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.
Although today the state's largest population center is around Chicago in the northern part of the state, the state's European population grew first in the west, with French Canadians who settled along the Mississippi River. After the American Revolutionary War established the United States, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1810s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved statehood. After construction of the Erie Canal increased traffic and trade through the Great Lakes, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River, at one of the few natural harbors on southern Lake Michigan."Chicago's Front Door: Chicago Harbor."

John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned Illinois' rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmlands, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. Railroads carried immigrants to new homes, as well as being used to ship their commodity crops out to markets.
By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans in Chicago, who created the city's famous jazz and blues cultures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/665.html |title=Jazz |work=Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/151.html |title=Blues|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=May 19, 2012[/tpl]
Three U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama. Additionally, Ronald Reagan, whose political career was based in California, was the only US President born and raised in Illinois. Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan, Land of Lincoln, which has been displayed on its license plates since 1954.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/special/plate_history/start_history.html |title=The History of Illinois License Plates |publisher=Cyberdriveillinois.com |accessdate=February 15, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/symbols/slogan.html |title=Slogan |publisher=Museum.state.il.us |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is located in the state capital of Springfield.

==Name==

"Illinois" is the modern spelling for the early French missionaries and explorers' name for the Illinois natives, a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.Fay, J. (2009) Eriniouaj. Retrieved October 21, 2009 from http://www.illinoisprairie.info/Eriniouaj.htm.
American scholars thought the name "Illinois" meant "man" or "men" in the Miami-Illinois language, with the original iliniwek transformed via French into Illinois.[tpl]cite book |last= Hodge |first= Frederick Webb |authorlink= Frederick Webb Hodge |title= Handbook of American Indians north of Mexico, Volume 1 |year= 1911 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology |oclc= 26478613 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ze4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597 |page= 597[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

The name "Illinois" derives from the Miami-Illinois verb irenwe·wa "he speaks the regular way". This was taken into the Ojibwe language, perhaps in the Ottawa dialect, and modified into ilinwe· (pluralized as ilinwe·k). The French borrowed these forms, changing the /we/ ending to spell it as -ois, a transliteration for its pronunciation in French of that time. The current spelling form, Illinois, began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois' name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was Inoka, of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.[tpl]cite book |last= Callary |first= Edward |title= Place Names of Illinois |year= 2008 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn= 978-0-252-03356-8 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA169 |page= 169[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last= Costa|first= David J.|date=January 2007|title= Three American Placenames: Illinois|journal=Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter|volume= 25|issue= 4|pages= 9–12|issn= 1046-4476|url= http://myaamia.strackattack.com/OtherFiles/CostaNewsletter.pdf#page=9|accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-European===

American Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans.  The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and urban center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a [tpl]convert|50|acre|ha|0[/tpl] plaza larger than 35 football fields,[tpl]cite book|authorlink=Timothy Pauketat|last=Timothy R.|first=Pauketat|title=Cahokia : Ancient Americas Great City on the Mississippi|publisher=Viking Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-670-02090-4|pages=23–34|quote=Pg 23 "Cahokia was so large-covering three to five square miles-that archaeologists have yet to probe many portions of it. Its centerpiece was an open fifty-acre Grand Plaza, surrounded by packed-clay pyramids. The size of thirty-five football fields, the Grand Plaza was at the time the biggest public space ever conceived and executed north of Mexico."...Pg 34 "a flat public square 1,600-plus feet in length and 900-plus feet in width[/tpl] and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture's cosmology.

The civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, "At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one-third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries."[ref]

The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance.E. Hoxie, Encyclopedia of North American Indians (1996) 266-7, 506 Gradually, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes. In the American Revolution, the Illinois and Potawatomi supported the Patriot colonists' cause.

===European exploration===

French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673. In 1680, other French explorers constructed a fort at the site of present day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today's Starved Rock State Park. French Canadians came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of the French empire of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, Missouri to evade British rule.
A few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians. In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed the Illinois Country for Virginia. In a compromise, Virginia ceded the area to the new United States in 1783 and it became part of the Northwest Territory, to be administered by the federal government and later organized as states.[tpl]cite book |last=Biles |first=Roger |title= Illinois: A History of the Land and its People|year= 2005|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location= DeKalb|isbn=0-87580-349-0[/tpl]

===19th century===

The Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement.
During the discussions leading up to Illinois' admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sancohis.org/presentations/Illinois%20From%20Territory%20to%20State.htm |title=Full Remarks from Dave M |publisher=Sancohis.org |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10-mile northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. But the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more. Pope lobbied to have the boundary moved further north, and the final bill passed by Congress did just that; it included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately [tpl]convert|51|mi|km[/tpl] north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added [tpl]convert|8500|sqmi|km2|-2[/tpl] to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal which would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers, and thus, connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.
In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield,[tpl]cite web|url=http://abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=137&CRLI=193 |title=Abraham Lincoln and Springfield – Abraham Lincoln's Classroom |publisher=Abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl] where a fifth capitol building was constructed. A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.
Though it was ostensibly a "free state", there was slavery in Illinois. The ethnic French had owned black slaves as late as the 1820s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a sovereign state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state. As the southern part of the state, later known as "Egypt"or "Little Egypt",[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-06-24/news/0106240357_1_illinois-egypt-logan |title=The other Illinois: How Egypt lost its clout – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=June 24, 2001 |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/may/02/backroads-tourism/ |title=Southern Illinois Backroads Tourism: In Little Egypt it means bluffs, Superman, even scuba diving » Evansville Courier & Press |publisher=Courierpress.com |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl] was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks. Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal. Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.Paul Finkelman, Slavery and the Founders: Race and Liberty in the Age of Jefferson, (2001), p 78 The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.James Pickett Jones, Black Jack: John A. Logan and Southern Illinois in the Civil War Era 1967 ISBN 0-8093-2002-9.
In 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and current-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki) and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.[tpl]cite web|url = http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/141.html |title = Black Hawk War |publisher = Encyclopedia of Chicago |accessdate = August 10, 2012[/tpl] The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa.[tpl]cite web|url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/ | title = The Black Hawk War of 1832| author = Lewis, James |publisher = Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project |accessdate = August 10, 2012[/tpl]
The winter of 1830–1831 is called the "Winter of the Deep Snow"; a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the "Winter of the Sudden Freeze". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north and this may have contributed to its name: "Little Egypt", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.Duff, Judge Andrew D. Egypt - Republished, Springhouse Magazine, accessed May 1, 2006.
By 1839, the Mormons had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo. Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished and soon rivaled Chicago for the position of the state's largest city. But in 1844, the Mormon leader Joseph Smith was murdered in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Soon afterward, the Mormons' new leadership led the group out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo rapidly declined afterward. [tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois' largest city. With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying [tpl]convert|4|sqmi|km2[/tpl].Roland Tweet, Miss Gale's Books: The Beginnings of the Rock Island Public Library, (Rock Island, IL: Rock Island Public Library, 1997), 15.
In 1847, after lobbying by Dorothea L. Dix, Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local almshouses.

====Civil War====

During the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in men who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments."Illinois Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery Units", Illinois in the Civil War, Retrieved November 26, 2006 The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army. For several months, both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo.

===20th century===

At the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5 million, with many workers attracted to its expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.[tpl]cite web|title=Illinois – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1800 to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html[/tpl] Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4 million.
The Century of Progress World's Fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County lead to a boom in 1937, and, by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking seventh among the 48 states.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.111 Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines (which still exists today as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street).
No state has had a more prominent role than Illinois in the emergence of the nuclear age. As part of the Manhattan Project, in 1942 the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world's largest for over 40 years. And, with eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.comed.com/sites/PartnersBusiness/Documents/EconomicDevelopmentFactSheet.pdf |title=ComEd and Electricity Related Messages for Economic Development |format=PDF |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]https://www.comed.com/Documents/about-us/economic-development/ComEd_and_Electricity_Related_EconDev_Messages_-_January_2012.pdf
In 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy. The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18.[tpl]cite web |last=Painter |first=George|title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States: Illinois |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/illinois.htm#fn73|work=The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers|publisher=Gay & Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest|accessdate=January 12, 2012|date=August 10, 2004[/tpl] The state's fourth constitution was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.

==Geography==

[tpl]further|List of ecoregions in Illinois[/tpl]300px|thumb|Illinois, showing major cities and roads
Illinois is located in the Midwest Region of the United States and is one of the nine states and Canadian Province of Ontario in the bi-national Great Lakes region of North America.

===Boundaries===

Illinois' eastern border with Indiana consists of a north-south line at [tpl]Unicode|87° 31′ 30″[/tpl] west longitude, from Lake Michigan to the Wabash River above Post Vincennes. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River. This marks the beginning of Illinois' southern border with Kentucky, which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.Wikisource. Illinois Constitution of 1818. Most of the western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. Its northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at [tpl]Unicode|42° 30'[/tpl] north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois actually lies within Lake Michigan, within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan.[tpl]cite book |editor=Nelson, Ronald E. (ed.) |others= |title=Illinois: Land and Life in the Prairie State|origdate= |origyear= |url= |edition= |year=1978|publisher=Kendall/Hunt|location= Dubuque, Iowa|isbn=0-8403-1831-6|oclc= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]

===Topography===

Though Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Charles Mound, located in this region, has the state's highest elevation above sea level at [tpl]convert|1235|ft|m[/tpl]. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom.

===Divisions===

Illinois has three major geographical divisions. Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has a population of over 9.8 million people. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, and the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of Rockford, Illinois' third largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some [tpl]convert|75|mi|km[/tpl] northwest of Chicago. The Quad Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.
The midsection of Illinois is a second major division, called Central Illinois. It is an area of mostly prairie and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium-small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include Peoria, Springfield, the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington-Normal; and Champaign-Urbana.
The third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.[tpl]cite book |last=Horsley |first=A. Doyne |title=Illinois: A Geography |year=1986 |publisher=Westview Press|location= Boulder|isbn=0-86531-522-1 [/tpl] This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage, unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, such as East St. Louis are located in this region and collectively they are known as the Metro-East. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents. A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville, Indiana Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.
In addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside of the Chicago Metropolitan area is often called "downstate" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the Chicago-area. Thus, some cities in Northern Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockford—which is actually north of Chicago—are considered to be "downstate".

===Climate===

Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, Illinois has a widely varying climate. Most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southernmost part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, borders on a humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over [tpl]convert|48|in|0[/tpl] at the southern tip to around [tpl]convert|35|in|0[/tpl] in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds [tpl]convert|38|in|0[/tpl] in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than [tpl]convert|14|in|0[/tpl].Illinois State Climatologist Office.

While tornadoes are no more powerful in Illinois than other states, the nation's deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred largely in Illinois because it is the most populous state in Tornado Alley. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims died in Illinois.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/pah/1925/gi_body.php |author=PAH Webmaster |title=NWS Paducah, KY: NOAA/NWS 1925 Tri-State Tornado Web Site – General Information |date=November 2, 2005 |accessdate=November 16, 2006[/tpl]  Other significant high-casualty tornadoes included the 1896 St. Louis – East St. Louis tornado which killed 111 people in East St. Louis and a May 1917 tornado that killed 101 people in Charleston and Mattoon. Modern developments in storm forecasting and tracking in the mid 20th Century have caused death tolls from tornadoes to dramatically decline, with the 1967 Belvidere – Oak Lawn tornado outbreak (58 fatalities) and 1990 Plainfield tornado (29 fatalities) standing out as exceptions. On November 18, 2013, tornadoes touched down and ripped through Washington, Illinois. There were 7 fatalities.

===Languages===

The official language of Illinois is English. Nearly 80% of the population speak English natively, and most of the rest speak it fluently as a second language.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-22.pdf |title=Language Use in the United States: American Community Survey Reports |last1=Ryan |first1=Camille |date=August 2013 |website=Census.gov |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=30 March 2014 [/tpl] A number of dialects of American English are spoken, ranging from Inland Northern American English around Chicago, to Southern American English in the far south. Illinois has speakers of many other immigrant languages, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread.

Illinois played an important role in the early Latter Day Saint movement, with Nauvoo, Illinois, becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the succession crisis, which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into several Latter Day Saint sects. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has over 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/usa-illinois |title=Newsroom – The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |accessdate=February 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] The largest and oldest surviving Bahá'í House of Worship in the world is located in Wilmette, Illinois.

===Manufacturing===

Illinois is one of the nation's manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107 billion in 2006. As of 2011, Illinois is ranked as the 4th most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio.http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/1357C591-2810-4228-A334-E8B55EF1288D/0/Manufacturing2011.pdf About three-quarters of the state's manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois' approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County.

===Services===

By the early 2000s, Illinois' economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois' earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.

===Energy===

Illinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption."Illinois in the Global Energy Marketplace", Robert Finley, 2001. Illinois State Geological Survey publication.

====Coal====

The coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal & Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula.Illinois State Geological Survey. Coal in Illinois. Retrieved December 4, 2008. However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4 million tons of coal, but only 17 million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported 3 million tons of coal and was projected to export 9 million tons in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, elsewise in Asia and Europe.http://www.ildceo.net/NR/rdonlyres/EA15E8A9-E0BD-468A-A308-BE58E93D0C03/0/CoalInIllinois2011.pdf As of 2010, Illinois is was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the Nation. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21 million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.
Mattoon was recently chosen as the site for the Department of Energy's FutureGen project, a 275 megawatt experimental zero emission coal-burning power plant which just received a second round of funding from the DOE. In 2010, after a number of setbacks, the city of Mattoon backed out of the project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://permianbasin360.com/fulltext?nxd_id=71755 |title=Illinois Town Gives Up on Futurgen |publisher=Permianbasin360.com |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl]

====Nuclear power====

Nuclear power arguably began in Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in the world's first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood; Byron; Clinton; Dresden; LaSalle; and Quad Cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/nuclear/state_profiles/illinois/il.html |title=Nuclear State Profiles |publisher=Eia.gov |accessdate=April 29, 2012[/tpl] With the exception of the single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the Nation’s total. In 2007, 48% of Illinois' electricity was generated using nuclear power.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/states/statesil.html|title=Illinois Nuclear Industry|date=November 6, 2009|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=January 29, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]

====Wind power====

Illinois has seen growing interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation."Illinois Wind." Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs, Western Illinois University Illinoiswind.com Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as "marginal or fair" for wind energy production by the U.S. Department of Energy, with some western sections rated "good" and parts of the south rated "poor".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/astate_template.asp?stateab=il|title= Illinois Wind Activities|date=October 20, 2009|work=EERE|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=January 14, 2010[/tpl] These ratings are for wind turbines with [tpl]convert|50|m|adj=on[/tpl] hub heights; newer wind turbines are taller, enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground. As a result, more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites. As of September 2009, Illinois had 1116.06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741.9 MW under construction.[ref]
