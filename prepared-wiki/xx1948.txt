[[Hypothetical types of biochemistry]]

Hypothetical types of biochemistry are forms of biochemistry speculated to be scientifically viable but not proven to exist at this time. While the kinds of living beings currently known on Earth commonly use carbon for basic structural and metabolic functions, water as a solvent and DNA or RNA to define and control their form, it may be possible that undiscovered life-forms could exist that differ radically in their basic structures and biochemistry from that known to science.
The possibility of extraterrestrial life being based on these "alternative" biochemistries is a common subject in science fiction, but is also discussed in a non-fiction scientific context.

==Shadow biosphere==

Apart from the prospect of finding different forms of life on other planets or moons, Earth itself has been suggested as a place where a shadow biosphere of biochemically unfamiliar micro-organisms might have lived in the past, or may still exist today.Davies, P. C. W. , Benner, S.A., Cleland, C.E., Lineweaver,C.H., McKay,C.P. and Wolfe-Simon,F. Signatures of a Shadow Biosphere (2009) Astrobiology. 9(2): 241-249.

==Alternative-chirality biomolecules==

Perhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing chirality of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, amino acids are almost universally of the L form and sugars are of the D form. Molecules of opposite chirality have identical chemical properties to their mirrored forms, so life that used D amino acids or L sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. It is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien; while it is certainly an alternative stereochemistry, molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one enantiomer throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often basal) organisms such as in comparisons between members of Archea and other domains,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] making it an open topic whether an alternative stereochemistry is truly novel.

==Non-carbon-based biochemistries==

On Earth, all known living things have a carbon-based structure and system. Scientists have speculated about the pros and cons of using atoms other than carbon to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the necessary structures. However, as Carl Sagan argued, it is very difficult to be certain whether a statement that applies to all life on Earth will turn out to apply to all life throughout the universe.[tpl]cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|first2=Jerome|last2=Agel|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000|isbn=9780521783033|page=41[/tpl] Sagan used the term "carbon chauvinism" for such an assumption.[tpl]cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000 |page=46[/tpl] Carl Sagan regarded silicon and germanium as conceivable alternatives to carbon; but, on the other hand, he noted that carbon does seem more chemically versatile and is more abundant in the cosmos.[tpl]cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| year=2000|page=47[/tpl]

===Silicon biochemistry===

The most commonly proposed basis for an alternative biochemical system is the silicon atom, because silicon has many chemical properties similar to those of carbon and is in the same group of the periodic table, the carbon group. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.[tpl]cite journal|last1 = Pace|first1 = NR|title = The universal nature of biochemistry|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/805.full.pdf| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume = 98|issue = 3|pages = 805–8|year = 2001 |pmid = 11158550|pmc = 33372|doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805|bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P[/tpl]
However, silicon has several drawbacks as an alternative to carbon. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms. Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as "monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules". This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger mass and atomic radius, and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the carbonyl group, a fundamental motif of bio-organic chemistry).
Silanes, which are chemical compounds of hydrogen and silicon that are analogous to the alkane hydrocarbons, are highly reactive with water, and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating polymers of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as silicones, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.[tpl]cite book|first=Stephen|last=Gillette| title=World-Building|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=0-89879-707-1[/tpl] Complex long-chain silicone molecules are still less stable than their carbon counterparts, though.
Another obstacle is that silicon dioxide (a common ingredient of many sands), the analog of carbon dioxide, is an insoluble solid at the temperature range where water is liquid, making it difficult for silicon to be introduced into water-based biochemical systems even if the necessary range of biochemical molecules could be constructed out of it. Another problem with silicon dioxide is that it would be the product of aerobic respiration. If a silicon-based life form were to breathe using oxygen, as life on Earth does, it would possibly produce silicon dioxide as a by-product of this, assuming that the only difference between the two types of life is silicon in place of carbon. This implies that the exhaled product, silicon dioxide, would be a solid, thus filling the respiratory organs of the organism with sand. This however would be solved if the organism lives in temperatures of several hundred to thousand degrees, where the silicon dioxide becomes a liquid. Oxygen-breathing silicon life, if it exists, is therefore most likely to exist in environments with very high temperatures or pressure.
Finally, of the varieties of molecules identified in the interstellar medium [tpl]As of|1998|lc=on[/tpl], 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html| title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon? Why couldn't organisms be based on other substances?| work=sci.astro ET Life (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions)| accessdate=2006-07-21| first=Joseph| last=Lazio[/tpl] Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Somewhat in support, in September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar-medium conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics - "a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively".[tpl]cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=September 22, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24 [/tpl] (Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.")
Also, even though Earth and other terrestrial planets are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in the Earth's crust is roughly 925:1[ref]
