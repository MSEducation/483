Quiz questions are set by reporters on location, who ask celebrity panelists in the studio to guess the prices of various things. In the show's original format, panelists guessed the prices of expensive or unusual items or services from around the world. In the present format, however, they are asked to guess prices related to the lifestyles of the rich. The rich people visited are generally in Japan, although questions are sometimes sent from overseas.
