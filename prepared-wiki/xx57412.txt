Sebastiano Ziani was Doge of Venice from 1172 to 1178. He was one of the greatest planners of Venice.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
During his short term as Doge, Ziani divided the city-state into many districts. He realised that the government headquarters were too close to the shipyard. As such, they were affected by the noise from the shipyard. Ziani resolved this problem by donating a piece of land to the city-state and relocating the shipyard in it.
He also hosted Pope Alexander III, the Emperor Frederick I, and the delegation of William II of Sicily for the signing of the Treaty of Venice in July 1177. He was married to a woman named Cecilia.Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wifes of the doges. London : T. W. Laurie
