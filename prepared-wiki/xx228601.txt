Harbor View House, formerly the Army and Navy Y.M.C.A., is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #252) located in the San Pedro section of Los Angeles, California, near the Port of Los Angeles.

==History==

The Army and Navy Y.M.C.A. was dedicated in 1926 as a recreation center for servicemen at Fort MacArthur, offering 300 dormitory rooms, a gymnasium, running track, banquet room, patio, pool, boxing and wrestling rooms and a coffee shop.  It provided recreation and temporary quarters for over four million men during World War II, and was visited by celebrities, including Bob Hope and Lucille Ball.  
The facility was converted to civilian use in 1947, offering accommodations to young travelers and senior citizens. Since 1967, it has been known as Harbor View House, offering housing for the mentally ill.[tpl]cite web|title=Harbor View House|publisher=San Pedro.com|url=http://www.sanpedro.com/sp_point/hrbrvhs.htm[/tpl]

==Present day==

Since September 1967 Harbor View House has been operated as a residence serving the mentally ill. It is licensed a 204 bed Adult Residential Facility, Mentally Ill by the California Department of Social Services and an 83 bed Intermediate Care Nursing Facility by the California Department of Public Health Services. It is owned and operated by HealthView, Inc. a non-profit organization. It also contains HealthView Behavioral Services an outpatient mental health clinic operated under contract from the Los Angeles Department of Mental Health. In 1994 the building underwent seismic retrofit renovation after the receiving damage from the Northridge earthquake. The swimming pool was filled in and offices were created in the space above the pool during this renovation this time.  Many features still remain like the coffee shop, gymnasium and running track. Harbor View House continues to be the largest licensed unlocked facility offering a variety of services for the mentally ill in the state of California.
