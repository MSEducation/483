[[Arrows A20]]

CATEGORIES: Arrows Formula One cars, 1999 Formula One season cars

The Arrows A20 was the car with which the Arrows Formula One team competed in the 1999 Formula One season.  It was driven by Pedro de la Rosa, a Spanish débutant, and Japan's Toranosuke Takagi, who moved from the defunct Tyrrell team.
The team was short of funds with the lack of a major sponsor (Danka's sponsorship having ended at the end of 1998) and the chassis was a development of the A19, which had not been too competitive itself.  Engine builder Brian Hart supplied in-house engines, but it became clear that his small resources were insufficient to compete in modern F1, and he left the team after an ownership dispute with Tom Walkinshaw.
At the start of the year a colourful Nigerian prince, Malik ado Ibrahim, bought a 25% shareholding in the team, and his T-Minus brand appeared on the cars for most of the year. However, he too could not provide sufficient funding. The idea behind the T-Minus brand was that companies and corporations would purchase the rights to use the name and they would be permitted to use the brand to promote their products. Malik stated that he had intentions to use the brand in conjunction with Lamborghini but a deal never pulled through. An Arrows employee of the time stated 'The T-Minus brand has bought in absolutely no money over the year' and carried on stating 'It was simply a dream in the Prince's head and nothing materialised.'

The year proved to be a disaster, as the cars were slow and unreliable, and the team ended up battling with Minardi at the back of the grid. Its only competitive showing came in the opening race of the season at Melbourne, where de la Rosa finished sixth for a point on his début, with Takagi one place back in seventh. Only this point, and newcomer BAR's poor finishing record, kept Arrows from finishing last in the Constructors' standings.
While de la Rosa proved promising, Takagi struggled with communication issues as he could not speak English at the time and left at the end of the season; he was replaced for 2000 by Jos Verstappen.
