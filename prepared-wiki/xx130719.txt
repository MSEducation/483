After 54 years of absence from the Olympic program, skeleton was reinstated as an official medal sport at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, featuring individual events for men and women.
In 1928, the first Olympic skeleton event was won by American sledder Jennison Heaton, who also won a silver medal in the bobsleigh's five-man event. His younger brother, John Heaton, was runner-up, spending an additional second to complete all three runs (the fourth was cancelled). He repeated this result 20 years later, placing behind Nino Bibbia of Italy, who won his country's first Winter Olympic gold medal.[tpl]cite web|last=Kubatko|first=Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/SKE/mens-skeleton.html|title=Skeleton at the 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games: Men's Skeleton|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 2, 2009[/tpl]

On the same day, another American, Tristan Gale, won the first-ever women's event in the discipline.

The following day, Alexander Tretiakov – who had won Russia's first Olympic skeleton medal in Vancouver – beat the 2010 Olympic silver medalist Martins Dukurs of Latvia in the men's event to secure his first Olympic title.[tpl]cite web|title=Sochi 2014: Alexander Tretiakov wins men's skeleton gold|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/winter-olympics/26058191|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=15 February 2014[/tpl] 
Having won two medals in an equal number of participations, John Heaton, Gregor Stähli, Martins Dukurs and Alexander Tretiakov are the joint medal leaders in Olympic skeleton, although only Tretiakov managed to win a gold medal.[tpl]cite web|last=Kubatko|first=Justin|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/SKE/|title=Skeleton|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 2, 2009[/tpl] As of 2014, the United States are the most successful National Olympic Committee (NOC) in Olympic skeleton, having won eight medals (three golds, four silvers and one bronze). Great Britain comes next with six medals (two golds, one silver and three bronzes), and is the only NOC to have collected a medal each time that skeleton was featured at the Winter Olympics, particularly in the women's event. Thirty medals have been awarded to twenty-six sledders representing nine NOCs.
