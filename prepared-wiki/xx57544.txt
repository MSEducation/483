Nephrotic syndrome is a nonspecific kidney disorder characterised by a number of signs of disease: proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema.http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=nephrotic%20syndrome It is characterized by an increase in permeability of the capillary walls of the glomerulus leading to the presence of high levels of protein passing from the blood into the urine (proteinuria at least 3.5Â grams per day per 1.73m2 body surface area);[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html |title=ELECTRONIC LEARNING MODULE for KIDNEY and URINARY TRACT DISEASES |work= |accessdate=2008-11-26[/tpl] low levels of protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia), ascites and in some cases, edema; high cholesterol (hyperlipidaemia or hyperlipemia) and a predisposition for coagulation.
The cause is damage to the glomeruli, which can be the cause of the syndrome or caused by it, that alters their capacity to filter the substances transported in the blood. The severity of the damage caused to the kidneys can vary and can lead to complications in other organs and systems. However, patients suffering from the syndrome have a good prognosis under suitable treatment.
Kidneys affected by nephrotic syndrome have small pores in the podocytes, large enough to permit proteinuria (and subsequently hypoalbuminemia,
==Signs and symptoms==

It is characterized by proteinuria (>3.5g/day), hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidaemia, and edema (which is generalized and also known as anasarca or dropsy) that begins in the face. Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion.
Hyperlipidaemia is caused by two factors:
