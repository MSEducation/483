Anakim are a race of giants descended from Anakeastons-bible-dictionary mentioned in the Tanakh. They dwelt in the south of the land of Canaan, near Hebron (Gen. 23:2; Josh. 15:13). According to [tpl]bibleref2|Genesis|14:5-6[/tpl] they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab in the days of Abraham. Their name may come from a Hebrew root meaning "strength" or "stature"."Anakim" in Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 397.
Their formidable appearance, as described by the Twelve Spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. The Israelites seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the giants ([tpl]bibleref2|Genesis|6:4[/tpl], [tpl]bibleref2|Numbers|13:33[/tpl]) of the antediluvian age. Joshua finally expelled them from the land, excepting a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod ([tpl]bibleref2|Joshua|11:22[/tpl]). The Philistine giants whom David encountered (2 Samuel 21:15-22 ) were descendants of the Anakim.eastons-bible-dictionary
