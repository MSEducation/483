==Curriculum==

Abdul Hamid Sharaf School teaches two different curricula: 
An American curriculum is taught which prepares students to write the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and the Scholastic Aptitude Subject Tests (SAT II). This curriculum is aimed at the students who are from the United States and plan to return there for their post-secondary education. Although completion of the SAT stream and passing marks in the SAT and SAT II tests is recognized by Jordanian universities as proof of secondary education it is not looked favorably upon. 
The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) curriculum is also taught. This prepares students for the O level and A level exams which are internationally recognized as proof of secondary education. Passing marks in the O and A level exams are recognized as completion of secondary education by most Jordanian Universities. This stream is often chosen by students who plan to continue into post-secondary education outside of Jordan or in a Jordanian university which teaches in English.
