The 1949 Salad Bowl was a college football bowl game played between Drake Bulldogs and Arizona Wildcats at Montgomery Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona. The game marked the second bowl game for each school. Drake had previously played in the 1946 Raisin Bowl, while Arizona was featured in the 1921 San Diego E-W Christmas Classic. The game was sponsored by Phoenix Kiwanis Club.
The Wildcats out-gained Drake in total yards 355-206; however, the Bulldogs capitalized from three costly Arizona turnovers during the contest. Drake's Frank Metzger scored on a 1-yard run to give the Bulldogs an early 7-0 lead. The second quarter would see the Bulldogs go up 14-0 thanks to a Floyd Miller 20-yard interception return. An Ed Walgast 15-yard run would cut the lead to 14-7 at half. Late in the third quarter, Charlie Hall returned a punt 79-yards for a touchdown, but the ensuing extra point by one of the nation's top kickers Tackett hit the upright, preserving a 14-13 lead. Neither team would score in the four quarter. With time running out Arizona fumbled at the Drake 11-yard line on a potential game winning drive, allowing Drake to capture a 14-13 victory.http://www.arizonawildcats.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/ariz/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2009MiscellaneousInformationhttp://www.mmbolding.com/bowls/Salad_1949.htm
