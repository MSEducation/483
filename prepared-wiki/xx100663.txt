Irving, rev. edn, 2 vols., Bannatyne Club, 21 (1829 (cited in ODNB) a Benedictine monk who was executed for his Roman Catholicism. However, his identity is doubtful: "Abercromby has not come to light in recent scholarly work, nor is he found in the published records... The only possible conclusion is that John Abercromby is a figment, a ‘ghost’ fabricated by Thomas Dempster."Mark Dilworth, ‘Abercromby, John (supp. fl. 1561)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 26 Sept 2007.
