Glastonbury [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|t|ən|b|ə|r|i[/tpl] is a small town in Somerset, England, situated at a dry point on the low lying Somerset Levels, [tpl]convert|23|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of Bristol. The town, which is in the Mendip district, had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Parish|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=11123750&c=Glastonbury&d=16&e=61&g=6461272&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1388575584154&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2491|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl] Glastonbury is less than [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] across the River Brue from Street, which is now larger than Glastonbury.
Evidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times. Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the Bronze Age. Centwine was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey, which dominated the town for the next 700 years. One of the most important abbeys in England, it was the site of Edmund Ironside's coronation as King of England in 1016. Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, including the Tribunal, George Hotel and Pilgrims' Inn and the Somerset Rural Life Museum, which is based in an old tithe barn, are associated with the abbey. The Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century.
The town became a centre for commerce, which led to the construction of the market cross, Glastonbury Canal and the Glastonbury and Street railway station, the largest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust and nearby is the Ham Wall National Nature Reserve.
Glastonbury has been described as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. In some Arthurian literature Glastonbury is identified with the legendary island of Avalon. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.

==History==

===Prehistory===

During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/pdfs/esaspdfs/stage1/SOMHIST.pdf |title=Historical Monitoring in the Somerset Levels and Moors ESA 1987–1994 |accessdate=10 June 2007|format=PDF |work=DEFRA [/tpl] The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Sweet Track, west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000 year-old trackway in Belmarsh Prison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news169297178.html|title=London's earliest timber structure found during Belmarsh prison dig|last=Anon|date=12 August 2009|work=physorg.com News|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=10 July 2010[/tpl] Tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806 BC.[tpl]cite web | title = The day the Sweet Track was built | work=New Scientist, 16 June 1990 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617212.800.html | accessdate =26 October 2007 [/tpl] It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world.[tpl]cite web | title = Special issue on Wetlands / The Somerset Levels | work=Current Archaeology 172 | publisher=Current Archaeology|date=5 April 2007 | url = http://www.archaeology.co.uk/ca/issues/ca172/ca172.htm | accessdate =26 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070405210503/http://archaeology.co.uk/ca/issues/ca172/ca172.htm |archivedate = 5 April 2007[/tpl] The track was discovered in the course of peat digging in 1970, and is named after its discoverer, Ray Sweet.[tpl]cite book |last=Williams |first=Robin |coauthors= Williams, Romey |title=The Somerset Levels |year=1992|pages=35–36 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0-948578-38-6 [/tpl] It extended across the marsh between what was then an island at Westhay, and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to [tpl]convert|2000|m|mi[/tpl]. The track is one of a network of tracks that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Built in the 39th century BC, during the Neolithic period, the track consisted of crossed poles of ash, oak and lime (Tilia) which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that mainly consisted of oak planks laid end-to-end. Since the discovery of the Sweet Track, it has been determined that it was built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, dating from 3838 BC and so 30 years older.[tpl]cite book |last=Hill-Cottingham |first=Pat |coauthors=Briggs, D., Brunning, R., King, A. & Rix, G |title=The Somerset Wetlands |year=2006 |publisher=Somerset Books |isbn=0-86183-432-1 [/tpl]
Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue, on the Somerset Levels near Godney, some [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] north west of Glastonbury.

The village was built in about 300 BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around 100 AD) when it was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level.[tpl]cite book |last=Adkins |first=Lesley |coauthors=Roy Adkins |title=A field guide to Somerset archeology |year=1992 |publisher=Dovecote Press |location=Wimborne |isbn=0-946159-94-7 |pages=69–70 [/tpl] It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.[tpl]cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=Iron Age Communities in Britain (4th Ed) | page=266 |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-34779-3 [/tpl]
Sharpham Park is a [tpl]convert|300|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] historic park, [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] west of Glastonbury, which dates back to the Bronze Age.

===Middle Ages===

The origin of the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the settlement is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called Glestingaburg.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2307/2848235|last=Gray|first=Louis H.|title=The origin of the name of Glastonbury |journal=Speculum |date=January 1935 |volume=10|issue=1|pages=46–53 |jstor=2848235[/tpl] The burg element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure, however the Glestinga element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_GlastonburyText.pdf|title=Glastonbury|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Gray |first=Louis H. |title=Speculum, Vol. 10, No. 1: The Origin of the Name of Glastonbury |pages=46–53 |year=1935 |publisher=Medieval Academy of America |location= |isbn= [/tpl] It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.
William of Malmesbury in his De Antiquitate Glastonie Ecclesie gives the Old Celtic Ineswitrin (or Ynys Witrin) as its earliest name, and asserts that the founder of the town was the eponymous Glast, a descendant of Cunedda.
Centwine (676–685) was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey.[tpl]cite book|last=Godden|first=Malcolm|title=Anglo-Saxon England|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88343-6|page=51|url=http://books.google.com/?id=i3s1Q4XXIF8C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=Centwine+Glastonbury&q=Centwine%20Glastonbury|coauthors=Simon Keynes|accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] In 1016 Edmund Ironside was crowned king at Glastonbury.[tpl]cite web|title=Eadmund|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/uk/england/anglosaxon/edmund2.php|publisher=Archontology.org|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] After his death later that year he was buried at the abbey.[tpl]cite web|title=Edmund II Ironside |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/saxon_15.htm|publisher=English Monarchs|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] To the southwest of the town centre is Beckery, which was once a village in its own right but is now part of the suburbs.

Sharpham Park was granted by King Eadwig to the then abbot Æthelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was conferred by the soon-to-be King John I to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Edward Dyer was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building.[tpl]cite web | title=Abbots Sharpham and Sharpham Park Farmhouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=267774 | accessdate=25 November 2006[/tpl] It was the birthplace of Sir Edward Dyer (died 1607) an Elizabethan poet and courtier, the writer Henry Fielding (1707–54), and the cleric William Gould.

During the Middle Ages the town largely depended on the abbey but was also a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century. A Saxon-era canal connected the abbey to the River Brue. Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, was executed with two of his monks on 15 November 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ophiuchvs2000/RememberRichardWhiting.pdf|title=Remember Richard Whiting|last=Cousins|first=J.F.|year=2007|accessdate=18 August 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ophiuchvs2000/RememberRichardWhiting.pdf&date=2009-10-26+00:02:21|archivedate=26 October 2009[/tpl]

===Early modern===

In 1693 Glastonbury, Connecticut was founded and named after the English town from which some of the settlers had emigrated. It was originally called "Glistening Town" until the mid-19th century when it was changed in line with Glastonbury, England. A representation of the Glastonbury thorn is incorporated onto the town seal.[tpl]cite web|title=The Town|url=http://town.glasct.org/hissoc/Glastonbury/town.html|publisher=The Historical Society of Glastonbury|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]
The Somerset towns charter of incorporation was received in 1705. Growth in the trade and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors. The opening of the Glastonbury Canal produced an upturn in trade, and encouraged local building.
The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides.[tpl]cite web|title=Somerset Hundreds|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SOM/Miscellaneous/|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=12 September 2011[/tpl]

===Modern history===

By the middle of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal drainage problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.G. Body and R. Gallop, (2001), The Glastonbury Canal, Fiducia Press, ISBN 0-946217-08-4 The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers,Somerset Waterways Development Trust for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway.Handley, Chris, (2001). The Maritime Activities of the Somerset & Dorset Railway. Bath: Millstream Books. ISBN 0-948975-63-6. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.

Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|title=Street|url=http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/explore-somerset/towns-and-villages/street-p500233|publisher=Visit Somerset|accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl]

==Mythology and legends==

Glastonbury is notable for myths and legends concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. The legend that Joseph of Arimathea retrieved certain holy relics was introduced by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, thought to have been a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.[tpl]cite book|last=de Boron|first=Robert|title=Romanz De L'estoire Dou Graal|year=13th century|publisher=Project Gutenburg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4936|isbn=1-153-68487-X[/tpl]
De Boron's account relates how Joseph captured Jesus' blood in a cup (the "Holy Grail") which was subsequently brought to Britain. The Vulgate Cycle reworked Boron's original tale. Joseph of Arimathea was no longer the chief character in the Grail origin: Joseph's son, Josephus, took over his role of the Grail keeper.[tpl]cite web|title=Vulgate history of the grail|url=http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/keeper.html#Vulgate|publisher=Timeless Myths|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl]
The earliest versions of the grail romance, however, do not call the grail "holy" or mention anything about blood, Joseph or Glastonbury.
In 1191, monks at the abbey claimed to have found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere to the south of the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of contemporary historians including Giraldus Cambrensis.[tpl]cite web|title=King Arthur & Avalon|url=http://www.glastonburyabbey.com/arthur.php|publisher=Glastonbury Abbey|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.[tpl]cite book|last=Carley|first=James P.|title=Glastonbury Abbey The Holy House at the Head of the Moors Adventurous|year=1996|publisher=Gothic Image Publications|isbn=978-0-906362-23-5|url=http://www.gothicimage.co.uk/books/glastabbey8.html|chapter=8 Arthur, Avalon and the Bridge Perilous  |accessdate=25 August 2010[/tpl]
In some Arthurian literature Glastonbury is identified with the legendary island of Avalon. An early Welsh poem links Arthur to the Tor in an account of a confrontation between Arthur and Melwas, who had kidnapped Queen Guinevere.[tpl]cite web|title=Queen Guinevere|url=http://www.arthurian-legend.com/more-about/more-about-arthur-9.php|publisher=Arthurian Legend|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] According to some versions of the Arthurian legend, Lancelot retreated to Glastonbury Abbey in penance following Arthur's death.[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/glastonburytor.html|publisher=Crystal Links|accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl]
Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On disembarking he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.[tpl]cite news|last=Wheeler|first=David|title=Branch lines: the Glastonbury thorn|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/3296455/Branch-lines-the-Glastonbury-thorn.html|accessdate=5 July 2010|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 January 2002 | location=London[/tpl]

A new sapling has been planted nearby.    Many other examples of the thorn grow throughout Glastonbury including those in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey, St Johns Church and Chalice Well.
Today Glastonbury Abbey presents itself as "traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian church in the world," which according to the legend was built at Joseph's behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years after the death of Jesus.[tpl]cite web|title=Joseph of Arimathea|url=http://www.glastonburyabbey.com/arimathea.php?&rpn=myths|publisher=Glastonbury Abbey|accessdate=22 August 2010[/tpl] The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, "Jerusalem" (see And did those feet in ancient time).[tpl]cite web|title=Jerusalem|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/jerusalem/features/and-did-those-feet|publisher=Icons.org|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl]

===Glastonbury zodiac===

In 1934 artist Katherine Maltwood suggested a landscape zodiac, a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury.Maltwood, K. E. A Guide to Glastonbury’s Temple of the Stars: Their Giant Effigies Described From Air Views, Maps, and From "The High History of the Holy Grail" (London, The Women’s Printing Society, Ltd., 1934). Her next book on the subject matter, Air View Supplement To A Guide To Glastonbury’s Temple of The Stars was published in 1937. She held that the "temple" was created by Sumerians about 2700 BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 Ian Burrow, Somerset’s Planning Department staff archeologist, concluded that "while the outlines of the effigies may be plotted today, their antiquity is illusory" http://sites.google.com/site/alisonsinc/maltwood'szodiac and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983.Tom Williamson, Liz Bellamy, Ley Lines In Question, pages 162-168. (Tadworth, UK: World's Work, 1983). ISBN 0-437-19205-9 These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the "temple" in any form, from conventional archaeologists.[tpl]cite book|last=Williamson|first=Tom|title=Ley Lines in Question|year=1983|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|isbn=978-0-437-19205-9|coauthors=Liz Bellamy[/tpl] Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several ley lines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glastonburytor.org.uk/leymap.html|title=The ancient landscape around Glastonbury|last=Jenkins|first=Palden|publisher=Glasonbury Tor|accessdate=28 March 2010[/tpl]

==Geography==

The walk up the Tor to the distinctive tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, [tpl]convert|158|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level,[tpl]cite web|title=Glastonbury Tor Conservation Statement|url=http://www.glastonburytor.org.uk/conservation.html|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=4 July 2010|date=February 1999[/tpl] it is easy to appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by "droves", i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be [tpl]convert|6|m|ft|0[/tpl] below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID30.asp |title=Somerset |accessdate=10 June 2007 |work=Natural England [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile85.pdf |title=Somerset Levels and Moors Natural Area – A nature conservation profile July 1997|accessdate=10 June 2007 |format=PDF |work=English Nature [/tpl] The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000 years, following the end of the last ice age.[tpl]cite book |last=Hardy |first=Peter |title=The Geology of Somerset |year=1999 |publisher=Ex Libris Press |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=0-948578-42-4 | pages=185–186 [/tpl]
The low lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana. This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed.[tpl]cite web|last=Young|first=Andrew|title=An Introduction to Mirages|url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/mirages/mirintro.html|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl] The Italian name Fata Morgana is derived from the name of Morgan le Fay, who was alternatively known as Morgane, Morgain, Morgana and other variants. Morgan le Fay was described as a powerful sorceress and antagonist of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere in the Arthurian legend.
Glastonbury is less than [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] across the River Brue from the village of Street. At the time of King Arthur the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann.[tpl]cite web | title=Pomparles Bridge | work=ArthurianAdventure.com | url=http://www.arthurianadventure.com/pomparles_bridge.htm | accessdate=11 November 2008[/tpl] The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.[tpl]cite web|title=Pomparles Bridge, Northover, Glastonbury|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=23577|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=4 July 2010[/tpl]
Until the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was prevented by gravel banks and peat near Westhay.[tpl]cite web | title=Meare and Ferran Mere | work=Sacred Sites around Glastonbury | url=http://www.isleofavalon.co.uk/sacredsites/meare.html | accessdate=1 November 2008[/tpl] The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Some time between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust.[tpl]cite web|title=Brue Valley Living Landscape|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/brue_valley.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl] The project commenced in January 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat, ensuring that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change, while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK.[tpl]cite web|title=a living landscape|url=http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/?section=environment:livinglandscapes|publisher=Wildlife Trusts|accessdate=5 July 2010[/tpl]

The Whitelake River rises between two low limestone ridges to the north of Glastonbury, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River is on Worthy Farm, the site of the Glastonbury Festival, between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle.

==Climate==

Along with the rest of South West England, Glastonbury has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.[tpl]cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] The annual mean temperature is approximately [tpl]convert|10|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. In winter mean minimum temperatures of [tpl]convert|1|or|2|°C|°F|1[/tpl] are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around [tpl]convert|700|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Economy==

Glastonbury is a centre for religious tourism and pilgrimage. As with many towns of similar size, the centre is not as thriving as it once was but Glastonbury supports a large number of alternative shops.
The outskirts of the town contain a DIY shop a former sheepskin and slipper factory site, once owned by Morlands, which is slowly being redeveloped. The [tpl]convert|31|acre|adj=on[/tpl] site of the old Morlands factory was scheduled for demolition and redevelopment into a new light industrial park,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southwestrda.org.uk/news/release.asp?ReleaseID=882|title=Morlands demolition progressing well|date=7 August 2003|publisher=South West RDA|accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/3383521.stm|title=Old tannery demolition continues|date=9 January 2004|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl] although there have been some protests that the buildings should be reused rather than being demolished.

The Chalice Well is a holy well at the foot of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron decoration made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of [tpl]convert|25000|impgal[/tpl] per day and has never failed, even during drought. Iron oxide deposits give the water a reddish hue, as dissolved ferrous oxide becomes oxygenated at the surface and is precipitated, providing chalybeate waters. As with the hot springs in nearby Bath, the water is believed to possess healing qualities. The well is about [tpl]convert|9|ft|m[/tpl] deep, with two underground chambers at its bottom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=265891|title=The Chalice Well|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=20 August 2008[/tpl] It is often portrayed as a symbol of the female aspect of deity, with the male symbolised by Glastonbury Tor.

==Religious sites==

Glastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in pre-Christian times.Ashe, Geoffrey, From Caesar to Arthur, University of Michigan, 1960. Page 87 The abbey was founded by Britons, and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This fanciful legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron's version of the Holy Grail story and to Glastonbury's connection to King Arthur, which dates at least to the early 12th century.Ashe, Geoffrey, From Caesar to Arthur, University of Michigan, 1960. pages 83–90 Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint Dunstan, the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cathedralsplus.org.uk/index.php/front_end/member/47/about.html|title=Glastonbury Abbey|work=Cathedrals Plus|publisher=The Pilgrims Association|accessdate=19 August 2008[/tpl]
