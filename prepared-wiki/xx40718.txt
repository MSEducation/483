Give 'em Hell, Harry! is a biographical play and 1975 film, written by playwright Samuel Gallu. Both the play and film are a one-man show about former President of the United States Harry S. Truman. Give 'em Hell, Harry! stars James Whitmore and was directed by Steve Binder and Peter H. Hunt.
The title comes from an incident that took place during the 1948 Presidential election campaign. In Harrisburg, Illinois, Truman delivered a speech attacking the Republicans. During the speech a supporter yelled out "Give 'em Hell, Harry!".  Truman replied, "I don't give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it's Hell." Subsequently, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!" became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters. 
The play previewed in Hershey, Pennsylvania, followed by its official opening at Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC. Its April 17, 1975, premiere was hosted by Truman's daughter Margaret and attended by President Gerald Ford. The play then went on to a six-city tour, during which it was videotaped for film on the stage of the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington, using a live editing process called Theatrovision.[tpl]cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Review: Give 'em Hell, Harry! |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010324/1023 |date=January 1, 1975[/tpl] James Whitmore was nominated for Best Actor by both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes.
