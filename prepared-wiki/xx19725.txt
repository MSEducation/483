Bernhard von Reesen (born ca. 1490) was an art collector born to a patrician family in Danzig (Gdańsk), in Polish Royal Prussia.
Reesen received an extensive education as was the custom of that time for men of his background.  As did many other well-off business men and statesmen, at the age of thirty, Reesen commissioned Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg to paint his portrait in 1520/21. The painting can still be seen at the exhibit of Old Masters in Dresden, Germany.
The 'von Reesen' name indicates that his family hails from the city of Rees, Germany.
