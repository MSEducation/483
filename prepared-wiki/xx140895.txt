==Demographics==

This neighbourhood has been working class at least since the 19th century. Émile Zola set there the plot of his novel L'Assommoir, depicting the life of alcoholic workers. 
From the 1920s, the area witnessed a substantial influx of population from Algeria (then part of France). The Algerian population stabilized in the 1950s, while population from other European and African countries increased.[tpl]cite book|title=Centralité immigrée - Le quartier de la Goutte d'Or|authors=Jean-Claude Toubon, Khelifa Messamah|year=1990|publisher=L'Harmattan|language=French[/tpl] Today, a large part of the population is either foreign or of foreign descent. As of 2006 the INSEE estimated the proportion of foreign nationals at 34.6%.http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/donnees-detaillees/duicq/pdf/ftd/ftd_z_1100030.pdf
As of 2002 a large number of illegal immigrants were living in the area. During that year, Ervin Dyer of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that his guide (no factual evidence provided) told him that the number of illegal immigrants was (is) increasing. 
As of 2012, at least 35% of the residents of Goutte d'Or were of immigrant origin, including West African and Algerian, a figure unchanged from 2006.Henley, John.
