Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park ([tpl]lang-gd|Pàirc Nàiseanta Loch Laomainn is nan Tròisichean[/tpl]) is a national park in Scotland centred on Loch Lomond, and includes several ranges of hills, the Trossachs being the most famous. It was the first of the two national parks established by the Scottish Parliament in 2002, the second being the Cairngorms National Park.
The park is the fourth largest in the British Isles, with a total area of 1,865 km² (720 mi²) and a boundary of some [tpl]convert|350|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. It includes 21 Munros (including Ben Lomond, Ben Lui, Beinn Challuim, Ben More and two peaks called Ben Vorlich), 19 Corbetts, two forest parks (Queen Elizabeth, and Argyll) and 57 designated special nature conservation sites.
15,600 people live in the park, which is customarily split into four sections: Breadalbane, Loch Lomond, The Trossachs, and Argyll Forest Park.

==Sights==

The park consists of many mountains and lochs, and the principal attractions are scenery, walking, and wildlife.
For walkers seeking a challenge, the West Highland Way passes through the park, while the mountains of Ben Lomond, and The Cobbler in the Arrochar Alps attract most hikers. Less intrepid visitors can detour from the A82 to view the Falls of Dochart.
There is a national park visitor centre at the southern end of Loch Lomond, called Loch Lomond Shores, which includes a visitor information centre at the most popular gateway to the park, as well as an aquarium, shops and restaurants.
On Loch Katrine, visitors can travel on the historic steamship SS Sir Walter Scott, while cruises on Loch Lomond can be taken from Tarbet, Argyll and Bute and Balloch; there is also an extensive water taxi service between most lochside communities.
