Yahoo! Internet Life was a monthly magazine published by Ziff Davis, which licensed the name from Yahoo!, the well-known web portal and search engine website. It was created and launched by G. Barry Golson, the former executive editor of Playboy and TV Guide.
It dealt with the emerging Internet and computer culture of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Its closure was announced in July 2002, and its last issue was published in August.[tpl]cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2002/07/02/yahoo-life.htm  |title='Yahoo Internet Life' ceases publication |work=USAToday.com |date=July 2, 2002 |agency=AP |accessdate=2013-04-04[/tpl]
The magazine featured a regular column by film critic Roger Ebert and others and had many reviews of various kinds of webpages and tech gadgets. Editors included Stevan Keane, Ben Greenman, Larry Smith, David Thomas, Ron Bel Bruno, Bilge Ebiri, and Rob Bernstein. The design director was Gail Ghezzi.
The magazine explored potentially controversial tech-related issues such as pornography and peer-to-peer technology.  Alanis Morissette appeared (apparently topless, but with strategically crossed hands) on the cover of the August 2000 Internet Music issue.
