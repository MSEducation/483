[[Tishbite]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people, Elijah

Tishbite is a word used in the Bible to refer to Elijah ([tpl]Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:1|HE[/tpl], [tpl]Bibleverse|1|Kings|21:17-28|HE[/tpl],  [tpl]Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:3-8|HE[/tpl],  [tpl]Bibleverse|2|Kings|9:36|HE[/tpl]). The phrasing can be reworded as "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbe in
Gilead." The word is sometimes interpreted as "stranger," so that the verse might read "Elijah the stranger from among the strangers in Gilead." This designation is probably given to the prophet as
denoting that his birthplace was Tishbe, a place in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, [tpl]Bibleverse||Tobit|1:2|NAB[/tpl]). Josephus, the Jewish historian (Ant. 8:13, 2), however, supposes that Tishbe was some place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the mountains of Gilead.
