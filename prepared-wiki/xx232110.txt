Julia L. Newton is Clinical Professor of Ageing and Medicine and Dean of clinical medicine at the School of Clinical Medical Sciences of Newcastle University in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. She is Director of MD Studies in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Newcastle, and a member of the Pharmacogenomics & Complex Disease Genetics Research Group
She has worked on a wide range of gastroeintestinal problems. Her published research has been chiefly on the autonomic nervous system and its relation to disease especially primary biliary cirrhosis. Newton's current interests, however, are focused on  how fatigue develops, and she proposes "postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome" as a possible cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. She has also worked to establish a link between autonomic dysfunction and muscle fatigue linking POTS with abnormal muscle PH and proton efflux.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Jones|first=D.|coauthors =Hollingsworth K., Taylor R., Blamire A., Newton J.|title=Abnormalities in pH Handling by Peripheral Muscle and Potential Regulation by the Autonomic Nervous System in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome|journal=Journal of Internal Medicine|volume=9999|issue=999A|pages=394|publisher =Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=|year=2009|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122564291/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2009.02160.x|id=|accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl]
