"Tired of Being Alone" is a soul song written by Al Green that became popular in the early 1970s and remains popular to this day, being a score in popular shows such as Nip/Tuck. It reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and # 7 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart. Though released on the 1971 album, Al Green Gets Next to You, the song was written in late 1968 and intended to be released on the 1969 album, Green Is Blues. Problems occurred with the first recording, so it was postponed for production. It was altered and perfected the second time around.
"Tired of Being Alone" was produced and recorded by Willie Mitchell at Hi Records, and mixed by Mitchell and Terry Manning.
In 2004, Green's version was ranked #293 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596138/tired_of_being_alone|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|publisher=RollingStone.com|accessdate=2008-07-25[/tpl]
