The Austrian Federal Railways (German: Österreichische Bundesbahnen, ÖBB) is the national railway system of Austria, and the administrator of Liechtenstein's railways. The ÖBB group is owned entirely by the Republic of Austria and is divided into several separate businesses that manage the infrastructure and operate passenger and freight services.
The ÖBB are the successor to the Bundesbahn Österreich (BBÖ, Federal Railway of Austria) and which itself was the successor of the kkStB (Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways).  The railway system was incorporated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn during the 1938-1945 Anschluss.
Major changes currently being made to the Austrian railway network are the construction of the Wien Hauptbahnhof (Vienna main station), the Koralm Railway, the Semmering Base Tunnel and the Brenner Base Tunnel connection with Italy.
