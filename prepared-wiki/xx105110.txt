Atlantic Terminal, formerly called Flatbush Avenue, is the westernmost stop on the Long Island Rail Road's (LIRR) Atlantic Branch, located at Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, New York City. It is the primary terminal for the Far Rockaway, Hempstead, and, on weekdays, West Hempstead Branches. The terminal is located in the City Terminal Zone, the LIRR's Zone 1, and thus part of the CityTicket program.

==Subway and bus connections==

Atlantic Terminal is connected to the New York City Subway's Atlantic Avenue â€“ Barclays Center complex, which is served by the [tpl]NYCS Atlantic-Pacific[/tpl] trains. Buses serving outside the complex include B41, B45, B63, B65, and B67.
On January 5, 2010, a new entry pavilion opened, providing improved connections between the LIRR, subways, and buses.[tpl]cite press release |publisher=Long Island Rail Road |date=January 5, 2010 |title=New LIRR Atlantic Terminal Pavilion Opens To The Public |url=http://new.mta.info/press-release/long-island-rail-road/new-lirr-atlantic-terminal-pavilion-opens-public|accessdate=July 16, 2013[/tpl]

==Nearby attractions==

The rail terminal is adjacent to and below the Atlantic Terminal mall and near the Barclays Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower.

==Station layout==

This terminal has three high-level island platforms adjacent to six tracks. The north platform, Platform A, is ten cars long and adjacent to Tracks 1 and 2. The two eastern-most cars on Track 1 are not accessible due to a large gap between the train and the platform. The center platform, Platform B, is eight cars long and adjacent to Tracks 3 and 4. (Brook Tower is at the east end of this platform.) The south platform, Platform C, is six cars long adjacent to Tracks 5 and 6. Because the west end of Track 6 is adjacent to the inbound local platform of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, this track has only enough space for four cars to meet the platform.

==Future developments==

The massive Atlantic Yards residential, commercial and sports complex (including Barclays Center) is being built near the station and above its yard tracks.[tpl]cite news |title=Slow Economy Likely to Stall Atlantic Yards |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/nyregion/21yards.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 21, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-14[/tpl]
