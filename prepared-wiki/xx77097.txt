==Biography==

===Early life and influences===

Isabella discovered comics at the age of four, when his mother began bringing him I. W. Publications titles she bought at Woolworth. Early influences from the comic book world included Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, Robert Kanigher, and Len Wein; Isabella was also influenced by writers like William Shakespeare, Harlan Ellison, Ed McBain, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks, Lester Dent, Dave Barry, Max Allan Collins, Don Pendleton, and Studs Terkel.
As a teenager, Isabella had many letters published in comic book letter columns,[tpl]cite magazine|last = Smith|first = Stephen Scott Beau|authorlink = Beau Smith|title = The LOCsmiths|magazine = Amazing Heroes|issue = 23|pages = |publisher = Fantagraphics Books|date = May 15, 1983[/tpl] primarily in the pages of Marvel titles. He was active in comics fandom as well, a member of CAPA-alpha, and a regular contributor to comics fanzines.

===Marvel Comics===

Isabella's work in comics fandom attracted the attention of Marvel editor Roy Thomas (whose professional career began in similar fashion), and in 1972 Thomas hired Isabella as an editorial assistant at Marvel. With Marvel's establishment of Marvel UK that year, Isabella was assigned the task of overseeing the reprints used in Marvel UK's nascent comics line.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.panelology.info/Marvel/Marvel-UK-1.html|title= The Mighty World of Bronze Age British Marvel 1972â€“1974: Setting Up Marvel UK |first= Adrian|last= Wymann|date= May 13, 2009|publisher= Panelology!|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120302035524/http://www.panelology.info/Marvel/Marvel-UK-1.html|archivedate= March 2, 2012|deadurl= no |accessdate= June 5, 2011[/tpl] He also served for a time as an editor for Marvel's black-and-white magazine line. 
As a writer, Isabella scripted Ghost Rider; "It, the Living Colossus" in Astonishing Tales; Luke Cage in Hero for Hire and Power Man; Tigra in Marvel Chillers; Daredevil,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Isabella|title= Interview With Tony Isabella|first= Kuljit|last= Mithra|date= May 1997|publisher= ManWithoutFear.com|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Fi8bVwJD|archivedate= April 7, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= April 7, 2013[/tpl] and Captain America.

====Controversy====

During his mid-1970s run on Ghost Rider, Isabella wrote a two-year story arc in which Johnny Blaze occasionally encountered an unnamed character referred to as "the Friend" who helped Blaze stay protected from Satan, who had granted Blaze supernatural power and created the Ghost Rider. Isabella said in 2007,
[tpl]quote|Getting prior approval from editor Roy Thomas, as I would from later editors Len Wein and Marv Wolfman, I introduced "The Friend" into the series. He looked sort of like a hippie Jesus Christ and that's exactly who He was, though I never actually called Him that.... It allowed me to address a disparity that had long bothered me about the Marvel Universe. Though we had no end of Hell(s) and Satan surrogates in our comics, we had nothing of Heaven....  two years I'd written a story wherein, couched in mildly subtle terms, Blaze accepted Jesus as his savior and freed himself from Satan's power forever. Had I remained on Ghost Rider, which was my intent at the time, the title's religious elements would have faded into the background. Blaze would be a Christian, but he'd express this in the way he led his life. ... Unfortunately, an assistant editor took offense at my story. The issue was ready to go to the printer when he pulled it back and ripped it to pieces. He had some of the art redrawn and a lot of the copy rewritten to change the ending of a story two years in the making. "The Friend" was revealed to be, not Jesus, but a demon in disguise. To this day, I consider what he did to my story one of the three most arrogant and wrongheaded actions I've ever seen from an editor.[tpl]cite news | title = The Ghost Rider movie opens on February 16. | url = http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/tony/back20070411.shtml | publisher = Comics Buyer's Guide #1628 (May 2007) via Tony's Online Tips (April 11, 2007) | first = Tony | last = Isabella | accessdate = 16 February 2013 | archivedate = April 26, 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070426160256/http://www.worldfamouscomics.com/tony/back20070411.shtml | deadurl =  no[/tpl][/tpl]

===DC Comics===

For DC Comics, Isabella worked as a writer and story editor but is mainly known for his creation of Black Lightning,[tpl]cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=Dorling Kindersley |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 173 |quote = Writer Tony Isabella and artist Trevor von Eeden provided the creative juice for Black Lightning.[/tpl] writing both the character's short-lived 1970s and 1990s series.Manning, Matthew K.

Isabella and artist Richard Howell produced the Shadow War of Hawkman mini-series in 1985, involving the characters of Hawkman and Hawkwoman.Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 215: "May 1985 saw the return of the Winged Wonder in a four-issue miniseries entitled The Shadow War of Hawkman by writer Tony Isabella and penciller Richard Howell." An ongoing series was launched the following year.

===Justice Machine===

In 1987, Isabella began writing the Justice Machine series for Comico, co-plotting with series creator and penciller Mike Gustovich. The new series picked up from the end of the Bill Willingham/Gustovich written limited series Justice Machine featuring the Elementals, which re-booted the series' continuity from the older Noble Comics/Texas Comics-published original series. The on-going book became one of Comico's best-selling series, selling upwards of 70,000 copies of each issue at its peak. Isabella wrote the first 11 issues of the Comico series before moving on to other projects.
In 1990, Isabella returned to the characters to write the series for Innovation Comics, with Gustovich pencilling once more.
