[[Olive oil]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking oils, Mediterranean cuisine, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, Olive oil

Olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive (the fruit of Olea europaea; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives.
It is commonly used in cooking, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps. Olive oil is used throughout the world, but especially in the Mediterranean countries and, in particular, in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which has the highest consumption per person.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aboutoliveoil.org/consumption.html |title=North American Olive Oil Association: "About Olive Oil - Consumption" |accessdate=June 11, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Early cultivation===

The olive tree is native to the Mediterranean basin; wild olives were collected by Neolithic peoples as early as the 8th millennium BC.Davidson, s.v. Olives The wild olive tree originated in Asia Minor[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/web/aa-ingles/oliveWorld/olivo.html |title=International Olive Council |accessdate=October 5, 2011[/tpl] or in ancient Greece.[tpl]refn|group=n|The Greek word for olive oil or for oil in general, [tpl]lang|grc|·ºîŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ[/tpl] (elaion),[tpl]LSJ|e)/laion|·ºîŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ|ref[/tpl]. is first attested in the Mycenaean Greek forms [tpl]lang|gmy|êÄÅêÄ®êÄ∫[/tpl], e-ra-wo and [tpl]lang|gmy|êÄÅêÅâêÄ∫[/tpl], e-rai-wo, written in the Linear B syllabic script.[tpl]cite web|title=The Linear B word e-ra-wo|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16728|website=Palaeolexicon.

Archeological evidence shows that olives were turned into oil by 4500 BC by Canaanites in present-day Israel.Ehud Galili et al., "Evidence for Earliest Olive-Oil Production in Submerged Settlements off the Carmel Coast, Israel", Journal of Archaeological Science 24:1141‚Äì1150 (1997); Pagnol, p. 19, says the 6th millennium in Jericho, but cites no source. Until 1500 BC, eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivated. Evidence also suggests that olives were being grown in Crete as long ago as 2,500 BC. The earliest surviving olive oil amphorae date to 3500 BC (Early Minoan times), though the production of olive is assumed to have started before 4000 BC. Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the Late Minoan period (1500 BC) in Crete, and perhaps as early as the Early Minoan.F. R. Riley, "Olive Oil Production on Bronze Age Crete: Nutritional properties, Processing methods, and Storage life of Minoan olive oil", Oxford Journal of Archaeology 21:1:63‚Äì75 (2002) The cultivation of olive trees in Crete became particularly intense in the post-palatial period and played an important role in the island's economy, as it did across the Mediterranean.
Recent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations, but a detailed history of domestication is not yet understood.Guillaume Besnarda, Andr√© Bervill√©, "Multiple origins for Mediterranean olive (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea) based upon mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms", Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences‚ÄîSeries III‚ÄîSciences de la Vie 323:2:173‚Äì181 (February 2000); Catherine Breton, Michel Tersac and Andr√© Bervill√©, "Genetic diversity and gene flow between the wild olive (oleaster, Olea europaea L.) and the olive: several Plio-Pleistocene refuge zones in the Mediterranean basin suggested by simple sequence repeats analysis", Journal of Biogeography 33:11:1916 (November 2006)

===Production and trade===

Olive trees and oil production in the Eastern Mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient city-state Ebla (2600‚Äì2240 BC), which were located on the outskirts of the Syrian city Aleppo. Here some dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe lands of the king and the queen. These belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace. A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in Tanakh.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Dynastic Egyptians before 2000 BC imported olive oil from Crete, Syria and Canaan and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth. Remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4,000 years old in a tomb on the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea. Sinuhe, the Egyptian exile who lived in northern Canaan about 1960 BC, wrote of abundant olive trees.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/sinuhe.htm |last1=Gardiner |first1=Alan H. |year=1916 |title=Notes on the Story of Sinuhe |publisher=Librairie Honor√© Champion |location=Paris[/tpl]
Besides food, olive oil has been used for religious rituals, medicines, as a fuel in oil lamps, soap-making, and skin care application. The Minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies. The oil became a principal product of the Minoan civilization, where it is thought to have represented wealth. The Minoans put the pulp into settling tanks and, when the oil had risen to the top, drained the water from the bottom.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Olive tree growing reached Iberia and Etruscan cities well before the 8th century BC through trade with the Phoenicians and Carthage, then was spread into Southern Gaul by the Celtic tribes during the 7th century BC.
The first recorded oil extraction is known from the Hebrew Bible and took place during the Exodus from Egypt, during the 13th century BC.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] During this time, the oil was derived through hand-squeezing the berries and stored in special containers under guard of the priests. A commercial mill for non-sacramental use of oil was in use in the tribal Confederation and later in 1000 BC, the fertile crescent, an area consisting of present day Palestine, Lebanon, and Israel. Over 100 olive presses have been found in Tel Miqne (Ekron), where the Biblical Philistines also produced oil. These presses are estimated to have had output of between 1,000 and 3,000¬†tons of olive oil per season.
Many ancient presses still exist in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and some dating to the Roman period are still in use today.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Olive oil was common in ancient Greek and Roman cuisine. According to Herodotus, Apollodorus, Plutarch, Pausanias, Ovid and other sources, the city of Athens obtained its name because Athenians considered olive oil essential, preferring the offering of the goddess Athena (an olive tree) over the offering of Poseidon (a spring of salt water gushing out of a cliff). The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia. From its beginnings early in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of Hellenic city states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense.Thomas F. Scanlon, "The Dispersion of Pederasty and the Athletic Revolution in sixth-century BC Greece", in Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West, ed. B. C. Verstraete and V. Provencal, Harrington Park Press, 2005Nigel M. Kennell, "Most Necessary for the Bodies of Men: Olive Oil and its By-products in the Later Greek Gymnasium" in Mark Joyal (ed.), In Altum: Seventy-Five Years of Classical Studies in Newfoundland, 2001; popis pp. 119‚Äì33 Olive trees were planted in the entire Mediterranean basin during evolution of the Roman republic and empire. According to the historian Pliny, Italy had "excellent olive oil at reasonable prices" by the 1st century AD, "the best in the Mediterranean", he maintained.
The importance and antiquity of olive oil can be seen in the fact that the English word oil derives from c. 1175, olive oil, from Anglo-Fr. and O.N.Fr. olie, from O.Fr. oile (12c., Mod.Fr. huile), from L. oleum "oil, olive oil" (cf. It. olio), from Gk. elaion "olive tree",Random House Unabridged Dictionary, s.v. "olive" and "oil" which may have been borrowed through trade networks from the Semitic Phoenician use of el'yon meaning "superior", probably in recognized comparison to other vegetable or animal fats available at the time. Robin Lane Fox suggestsFox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer, 2008:127. that the Latin borrowing of Greek elaion for oil (Latin oleum) is itself a marker for improved Greek varieties of oil-producing olive, already present in Italy as Latin was forming, brought by Euboean traders, whose presence in Latium is signaled by remains of their characteristic pottery, from the mid-8th century.

==Varieties==

There are many different olive varieties or olives, each with a particular flavor texture and shelf-life that make them more or less suitable for different applications such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads, indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering, or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applications.

==Production and consumption==

Spain produces 43.8% of world production of olive oil.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationmaster.com/red/pie/agr_oli_oil_pro_in_ton-agriculture-olive-oil-production-tons|title=World Olive Oil Production breakdown|accessdate=October 5, 2011 [/tpl] 75% of Spain's production comes from the region of Andaluc√≠a, particularly within Ja√©n province, although other regions also produce excellent oil. Although Italy is a net importer of olive oil, it still accounts for 21.5% of the world's production. Major Italian producers are known as "Citt√† dell'Olio", "oil cities"; including Lucca, Florence and Siena, in Tuscany. However the largest production is harvested in Puglia and Calabria. Greece accounts for 12.1% of world production and Syria for 6.1%, as third and fourth largest producers in the World. Portugal accounts for 5% and its main export market is Brazil. Morocco is the world's sixth largest producer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/17869/maroc-sixieme-producteur-mondial-d-huile.html|title=Le Maroc est sixi√®me producteur mondial d'huile d'olive|date=11.06.2013 |author=Ristel Edimo[/tpl]
Australia now produces a substantial amount of olive oil. Many Australian producers only make premium oils, while a number of corporate growers operate groves of a million trees or more and produce oils for the general market. Australian olive oil is exported to Asia, Europe and the United States.
In North America, Italian and Spanish olive oils are the best-known, and top-quality extra-virgin oils from Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece are sold at high prices, often in "prestige" packaging. A large part of U.S. olive oil imports come from Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The U.S. imported [tpl]convert|47800000|USgal|m3|sigfig=3[/tpl] of olive oil in 1998, of which [tpl]convert|34600000|USgal|m3|sigfig=3[/tpl] came from Italy.

Olive orchards in Arizona, California, and Texas are producing olive oil that is appearing on U.S. grocery market shelves alongside the Mediterranean olive oils.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Regulation==

The International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives, such as olive oil. The IOC officially governs 95% of international production and holds great influence over the rest. The EU regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils.Olive Oil Times
The United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority, but on October 25, 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC, with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the U.S.New U.S. Olive Oil Standards in Effect Today Olive Oil Times Additionally, U.S. Customs regulations on "country of origin" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer.Durant, John. U.S. Customs Department, Director Commercial Rulings Division Country of origin marking of imported olive oil; 19 CFR 134.46; "imported by" language 2000-09-05.United States International Trade Commission Rulings See reference to HQ 560944 ruling of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on April 27, 1999 "blending of Spanish olive oil with Italian olive oil in Italy does not result in a substantial transformation of the Spanish product" 2006-02-28. Yet most major U.S. brands continue to put "imported from Italy" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print.[tpl]cite web |url=http://oliveoilonly.org/impurity/olive-oil-labels-false-labeling.htm |last=McGee |first=Dennis |title=Deceptive Olive Oil Labels on Major Brands (includes photos)|accessdate=2008-11-09 [/tpl] "In fact, olive oil labeled 'Italian' often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece."Raymond Francis. The Olive Oil Scandal. Beyond Health. 1998 This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin.

===Commercial grades===

All production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing. This paste is then malaxed (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called pomace, still contains a small quantity of oil.
The grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as:
In countries that adhere to the standards of the International Olive Council (IOC),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/estaticos/view/83-designations-and-definitions-of-olive-oils |title=Designations and definitions of olive oils |publisher=International Olive Council |accessdate=2012-12-01[/tpl] as well as in Australia, and under the voluntary USDA labeling standards in the United States:

===Retail grades in the United States from the USDA===

As the United States is not a member, the IOC retail grades have no legal meaning in that country, but as of October 25, 2010, the USDA established new Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil, which closely parallel the IOC standards:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3011889 |title=United States Standard for Grades of Olive Oil |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]
These grades are voluntary. Certification is available from the USDA on a fee-for-service basis.
Quantitative analysis can determine the oil's "acidity", which refers not to its chemical acidity in the sense of pH but as the percent (measured by weight) of free oleic acid. This is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades, more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity. Another measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the peroxide value, which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized (damaged by free radicals, leading to oxidative rancidity.
To classify it by taste, olive oil is judged by a panel of trained tasters in a blind taste test. This is also called its organoleptic quality.

===Label wording===

===Adulteration===

The adulteration of oil can be no more serious than passing off inferior, but safe, product as superior olive oil, but there are no guarantees. It is guessed that almost 700 people died in 1981 as a consequence of consuming rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline intended for use as an industrial lubricant, but sold as olive oil in Spain (see toxic oil syndrome).[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DC1630F932A15756C0A96F948260 |title=Trial in Spain on Toxic Cooking Oil Ends in Uproar |last=Riding |first=Alan |date=1989-05-21 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-11-16[/tpl]
There have been allegations, particularly in Italy and Spain, that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt.See Milena Gabanelli's RAI-Tv investigative report on the adulteration and mislabelling of extra virgin olive oil in Italy, originally broadcast on Italian state television channel Rai 3 on March 10, 2003: http://www.rai.it/dl/Report/puntata/ContentItem-17eecee5-475b-44cb-9839-0177ef27d2b0.html. Major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil and that only about 40% of olive oil sold as "extra virgin" in Italy actually meets the specification.Mueller, Tom. Slippery Business The New Yorker. 2007-08-13. In some cases, colza oil (Swedish turnip) with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1204304521.23/ |title=EUbusiness.com[/tpl] This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil, under which every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used, for blended oils.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/07/nfood07.xml |title=Murky Italian olive oil to be pored over | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | date=2007-05-07 | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] In February 2008, however, EU officials took issue with the new law, stating that under EU rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1204304521.23/ |title=Eubusiness.com[/tpl] Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil.
Extra Virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for "sensory defects" that include: rancid, fusty, musty, winey (vinegary) and muddy sediment. These defects can occur for different reasons. The most common are:
In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted "Operation Golden Oil", arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a large-scale scheme to relabel oils from other Mediterranean nations as Italian.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/05/witaly105.xml |title=Italian police crack down on olive oil fraud - Telegraph | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | date=2008-03-05 | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil, and selling it as extra virgin olive oil, both in Italy and abroad; 25,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Forty-arrested-in-new-39fake39.4005000.jp |title=Forty arrested in new 'fake' olive oil scam - Scotsman.com News | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman|first=Nick|last=Pisa|date=2008-04-22[/tpl]
On March 15, 2011, the Florence, Italy prosecutor's office, working in conjunction with the forestry department, indicted two managers and an officer of Carapelli, one of the brands of the Spanish company Grupo SOS (which recently changed its name to Deoleo). The charges involved falsified documents and food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Neri Pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that "the case is based on an irregularity in the documents."Investigations Into Deodorized Olive Oils Olive Oil Times. 2011-03-29.
In February 2012, an alleged international olive oil scam occurred in which palm, avocado, sunflower and other cheaper oils were passed off as Italian olive oil.[tpl]cite news|last=Mueller|first=Tom|title=Slippery Business|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/13/070813fa_fact_mueller|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=13 August 2007[/tpl] Police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature. The oils were not toxic, however, and posed no health risk, according to a statement by the Guardia Civil. Nineteen people were arrested following the year-long joint probe by the police and Spanish tax authorities, part of what they call Operation Lucerna.http://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-business/europe/operation-lucerna-olive-oil-fraud/24815 Olive Oil Times 2012.

==Global consumption==

Greece has by far the largest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide, over 26 liters per person per year; Spain and Italy, around 14¬†l; Tunisia, Portugal, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, around 8¬†l. Northern Europe and North America consume far less, around 0.7¬†l, but the consumption of olive oil outside its home territory has been rising steadily.

===Global market===

The main producing and consuming countries are:

==Extraction==

Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid, so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows:
The remaining paste (pomace) still contains a small quantity (about 5‚Äì10%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialised chemical plants, not in the oil mills. The resulting oil is not "virgin" but "pomace oil". The term "first press", sometimes found on bottle labels, is today meaningless, as there is no "second" press; it comes from ancient times of stone presses, when virgin oil was the one produced by battering the olives.
The label term "cold-extraction" on extra virgin olive oils indicates that the olive grinding and stirring was done at a temperature of maximum [tpl]Convert|25|C|F[/tpl], as treatment in higher temperatures risks decreasing the olive oils' quality (texture, taste and aroma).

==Constituents==

Olive oil is composed mainly of the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid and palmitic acid and of other fatty acids, along with traces of squalene (up to 0.7%) and sterols (about 0.2% phytosterol and tocosterols). The composition varies by cultivar, region, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process.

===Phenolic composition===

Olive oil contains phenolics such as esters of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, including oleocanthal and oleuropein,The phenolic compounds of olive oil: structure, biological activity and beneficial effects on human health E.

Elenolic acid is a component of olive oil and olive leaf extract. It can be considered as a marker for maturation of olives. Oleuropein, together with other closely related compounds such as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid.
Both hydroxytyrosol and its precursor oleuropein exist in the fruit at levels on the order of 100 times that of shelf extra virgin olive oil. Phenolics are considerably higher in fresh cloudy olive oil than extra virgin that has been separated and aged.

Oleocanthal from olive oil is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) similar to classical NSAIDs like ibuprofen. It has been suggested that long-term consumption of small quantities of this compound from olive oil may be responsible in part for the low incidence of heart disease associated with a Mediterranean diet.[tpl]cite pmid|21443487[/tpl]

===Skin===

Olive oil has a long history of being used as a home remedy for skincare.

There has been relatively little scientific work done on the effect of olive oil on acne and other skin conditions. However, one study noted that the abundance of squalene in oils in general shows promise for sufferers of seborrheic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Squalene is used as an antioxidant, moisturizer, and as a convenient vehicle to carry other substances in topical application.[tpl]cite pmid|23449131[/tpl] Another researcher reported that a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil alleviates diaper dermatitis, psoriasis, and eczema by inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.[tpl]cite pmid|15777988[/tpl]
Olive oil is popular for use in massaging infants and toddlers, but scientific proof of its efficacy is mixed. One analysis of olive oil versus mineral oil found that, when used for infant massage, olive oil can be considered a safe alternative to sunflower, grapeseed and fractionated coconut oils. This stands true particularly when it is mixed with a lighter oil like sunflower, which "would have the further effect of reducing the already low levels of free fatty acids present in olive oil". The study also notes that there appears to be much confusion surrounding mineral oil, and that further studies should be done on refined mineral oil to back up claims about its superiority to olive oil.[tpl]cite pmid|21388045[/tpl] Another trial echoes this claim, stating that olive oil lowers the risk of dermatitis for infants in all gestational stages when compared with emollient cream.[tpl]cite pmid|18429773[/tpl] However, yet another study found that topical treatment with olive oil for newborns "significantly damages the skin barrier" when compared to sunflower oil, and that it may make existing atopic dermatitis worse.

==Uses==

===Culinary use===

Olive oil is the main cooking oil in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.
Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing and as an ingredient in salad dressings. It is also used with foods to be eaten cold. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for saut√©ing.
The higher the temperature to which the olive oil is heated, the higher the risk of compromising its taste. When extra virgin olive oil is heated above [tpl]convert|210|-|216|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl], depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the oil are burned. This leads to deteriorated taste. Also, the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive oil is not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods. Refined olive oils are perfectly suited for deep frying foods and should be replaced after several uses. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
Choosing a cold-pressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a wine. The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish. Also, people who like lots of tannins in their red wines might prefer more bitter olive oils.
An important issue often not realized in countries that do not produce olive oil is that the freshness makes a big difference. A very fresh oil, as available in an oil producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere. In time, oils deteriorate and become stale. One-year old oil may be still pleasant to the taste, but it is surely less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil should be used for cooking, not for foods to be eaten cold, like salads.
The taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil from and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors - riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil).
For certain culinary uses, olive oil may be substituted with safflower or sunflower oils, canola oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil.6 Substitutes for Olive Oil OilyOily.com. Retrieved 2013-06-10.
Olive oil has various non-culinary uses as well. For example, it is also a natural and safe lubricant, and can be used to lubricate machinery that is used within the kitchen (grinders, blenders, cookware, etc.) It can also be used for illumination (oil lamps) or as the base for soaps and detergents.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.floridaconcerts.org/soap-making-the-old-way-with-wood-ash.htm |title=Soap Making from Scratch Workshop |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl] Some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esenciadeolivo.es/en/the-culture-of-the-olive-tree/products/ |title=The olive essence |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=23 November 2013[/tpl]

===Religious use===

Olive oil also has religious symbolism for healing and strength and to consecration‚Äî setting a person or place apart for special work. This may be related to its ancient use as a medicinal agent and for cleansing athletes by slathering them in oil then scraping them.

====Judaism====

In Jewish observance, olive oil is the only fuel allowed to be used in the seven-branched Menorah in the Mishkan service during the Exodus of the tribes of Israel from Egypt, and later in the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. A menorah similar to the Menorah used in the Mishkan is now used during the holiday of Hanukkah that celebrates the miracle of the last of such containers being found during the re-dedication of the Temple (163 BC), when its contents lasted for far longer than they were expected to, allowing more time for more oil to be made. Although candles can be used to light the hanukkiah, oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original Menorah. Another use of oil in Jewish religion is for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel, originating from King David. Tzidkiyahu was the last anointed King of Israel.

====Christianity====

The Catholic and Orthodox Churches use olive oil for the Oil of Catechumens (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for Baptism) and Oil of the Sick (used to confer the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick or Unction). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as balsam is consecrated by bishops as Sacred Chrism, which is used to confer the sacrament of Confirmation (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of Baptism and the ordination of priests and bishops, in the consecration of altars and churches, and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their coronation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and a number of other religions use olive oil when they need to consecrate an oil for anointings.
Eastern Orthodox Christians still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.
In the Orthodox Church, olive oil is a product not consumed during lent or penance while Orthodox monks use it sparingly in their diet. Exceptions are in feast days and Sundays.

====Islam====

In Islam, olive oil is mentioned in the Quranic verse: 
"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allah is All-Knower of everything."
(  ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜŸàÿ±  , An-Noor, Chapter #24, Verse #35)
