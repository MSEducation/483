==Baseball career==

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===

Cantú was spotted by a scout while playing in a Junior Olympic tournament in Mexico City while in high school, and offered a contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at age 16. In 2003, Cantú played for the Mexican national team in the regional Olympic qualifying tournament. His team defeated the U.S. team, eliminating them from the 2004 summer games in Athens.
Cantú made his major league debut with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the [tpl]By|2004[/tpl] season, batting .301 with two home runs and 17 runs batted in in 50 games played.
In [tpl]By|2005[/tpl], Cantú began the season expecting to play a utilityman role, but due to the retirement of second baseman Roberto Alomar during spring training, he became the full-time second baseman. He showcased his talents, having a breakout year, and was  named the Devil Rays Most Valuable Player by Tampa Bay sportswriters, after hitting .289 with 28 home runs, 117 RBIs, 40 doubles, and 171 hits in 150 games (80 at second base, 63 at third).  Cantú was a valuable young player for the rebuilding Devil Rays, who finished last in the American League that season.
In [tpl]By|2006[/tpl] however, he had a down year as he struggled with injuries.  His production from the previous year dropped precipitously, as he hit just .249 with 14 home runs and 62 RBIs.
The following season, he failed to make the Opening Day 25-man roster for [tpl]By|2007[/tpl], and was assigned instead to the Triple-A Durham Bulls.  He threatened not to report, and demanded a trade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/04/01/Rays/Angry_Cantu_sent_down.shtml |title=Rays: Angry Cantu sent down, wants out |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2010[/tpl] However, on the April 4, 2007, edition of ESPN's Baseball Tonight, Cantú retracted his trade demand and said he would voluntarily report to Durham.  He hit just .207 with zero home runs and 4 RBIs in 25 games with Tampa Bay that year.

===Cincinnati Reds===

On July 28, [tpl]By|2007[/tpl] Cantú was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along with minor league outfielder Shaun Cumberland for pitchers Brian Shackelford and Calvin Medlock.

During the 2007 season, he played primarily first base (as opposed to second base) as he played 21 games at first base, 2 game at second base and 1 game at third base (combined with Tampa Bay and Cincinnati).
