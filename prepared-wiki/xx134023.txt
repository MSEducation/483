Fish Creek is a small township in Victoria, Australia.  At the 2006 census, Fish Creek and the surrounding area had a population of 675.

==History==

Fish Creek was first settled in 1886. The Post Office opened on 6 October 1890 next to the proposed railway which arrived in 1892. In 1900 a community hall was built where the Butter Factory building stands today. This hall was used as a church by everyone until in 1904 a new Catholic church was built.  Not long after that the Union Church was opened and since then the town has had two churches.
The Great South Gippsland Railway line closed to passengers in 1980 for all stations past Leongatha. However freight and goods traffic continued until the line was formally closed in 1994. The track and all other railway infrastructure, such as signals and stations, were removed and a combined bike, pedestrian and horse riding track (The Great Southern Rail Trail) was established along the former rail line.
