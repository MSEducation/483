Georgia-Pacific Tower is a [tpl]convert|212.45|m|abbr=on[/tpl] skyscraper in downtown Atlanta. It contains 52 stories of office space and was finished in 1982. Before the six-year era of tall skyscrapers to be built in Atlanta, it was Atlanta's second tallest building from 1982 to 1987.  During that time period the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel was the tallest building in Atlanta. It has a stair-like design that staggers down to the ground, and is clad in pink granite quarried from Tate, Georgia.
The tower is on the former site of the Loew's Grand Theatre, where the premiere for the 1939 film Gone with the Wind was held. (133 Peachtree St. NE, near intersection of Peachtree and Forsyth streets) The theatre could not be demolished because of its landmark status; when it burned down in 1978, clearing the way for the tower.
The architectural firm that built it was Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.  The tower is the world headquarters of Georgia-Pacific. Other tenants include consulting firm McKinsey & Company and the downtown branch of the High Museum of Art, which opened in 1986.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
On March 14, 2008, the tower sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta.  A number of windows were blown out. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s.[tpl]cite web | author=Tim Eberly; Paul Shea | title=Tornado Kills, 2 Pummels Downtown | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/03/14/domeburst_0315.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab | publisher=Atlanta Journal and Constitution | date=March 15, 2008 | accessdate=7 February 2011[/tpl]
