Lantana montevidensis is a species of lantana known by many common names, such as: trailing lantana, weeping lantana, creeping lantana, small lantana, purple lantana or trailing shrubverbena. 
This lantana  is native to South America.

==Description==

Lantana montevidensis is a small strongly scented flowering low shrub with oval-shaped green leaves. With support it has a climbing 'vine' form, when on edge a trailing form, and on the flat a groundcover form..
The inflorescence is a circular head of several purple to lavender to white funnel-shaped flowers with lobed corollas each nearly a centimeter wide. Reports of yellow flowered Lantana montevidensis are based on the misidentification of Lantana depressa var. depressa, a Florida endemic taxon more closely related to Lantana camara.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sanders, R.W. |title=Taxonomy of Lantana sect Lantana (Verbenaceae |journal=Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=403â€“442 |year=2012 [/tpl]
The fruit consists of a pair of nutlets surrounded by flesh somewhat like a berry.

==Cultivation==

Lantana montevidensis  is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its plentiful colorful lavender to purple flowers and as a drought tolerant groundcover, woody vine,  and trailing plant for containers and in the ground.  
In temperate climates there are flowers most the year, with yellow blooming and variegated leaved cultivars also available.

==Invasive species==

The plant is present nearly worldwide as an introduced species of garden and landscape plant, and in some areas, such as parts of Australia and Hawaii, now a noxious weed and invasive species. This plant is toxic to livestock.
