==Geography==

Gwebin is located in northern-central Burma. It lies off National Road 311, which after a short way southeast of the village to Wabyudaung, merges with the National Highway 31 which connects it to the township seat of Mogok in the east. Several miles to the west of the village is the Irrawaddy River, flowing southwards. This is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. The 311 road connects the village to Thabeikkyin on the eastern bank of the river and to Kyaukkyi to the north of Gwebin.
