===SNL Digital Shorts===

Through a connection in California, Rick submitted some music tracks to Andy Samberg's comedy troupe The Lonely Island in 2008.  Rick also produced and composed for the track "Like a Boss" which appeared on their first album, Incredibad. The song was developed into an Saturday Night Live Digital Short of the same name which appeared on SNL on April 4, 2009.
The video featured Rihanna with Samberg who, as shy elementary school student "Shy Ronnie" performs a rap verse accompanying Rihanna's choral hook. "Shy Ronnie" aired originally on December 5, 2009. In a classroom, Rihanna sings the hook on top of a hip-hop/R&B beat. As her verse completes, Shy Ronnie takes to the microphone reluctantly and almost silently, causing a very awkward situation between Rihanna and the students. Ronnie fails in multiple ways, from inaudibility to microphone feedback and peeing himself. Rihanna proclaims (still in song) that she should have paid Kanye West instead to accompany her on the song, and leaves. Immediately upon Rihanna's departure, Ronnie sheds his shy demeanor, and busts out two lines of rap clearly. Rihanna reenters because she forgot her purseâ€”Ronnie reverts to his shy self. When Rihanna leaves again finally, the beat stops, and Ronnie continues in a cappella, though ending with a weak finish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/113207/saturday-night-live-digital-short-shy-ronnie#s-p1-sr-i2|title=Excerpt: SNL Digital Short: Shy Ronnie |publisher= hulu.com|accessdate=September 24, 2011|year=2009[/tpl]
