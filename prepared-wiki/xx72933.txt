Enguera ([tpl]lang-va|Énguera[/tpl]) is a municipality in southwestern province of Valencia, Spain. 
The local economy depends primarily on agriculture, and secondarily on industry and services. In recent years, agricultural crops, especially olives, have gained in importance, although the complementary or secondary component of agriculture is evident. Rural tourism, including camping, country homes, a hotel, and restaurants are gaining importance. Meanwhile, the once-flourishing industry that was an important part of the village economy at the end of the eighteenth century has faded almost to nothing. While many of Enguera's inhabitants work in industry, their jobs are in nearby towns.
The Sierra de Enguera is named after this town.
