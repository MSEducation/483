Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid $30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about "bitches." It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, using Pro Tools because his raps were out of synch with Clark's beat. The duo eventually had to re-record their lines and re-title the song "Bitches". Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted Ice-T. However, he charged them only $10,000. The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on the compilation, Psychopathics from Outer Space (2000). The song "Echo Side" was originally released at an Insane Clown Posse concert in Garden City, Michigan as the first ever single from Dark Lotus.Bruce (2003), p. 560–561.
To help increase their positive publicity, Island Records hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team. The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of Alternative Press magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dalai Lama" needed to be changed. Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again – referring to Disney's previous requirement of censure. Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric. In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.

==Musical style==

While the album's predecessor, The Great Milenko, was written and recorded in a more rock-oriented style, featuring contributions by guitarists Slash and Steve Jones, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers featured a more hip hop-oriented sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote, "Where The Great Milenko ... was targeted at white-boy, adolescent metalheads ...  The Amazing Jeckel Brothers contains cameos from Snoop Dogg and Ol' Dirty Bastard, plus a cover of a Geto Boys song, which brings Clown Posse to street level."
To produce the album, Insane Clown Posse once again teamed up with renowned Detroit record producer and DJ Mike E. Clark, who utilized standard hip hop techniques such as record scratching and samples ranging from 1970s funk to calliope music.[tpl]Cite web  | last = Maher   | first = Brendan  | title = Insane Clown Posse, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers  | publisher = PopMatters  | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/19728/insaneclownposse-amazing  |accessdate=10 May 2010[/tpl] "Another Love Song" was based upon Beck's song "Jack-Ass", which itself derived from a sample of Bob Dylan's "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue". Bruce loved the song and wanted to rewrite it in his own style. Although the group "lifted the riff from Beck", since Beck's song sampled the Dylan composition, Insane Clown Posse's sample was cleared with Dylan rather than Beck. Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote that Clark's production incorporates elements of "carnival organ riffs, power chords and shotgun blasts ... banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals."[tpl]cite web |first=Barry |last=Walters |title=Insane Clown Posse: The Amazing Jeckel Brothers: Music Reviews | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-amazing-jeckel-brothers-19990610 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2012-03-23 |date=1999-06-10 |publisher=Rolling Stone[/tpl]

==Lyrical themes==

During the two years between The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, Insane Clown Posse had become nationally known, but were not taken very seriously. While the controversy over The Great Milenko allowed the duo to attract the attention of Island Records, it also attracted Insane Clown Posse to public criticism for their style and lyrics.Bruce (2003), p. 306–314. Bruce recalls the period as an angry era for the group due to all of the negativity directed toward them. He says that they "used to keep two piles of press at their office. One pile was all the positive press they've gotten, which was under an inch tall. Then they had the negative press pile, which was spilling over the side of a full basket." As a result, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was recorded as a release for their anger.
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers focuses on the 9 circles of hell, and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r415252/review|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=allmusic ((( The Great Milenko > Overview ))) |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Jack "the sinister" and Jake "the just" (bad and good) emerge from the flame of a candle to determine the fate of the dead.[tpl]cite web | title=The Amazing Jeckel Brothers LP | url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/music | publisher=Psychopathic Records | accessdate=2009-05-22 [/tpl] The Jeckel Brothers juggle fire balls.

If a soul witnesses Jake drop one of the balls, he will be damned to hell. Souls who see Jake successfully complete the act ascend to heaven.

The album was panned by critics. NME wrote that "the slick, dumbed-down Dungeons & Dragons rap-rock schtick ... is often unbearable". College Music Journal writer Matt Ashare described the album as "Cirque de so-lame". Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters gave the album two out of five stars, writing that "no musical sleight of hand can disguise the fact that Shaggy and J remain the ultimate wack MCs." In The Great Rock Discography, Martin Charles Strong gave the album four out of ten stars.
PopMatters reviewer Brendan Maher accused Insane Clown Posse of misogyny and described The Amazing Jeckel Brothers as "music to strangle your ex-girlfriend to". Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, writing "Though they claim clown, they rarely get funnier than 'I'd cut my head off but then I would be dead'." However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a four out of five star rating, writing that "Clown Posse actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of hardcore hip hop and shock-metal had in the first place".
