The Boryeong Mud Festival is an annual festival which takes place during the summer in Boryeong, a town around 200Â km south of Seoul, South Korea. The first Mud Festival was staged in 1998 and, by 2007, the festival attracted 2.2 million visitors to Boryeong.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1205425,00.html|title=Good Clean Fun|publisher=Time magazine|author=Jiwatram, Jaya|date=2006-06-19[/tpl]
The mud is taken from the Boryeong mud flats, and trucked to the Daecheon beach area, where it is used as the centrepiece of the 'Mud Experience Land'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22095253_ITM |title=Down and dirty at Boryeong Mud Festival |publisher=Korea Herald|author=Card, James|date=2004-07-23[/tpl] The mud is considered rich in minerals and used to manufacture cosmetics. The festival was originally conceived as a marketing vehicle for Boryeong mud cosmetics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-28/rest-of-world/27876791_1_astronaut-training-tourism-malaysia-space-shuttle|title=Now, get a feel of space in Malaysia |publisher=Times of India|author=Kumar, Meenakshi |date=2007-04-28[/tpl]
Although the festival takes place over a period of around two weeks, it is most famous for its final weekend, which is popular with Korea's western population. The final weekend of the festival usually falls on the second weekend in July.

==History of the Festival==

In 1996 a range of cosmetics was produced using mud from the Boryeong mud flats. The cosmetics were said to be full of minerals, bentonites, and germaniums, all of which occur naturally in the mud from the area.
In order to promote these cosmetics, the Boryeong Mud Festival was conceived. Through this festival,  it was hoped people would learn more about the mud and the cosmetics. The festival has become popular with both Koreans and western tourists, as well as American Military personnel stationed in the country, and foreign English teachers working in Korea.
The festival attracted some controversy in 2009 when a group of school children attending the festival developed skin rashes after contact with the mud.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/11/117_48322.html |title=Boryeong Shrugs Off Mud Contamination |publisher=Korea Times|author=Kang, Shin-Who|date=2009-07-12[/tpl]

For the period of the festival several large attractions are erected in the seafront area of Daecheon. These include a mud pool, mud slides, mud prison and mud skiing competitions.

A small market runs along the seafront selling cosmetics made using the mud from Boryeong. Various health and beauty clinics offer massages, acupuncture and other treatments utilising the medicinal qualities of the mud.
The festival is closed with a large firework display.
