The aircraft is made from aluminium and features a [tpl]convert|130|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide cabin at the shoulder, with a bubble canopy over the cockpit. The wings feature flaps. The standard engine is a [tpl]convert|60|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 912UL, with the [tpl]convert|75|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 912ULS, the [tpl]convert|71|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ULPower UL260i/iS and the [tpl]convert|88|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] ULPower UL350iS powerplants optional. The [tpl]convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 914, [tpl]convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Jabiru 2200 and [tpl]convert|120|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Jabiru 3300 are also available. Other engines are planned, particularly for the United States market. The aircraft has a notably high useful load of [tpl]convert|279|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
