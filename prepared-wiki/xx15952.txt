==Biography==

===Early life===

Carmack, son of local television news reporter Stan Carmack, grew up in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area where he became interested in computers at an early age. He attended Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village, Kansas and Raytown South High School in nearby Raytown, Missouri.
As reported in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, "when Carmack was 14, he broke into a school to help a group of kids steal Apple II computers, but during the attempted break-in one of the kids set off the silent alarm. John was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings'). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home."[tpl]cite web|url=http://games.slashdot.org/story/99/10/15/1012230/John-Carmack-Answers |title=John Carmack Answers - Slashdot |publisher=Games.slashdot.org |date=1999-10-15 |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl] When he was asked "if you had not been caught, would you consider doing it again?" he answered "yes, probably." However, when the therapist presented this evaluation he neglected to include "if you had not been caught" in his statement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/305yuvkp.asp?pg=2 |title='Civilization' and Its Contents |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]
He attended the University of Missouri–Kansas City for two semesters before withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer.

===Career===

Softdisk, a computer company in Shreveport, Louisiana, hired Carmack to work on Softdisk G-S (an Apple IIGS publication), introducing him to John Romero and other future key members of id Software such as Adrian Carmack (not related). Later, this team would be placed by Softdisk in charge of a new, but short-lived, bi-monthly game subscription product called  Gamer's Edge for the IBM PC (DOS) platform. In 1990, while still at Softdisk, Carmack, Romero, and others created the first of the Commander Keen games, a series which was published by Apogee Software, under the shareware distribution model, from 1991 onwards. Afterwards, Carmack left Softdisk to co-found id Software.
Carmack has pioneered or popularized the use of many techniques in computer graphics, including "adaptive tile refresh" for Commander Keen, raycasting for Hovertank 3-D, Catacomb 3-D, and Wolfenstein 3-D, binary space partitioning which Doom became the first game to use, surface caching which he invented for Quake, Carmack's Reverse (formally known as z-fail stencil shadows) which he devised for Doom 3, and MegaTexture technology, first used in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.
Carmack's engines have also been licensed for use in other influential first-person shooters such as Half-Life, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor. In 2007, when Carmack was on vacation with his wife, he ended up playing some games on his cellphone, and decided he was going to make a "good" mobile game.[tpl]Cite web| first=Anna | last=Kang| date= October 18, 2007| title=Q&A: Fountainhead's Kang Talks Orcs & Elves DS, Wii Possibilities | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15909| postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]Cite news| first= Mike|last= Snider| title =Q&A with id Software's Kevin Cloud and Steve Nix| newspaper =USA Today| date =18 July 2007| url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/bonus/2007-07-16-q&a-id_N.htm?csp=34| postscript= [/tpl]
On August 7, 2013, Carmack joined Oculus VR as their CTO.

==Technologies==

==Armadillo Aerospace==

Around 2000, Carmack became interested in rocketry, a hobby of his youth. Reviewing how much money he was spending on customizing Ferraris,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Carmack realized he could do significant work in rocketry and aerospace. He began by giving financial support to a few local amateur groups before starting Armadillo Aerospace. Carmack taught himself aerospace engineering and is the lead engineer of the company. Since then, he has made steady progress toward his goals of suborbital space flight and eventual orbital vehicles. In October 2008, Armadillo Aerospace competed in a NASA contest known as the Lunar Lander Challenge, winning first place in the Level 1 competition along with $350,000. In September 2009, they completed Level 2 and were awarded $500,000.[tpl]cite news |first=Patrick |last=Michaels |work=Dallas Observer |title=Rocket Men From Mesquite's Armadillo Aerospace Are in Line For $1 Million X Prize |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2009/09/a_three-minute_hover_over_cadd.php |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |date=September 14, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://spacefellowship.com/2009/09/13/armadillo-aerospace-claim-level-2-ngllc-prize/comment-page-1/ |title=International Space Fellowship |publisher=Spacefellowship.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/09/11/2064885.aspx/ |title=Lunar lander qualifies for prize - Cosmic Log |publisher=Cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]

==Free software==

Carmack is a well-known advocate of open source software, and has repeatedly voiced his opposition to software patents, which he equates to "mugging someone".[tpl]cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=151312&cid=12701745 |title=Are Video Game Patents Next? |publisher=Slashdot |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]  He has also contributed to open source projects, such as starting the initial port of the X Window System to Mac OS X Server and working to improve the OpenGL drivers for Linux through the Utah GLX project.
Carmack released the source code for Wolfenstein 3D in 1995 and the Doom source code in 1997. When the source code to Quake was leaked and circulated among the Quake community underground in 1996, a programmer unaffiliated with id Software used it to port Quake to Linux, and subsequently sent the patches to Carmack. Instead of pursuing legal action, id Software, at Carmack's behest, used the patches as the foundation for a company-sanctioned Linux port.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Id Software has since publicly released the source code to Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3 and most recently Doom 3 (including, later, the BFG Edition), all under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The Doom source code was also re-released under the GPL in 1999. The id Tech 4 engine, more commonly known as the "Doom 3 engine", has also been released as open source under the GPL.[tpl]cite web|url=https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl |title=TTimo/doom3.gpl · GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]
Carmack is also noted for his generous contributions to charities and gaming communities. Some of the recipients of Carmack's charitable contributions include his former high school, promoters of open source software, opponents of software patents, and game enthusiasts. In 1997, he gave away one of his Ferraris (a 328 model) as a prize to Dennis Fong, the winner of the Quake tournament "Red Annihilation".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dennis-fong |title=Dennis Fong | CrunchBase Profile |publisher=Crunchbase.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl]

==Personal life and philosophy==

Carmack met his wife Katherine Anna Kang at QuakeCon 1997 when she visited id's offices. As a bet, Kang challenged Carmack to sponsor the first All Female Quake Tournament if she was able to produce a significant number of participants. Carmack and Kang married in January 2000 and had a son in 2004. Carmack has a blog last updated in 2006 (previously a .plan), an active Twitter account, and also occasionally posts comments to Slashdot.
As a game developer, Carmack stands apart from many of his contemporaries by avoiding commitment to a final release date for any game he is developing. Instead, when asked for a release date on a new title, Carmack will usually reply that the game will be released "when it's done."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/896/896763p6.html |title=GameSpy: John Carmack: QuakeCon 2008 Keynote Highlights - Page 6 |publisher=Pc.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl] Employees at Apogee, in their past years the publishers of games by id Software, adopted this business practice as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://forums.3drealms.com/vb/showthread.php?p=654680#post654680 |title=DNF Dallas Business Journal Article, 2008, and stuff - Page 4 - 3D Realms Forums |publisher=Forums.3drealms.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27[/tpl] Other game developers, such as Blizzard Entertainment and Valve, have made similar statements.[tpl]cite news |author = GamePro Staff |url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/ |title = GamePro Q&A: Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan on The Burning Crusade |publisher = GamePro |date = 2006-08-29 |accessdate = 2006-09-30|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090114012421/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/|archivedate=2009-01-14[/tpl]
