[[Robert Morton Organ Company]]

CATEGORIES: Companies based in Los Angeles, California, San Fernando Valley

The Robert Morton Organ Company was a producer of theater pipe organs and church organs, located in Van Nuys, California.  Robert Morton was the number two volume producer of theatre organs, building approximately half as many organs as the industry leader Wurlitzer.  The name Robert Morton was derived not from any person in the company, but rather from the name of company president Harold J. Werner's son, Robert Morton Werner.
The Robert Morton company had its origins in the Murray Harris Organ Company of Los Angeles.  The company passed through various owners, business names and locations between Murray Harris and Robert Morton, including the Los Angeles Art Organ Company, the Johnston Organ Company, and the California Organ Company.  Despite all the corporate change and upheaval, the output in terms of high quality and tonal character was remarkably consistent.  Several Robert Morton key personnel were veteran organbuilders who had served as apprentices with major English organbuilding firms.  Tonally, Robert Morton organs had a reputation for being powerful, while at the same time refined and "symphonic" in character.
The company's heyday was in the late 1920s, the era of the lavish movie palace theaters exhibiting silent films. The rise of the Great Depression and the advent of sound films eliminated the demand for theater organs and the company closed in 1931. In addition to their uses in theaters and music halls, Robert Morton organs have been featured in the music for the Haunted Mansion attractions at various Disney theme parks.
