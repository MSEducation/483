[[Meta element]]

CATEGORIES: HTML tags, HTML, Search engine optimization

Meta elements are tags used in HTML or XHTML documents to provide structured metadata about a Web page. 
They are part of a web page's head section. Multiple Meta elements with different attributes can be used on the same page. Meta elements can be used to specify page description, keywords and any other metadata not provided through the other head elements and attributes.
The meta element has two uses: either to emulate the use of an HTTP response header, or to embed additional metadata within the HTML document.
With HTML up to and including HTML 4.01 and XHTML, there were four valid attributes: content, http-equiv, name and scheme. Under HTML 5 there are now five valid attributes, charset having been added. http-equiv is used to emulate an HTTP header, and name to embed metadata. The value of the statement, in either case, is contained in the content attribute, which is the only required attribute unless charset is given. charset is used to indicate the character set of the document, and is available in HTML5.
Such elements must be placed as tags in the head section of an HTML or XHTML document.

==An example of the use of the meta element==

In one form, meta elements can specify HTTP headers which should be sent before the actual content when the HTML page is served from Web server to client. For example:
In this example, the meta element identifies itself as containing the 'keywords' relevant to the document, Wikipedia and encyclopedia.  Meta keywords are no longer used by any major search engine, in fact keyword stuffing can negatively affect a webpage's rankings.
Meta tags can be used to indicate the location a business serves:
In this example, geographical information is given according to ZIP codes.
Default charset for plain text is simply set with meta:

==Meta element used in search engine optimization==

Meta elements provide information about the web page, which can be used by search engines to help categorize the page correctly.
They have been the focus of a field of marketing research known as search engine optimization (SEO), where different methods are used to provide a user's website with a higher ranking on search engines. Prior to the rise of content-analysis by search engines in the mid-1990s (most notably Google), search engines were reliant on meta data to correctly classify a Web page and webmasters quickly learned the commercial significance of having the right meta element.  The search engine community is now divided as to the value of meta tags.  Some claim they have no value, others that they are central, while many simply conclude there is no clear answer but, since they do no harm, they use them just in case.  Googlehttps://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en state they do support for the meta tags "content", "robots", "google", "google-site-verification", "content-type", "refresh" and "google-bot."
Major search engine robots look at many factors when determining how to rank a page of which meta tags will only form a portion.  Furthermore, most search engines change their ranking rules frequently.  Google have stated they update their ranking rules every 48 hours.  Under such circumstances, a definitive understanding of the role of meta tags in SEO is unlikely.

===The keywords attribute===

The keywords attribute was popularized by search engines such as Infoseek and AltaVista in 1995, and its popularity quickly grew until it became one of the most commonly used meta elements.Statistic (June 4, 1997), META attributes by count, Vancouver Webpages, retrieved June 3, 2007
No consensus exists whether or not the keywords attribute has any effect on ranking at any of the major search engines today. It is speculated that it does, if the keywords used in the meta can also be found in the page copy itself.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] With respect to Google, thirty-seven leaders in search engine optimization concluded in April 2007 that the relevance of having keywords in the meta-attribute keywords is little to none"In 2007, 37 leaders in search engine optimisation concluded that having keywords in the keywords attribute is little to none." Sanger.nu blog, September 9 2008, retrieved August 2 2011 and in September 2009 Matt Cutts of Google announced that they were no longer taking keywords into account whatsoever."Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking" Google Webmaster Central Blog, September 21, 2009, retrieved September 21, 2009  However, both these articles suggest that Yahoo! still makes use of the keywords meta tag in some of its rankings.  Yahoo! itself claims support for the keywords meta tag in conjunction with other factors for improving search rankings.Yahoo! FAQs, How do I improve the ranking of my web site in the search results?, Yahoo.com, retrieved November 12, 2008 In Oct 2009 Search Engine Round Table announced that "Yahoo Drops The Meta Keywords Tag Also""Yahoo Drops The Meta Keywords Tag Also" SEO Roundtable, October 8, 2009, retrieved April 22, 2011 but informed us that the announcement made by Yahoo!'s Senior Director of Search was incorrect."Yahoo's Senior Director of Search Got It Wrong, Yahoo Uses Meta Keywords Still" SEO Roundtable, October 16, 2009, retrieved April 22, 2011 In the corrected statement Yahoo! Senior Director of Search states that "...What changed with Yahoo's ranking algorithms is that while we still index the meta keyword tag, the ranking importance given to meta keyword tags receives the lowest ranking signal in our system.... it will actually have less effect than introducing those same words in the body of the document, or any other section." In Sept 2012, Googlehttp://googlenewsblog.blogspot.in/2012/09/a-newly-hatched-way-to-tag-your-news.html announced that they will consider Keyword Meta tag for news publishers. Google said that this may help worthy content to get noticed, the syntax of the news meta keywordhttp://baawraman.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/keyword-meta-tag-is-back/ has subtle difference from custom keyword meta tag, it is denoted by "news_keywords", while custom keyword meta tag is denoted by "keywords".

===The description attribute===

Unlike the keywords attribute, the description attribute is supported by most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect click-through rates. Industry commentators have suggested that major search engines also consider keywords located in the description attribute when ranking pages.Danny Sullivan, How To Use HTML Meta Tags, Search Engine Watch, December 5, 2002 W3C doesn't specify the size of this description meta tag, but almost all search engines recommend it to be shorter than 155 characters of plain text.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]

===The language attribute===

The language attribute tells search engines what natural language the website is written in (e.g. English, Spanish or French), as opposed to the coding language (e.g. HTML). It is normally an IETF language tag for the language name. It is of most use when a website is written in multiple languages and can be included on each page to tell search engines in which language a particular page is written.1 Website Designer Using language metatags in websites February 19, 2008

===The robots attribute===

The robots attribute, supported by several major search engines,Vanessa Fox, Using the robots meta tag, Official Google Webmaster Central Blog, 3/05/2007[tpl]Failed verification|date=January 2010[/tpl] controls whether search engine spiders are allowed to index a page, or not, and whether they should follow links from a page, or not. The attribute can contain one or more comma-separate values. The noindex value prevents a page from being indexed, and nofollow prevents links from being crawled. Other values recognized by one or more search engines can influence how the engine indexes pages, and how those pages appear on the search results.  These include noarchive, which instructs a search engine not to store an archived copy of the page, and nosnippet, which asks that the search engine not include a snippet from the page along with the page's listing in search results.Danny Sullivan (March 5, 2007),Meta Robots Tag 101: Blocking Spiders, Cached Pages & More, SearchEngineLand.com, retrieved June 3, 2007

====Additional attributes for search engines====

=====NOODP=====

The search engines Google, Yahoo! and MSN use in some cases the title and abstract of the DMOZ listing of a website for the title and/or description (also called snippet or abstract) in the search engine results pages (SERP). To give webmasters the option to specify that the ODP content should not be used for listings of their website, Microsoft introduced in May 2006 the new "NOODP" value for the "robots" element of the meta tags.Betsy Aoki (May 22, 2006), Opting Out of Open Directory Listings for Webmasters, Live Search Blog, retrieved June 3, 2007 Google followed in July 2006Vanessa Fox (July 13, 2006), More control over page snippets, Inside Google Sitemaps, retrieved June 3, 2007 and Yahoo! in October 2006.Yahoo! Search (October 24, 2006), Yahoo! Search Weather Update and Support for 'NOODP', Yahoo! Search Blog, retrieved June 3, 2007
The syntax is the same for all search engines who support the tag.
Webmasters can decide if they want to disallow the use of their ODP listing on a per search engine basis
Google:
Yahoo!

=====NOYDIR=====

Yahoo! puts content from their own Yahoo! directory next to the ODP listing. In 2007 they introduced a meta tag that lets web designers opt-out of this.Yahoo! Search (February 28, 2007), Yahoo! Search Support for 'NOYDIR' Meta Tags and Weather Update, Yahoo! Search Blog, retrieved June 3, 2007
Adding the NOYDIR tag to a page will prevent Yahoo! from displaying Yahoo! Directory titles and abstracts.

=====Robots-NoContent=====

Yahoo! also introduced in May 2007 the attribute value: .Yahoo! Search (May 02, 2007), Introducing Robots-Nocontent for Page Sections, Yahoo! Search Blog, retrieved March 23, 2013 This is not a meta tag, but an attribute and value, which can be used throughout Web page tags where needed. Content of the page where this attribute is being used will be ignored by the Yahoo! crawler and not included in the search engine's index.
Examples for the use of the  tag:

===Academic studies===

Google does not use HTML keyword or meta tag elements for indexing. The Director of Research at Google, Monika Henzinger, was quoted (in 2002) as saying, "Currently we don't trust metadata because we are afraid of being manipulated." Greta de Groat (2002). "Perspectives on the Web and Google: Monika Henzinger, Director of Research, Google", Journal of Internet Cataloging, Vol. 5(1), pp. 17-28, 2002. Other search engines developed techniques to penalize Web sites considered to be "cheating the system". For example, a Web site repeating the same meta keyword several times may have its ranking decreased by a search engine trying to eliminate this practice, though that is unlikely. It is more likely that a search engine will ignore the meta keyword element completely, and most do regardless of how many words are used in the element.
Google does, however, use meta tag elements for displaying site links. The title tags are used to create the link in search results:
The meta description often appears in Google search results to describe the link:

==Redirects==

Meta refresh elements can be used to instruct a Web browser to automatically refresh a Web page after a given time interval. It is also possible to specify an alternative URL and use this technique in order to redirect the user to a different location.
Auto refreshing via a META element has been deprecated for more than ten years,W3CTechniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines W3C Working Draft 26-Feb-1999 and recognized as problematic before that.Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines W3C Working Draft 17-Feb-1999
The W3C suggests that user agents should allow users to disable it, otherwise META refresh should not be used by web pages.
For Internet Explorer's security settings, under the miscellaneous category, meta refresh can be turned off by the user, thereby disabling its redirect ability.
In Mozilla Firefox it can be disabled in the configuration file under the key name "accessibility.blockautorefresh".Accessibility.blockautorefresh mozillaZine, archived June 2, 2009 from the original
Many web design tutorials also point out that client-side redirecting tends to interfere with the normal functioning of a Web browser's "back" button. After being redirected, clicking the back button will cause the user to go back to the redirect page, which redirects them again. Some modern browsers seem to overcome this problem however, including Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Opera.[tpl]citation needed |date=April 2011[/tpl]
Auto-redirects via markup (versus server-side redirects) are not in compliance with the W3C's - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 (guideline 7.5).W3C Recommendation (May 5, 1999), Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 - Guideline 7. W3.org, retrieved September 28, 2007

==HTTP message headers==

Meta elements of the form <meta http-equiv="foo" content="bar"> can be used as alternatives to HTTP headers. For example, <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Wed, 21 June 2006 14:25:27 GMT"> would tell the browser that the page "expires" on June 21, 2006 at 14:25:27 GMT and that it may safely cache the page until then. The HTML 4.01 specification optionally allows this tag to be parsed by HTTP servers and set as part of the HTTP response headers,W3C Recommendation (December 24, 1999), HTML 4.01 Specification. ''W3.org', retrieved July 24, 2012 but no web servers currently implement this behavior.Stack Overflow, meta http-equiv - is it sent as part of an HTTP header, or does the client parse the body for meta tags?, from a London Web Standards tech talk. Instead, the user agent emulates the behavior for some HTTP headers as if they had been sent in the response header itself.

==Alternative to meta elements==

Some HTML elements and attributes already handle certain pieces of meta data and may be used by authors instead of META to specify those pieces: the TITLE element, the ADDRESS element, the INS and DEL elements, the title attribute, and the cite attribute.http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.4.4
An alternative to meta elements for enhanced subject access within a website is the use of a back-of-book-style index for the website. See the American Society of Indexers website for an example.
In 1994, ALIWEB, also used an index file to provide the type of information commonly found in meta keywords attributes.
In cases where the content attribute's value is a URL, many authors decide to use a link element with a proper value for its rel attribute as well.
For a comparison on when it is best to use HTTP-headers, meta-elements, or attributes in the case of language specification: see here.
