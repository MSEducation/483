He was a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries in 1988 and the Republican presidential primaries in 1992. Duke has unsuccessfully run for the Louisiana State Senate, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and Governor of Louisiana.

The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Duke as "the most recognizable figure on the American radical right" and "a neo-Nazi".http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/profiles/david-duke His views are frequently described by his critics as being characterized by racism, antisemitism, and Holocaust denial.Gerstenfeld, Phyllis B., Diana R.

==Youth and early adulthood==

Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. Duke and Alice Maxine Crick. As the son of an engineer for Shell Oil, Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. They lived a short time in the Netherlands, before settling in Louisiana. In the late 1960s, Duke met the leader of the white supremacist National Alliance, William Pierce, who would remain a lifelong influence. Duke joined the Ku Klux Klan in 1967.Issues '92 Profile: David Duke; The Orange County Register. Santa Ana, Calif.: March 2, 1992. pg. a.04
Duke studied at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, and in 1970, he formed a white student group called the White Youth Alliance; it was affiliated with the National Socialist White People's Party. The same year, to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, Duke appeared at a demonstration in Nazi uniform. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, he became notorious on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform.[tpl]cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|isbn=0-87805-678-5[/tpl]
Duke claimed to have spent nine months in Laos, calling that a "normal tour of duty". He actually went there to join his father, who was working there and had asked him to visit during the summer of 1971.[tpl]cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&q=%20%20%20vietnam&f=false|pages=26–29[/tpl] His father got him a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a Molotov cocktail on the blackboard.[tpl]cite book|first=B.G.|last=Burkett|title=Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was robbed of its heroes and history|publisher=Verity Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xd0DAAAACAAJ&dq=stole+valor|isbn=978-0-9667036-0-3|year=1998[/tpl] He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines twenty times at night to drop rice to anti-Communist insurgents in planes flying ten feet off the ground, narrowly avoiding receiving a shrapnel wound. Two Air America pilots who were in Laos at that time said that flights were during the day and flew no less than 500 feet from the ground. One suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe "milk run" once or twice but no more than that. Duke was also unable to recall the name of the airfield used.
He graduated from Louisiana State University in 1974 after enrolling in 1968. During this time he spent what would have been his senior year organizing the National Party.[tpl]cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&q=%20%20%20vietnam&f=false|page=1[/tpl]

==Family and personal life==

While working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Hardin, who became active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke's two daughters, Erika and Kristin. According to an article by Martin A. Lee in the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, in 1977 David Duke, then married with two children, pursued female sex partners so avidly and so openly that it embarrassed many of his closest colleagues. Tom Metzger, then Duke's state leader in southern California, became livid when Duke showed up for a Ku Klux Klan anti-immigrant "border watch" stunt and immediately started pursuing women.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/spring/insatiable |title=Get informed |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center[/tpl] Duke divorced in 1984—arguably because Chloe was fed up with Duke's womanizingThe Rise of David Duke, Tyler Bridges, pg. 80, 1994—and Chloe moved to West Palm Beach to be near her parents. There she became involved with Duke's Klan friend, Don Black, whom she later married.[tpl]cite web|last= Kim|first=T.

As of 2009, it was confirmed that David Duke was living in Zell am See in Salzburg, Austria,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/NRSITZ/NRSITZ_00023/SEITE_0136.html |title=Parlamentarische Materialien |publisher=Parlament.gv.at |accessdate=2012-05-06[/tpl] from which he ran the Internet business "Art by Ernst", taking and selling photographs of rare birds, mountain scenery and wildlife[tpl]cite journal|title=The Mysterious Tale of a Ukrainian University's Anti-Semitic Crusade|first=Nadine|last=Epstein|date=November–December 2009|work=Moment Magazine|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2009/2009-12/200912-MAUP.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.salzburger-fenster.at/rubrik/lokales/1909/us-rechtsextremist-nutzt-salzburg-seit_12707.html|title=US-Rechtsextremist nutzt Salzburg seit Jahren als Zuflucht|date=September 19, 2009|first=Sonja|last=Wenger|work=Salzburger Fenster[/tpl] under the pseudonym "Ernst Duke" (his middle-name "Ernest" Germanized).http://www.gruene.at/uploads/media/dossier_duke_ernest_duke.pdf[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hagalil.com/archiv/2009/05/17/duke-2/|title=Ex-Ku-Klux-Boss: Rückzugsgebiet in den Alpen|accessdate=2011-07-22|work=haGalil.com|location=|date=May 17, 2009[/tpl] Local authorities have stated that as long as he does not break any laws, Duke is allowed to stay in Austria if he wishes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/5319566/Former-KKK-grand-wizard-living-in-Austria.html|title=Former KKK grand wizard living in Austria|accessdate=2009-05-13|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=May 13, 2009[/tpl] Duke has stated: "I'm not in Austria for any political activities. I just come to Austria to relax – the mountains are beautiful. The Austrian Alps are just beautiful. There's beauty all over the world." In May 2009, Duke issued a statement denying that he resides in Austria and saying that he is a resident of Mandeville, Louisiana, and is registered as a taxpayer in his city, state and on the national level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.davidduke.com/general/i-live-in-america-setting-straight-the-silly-telegraph-article_13847.html|title=A Letter to the Telegraph|publisher=davidduke.com|accessdate=November 20, 2009|date=May 20, 2009[/tpl]

==Political activities==

===Early campaigns===

Duke first ran for the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat from a Baton Rouge district in 1975. He received 11,079 votes, a third of those cast.[tpl]cite news|author=Wayne King|title=David Duke:Cleaning up the Klan's image |date=November 25, 1975|work=St. Petersburg Times via New York Times|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JjIMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UF8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4666,22684&dq=david-duke&hl=en|accessdate=2011-01-16[/tpl] In 1979, he ran as a Democrat for the 10th District Senate seat and finished second in a three-candidate race with 9,897 votes (26 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328064 |title=Our Campaigns – LA State Senate 10 Race – October 27, 1979 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=2012-05-06[/tpl] Duke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the Georgia Forsyth County Defense League without permission. League officials described it as a fund-raising scam. Duke was accused by several Klan officials of stealing his organization's money. "Duke is nothing but a con artist," Jack Gregory, Duke's Florida state leader, told the Clearwater Sun (of Florida) after David Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in Metairie. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan. In 1979, after his first, abortive run for president (as a Democrat) and a series of highly publicized violent Klan incidents, Duke quietly incorporated the nonprofit National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP) in an attempt to leave the baggage of the Klan behind.[tpl]cite web|author=By Martin A.

===1988 Democratic presidential campaign===

In 1988, Duke ran initially in the Democratic presidential primaries. His campaign failed to make much of an impact, with the one notable exception of winning the little-known New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=393638 |title=Our Campaigns – D Primary Race – February 16, 1988 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=2012-05-06[/tpl] Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then successfully sought the Presidential nomination of the Populist Party.[ref]Our Campaigns – US President – Pop Convention Race, March 11, 1988]
[/ref] He appeared on the ballot for President in eleven states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of Arkansas for Vice President, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker for Vice President. He received just 47,047 votes, for 0.04 percent of the combined, national popular vote.D.C. Finegold-Sachs (2005). D.C.'s Political Report. 1988 Presidential Candidates; retrieved on 2009-04-04.

===1989: Successful run in special election for Louisiana House seat===

In December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CXzQ2VSpyZsC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=John+Treen+of+Louisiana&q=John%20Treen%20of%20Louisiana|title=Michael Zatarain, David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=November 11, 2009|isbn=978-0-88289-817-9|author1=Zatarain, Michael|date=July 1990[/tpl]
In 1988, Republican State Representative Charles Cusimano of Metairie resigned his District 89 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a special election was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans, John Spier Treen, a brother of former Governor David C. Treen, Delton Charles, a school board member, and Roger F. Villere, Jr., who operates Villere's Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328066|title=Louisiana State Representative Election, 1989|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009[/tpl] As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a runoff election was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. John Treen's candidacy was endorsed by U.S. President George H. W. Bush, former President Ronald Reagan, and other notable Republicans,"GOP Condemns Duke" Newsday. Long Island, N.Y.: February 25, 1989, pg. 9 as well as the Democrat Victor Bussie (president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO) and Edward J. Steimel (president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and former director of the "good government" think tank, the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke, however, hammered Treen on a statement the latter had made indicating a willingness to entertain higher property taxes, anathema in that suburban district.[ref]Douglas D.

Freshman legislator Odon Bacqué of Lafayette, a No Party member of the House, stood alone in 1989, when he attempted to deny seating to Duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election. When John Treen failed in a court challenge in regard to Duke's residency, Duke was seated. Lawmakers who opposed Duke said that they had to defer to his constituents who narrowly chose Duke as representative.Ron Gomez, "David Duke? He's Just Another Freshman", My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative, Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pp. 157-164; ISBN 0-9700156-0-7
Duke took his seat on the same day as Jerry Luke LeBlanc of Lafayette Parish, who won another special election held on the same day as the Duke-Treen runoff to choose a successor to Kathleen Blanco, the future governor who was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.
As a short-term legislator, Duke was, in the words of a colleague, Ron Gomez of Lafayette "so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking."Gomez, ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator, pg. 230
One legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that welfare recipients be tested for the use of narcotics. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal."Duke welfare bill wins panel favor," Minden Press-Herald, May 9, 1989, pg. 1
Gomez recalls having met and interviewed Duke in the middle 1970s when Duke was a state senate candidate: "He was still in his mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that."Gomez, Recovering Legislator, pg. 228. Gomez has implied that Duke had a facelift by the time he entered the legislature.
Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.[tpl]cite news|author=Benton, Joshua|title=National: David Duke Reverts to Unabashed Racism in Congress run |date=May 1, 1999|publisher=Block News Alliance|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/19990501davidduke3.asp|accessdate=2006-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gullixson|first=Paul|title=Part 4: Taking on David Duke|date=April 12, 1995|publisher=Palo Alto Weekly|work=Palo Alto Weekly|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/page4/1995_Apr_12.NOTES12.html|accessdate=2006-09-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ben|title=American Nazi Idol|date=August 18, 2005|publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=19186|accessdate=2006-09-02[/tpl]
Gomez continued: "He once presented a bill on the floor, one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times."Ron Gomez, p. 230 Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.Gomez, Recovering Legislator, pgs. 231-2
Gomez added that Duke's "tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome."Gomez, Recovering Legislator, pg. 231
Gomez continued: Duke's "new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of 'European-Americans.' He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the 'growing underclass.' He used the tried and true demagoguery of class envy to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, affirmative action... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject near and dear to every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the homestead exemption."Gomez, Recovering Legislator, pg. 222
Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the Republican organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp|title=Stephen Sabludowsky, "Jindal Has Mighty Duke in Louisiana GOP and Roger Villere"|publisher=bayoubuzz.com|accessdate=November 8, 2009[/tpl]

===1990 campaign for U.S. Senate===

Duke has often criticized federal policies which he believes discriminate against white people in favor of racial minorities. To that end he formed the controversial group, the "National Association for the Advancement of White People"."Duke undecided on Senate race", Minden Press-Herald, November 6, 1989, p. 1
Though Duke had first hesitated about entering the Senate race, he made his announcement of candidacy for the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 6, 1990.

Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3516 |title=Our Campaigns – LA US Senate Race – October 6, 1990 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=2012-05-06[/tpl] whom Duke derided as "J.

The Republican Party officially endorsed state Senator Ben Bagert of New Orleans in a state convention held on January 13, 1990, but national GOP officials in October, just days before the primary election, concluded that Bagert could not win. To avoid a runoff between Duke and Johnston, the GOP decided to surrender the primary to Johnston. Funding for Bagert's campaign was halted, and though at first under protest Bagert dropped out two days before the election. With such a late withdrawal, Bagert's name remained on the ballot, but his votes, most presumably cast as absentee ballots, were not counted.[tpl]cite news |title=Republican quits to help Democrat |author=Kevin McGill |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwghAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gXYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,613940&dq=duke+1990+not+endorsed&hl=en |newspaper=The Hour |date=5 October 1990 |accessdate=7 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Louisiana Republican Quits, Reducing Duke's Chances|date=October 5, 1990|work=Washington Post[/tpl] Duke received 43.51 percent (607,391 votes) of the primary vote to Johnston's 53.93 percent (752,902 votes).

In a 2006 editorial, Gideon Rachman (The Economist, the Financial Times) recalled interviewing Duke's campaign manager (from his 1990 campaign) who said, "The Jews just aren't a big issue in Louisiana.

In the primary, Duke finished second to former governor Edwin W. Edwards in votes; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32 percent of the vote. Incumbent Governor Buddy Roemer, who had switched from the Democratic to Republican parties during his term, came in third with 27 percent of the vote. Duke effectively killed Roemer's bid for re-election. While Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a "protest vote" to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana's establishment politicians.

The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. By the time of the 1991 gubernatorial election, however, its leadership had withdrawn support from Duke.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theocracywatch.org/clarkson_inside.html|title=Frederick Clarkson, "Church and State, November 1993|publisher=theocracywatch.org|accessdate=June 6, 2012[/tpl] Despite Duke's status as the only Republican in the runoff, sitting Republican President George H.W. Bush opposed his candidacy and denounced him as charlatan and a racist. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu stated that "The President is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past."West, Paul. (October 21, 1991). "Winners set stage for racially charged La. runoff." The Baltimore Sun.''
The interest group, the Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism, rallied against the election of Duke as governor. Beth Rickey, a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a PhD student at Tulane University, began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her that he was a mainstream conservative in the Reagan mold.Patricia Sullivan, "Beth Rickey dies with an immune disorder and Crohn's disease," Washington Post, September 16, 2009
Between the primary and the runoff, called the "general election" under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), white supremacist organizations from around the country contributed to his campaign fund.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Martin A.|title=Detailing David Duke|year=2003|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|accessdate=2006-08-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=David Duke: In His Own Words|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|accessdate=2006-08-31[/tpl]
Duke's success garnered national media attention. While Duke gained the backing of the quixotic former Alexandria Mayor John K. Snyder, he won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands to Edwards' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: "Vote for the Crook.

Edwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%). Duke's 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke claimed victory, saying: "I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote." Exit polls confirmed that he had.

In 1992 a film was released that investigated Duke's appeal among some white voters. Backlash: Race and the American Dream explored the demagogic issues of Duke's platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy and tied Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as Lester G. Maddox and George C. Wallace, Jr., and the use in the 1988 Presidential campaign of Pres. George H.W.

===Late 1990s campaigns===

When Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the U.S. Senate. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge and Democrat Mary Landrieu of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, jungle primary race.David Duke Heads North to Raise Money for House Race" By Michael Janofsky, The New York Times, January 3, 1999
Because of the sudden resignation of powerful Republican incumbent Bob Livingston in 1999, a special election was held in Louisiana's First Congressional District. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff.

The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. Winter 1996/1997. Duke first received broad public attention during this time, as he endeavored to market himself in the mid-1970s as a new brand of Klansman: well-groomed, engaged, and professional. Duke also reformed the organization, promoting nonviolence and legality, and, for the first time in the Klan's history, women were accepted as equal members and Catholics were encouraged to apply for membership.[tpl]cite web|title=Photo of David Duke at a Klan cross lighting ceremony|url=http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF1503/Berry/Berry01.jpg|accessdate=2006-09-02[/tpl] Duke would repeatedly insist that the Klan was "not anti-black", but rather "pro-white" and "pro-Christian."

===Stormfront===

In 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a small bulletin board system (BBS) called Stormfront.

==New Orleans Protocol==

Shortly after his release from prison for tax fraud in 2004, Duke organized a weekend gathering of "European Nationalists", in the vein of white nationalism, in Kenner, Louisiana. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division that had followed the death of William Pierce in 2002, he presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image amongst outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the New Orleans Protocol (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organisations, it has three provisions:[tpl]cite web |title=Freed from prison, David Duke mounts a comeback |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Report, Summer 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=The New Orleans Protocol | publisher=Canadian Heritage Alliance website |url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:T64eYPcPncgJ:www.canadianheritagealliance.com/about-us/new-orleans-protocol.html [/tpl]
Those who signed the pact on May 29, 2004 include Duke, Paul Fromm, Don Black, Willis Carto (whose holocaust-denying Barnes Review helped sponsor the event), Kevin Alfred Strom, and John Tyndall (signing as an individual, not on behalf of his British National Party). It was also adopted by the white supremacist Canadian Heritage Alliance.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The SPLC noted that the 'high tone' contrasted with statements at the event where the pact was signed such as Paul Fromm's calling a Muslim woman "a hag in a bag" and Sam Dickson (from the Council of Conservative Citizens, another sponsor) speaking "about the "very, very destructive" effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II – opposition that caused people to view Hitler's "normal, healthy racial values" as evil. They described the Protocol as a "smokescreen", saying that "most of conference participants' ire was directed at what they consider to be a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy the white race through immigration and miscegenation".http://wayback.archive.org/web/20091019031428/http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=83

Duke wrote a self-help book for women to raise money under the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt and James Konrad, titled Finders-Keepers – Finding and Keeping the Man You Want which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, published by Arlington Place Books in 1976. Professor Lawrence N.

===My Awakening===

Duke published his autobiography My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding in 1998. The book details Duke's social philosophies, especially his reasoning behind racial separation. In the book, Duke says:
 We (Whites) desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will. 
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) book review refers to it as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic views.[tpl]cite web | last = Foxman | first = Abraham | title = David Duke's My Awakening: A Minor League Mein Kampf |date=January 1999 | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | accessdate = 2006-11-16[/tpl]
To raise the money to re-publish a new, updated edition of My Awakening, Duke instigated a 21-day fundraising drive on November 26, 2007 where he had to raise "$25,344 by a December 17 deadline for the printers."The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD » Day 1 of the 21 Day Fundraising Drive for the New, Updated Edition of My Awakening[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] Duke states this drive is necessary because the work "has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom."

===Jewish Supremacism===

In 2002, Duke traveled to Eastern Europe to promote his book, Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening on the Jewish Question in Russia in 2003. The book purports to "examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times."[tpl]cite web|last=Duke|first=David|title=Jewish Supremacism: Author's Preface|date=December 5, 2005|work=Jewish Supremacism|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|accessdate=2006-11-16[/tpl] The book is dedicated to Israel Shahak, a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former Boris Yeltsin administration official and politician Boris Mironov wrote an introduction for the Russian edition, called The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American.
The ADL office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation of Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from a prominent Duma member to Russia's Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke's book. The letter by Aleksandr Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and as violating Russian anti-hate crime laws.David Duke in Russia. Anti-Defamation League. Retrieved on November 16, 2006.] Around December 2001 Prosecutor's office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and Jewish Supremacism.

==Internet commentary==

On February 5, 2002, Duke said, on his Internet radio show, that Ariel Sharon was "the world's worst terrorist" and that Mossad was involved in the September 11 attacks. The broadcast said that Zionists were behind the attacks in order to reduce sympathy for Muslim nations in the West, and that the number of Israelis killed in the attack was lower than it would be under normal circumstances, citing early assessments by The Jerusalem Post and "the legendary involvement of Israeli nationals in businesses at the World Trade Center". According to Duke, this indicated that Israeli security services had prior knowledge of the attack.Ariel Sharon: The terrorist behind the 9-11 Attack! by David Duke
On February 4, 2009, Duke repeatedly called MSNBC pundit Keith Olbermann "untermensch" on his radio show in response to being labeled "Worst Person in the World" on Countdown with Keith Olbermann.http://www.stormfront.org/audio/stormfront_radio-dr_david_duke_and_don_black-02-04-09.mp3

===Comments in the media===

Since 2005, Duke has appeared three times on Current Issues, a Lafayette, Louisiana–based television show hosted and produced by Palestinian-American Hesham Tillawi, which has recently been picked up by Bridges TV.

David Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under [tpl]usc|26|7206[/tpl] and mail fraud under [tpl]usc|18|1341[/tpl] in December 2002.David Duke pleads to mail fraud, tax charges USA Today
Four months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in Big Spring, Texas. He was also fined US$10,000, ordered to cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service, and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the United States federal court system and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence, rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.
Duke pleaded guilty to what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Through postal mail, Duke later appealed to his supporters that he was about to lose his house and his life savings.
