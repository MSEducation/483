==Comments on national issues==

===Fuel subsidy removal===

During the national debate on fuel subsidy removal that eventually led to Occupy Nigeria protests, Daramola was one of Nigerian legislators invited to a meeting with Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria's President. At the end of the meeting, Daramola said "Mr. President did not sufficiently convince me or my other colleagues in the House of Representatives. I don’t want to be graphic on what happened there but I am telling you that it was a faux pax. I don’t think he achieved any purpose. I don’t think he moved the story forward. I would say that his reasons did not appeal to members of the House of Representatives."[tpl]cite news |author=Paul Odenyi |title=Fuel subsidy: ‘Jonathan can’t convince Senators, Reps’ |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/12/fuel-subsidy-'jonathan-can't-convince-senators-reps'/ |date=April 1, 2012 |newspaper=Vanguard[/tpl]
