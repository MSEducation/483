CATEGORIES: Schools in Hyderabad, India

The Steiner School in Hyderabad was launched by the Education Renaissance Trust - a non-profit organization run by a group of people who wanted to spark off change among teachers and concerned parents. Their aim was to start a school that had sensitivity and a deeper understanding of the child. As the Trust searched for an alternative system, the Steiner Waldorf School was the answer. These schools have flourished the world over for over 90 years.
The Education Renaissance Trust is part of an international movement in education. There are over 1000 Steiner schools worldwide. Each one is adapted to the character of its location.
