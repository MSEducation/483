An example if two distinct debated scenarios are:

To determine the star's luminosity, there are 3 computational steps:

====Arcseconds to AU====

The calculations begin with the formula for a star's angular diameter, as follows:

where

====AU to R☉====

To convert the above into solar units, the math is straightforward. Since 1 AU = 149,597,871 km and the mean diameter of the Sun = 1,392,000 km (hence a mean radius of 696,000 km), the calculation is as follows:

====R☉ to L☉====

Incorporating the R☉ results into the luminosity formula outlined earlier where B = Betelgeuse, L = Luminosity, R = Radius and T = Temperature, we can calculate Betelgeuse's luminosity per each scenario, as follows:

These luminosity calculations do not take into consideration error factors relating to angular diameter or distance measurements nor any diminution caused by extinction, which in the case of Betelgeuse has been estimated at around 3.1%.  Also, while the calculations are correct and useful, in practice they are often performed in reverse because the distance to most stars[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl], and hence their size, cannot be determined directly while quantities such as the luminosity and temperature can be estimated from other observable quantities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
