Hans Molisch (December 6, 1856, Brünn, Habsburg Moravia - December 8, 1937, Wien, Austria) was a Czech-Austrian botanist.
He taught as a professor at the German University of Prague (1894-), Vienna University (1909-1928), Tohoku Imperial University (now Tohoku University, Japan; 1922-1925), and a university in India.
From 1931 to 1937 he acted as the vice-president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.
Hans Molisch expanded on Julius von Sachs's work by developing ´starch pictures´ in intact leaves by using actual photographic negatives as masks over the illuminate leaves.
