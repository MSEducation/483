[[Potoroo]]

CATEGORIES: Potoroids, Marsupials of Australia

The potoroo is a kangaroo-like marsupial about the size of a rabbit. It is a macropod. All three extant species are threatened, especially the long-footed Potoroo (Endangered) and Gilbert's potoroo (Critically Endangered). The main threats are predation by introduced species (especially foxes) and habitat loss.
Potoroos were formerly very common, and early settlers reported them as being a significant pest to their crops.
Gilbert's Potoroo is Australia's most endangered animal. There are only 30â€“40 known left in the wild. It was discovered in 1840 by a naturalist called John Gilbert. It was then thought to have become extinct until being rediscovered in 1994 at the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve (near Albany) in Western Australia.
