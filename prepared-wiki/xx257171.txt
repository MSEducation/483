Assad spent the next five years playing at various venues performing original songs and covers. Venues ranged from restaurants, weddings and coffee shops to leading and organizing worship concerts at church.  Around 2003 Assad recorded a 4-song demo with Drew Middleton, a member of the CCM band Tenth Avenue North at the time, whom Assad toured with occasionally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/AudreyAssad2010.asp|title=Audrey Assad: Building Something Special|author=Jen Rose|date=July 10, 2010|work=Jesus Freak Hideout|accessdate=July 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tcmaudioarchives.mypodcast.com/2010/07/Talkback_with_C_E_Moore_Sparrow_Records_recording_artist_Audrey_Assad-317013.html|title=Talkback with C.

===Nashville and the Firefly EP===

In 2008 when Assad was 24, she decided to move to Nashville, Tennessee to continue and focus on her music career. She raised $7,000 from friends and fans to support her move from Florida.[tpl]cite web|url=http://saltandlighttv.org/blog/general/a-songstress-for-the-soul-part-ii#more-15456|title=A Songstress for the Soul: Part II|author=Jenna Murphy|date=August 24, 2010|work=Salt + Light|accessdate=July 19, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110720090225/http://saltandlighttv.org/blog/general/a-songstress-for-the-soul-part-ii|archivedate=July 20, 2011|deadurl=no[/tpl] In Nashville she worked with producers Paul Moak and Phillip LaRue, recording a five song EP, Firefly, which sold at shows and featured a handwritten cover made of a brown paper bag. She supported herself by working as a nanny before meeting fellow Catholic musician Matt Maher. Maher took Assad under his wing and brought her to various gigs, where she sang back-up vocals and played sets during his shows. This time together around Maher's home base of Phoenix, Arizona, would later prompt Assad to move there from Nashville. During this time Assad signed on to work as a staff writer for EMI Christian Music Group Publishing, doing songwriting work with other artists.

===Sparrow Records and The House You're Building===

In 2009 Assad signed with Sparrow Records, who had been talking to Assad after the release of her EP.  For her first album, Assad then met and played for producer Marshall Altman, who would agree to produce what would become The House You're Building. Altman and Assad recorded the album at the Galt Line Studio in Los Angeles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=2912|title=Official bio|work=Sparrow Records|accessdate=July 19, 2011[/tpl] The House You're Building was released on July 13, 2010, and the title track was featured as a free download on iTunes Discovery Download.

The album reached #12 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and #6 on its Heatseekers chart.Charts, Allmusic Assad is working with Marshall Altman again for a follow-up to her debut album.

==Musical style and themes==

Assad grew up in a religious household but listened to secular music growing up through her mother's influence, including The Carpenters, James Taylor and Celine Dion, as well as French and Middle Eastern music from her dad's influence.  Later she discovered and began listening to Christian music such as the Newsboys, Nichole Nordeman and Cindy Morgan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=11943|title=Audrey Assad: Heaven is Breaking Through|author=RJ Carter|date=June 25, 2010|work=The Trades|accessdate=July 19, 2011[/tpl]  When she was 2 she started playing the piano, but it wasn't until she was 19 when she began leading worship  that she started writing and performing her own music. Assad played in local Florida venues with a style she described as folky and "average girl with a guitar/piano stuff". The Firefly EP that she recorded with Paul Moak was also described as folky and rootsy.
Her current style is a mix of religious and non-religious themed songs that draw from her Catholic faith as well as literary references from her love of reading literature and poetry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2010/July/Audrey-Assad-Explores-Faith-Walk-in-New-Album/ |title=Audrey Assad Explores Faith Walk in New Album|author=Wendy Griffith|date=July 7, 2010|work=CBN|accessdate=19 July 2011[/tpl] A majority of her religious songs are written in a way that emphasizes being sung to God rather than about God.
