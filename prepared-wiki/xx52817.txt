[[Minocycline]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-acne preparations, Tetracycline antibiotics, Neuroprotective agents

Minocycline (INN) is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, and has a broader spectrum than the other members of the group. It is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, classified as a long-acting type. As a result of its long half-life it generally has serum levels 2–4 times that of the simple water-soluble tetracyclines (150 mg giving 16 times the activity levels compared with 250 mg of tetracycline at 24–48 hours).
Minocycline is the most lipid-soluble of the tetracycline-class antibiotics, giving it the greatest penetration into the prostate and brain, but also the greatest amount of central nervous system (CNS)-related side effects, such as vertigo. A common side effect is diarrhea. Uncommon side effects (with prolonged therapy) include skin discolouration and autoimmune disorders that are not seen with other drugs in the class.
Minocycline is a relatively poor tetracycline-class antibiotic choice for urinary pathogens sensitive to this antibiotic class, as its solubility in water and levels in the urine are less than all other tetracyclines. Minocycline is metabolized by the liver and has poor urinary excretion.
Minocycline is not a naturally-occurring antibiotic, but was synthesized semi-synthetically from natural tetracycline antibiotics by Lederle Laboratories in 1972, and marketed by them under the brand name Minocin."The Tetracyclines". Lin, DW. March 2005.

==Cautions==

Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in renal impairment, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus.[tpl]cite journal | author=Gough A, Chapman S, Wagstaff K, Emery P, Elias E | title=Minocycline induced autoimmune hepatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome | journal=BMJ |date=January 1996 | pages=169–72 | volume=312 | issue=7024 | pmid=8563540 | pmc=2349841 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.312.7024.169 [/tpl] It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krawitt EL |title=Autoimmune hepatitis |journal=N.

Also, more so than other tetracyclines, minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Cerebral edema, as well as autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects to minocycline in some people.[tpl]cite journal|title=Minocycline-induced hypersensitivity syndrome presenting with meningitis and brain edema: a case report|author=Lefebvre N|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|year=2007|volume=1|pages=22|doi= 10.1186/1752-1947-1-22|pmid=17511865|pmc=1884162|author-separator=,|author2=Forestier E|author3=Farhi D|display-authors=3|last4=Mahsa|first4=Mohseni|last5=Remy|first5=Véronique|last6=Lesens|first6=Olivier|last7=Christmann|first7=Daniel|last8=Hansmann|first8=Yves[/tpl]
Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date."Principles and methods for the assessment of nephrotoxicity associated with exposure to chemicals". Environmental health criteria: 119. World Health Organization (WHO). ISBN 92-4-157119-5. ISSN 0250-863X. 1991 While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline.
Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly.[tpl]cite book |title=Drug Interactions in Infectious Diseases |last=Piscitelli |first=Stephen C. |coauthors=Keith Rodvold |year=2005 |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=1-58829-455-2 [/tpl] Minocycline should be taken with plenty of water.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] If taking this drug, one should avoid prolonged or excessive exposure to direct sunlight.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
A study published in 2007, suggested that minocycline harms ALS patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. According to the researcher from Columbia University the effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses.Science Vol 318, 1227, 2007

==Side effects==

Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, headache and vomiting. Minocycline increases sensitivity to sunlight. Minocycline may affect quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nonaka K, Nakazawa Y, Kotorii T |title=Effects of antibiotics, minocycline and ampicillin, on human sleep |journal=Brain Res. |volume=288 |issue=1-2 |pages=253–9 |date=December 1983 |pmid=6661620 |doi= 10.1016/0006-8993(83)90101-4|url=[/tpl] It has also been linked to cases of lupus.

Occasionally minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug related lupus and auto-immune hepatitis; minocycline induced auto-immune hepatitis when it occurs usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline induced lupus, however, women are the most likely to develop minocycline induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline induced autoimmune problems within a period of a couple of weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mongey AB, Hess EV |title=Drug insight: autoimmune effects of medications-what's new? |journal=Nat Clin Pract Rheumatol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=136–44 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18200008 |doi=10.1038/ncprheum0708 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrrheum/journal/v4/n3/pdf/ncprheum0708.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ochsendorf F |title=Minocycline in acne vulgaris: benefits and risks |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=327–41 |year=2010 |pmid=20642295 |doi=10.2165/11319280-000000000-00000 |url=[/tpl] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline.
Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances with dizziness, ataxia, vertigo and tinnitus. These effects are again thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50% to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients.
Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri),[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedman DI |title=Medication-induced intracranial hypertension in dermatology |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |year=2005 |pmid=15675888 |doi= 10.2165/00128071-200506010-00004|url=[/tpl] a side effect also more common in female patients.

==Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective==

In various models of neurodegenerative disease, minocycline has demonstrated neurorestorative as well as neuroprotective properties. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease have shown a particularly beneficial response to minocycline in research studies, and an antipsychotic benefit has been found in people with schizophrenia and minocycline is proposed as a possible addon therapy for some schizophrenics.[tpl]cite journal |author=Miyaoka T |title=Clinical potential of minocycline for schizophrenia |journal=CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=376–81 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18991666 |doi=10.2174/187152708786441858 [/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.4088/JCP.08m04666yel[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1177/0269881112444941[/tpl] Current research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

As an anti-inflammatory, minocycline inhibits apoptosis (cell death) via attenuation of TNF-alpha, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokine output. This effect is mediated by a direct action of minocycline on the activated T cells and on microglia, which results in the decreased ability of T cells to contact microglia which impairs cytokine production in T cell-microglia signal transduction .

A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.
