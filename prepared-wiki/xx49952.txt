Heinola is a town and a municipality of [tpl]Formatnum: [tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Heinola[/tpl][/tpl] inhabitants ([tpl]#time: j F Y|[tpl]Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate[/tpl] [/tpl]) located in the region of Päijänne Tavastia. Heinola is perhaps best known for its summer activities such as the Sauna-sitting World Championships.

==History==

Heinola used to be a remote village of then larger Hollola until it gained significance in 1776 when Gustav III of Sweden promoted it to be the governmental center of the province in which it was then located. The grid plan of the city center is from that era. Heinola also became a center of commerce for nearby regions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heinola.fi/ENG/General_information/The_history_of_heinola/|title=The history of Heinola|publisher=Heinolan kaupunki|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl]
When Finland became a part of Russia in 1809, the capital of the province was moved eastwards with the state border. To compensate this, Heinola gained a city status in 1839. Before World War II, Heinola was widely known as a spa town, and until 1972 it served as a location for an institute (seminaari) that taught elementary school teachers. These both were established in the 1890s and played important role in the town life.

==Economy==

After World War II Heinola has been economically an industrial town, mainly due to its wood processing industry. Industry remained the largest source of employment until 1970s, when the trade and services sector grew larger, following a national trend.
Heinola has been hit hard by Late-2000s recession. UPM-Kymmene, that used to be the largest employer after the public sector, has reported closing down its sawmill and plywood mill in Heinola during 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/01/upm_job_losses_total_830_1362547.html|title=UPM job losses total 830|publisher=YLE|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl]

==Sights==

The bird zoo is located just next to the bus station. The founding idea of the bird zoo is to offer help for birds that have injured themselves in the traffic, power lines and glass surfaces, and to rehabilitate them back to the nature. The birds that remain in the care, and the ones that are not capable of returning to the nature, but are considered to maintain a meaningful life in capture, are available for the to specatators to see. For school groups and to tourists, this can be a good opportunity to identify some of the species that are not so easily spotted in the wild. In the summer, tropical birds that spend the winter inside are also to be seen.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heinola.fi/FIN/Palvelut/Matkailu/Lintutarhat/tietoa_lintutarhasta.htm|publisher=Heinolan kaupunki|accessdate=21 February 2014[/tpl]

==Geography==

Heinola is largely situated between two lakes, Ruotsalainen and Konnivesi. A waterway connecting the lakes crosses the town and is, along with an esker also crossing the town, a characterising geographical feature of Heinola.
A motorway (Finnish national road 4/E75) connects Heinola to Lahti (distance [tpl]convert|35|km|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and Helsinki (distance [tpl]convert|138|km|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]).
