He is successor to the ninth Imam, Ahmed ibn Abdellah and father of next Imam Al Mahdi who was the founder of the Fatimid Caliphate.
The 8th to 10th Ismaili Imams were hidden from the public, because of threats from Abbasid caliphate, and were known by their nicknames. However, the Dawoodi Bohra in their religious text, Taqqarub, claim to have the true names of all 21 imams in sequence including those "hidden" imams: 8th Imam "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl al-Wafī" the true name/ (Wafī Ahmad), 9th Imam "Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad at-Taqī" the true name/ (Taqī Muhammad), and the 10th Imam "al-Ḥusayn ibn Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ar-Raḍī/al-Zakī" the true name/ (Raḍī Abdullah)The dua (prayer) "Taqarrub" lists these names amongst the Imams.[ref]“In addition to what has been concluded from this study, the following deductions can also be drawn: To the Ismāʿīlīs, the names of the hidden Imams after Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn Ja'far are: Abdallah ibn Muhammad (better known in Isma'ili circles as Ahmad al-Wafi), Ahmad ibn Abdallah (better known as Muhammad at-Tāqī), Husayn ibn Ahmad (better known as ʿAbd Allāh ar-Raḍī/al-Zakī), and Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥusain (better known as ‘Ubayd Allah ibn al-Husayn, with al-Madhī as title)."
