Rock Against Howard is an Australian compilation CD featuring anti-Coalition musicians, released in 2004. The project hoped to inspire young voters to turn out in federal elections that year to vote against then-Prime Minister John Howard, but Howard's party prevailed all the same.
Rock Against Howard was organised by Frenzal Rhomb guitarist Lindsay McDougall, when he realised every musician he knew felt the same way about Howard. It was inspired by the American Rock Against Bush compilations, and takes on a similar format. All profits from album sales go to refugee charities through the Refugee Action Coalition, an ironic tribute to Howard's stance on asylum seekers.
The music on the release is politically oriented, with the first disk featuring previously released songs, and a disk of live and otherwise previously unreleased work on the second. The style of music varies widely, with punk rock, hip-hop, and even show tunes.
