==The Michael teachings==

Messages from Michael is the first in a series of four books that chronicles a three-decade-long "conversation" between a group of friends surrounding Sarah Chambers (d. 1998) and a channeled, spiritual teaching entity that has come to be known as Michael. As of September 2013 this conversation continues, as the Michael group continues to conduct closed sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area. A core concept of the teachings is "all choices made are equally valid."
Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's book presented a heavily fictionalized version of Sarah Chambers' group, identifying her under the pseudonym of Jessica Lansing. Yarbro owns the copyright to the group's work and published three more books on the subject, containing edited channeling transcripts as well as additional background material.
