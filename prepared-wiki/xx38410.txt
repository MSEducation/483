[tpl]Nihongo|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure|ジョジョの奇妙な冒険|JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken[/tpl] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1986 to 2004, before being transferred to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The current story arc, JoJolion, started in 2011. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is currently Shueisha's second largest manga series with 110 tankōbon volumes and counting (only Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo, with over 180, has more).
A six-volume original video animation adaptation of the later half of the series' third story arc, Stardust Crusaders, was released from 1993 to 1994 by studio A.P.P.P. Six years later, they produced a seven-volume series adapting the arc's first half from 2000 to 2002. A.P.P.P. also produced a theatrical film of the first arc, Phantom Blood, in 2007. From 2003 to 2005, Super Techno Arts released an English dub of both OVA series as one on DVD in North America. Only the third story arc of the manga, which is the most popular and well-known, received an English release in North America by Viz Media from 2005 to 2010. A 26-episode television anime, produced by David Production and covering the first two arcs, aired on Tokyo MX and other stations starting in October 2012 and ending in April 2013. A second season covering the third arc began broadcast in April 2014.
The JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga has sold over 80 million copies in Japan alone, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and has spawned a large media franchise that includes several novelizations and video games, action figures, a jewelry line, and even snack foods.

==Plot==

The story of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure centers around the misadventures of the Joestars, a powerful family with English roots. The series spans several generations, with each part featuring a descendant of the Joestars as the main protagonist along with a large cast of characters. Parts 1 to 6 occur in the same timeline while parts 7 and 8 take place in a separate, alternate universe.
The series' title is a reference to the fact that each part's main character's name can be read as JoJo, a nickname derived by putting together the letters "J" and "O" from their first and last names. Later installments have additional variations on the JoJo wordplay. For example, in the name [tpl]nihongo4|Josuke|仗助|Jōsuke|also [tpl]lang|ja|定助[/tpl][/tpl], the kanji [tpl]lang|ja|助[/tpl] has a kun'yomi reading of suke but an on'yomi reading of jo; likewise, in the Italian name of Giorno Giovanna, "Gio" is pronounced very similar to [tpl]nihongo3||ジョ|jo[/tpl].

==Supernatural powers==

The first supernatural item introduced in Part 1 Phantom Blood is the [tpl]nihongo4|Stone Mask|石仮面|Ishikamen[/tpl], an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that seems to react with blood. It is soon revealed that when it is worn by someone and blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spines that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, hitting accupuncture points that transforms them into an immortal [tpl]nihongo4|Vampire|吸血鬼|Kyūketsuki[/tpl]. These Vampires drain people of their blood through their fangs or their pointed fingernails, and seemingly have full control of their bodies, able to heal from most injuries and even make it so they can combine other creatures into abominations, such as Dio Brando's tendency to put human heads on animal bodies. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, as the vampirism is held in the brain, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The [tpl]nihongo4|Hamon|波紋||lit. "Ripple"[/tpl] is introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy into other kinds of energy via proper breathing, and it is effective in combating Vampires as experienced Hamon users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combatting the Vampires' [tpl]nihongo4|Zombies|屍生人（ゾンビ）|Zonbi|also referred to as [tpl]nihongo4|"Undead"|亡者（アンデッド）|Andeddo[/tpl][/tpl], which Vampires can create by imparting some of their vampiric essence into the once living or even the long deceased.
Part 2 Battle Tendency introduces the [tpl]nihongo4|Pillar Men|柱の男|Hashira no Otoko[/tpl], an ancient race of apex predators and progenitors to the Vampires as one of their members created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Hamon. Their remaining members, as the rest were slaughterd for trying to prevent them from raising to power, seek out the [tpl]nihongo4|Red Stone of Aja|エイジャの赤石|Eija no Sekiseki[/tpl], a naturally occurring gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision, as its power is able to perfect the transformation into a truly immortal being with control over all life's forces. However, only a flawless stone can produce these results, and it is this reason that the Hamon users protect the flawless Super Aja so it can never fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.
Part 3 Stardust Crusaders begins by introducing the supernatural power of [tpl]nihongo4|Stands|スタンド|Sutando[/tpl], so named because the semi-physical manifestation of the user's psychic powers resembles a spiritual familiar standing next to them. When first presented, Joseph Joestar refers to it as a [tpl]nihongo4|"Ghostly Hamon"|幽波紋（スタンド）|Sutando|but without furigana it would be pronounced yū hamon[/tpl]; it could conjecturally be said to be a semi-physical manifestation of one's Hamon powers. The exact requirements for a person to obtain a Stand are unclear, although the series hints that it can be linked to bloodline, rigorous spiritual and/or Hamon training, and/or exceptionally strong willpower and/or desire. A Stand may never manifest itself in one's life until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors. However, not everyone able to manifest a Stand has the ability to control it; despite her father Joseph Joestar and her son Jotaro Kujo being powerful Stand users, Holy Kujo, due to her lack of physical strength, resolve, and her peaceful nature, is brought to the brink of death by her Stand, which saps away her life in an attempt to manifest itself. Generally, destroying a Stand will result in the death of its user. Likewise, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat. There are instances of automatic Stands that act on the user's subconscious level until recognized, and there are rare cases of Stands that exist after the user's death, becoming nigh unstoppable and unpredictable without anyone controlling it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them, or speak to them.
A Stand can also be brought forth after one is pierced by the [tpl]nihongo4|Bow and Arrow|弓と矢|Yumi to Ya[/tpl], forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. The Bow and Arrow was hinted at in Part 3 and retroactively introduced in Part 4 Diamond Is Unbreakable; they were expanded upon in Part 5 Vento Aureo as being discovered on an archaeological dig by the villain Diavolo, who sold five Arrows to Enya the Hag of Part 3 and kept one for himself. However, using the Arrows is often a gamble, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time; the arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them. The Arrows also have the ability to make a Stand even more powerful if its user is hit with the Arrow; such an event causes the Stand of Part 4's Yoshikage Kira to develop a near unstoppable ability. However, if a Stand is struck by an Arrow, the Stand's powers are increased to such a limitless extent that it becomes a brand new [tpl]nihongo4|"Requiem"|レクイエム（鎮魂歌）|Rekuiemu[/tpl] Stand, achieving limitless powers.
In Part 5 there are examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci of Part 6 Stone Ocean is able to produce artificial Stand users with his own, by stealing others' Stands and transforming them into [tpl]nihongo4|Discs|ディスク|Disuku[/tpl] and then "inserting" them into regular people. It is unclear as to whether or not these artificial Stand users were capable of having Stands of their own, but Enrico does claim that only certain individuals are qualified to have Stand Discs inserted. Part 6 also features the [tpl]nihongo4|Bones of DIO|DIOの骨|DIO no Hone[/tpl] which are instrumental in Pucci's [tpl]nihongo4|Way to Heaven|天国へ行く方法|Tengoku e Iku Hōhō[/tpl]. It first absorbs the souls of 36 sinners and transforms into the strange Green Baby, and grants Pucci a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to his Way to Heaven and an even more powerful time and reality warping Stand. His powers and his ultimate defeat creates a new universe that rewrites all of the rules of reality.
Part 7 Steel Ball Run introduces the [tpl]nihongo4|Rotation|回転|Kaiten[/tpl], a technique that incorporates the golden ratio and the [tpl]nihongo4|golden rectangle|黄金長方形|ōgon chōhōkei[/tpl] into a means of manipulating the Magnus effect to the user's benefit. It is used by the Neapolitan Zeppeli family as physicians to treat patients, but its true power lies in its destructive effects which the Zeppelis also use in their secret role as executioners. Gyro Zeppeli in particular uses specially made [tpl]nihongo4|Steel Balls|鉄球|Tekkyū[/tpl] to impart the Rotation, with successful strikes causing the target's skin and muscles to contort and twist with the Rotation's energies. Johnny Joestar later learns to incorporate the Rotation through the powers of his Stand, increasing its power exponentially through new lessons and discoveries. An alternate version of the Rotation used by the Neapolitan Royal Guard uses specially made Steel Balls called [tpl]nihongo4|Wrecking Balls|レッキング・ボール（壊れゆく鉄球）|Rekkingu Bōru (Kowareyuku Tekkyū)[/tpl], which have smaller [tpl]nihongo4|Satellite|衛星|Eisei[/tpl] balls embedded in it that are able to impart the Rotation and may cause temporary hemispatial neglect if successfully struck. The Rotation's most powerful form incorporates the golden rectangle perfectly into the [tpl]nihongo4|Golden Rotation|黄金の回転|Ōgon no Kaiten[/tpl], producing a Rotation that is able to transcend dimensional walls and even produce a Stand manifestation. Such an effect can only be attained after achieving a certain speed on horseback and using the horse to extend control over the golden rectangle.
Also introduced in Part 7 is the [tpl]nihongo4|Saint's Corpse|聖人の遺体|Seijin no Itai[/tpl], body parts of a deceased man (hinted to be Jesus Christ) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand, although it may fuse to such an extent that the Stand becomes a permanent part of the person. There is a legend within the fiction that if someone were to gather all of the Corpse's parts, he would be able to rule the world. Also shown is the [tpl]nihongo4|Devil's Palm|悪魔の手のひら|Akuma no Tenohira[/tpl], a geographic place that seems to move on its own accord and tests those who come across it. If the person survives, he or she is granted a Stand.
Part 8 JoJolion introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the [tpl]nihongo4|Wall Eyes|壁の目|Kabe no Me[/tpl], strange fault-like structures that have risen from the ground following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. Three (Josuke Higashikata, Yasuho Hirose, and Joshu Higashikata) have all received painful bite marks from their proximity to the Wall Eyes, and the three of them have developed Stands as of the 21st chapter. Other users of Stands have either fallen into the faults (as with Daiya Higashikata) or grown up in an area where the Wall Eye has erupted later in their life (Ojiro Sasame).

==Development==

For JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular. As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but then colors completely impossible colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in JoJo resulting in him going to the Kappa River in Tōno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept.[tpl]cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=translanted and adapted by William Flanagan |title=The Official xxxHOLiC Guide |publisher=Del Rey Manga |year=2009|location=New York |pages=154–163 |isbn=978-0-345-51000-6[/tpl]

==Media==

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure began serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump in its combined issue #1-2 of 1987, which was released on December 2, 1986. The chapters are collected and published into tankōbon volumes by Shueisha, with the first released on August 10, 1987.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-851126-3|title=ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 1|trans_title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Volume 1|publisher=Shueisha|accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl] The series is broken into arcs or parts, each of which stars a descendant of the Joestar family. During Part 5, which takes place in Italy, the series' title was written in Italian as Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio. After volume 63, each parts' tankōbon have started the number count back at one; see Stone Ocean, Steel Ball Run and JoJolion. The series was switched to the magazine Ultra Jump in 2004, during Steel Ball Run, with the chapters published monthly. JoJolion, the current arc, began on May 19, 2011. In 2012, the first three Parts of the series were digitally colored and released as digital downloads for smartphones and tablet computers. A physical version of this re-release will be collected under the title [tpl]nihongo4|JoJonium|ジョジョニウム|Jojoniumu[/tpl] beginning December 4, 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://natalie.mu/comic/news/99692 |title=コミックナタリー - 「ジョジョ」カラーページを完全再現した「JoJonium」刊行 |publisher=Natalie.mu |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl]
In the early 1990s Viz Media had planned to release an English-language version of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in North America as "The Strange Adventures of Jojo", evident by an ad in their newsletter at the time, Viz-In.[tpl]cite web |title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2010-12-23 |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=2012-04-15[/tpl] It is suspected the plans were canned after Baoh, another series by Hirohiko Araki, sold poorly. The series was brought up again for talks in 2002, for release as individual monthly chapters. However by this time, that publication format for manga was on its way-out in North America.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure finally received a North American release in 2005, in the graphic novel format, similar to its Japanese tankōbon. However, it is only of the series' third part, Stardust Crusaders, which is the most popular and well-known. Originally published bimonthly, the volumes were later reduced to a quarterly release. The first volume was released on November 8, 2005 and the last on December 7, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?product_id=4659|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure English Volume 1|publisher=Viz Media|accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?product_id=8592|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure English Volume 16|publisher=Viz Media|accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl] Viz's release changed the names of several characters due to copyright concerns and included some censorship, scenes of animal violence were redrawn by Araki himself. In 2013, Viz revealed that they plan to release the third part digitally and expressed interest in further material of the series, however, they explained the difficulties due to the numerous references to real-life musicians and fashion designers.[tpl]cite web |title=Viz Talks "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure" Digital Distribution Plans and Difficulties |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/09/14-1/viz-talks-jojos-bizarre-adventure-digital-distribution-plans-and-difficulties |work=Crunchyroll |date=2013-09-14 |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has also seen domestic releases in Italy by Star Comics,[tpl]cite web |title=Phantom blood.

===Novels===

Several light novels based on the JoJo series have been written, each by a different author, but all including illustrations by Hirohiko Araki. The first, based on Part 3, was simply titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, released on November 4, 1993 and written by Mayori Sekijima and Hiroshi Yamaguchi.[tpl]cite web |title=ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 (JUMP j BOOKS) |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/ジョジョの奇妙な冒険-JUMP-BOOKS-荒木-飛呂彦/dp/4087030156/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t |language=Japanese |work=Amazon.co.jp |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl] [tpl]nihongo4|Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio II: Golden Heart/Golden Ring|ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 II ゴールデンハート/ゴールデンリング|JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Tsū Gōruden Hāto/Gōruden Ringu[/tpl] written by Gichi Ōtsuka and Miya Shōtarō, was released on May 28, 2001 and based on Part 5.

===Art books===

Araki has released multiple books containing original artwork he has produced for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. JoJo6251 was released in 1993 and features artwork, story details, and behind the scenes information for Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency, Stardust Crusaders, and Diamond Is Unbreakable. This was followed in 2000 by JOJO A-GO!GO! which features original artwork from Vento Aureo and Stone Ocean. In 2013, he released JoJoveller, a multimedia set that includes a book featuring original artwork for Stone Ocean, Steel Ball Run, and JoJolion; a book detailing the history of the publications; and a book detailing every Stand featured since Stardust Crusaders. The limited edition has two Blu-rays showing the 25th anniversary art exhibition in Tokyo and a behind-the-scenes look at Araki's creative process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://natalie.mu/comic/news/86939 |title=コミックナタリー - ジョジョ画集「JOJOVELLER」限定版は書籍3冊とBD2枚 |publisher=Natalie.mu |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/anime_news/AJ201304080064|title=ANIME NEWS: Orders for limited edition 'JoJo' art book being accepted|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=2013-04-08|accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl]

===Video games===

Several video games based on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure have been created. The first was a titular role-playing video game, based on the third story arc, which was released in 1993 for the Super Famicom. A fighting game for the arcade was also adapted from the third arc by Capcom in 1998, and also titled simply JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (released as JoJo's Venture in the west), with an updated version retitled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future released later that year. The arcade game was ported to both the PlayStation and Dreamcast in 1999, and a high-definition version was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[tpl]cite web |title=1st Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Fighting Game Remade in HD |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-07-14/1st-jojo-bizarre-adventure-fighting-game-remade-in-hd |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=2012-07-15[/tpl] These fighting games were the first pieces of JoJo related media released in North America, exposing the characters to many western players. A third Capcom game was based on Part 5, titled Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio: Vento Aureo and released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. This game was scheduled for release in Europe as Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio, but this did not come through because of the heavy references to band names, and Araki is unwilling to compromise in the change of names to avoid lawsuits. Capcom originally intended to release the game in the United States, even showing a playable version at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo, but no further plans or official release date has been announced since then.
A tie-in with the theatrical release, a game by Bandai, titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood, was released on October 26, 2006, for the PlayStation 2. The story is based on the first arc and features action/adventure gameplay, similar to Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio: Vento Aureo. Araki has personally checked the quality of the game and its faithfulness to the original. The release of the game coincided with the release of the theatrical film and the 25th anniversary of Hirohiko Araki's manga career. The game itself includes a bonus disc celebrating 20 years of the JoJo franchise.
At a July 5, 2012 press conference celebrating the 25th anniversary of JoJo, Araki himself announced JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle, produced by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai Namco Games. The fighting game was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 and is currently set for international releases in 2014.
Before the first JoJo's Bizarre Adventure game was released, Bandai released a Weekly Shōnen Jump crossover adventure game titled Famicom Jump: Hero Retsuden in 1989. Joseph Joestar from the second arc is one of the playable characters, while Santana and Speedwagon made cameo appearances. Its sequel Famicom Jump II: The Strongest Seven, released in 1991, features Jotaro as a selectable character. Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin and Polnareff also appear in this game. Both games were available on the Famicom. Characters from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure were also featured in the 2005 Nintendo DS Weekly Shōnen Jump crossover game Jump Super Stars and its sequel Jump Ultimate Stars, including Jotaro Kujo and Dio Brando as playable characters. The magazine's 2014 crossover game, J-Stars Victory Vs, features both Jonathan and Joseph Joestar as playable characters.[tpl]cite web|title=Jojo's, Nube characters join J-Stars Victory Vs.

===Controversy===

In May 2008, both Shueisha and studio A.P.P.P. halted manga/OVA shipments of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after a complaint had been launched against them from Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an.[tpl]cite web |title=Jojo's Anime, Manga Sales Halted Due to Islamic Images |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-22/jojo-anime-manga-sales-halted-due-to-islamic-images |work=Anime News Network |accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques for later printings of the series. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009. Jason Thompson later included Shueisha's changes to the manga in the list of "The Greatest Censorship Fails" in manga.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-01-03|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - The Greatest Censorship Fails|publisher=Anime News Network|date=2013-01-03|accessdate=2013-02-02[/tpl]

From September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur "Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, JoJo's creator and the fashion magazine Spur.
