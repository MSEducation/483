Copper Peak is a ski flying hill located in Ironwood, Michigan, United States. Built in 1970 it remains the only ski flying facility in the Western Hemisphere. In 1994 a K-spot on Copper Peak was at [tpl]convert|145|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl], allowing jumps up to [tpl]convert|158|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl]. Although there have been no flights at Copper Peak since 1994, there has been some investment in improving the facility to meet the standards of the International Ski Federation (FIS).
Ski flying at Copper Peak involves going much greater distances than normal Ski Jumping.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/09/bad_psotcards_copper_peak_oper.html |first1=Dave |last1=Murray |title=Bad postcards: Copper Peak operators promise their ski flying hill is more impressive than card depicts |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012 |work= The Grand Rapids Press |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68QXdCiFc |archivedate= June 14, 2012 |oclc= 975013[/tpl]

==History==

Between 1970 and 1994 there were ten competitions in the hill.[tpl]cite news |url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=149 |title= Michigan's long history of ski jumping |first1= Vivian M. |last1= Baulch |work= The Detroit News |date=February 1, 2002 |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |issn= 1055-2715[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The hill record is [tpl]convert|158|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl], set by Mathias Wallner and Werner Schuster (both Austria) on January 22, 1994, and January 23, 1994, respectively. The hill was expanded in the 1980s, but the profile is still outdated compared to current standards.
From summer to fall, the public can visit an observation platform 18 stories up the tower of the "highest man-made ski flying hill in the world". Open on weekends, it presents a view promoted as "the most awesome vista in the Midwest". Clear days give a northeasterly view of the Porcupine Mountains with the Apostle Islands [tpl]convert|35|mi|km[/tpl] to the west. Exceptionally clear days—caused by a Canadian high pressure system moving in—permit a view [tpl]convert|85|mi|km[/tpl] across Lake Superior to Isle Royale and Grand Marais, Minnesota.[tpl]cite book |last1= Hunt |first= Mary |last2= Hunt |first2= Don |year= 2009 |chapterurl= http://hunts-upguide.com/bessemer_copper_peak_ski_flying_hill.html |chapter= Bessemer: Copper Peak Ski Flying Hill |title=Hunts' Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |location= Albion, MI |publisher= Midwestern Guides |accessdate= February 12, 2011[/tpl]

==Renovation==

In 2012 the hill was under reconstruction. They have completed reprofiling the landing zone angle with filling the soil from 41° to 36°. New K-point will be at [tpl]convert|170|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl], new HS"HS" means Hill Size, and it is a unit of measurement (and a rating system) of the size of each hill (jump size) in Ski Jumping.

They have already finished digging a large [tpl]convert|2,830|m3|ft3|adj=on|sp=us[/tpl] collection pond at the bottom of the hill and a [tpl]convert|710|m3|ft3|sp=us|adj=on[/tpl] at the top of the hill from which they intend to make snow.
Currently they are installing safety fence along the landing slope and plans to be completed in the latter half of 2012. Installing the pipes, pipes etc. will commence in summer 2012.[tpl]update after|2012|12|31[/tpl] They also plan to build new judges tower.
The USA Ski Jumping organization announced that an exhibition ski flying event would take place at Copper Peak, February 28 to March 2, 2014,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usaskijumping.org/news/post/ski-flyers-to-soar-again-at-copper-peak-in-2014 |first1=Pete |last1=Graves |title=Ski Flyers to Soar Again at Copper Peak in 2014 |date=June 7, 2013 |accessdate=November 17, 2013 |publisher= USA Ski Jumping[/tpl] but this event has been cancelled. Instead, the Copper Peak board announced that Copper Peak will be converted to a ski jumping hill, with competitions beginning in 2015 or 2016. The plan is to hold ski jumping in the summer as well as the winter which would make Copper peak the largest summer ski jumping hill in the world.[tpl]cite news |first= Andrew |last= Krueger |date= December 9, 2013 |url= http://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/page/content.detail/id/543616/Copper-Peak-looks-for-comeback-to-world-stage.html?nav=5002 |title= Copper Peak looks for comeback to world stage |work= The Daily News |location= Iron Mountain, MI [/tpl]
