====Analog shutdown controversy====

On July 24, 2011, this station gained local attention when it played the song Time to Say Goodbye repeatedly after analog broadcasts ended at noon. The MIC usually does not allow vocal music to be played on most stations' analog shutdown warnings. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H080E-IrQtM
