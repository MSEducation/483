Babylon and On is a 1987 album by the British New Wave group Squeeze. It is the band's seventh album, and opens with their biggest U.S. hit, "Hourglass." Eric "ET" Thorngren produced the LP. Former Soft Boy Andy Metcalfe made his only appearance as an official member of Squeeze on this album. He would end up writing again with Tilbrook during Tilbrook's solo years.
"Hourglass" became an unexpected U.S. hithttp://www.allmusic.com/album/babylon-and-on-mw0000195811/awards for the band, reaching #15 on the Billboard Hot 100, which Chris Difford attributed to the video for the song as much as the song itself. "I would think that the video has had a lot to do with it.  It’s been played a lot, and everybody you speak to compliments you on it.  When you meet fans after gigs, they say, “Your video’s great.”  They don’t say, “Your album’s great.”  So it’s the first thing they think of."  Bud Scoppa with Darryl Morden Music Connection, January 25, 1988
