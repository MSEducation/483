[[Reflexive operator algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Operator theory, Operator algebras, Invariant subspaces

In functional analysis, a reflexive operator algebra A is an operator algebra that has enough invariant subspaces to characterize it. Formally, A is reflexive if it is equal to the algebra of bounded operators which leave invariant each subspace left invariant by every operator in A. 
This should not be confused with a reflexive space.

==Examples==

Nest algebras are examples of reflexive operator algebras. In finite dimensions, these are simply algebras of all matrices of a given size whose nonzero entries lie in an upper-triangular pattern.
In fact if we fix any pattern of entries in an n by n matrix containing the diagonal, then the set of all n by n matrices whose nonzero entries lie in this pattern forms a reflexive algebra. 
An example of an algebra which is not reflexive is the set of 2 by 2 matrices
This algebra is smaller than the Nest algebra
but has the same invariant subspaces, so it is not reflexive.
If T is a fixed n by n matrix then the set of all polynomials in T and the identity operator forms a unital operator algebra. A theorem of Deddens and Fillmore states that this algebra is reflexive if and only if the largest two blocks in the Jordan normal form of T differ in size by at most one. For example, the algebra
which is equal to the set of all polynomials in
and the identity is reflexive.

==Hyper-reflexivity==

We note that for any T in B(H) the following inequality is satisfied:
In the case of a reflexive algebra of matrices with nonzero entries specified by a given pattern, the problem of finding the distance constant can be rephrased as a matrix-filling problem: if we fill the entries in the complement of the pattern with arbitrary entries, what choice of entries in the pattern gives the smallest operator norm?
