[[Dean of Llandaff]]

CATEGORIES: Church in Wales deans, Deans of Llandaff

Dean of Llandaff is the title given to the head of the chapter of Llandaff Cathedral, which is located in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales.  It is not an ancient office – the head of the chapter was historically the Archdeacon who appears in this role in the Liber Landavensis and in the Chapter Acts preserved in the Glamorgan Records Office – but the office of a separate Dean was established by act of parliament in 1843. A century later the Deanery was merged with the Vicarage of Llandaff. The Chapter forfeited its legal rights on Disestablishment in 1920. The previous Dean was Janet Henderson.
