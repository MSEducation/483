==Critical reception==

PopMatters journalist J.C. Macek III wrote "Tres Cabrones (Spanish for "Three Bastards") is, by its very nature, a mixture of classic and current Melvins and the current three-man lineup (at least current for this release) are adept at nailing each era and facet of the band (from the classic sludge to the artistic experimental rock to the psychedelic lyrics to the absolutely comical side they've always embraced)."
