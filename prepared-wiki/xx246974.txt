[[Dravya (Jainism)]]

CATEGORIES: Atomism, Jain philosophical concepts, Religious cosmologies

According to Jain cosmology, the universe is made up of six dravya (substances): sentient beings or souls (jīva), non-sentient substance or matter (pudgala), principle of motion (dharma), the principle of rest (adharma), space (ākāśa) and time (kāla).Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 1 of  IntroductionGrimes, John (1996). Pp.118–119 The latter five are united as the ajiva (the non-living). As per the Sanskrit etymology, dravya means substances or entity, but it may also mean real or fundamental categories.

==Jiva (living entity)==

According to Jain philosophy, this universe consists of infinite jivas or souls that are uncreated and always existing. There are two main categories of souls: unliberated mundane embodied souls that are still subject to transmigration and rebirths in this  samsara  due to karmic bondage and the liberated souls that are free from birth and death. All souls are intrinsically pure but are found in bondage with karma since beginningless time. A soul has to make efforts to eradicate the karmas attain its true and pure form.
10th-century Jain monk Nemichandra describes the soul in Dravyasamgraha:Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p. 4[tpl]quote|The sentient substance (soul) is characterized by the function of understanding, is incorporeal, performs actions (doer), is co-extensive with its own body. It is the enjoyer (of its actions), located in the world of rebirth (samsara) (or) emancipated  (moksa)  (and) has the intrinsic movement upwards.| Dravyasamgraha—2[/tpl]
Acaranga Sutra describes a pure soul as:Jacobi, Hermann (1884) verse 197
The qualities of the soul are cetana (consciousness) and upyoga (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state and appearing of another state and these are merely the modes of the soul. Thus Jiva with its attributes and modes, roaming in samsara (universe), may lose its particular form and assume a new one. Again this form may be lost and the original acquired.Nayanar, Prof. A. Chakravarti (2005). verses 16–21

==Ajiva (five non-living entities)==

==Astikaya==

Out of the six dravyas, five except time have been described as astikayas, that is, extensions or conglomerates. Since like conglomerates, they have numerous space points, they are described as astikaya. There are innumerable space points in the sentient substance and in the media of motion and rest, and infinite ones in space; in matter they are threefold (i.e. numerable, innumerable and infinite). Time has only one; therefore it is not a conglomerate.Acarya Nemicandra; Nalini Balbir (2010) p.12–13 Hence the corresponding conglomerates or extensions are called—jivastikaya (soul extension or conglomerate), pudgalastikaya (matter conglomerate), dharmastikaya (motion conglomerate), adharmastikaya (rest conglomerate) and akastikaya (space conglomerates). Together they are called pancastikaya or the five astikayas.J. C. Sikdar (2001) p. 1107

==Attributes of Dravya==

These substances have some common attributes or gunas such as:Acarya Nemicandra; J. L. Jaini (1927) p. 4 (of introduction)
There are some specific attributes that distinguish the dravyas from each other:
