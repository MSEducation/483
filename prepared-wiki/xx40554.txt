Assault weapon is a political and legal term that refers to different types of firearms, and that has differing meanings, usages and purposes. Whether or not assault weapons should be legally restricted more than other firearms, how they should be defined, and even whether or not the term "assault weapon" should be used at all, are questions subject to considerable debate.[tpl]cite news |title=Even Defining 'Assault Rifles' Is Complicated |author=Goode, Erica |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/even-defining-assault-weapons-is-complicated.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 18, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=What Is an Assault Weapon? |author=Lallanilla, Marc |url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/17/what-is-assault-weapon/ |work=Fox News |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Assault Weapons: What Are They, and Should They Be Banned? |author=Richman, Josh |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22396050/assault-weapons-what-are-they-and-should-they |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Is It Fair to Call Them 'Assault Weapons'? |author=Blake, Aaron |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/17/is-it-fair-to-call-them-assault-weapons/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Media Myths on 'Assault Weapons' and 'Semiautomatic Firearms' |author=Carney, Timothy P. |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/media-myths-on-assault-weapons-and-semiautomatic-firearms/article/2516156 |newspaper=Washington Examiner |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=January 3, 2013[/tpl] 
In discussions about firearms laws and politics in the U.S., assault weapon definitions usually include semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine and one or more cosmetic, ergonomic, or safety features, such as a flash suppressor,  pistol grip, or barrel shroud, respectively. Semi-automatic firearms fire and reload only one bullet (round) per trigger pull.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mantel |first=Barbara |date=March 8, 2013 |title=Gun Control |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Gun-Control-v23-10.html |journal=CQ Researcher |publisher=CQ Press |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=233-256 |doi= |accessdate=December 3, 2013[/tpl] Assault weapon definitions include rifles, pistols and shotguns.[tpl]cite news |last=Levs |first=Josh |date=January 31, 2013 |title=Loaded language poisons gun debate |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/politics/gun-language/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 31, 2013 [/tpl] Some firearms are specified by name.

The exact definition of the term in this context varies among each of the various jurisdictions limiting or prohibiting assault weapon manufacture, importation, sale, or possession, and legislative attempts are often made to change the definitions.  Governing and defining laws include the now defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3355enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr3355enr.pdf |title=Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, H.R.3355 |author=103rd Congress |year=1994 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=201–215 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl] At that time, the U.S. Justice Department said, "In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use." State and local laws, sometimes modeled after the expired federal law, also define the term.
It has been asserted that the term is a media invention or a term that was intended by gun control activists to foster confusion with the public over differences between full automatic and semi-automatic firearms, while others argue that the term was promulgated by the firearms industry itself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/hosesix.htm |title=Bullet Hoses: Semiautomatic Assault Weapons—What Are They?

The term "assault weapon" is sometimes conflated with the term "assault rifle" which refers only to military rifles capable of switching between semi-automatic and fully automatic fire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39165/assault-rifle |title="Assault rifle." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Jul. 2010 |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl]  In the U.S., fully automatic firearms are regulated by laws such as the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA), which requires that they be registered and taxed, and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, as well as by state and local laws.
The term "assault weapon" is used to refer to anti-tank or anti-material explosive based weapons that are used by the military, such as the Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) portable rocket launcher.

==Definitions and usage==

The term "assault weapon" refers primarily but not exclusively to semi-automatic firearms that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess certain features.[tpl]cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Banning_Assault_Weapons_A_Legal_Primer_8.05_entire.pdf| title=Banning Assault Weapons: A Legal Primer for State and Local Action |publisher=Legal Community Against Violence |date=April 2004 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |quote=Assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms designed with military features to allow rapid and accurate spray firing.[/tpl] (Semi-automatic firearms, when fired, automatically extract the spent cartridge casing and load the next cartridge into the chamber, ready to fire again.

===History of terminology===

During World War II, Adolf Hitler personally chose the name "Sturmgewehr" (literally, "storm rifle", translated in English as "assault rifle") to describe the first (the Sturmgewehr 44) of a new class of small arm, which combined the characteristics of a carbine, submachine gun and automatic rifle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945, War Department |publisher=Lonesentry.com |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2011[/tpl]  A half-decade earlier the propaganda-friendly term "Sturmgeschütz" ("storm gun") was similarly invented and applied to certain armored military vehicles, turretless tank chassis mounting artillery intended for direct fire support. Otherwise, in English, use of the term "assault weapon" was restricted, prior to the 1980s, to naming certain minor military weapons systems, for example, the Rifleman's Assault Weapon, an American grenade launcher developed in 1977 for use with the M16 assault rifle.Jane's Infantry Weapons 1995–96, p. 219.
In 1985, Art Agnos introduced a bill in the California State Assembly seeking to place restrictions on semi-automatic firearms capable of using detachable magazines of 20 rounds or more.[tpl]cite journal|title=California: gun control's primary target.|journal=Guns & Ammo Magazine|date=November 1, 1985[/tpl] In his bill, AB 1509, these guns were categorized as "assault firearms". Speaking to the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Agnos said, "The only use for assault weapons is to shoot people."[tpl]cite news |last=Ingram |first=Carl |title=Restricting of Assault-Type Guns Okd by Assembly Unit |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/news/mn-27984_1_machine-guns |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 9, 1985[/tpl] The measure did not pass when it came up for a vote.
Popularization of the term "assault weapon" is attributed by many to the 1988 book "Assault Weapons and Accessories in America", written by gun-control activist Josh Sugarmann, and to subsequent public reaction to the January 1989 Cleveland School massacre in Stockton, CA.[tpl]cite news |title=Is it fair to call them ‘assault weapons’? |author=Blake, Aaron |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/17/is-it-fair-to-call-them-assault-weapons/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 30, 2013 |quote=The term 'assault weapon' became widely used starting the late 1980s.

===Defunct U.S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban===

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994, more commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, expired in 2004.  It banned the manufacture or importation of certain semi-automatic firearms that it defined as "semiautomatic assault weapons," commonly known as assault weapons.  Any firearms so defined that were already possessed at the time the law took effect were grandfathered in, and could be legally owned or transferred.  Another aspect of the law banned the manufacture or importation of magazines that could hold more than ten rounds of ammunition, with existing magazines grandfathered in as legal.
The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 defined certain firearms as assault weapons based on the features they possessed.  This included semi-automatic rifles with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a flash suppressor or threaded barrel, a bayonet mount, or a muzzle-mounted grenade launcher.  It included semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, or an unloaded weight of 50 ounces or more. Additionally defined as assault weapons were semi-automatic shotguns with a rotating cylinder, or with at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a detachable magazine, or a fixed magazine that can hold more than five rounds.[tpl]cite news |last=Koerner |first=Brendan |date=September 16, 2004 |title=What Is an Assault Weapon?

The ban also prohibited 19 specifically named models of firearms, as well as copies of those guns.  These included the AK-47, Uzi, Galil, AR-15, FN FAL, MAC-10, Steyr AUG, TEC-9, and Armsel Striker.

===Relation to assault rifles===

A common mistake stems from the conflation of the term "assault weapon" with the term "assault rifle", which refers to military rifles having selective fire capability.  Unlike assault rifles, semi-automatic firearms fire one round each time the trigger is pulled; the spent cartridge case is ejected and another cartridge is loaded into the chamber, without the manual operation of a bolt handle, a lever, or a sliding handgrip.  In contrast, a selective fire rifle may have the ability to fire in fully automatic mode, in which the rifle will repeatedly fire rounds in rapid succession with the trigger pulled once and held back, or fire in burst mode, in which two or three rounds will be fired as a burst each time the trigger is pulled, or fire in both fully automatic and burst modes.
Civilian ownership of assault rifles or any other full-automatic firearm is tightly regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives under the National Firearms Act of 1934 as amended by Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968.  Unlike "assault rifle", "assault weapon" has no consistent definition across all legal jurisdictions in the United States and is subject to varying definitions for varying purposes, including definitions that include common non-military firearms.  In this respect, it is primarily a legal term, with various statutory definitions in local, state, and federal laws that define them by a set of characteristics they possess, sometimes described as military-style cosmetic features.  Using lists of cosmetic features to define assault weapons was first codified by the language of the expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

==Political and legislative issues==

Whether or not the term "assault weapon" should be used at all and, if so, how the term should be defined and whether firearms defined as assault weapons should be legally restricted more than other firearms are questions subject to considerable debate as part of the arguments of gun politics in the United States.
