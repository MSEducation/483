[[Aspidochirotida]]

CATEGORIES: Aspidochirotida, Holothuroidea

Aspidochirotida is an order of sea cucumbers. They are distinguished from other sea cucumbers by the presence of flattened, often leaf-like tentacles, but without the other large appendages found in the related order Elasipodida. They do not have introvert or retractor muscles.An illustrated key to the sea cucumbers of the South Atlantic Bight Retrieved 2012-02-12. The tube feet often form a clearly demarcated sole. They have 15-30 shield-shaped retractile tentacles surrounding their mouths. The body wall is thick and leathery and contains ossicles, including some table-shaped ones. They have respiratory trees for gas exchange. The mesentery of the posterior loop of their gut is attached to the right ventral interradius. The muscles that run longitudinally down the body are arranged into five double bands. They can shoot out sticky white threads known as cuvierian tubes from their cloacas in order to distract or entangle predators. They are usually found in exposed shallow-water environments.Order Aspidochirotida Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-02-10.
