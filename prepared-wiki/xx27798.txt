Sporting's rivals, F.C. Porto, quickly hired Robson, with Mourinho appointed as his assistant manager. Living in the same apartment block at the time was another future Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager, the young André Villas-Boas, who, aged 16, introduced himself to Robson. Robson subsequently appointed Villas-Boas to work in the Porto observation department and helped him gain his UEFA 'C' coaching badge in Scotland, despite him technically being ineligible as he was aged 17.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/130/645/9/index.html |title=Novice delighting in the Dragao dugout |publisher=FIFA.com |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1864227.html |work=The Independent |publisher = Highbeam|title=Crucial role of boy scout who is Mourinho's 'eyes and ears' |date=11 July 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2013[/tpl] Porto were in a poor state when Robson arrived and the average attendance had dwindled to 10,000.[ref]
