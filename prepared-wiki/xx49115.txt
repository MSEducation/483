Other tall growing heaths, including the Portugal Heath (Erica lusitanica) and channel heath (Erica canaliculata) may also sometimes be called tree heath.

==Uses==

The wood, known as briar root or French bruy√®re, is an extremely hard and heat-resistant wood used for making smoking pipes.
The football-sized tubers are harvested at the age of 30 to 60 years. They are cooked for several hours, after which they are dried for several months before they are further processed. The wood is light brown to reddish brown, often beautifully textured, very hard, heat-resistant and does not affect the aroma of pipe tobacco smoke .
The wood is also used for making jewellery and knife handles.
