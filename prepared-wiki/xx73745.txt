Bathos ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s|,_|-|θ|oʊ|s[/tpl]; Greek βάθος, meaning "depth") is an abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect.  While often unintended, bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect.[tpl]cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&pg=PA24|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24[/tpl]  If bathos is overt, it may be described as Burlesque or mock-heroic. It should not be confused with pathos, a mode of persuasion within the discipline of rhetoric, intended to arouse emotions of sympathy and pity.
