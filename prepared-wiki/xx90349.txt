He attended Our Lady of Lourdes Grade School and Saint Joseph's Preparatory School.[tpl]cite web|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Philadelphia native Jim McKay dies at 86|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=June 8, 2008|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20080608_Philadelphia_native_Jim_McKay_dies_at_86.html|accessdate=2008-06-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611054358/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/20080608_Philadelphia_native_Jim_McKay_dies_at_86.html  |archivedate = 2008-06-11[/tpl] At the age of 14 his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended Loyola Blakefield high school.

===Television===

In 1947, McKay gave up his job as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun newspapers to join that same organization's new TV station WMAR-TV. His was the first voice ever heard on television in Baltimore, and he remained with the station until joining CBS in New York in 1950 as host of a variety show, called The Real McKay, which necessitated the changing of his on-air surname. Through the 1950s, sports commentary became more and more his primary assignment for CBS. In 1956-57 McKay teamed with Chris Schenkel to call CBS telecasts of New York Giants football. He was originally tabbed to be the lead broadcaster of the network's coverage of the 1960 Winter Olympics, but had to be replaced by Walter Cronkite after suffering a mental breakdown. McKay recovered in time to host the 1960 Summer Olympics from the CBS Television studio in Grand Central Terminal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/sports/19sandomir.html?ref=sports&pagewanted=print|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Amid Blizzard, Cronkite Helped Make Sports History|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2009[/tpl] He had a six-episode stint as host of the game show Make the Connection on NBC in 1955.
He moved on to ABC and was the host of ABC's influential Wide World of Sports for 37 years.
While covering the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics for ABC, McKay took on the job of reporting the events live on his only scheduled day off during the Games, substituting for Chris Schenkel.[tpl]cite web|last=Hiestand|first=Michael|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2008-06-08-mckay_N.htm|title=Jim McKay's wide world spanned eras|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2008[/tpl] He was on air for fourteen hours without a break, during a sixteen hour broadcast.Hale, Mark. 5 Questions for Jim McKay. AmericanSportscasterOnline.com. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt of the athletes held hostage, at 3:24 AM German Time, McKay came on the air with this statement:[tpl]cite news|last=Kelly|first=Christopher|url=http://www.statesman.com/life/content/life/stories/travel/01/8MUNICH.html|title=Modern Munich lives with its contradictions|work=Statesman.com|date=7 January 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Abramson|first=Alan|url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2002/writing/over250/over250.enterprise.second11a.html|title=Black September|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=5 September 2002[/tpl]
Although McKay received numerous accolades for his reporting of the Munich hostage crisis (including two Emmy Awards, one for sports and one for news reporting), he stated in a 2003 HBO documentary about his life and career that he was most proud of a telegram he received from Walter Cronkite praising his work he received the day after the massacre.
In 1994, he was the studio host for the FIFA World Cup coverage, the first ever held on American soil. McKay also covered the 2006 FIFA World Cup for ABC. In 2002, ABC "loaned" McKay to NBC to serve as a special correspondent during the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. In 2003, HBO released a documentary by McKay called Jim McKay: My World in My Words, tracing his career. This film outlines McKay's personal and professional accomplishments.

The day-long program has grown to become a major racing event in the state of Maryland, second only to the Preakness Stakes day at Pimlico Race Course. It has spawned more than twenty other similar events at U.S. race tracks such as the Sunshine Millions.
