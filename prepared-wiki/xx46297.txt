Nine Network (commonly known as Channel Nine or simply Nine) is the flagship Australian commercial free-to-air television network with headquarters based in Willoughby, a suburb located on the North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Nine Network is one of five main free-to-air commercial networks in Australia.
The Nine Network is one of the two highest rating television networks in Australia, along with the Seven Network and ahead of Network Ten, ABC and SBS. Nine had historically been the highest rating television network since television's inception in Australia in 1956 for most years up to 2006, although Network Ten had dominated in 1985 and for a number of years in the 1970s. The Nine Network's was overtaken in the ratings in 2007 by its rival, the Seven Network, which has dominated until recently. As a result, Nine's slogan "Still the One" was discontinued.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Unverified claim sentence|date=June 2012[/tpl] Since 2009, the network's slogan has been "Welcome Home". After a few years in slight decline, with a period plagued by mass-sackings, programme cancellations and budget cuts, the Nine Network has experienced a period of stability.

==History==

===Origins===

TCN-9 launched on 16 September 1956. John Godson introduced the station and Bruce Gyngell presented the first programme, This Is Television (so becoming the first person to appear on Australian television). Later that year, GTV-9 in Melbourne commenced transmissions to broadcast the 1956 Summer Olympics, later forming the National Television Network alongside QTQ-9 in Brisbane in 1959 and NWS-9 in Adelaide, the basis of the current Nine Network, in 1959. Before its formation, TCN-9 was then affiliated with HSV-7 (due to the fact that they were both Australia's first television stations, having been opened in 1956),Hey You! Classic Australian Television, 2008 and GTV-9's sister affiliate was ATN-7. By the late 1960s, the network had begun unofficially calling itself "the National Nine Network," and became simply the Nine Network in the early 1980s. It was the first Australian television station to regularly screen programmes in colour.
In 1967 the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.[ref]

In the late 1980s, STW-9 Perth which opened in 1965 became a Nine Network owned-and-operated station when Bond Media purchased the network. However, in 1989, Bond Media sold the Perth-based station to Sunraysia Television for A$95 million, due to the Federal cross-media ownership laws which restricted the level of national reach for media owners.

===1977-2006: The golden era===

Nine began using the slogan "Let Us Be The One" (based on The Carpenters song) in 1977 and achieved widespread success, becoming the number one free to air network in Australia and its National Nine News became the most watched news service. In 1978, Nine switched their slogan to "Still the One" (patterned after the campaign used by ABC in the United States), which lasted until the ratings downfall in January 2006. During the 80s, Nine's ratings peaked and drove the network forward well into the 90s. From 1999 to 2001, the network began losing ground to the Seven network in news and entertainment, but received a boost after the coverage of the 11 September attacks in 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Digital terrestrial television was introduced on 1 January 2001.

===2006-2008: Nine loses to Seven===

Nine stayed strong throughout 2004 but was hit hard when Seven introduced a new line-up in 2005, even though Nine finished ahead of Seven that year. Meanwhile, National Nine News was overtaken by Seven News, while Today was beaten by Seven's Sunrise. In 2006, Nine continued on its downward trend, losing most news weeks to Seven News and just winning the year thanks to its coverage of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. To try to revitalise the network in its 50th anniversary, Nine adopted a new, but critically received, logo that removed the nine dots, which had been part of the network's identity since 1970. In May 2007, Nine partially reintroduced the Nine dots, which resulted in the square logo changing into a 3D cube that rotates, with the dots visible on every second side of the cube.
After a period of declining ratings, David Gyngell returned to the job of Chief executive officer (CEO) in October 2007, succeeding Eddie McGuire.
In 2007, despite several hits, Seven won the whole year by a significant margin. The Seven Network had won 38 weeks, whereas the Nine Network only won two.

===2008-present: The relaunch===

In 2008, as part of a major relaunch, the network dropped the blue box, and reinstated its nine dots in its logo, with a 3D look. After losing viewers to Seven News, Nine relaunched its news service as Nine News, which managed to win more weeks over Seven in the first half of 2008. Nine also launched a breakout hit, Underbelly, which attracted over 2.5 million viewers in its first season. Nine tried to attract younger demographics, so while Seven went on to win the ratings year in total people, Nine was rated the number one network in the key 18–49 and 25–54 demographics.
In 2009, Nine started relatively strongly due to the top rating Australian drama Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities and the Twenty20 Cricket series, but could not hold its audience after Network Ten's Masterchef became a hit. Nine became inconsistent with scheduling and removal of programmes. Nine also launched a number of reality shows, including Ladette to Lady, Wipeout Australia, HomeMADE, Australia's Perfect Couple and The Apprentice Australia, in the hope of achieving the same success other networks had with the genre. All the new formats underperformed in the ratings and did not help the network establish any stable local content. Nine also expanded its news strand with the re-introduction of a late night bulletin (for its owned-and-operated stations), an extended morning bulletin and weekend editions of Today. Despite this, the flagship 18:00 state bulletins continued to fall in the ratings.
In August 2009, Nine launched its own digital multi-channel called Go! on Channel 99, primarily aimed at a younger demographic. The shares from Go! contributed to Nine's weekly shares and allowed it to enjoy several weeks of weekly ratings wins. In September, the Network took on a new slogan, Welcome Home and revamped its graphic package. With the resurgence of Nine News, growth of Today, stabilisation of 60 Minutes and a new programme line-up consisting of Hey Hey It's Saturday, Underbelly and Sea Patrol, Nine enjoyed more ratings success.
In 2010, Nine obtained the rights to exclusive coverage of the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks. Go! won the year in digital shares only. On 26 September 2010, Nine launched their third digital channel Gem (an acronym of General Entertainment and Movies) on Channel 90. In 2011 the Nine Network announced a new "Home of Comedy" line-up with comedy shows such as Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and other American sitcoms along with the launch of a live comedy show Ben Elton Live From Planet Earth which was cancelled after only three episodes due to low ratings. Nine also brought back This Is Your Life with Eddie McGuire as host, although the series was cancelled after airing four episodes. The Nine Network had success in the ratings in the second half of 2011 with The Block, Underbelly: Razor and The Celebrity Apprentice Australia. The highly anticipated return of a revamped ninth season of Two and a Half Men proved a huge success for the network, generating 2.3 million viewers and dominating the week as top program.2.3m for Two and a Half Men TV Tonight, 21 September 2011 The return of new episodes of the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory was also a huge success for the network scoring high figures consistently week after week and dominating the evening as top program. The Nine Network, was in second place in the ratings again in 2011 on 19.6%, behind the Seven Network (23.1%) and ahead of the Network Ten (15.9%), ABC (12.2%) and SBS (4.6%).Free To Air TV Ratings For The Year 2011 Throng, 26 November 2011
On 24 November 2011, the Nine Network announced line-up for 2012, with a focus on reality programs including an Australian version of The Voice, the return of Big Brother, Excess Baggage and The Celebrity Apprentice Australia.Nine's Home of Excitement in 2012. The Voice, Excess Baggage, Big Brother, more Underbelly, Celebrity Apprentice and The Block Throng, 24 November 2011 The Nine Network also aired coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. A new morning show, "Mornings", replaced the departure of Kerri-Anne Kennerley's self-titled show, after nine years on air. The program is hosted by Sonia Kruger and David Campbell.
On 26 March 2012, the Nine Network launched Extra, a new channel aimed at delivering home shopping, brand funded, religious, community, educational and multi-cultural programming content created by advertisers. The channel was created to try to lower Nine's ballooning debt, also the addition of a fourth channel to their DVB-T transports in metropolitan areas has lowered the encoded quality of their other channels given Australian broadcasters are already pushing the limits with the use of H.262 video for one HD and two SD channels in a single 7 MHz allocation. The new channel is not carried by their regional partner WIN.
It was reported on 31 May 2012 that the Australian telecommunications company Telstra and WIN Television Network CEO, Bruce Gordon, are considering making a takeover bid for Nine Entertainment.Telstra eyes troubled Nine television network The Australian, 31 May 2012 [tpl]subscription[/tpl]Bruce Gordon explores possible Nine bid Business Spectator, 13 June 2012 The network currently is trying to fight off administration as it deals with a debt exceeding A$3.3 billion.

==Programming==

The Nine Network broadcasts a range of programming from Australian and overseas sources. Nine's current Australian programming line-up includes: Mornings, Australia's Funniest Home Videos, Big Brother, The AFL Footy Show, The NRL Footy Show, Getaway, Footy Classified, RBT, the Underbelly series, The Block, The Farmer Wants a Wife, 60 Minutes, Millionaire Hot Seat and The Voice.

The network's flagship programme is the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Other American programming on Nine include Two and a Half Men, Anger Management, Dallas, The Mentalist, the CSI franchise, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Extra. Nine also aired the American talk show The View during the weekday afternoon time slot up until late 2013.
In an attempt to attract advertisers, as there is wide industry consensus that most advertisers are more interested in programmes for younger audiences, new programming is expected to now be targeted towards the younger generation. Tom Fisher is expected to host a new children's show on the channel in 2013
Reruns of Two and a Half Men are shown out of sequence with episodes from several different seasons often airing in the same night. This has resulted in much public scrutiny against the Network, with nine out of ten weekly episodes of Two and a Half Men being repeats, the highest ratio of any network.
Feature films broadcast on the Nine Network are sourced from its studio-output deals, including Regency Enterprises, Castle Rock, Lions Gate, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. It also broadcasts Australian and international titles distributed via Village Roadshow, Village Roadshow Pictures.
The network formerly broadcasts catalogue movie and television titles from the Paramount Pictures produced from the 1990s prior to 2010, Sony Pictures produced in 2008 prior to 2012,Nine has quit Sony deal TV Tonight, 20 July 2012 and Dreamworks from 1998 to 2006. Network Ten & Foxtel share broadcast rights to Paramount Pictures, with very expensive rights for Sony Pictures now being fully broadcast by the Seven Network from 2013 onwards, and broadcast rights to the entire Dreamworks catalogue are now broadcast on Network Ten.

===News and current affairs===

The Nine Network's news service is Nine News (previously National Nine News). For decades, it was the top rating news service nationally but in recent years, the Seven Network's Seven News has overtaken the service.
Nine produces several news bulletins and programmes, including Today, Weekend Today, as well as Nine Early Morning News, Nine Morning News, Nine News Now, Nine Afternoon News, Nine News: First at Five and local nightly editions of Nine News.
The news service also produces A Current Affair and 60 Minutes. During weekday overnights and Sunday mornings, Nine rebroadcasts American television network ABC's news and current affairs programme Good Morning America.
Exclusive contracts with ABC News and TVNZ for international news coverage.
From 2008, major expansion saw Today broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays too, the weekday version running from 05:30 until 09:00 weekdays, the launch of the Nine Early News, the axing of the Sunday program, National Nine News becoming Nine News after poor ratings losing to Seven News, Nine Late News was launched then renamed as Nightline and the 11 am bulletin be renamed as Nine Morning News, running from 11:00 until 12:00 weekdays.
Meanwhile, several additions have been made to Nine News teams around the country, as well as the acquisition of more reporters by A Current Affair and also state-based Today reporters (plus a Weekend Today weather presenter).
Nine has posted journalists overseas to cover major European stories following the closure of its European bureau in late 2008, with the last European correspondent, James Talia, being redesignated to his former role as a senior Melbourne Nine News journalist. Reporters including Simon Bouda, Allison Langdon, Chloe Bugelly, Tim Arvier and Brett McLeod have all been on projects for Nine News bulletins in Greece, UK, France, South Africa, Thailand and the Czech Republic.
Today has since overtaken Sunrise on numerous occasions, whilst Nine News, especially on Sundays, has done so too. Both Today and Nine News beat their Seven counterparts regularly in the east coast broadcasts. Local A Current Affair bulletins in Perth and Adelaide have been scrapped by WIN stations there for not performing as well as expected.

The flagship sports of the brand are cricket, National Rugby League (NRL), and formerly Australian rules football, until Nine lost the rights in 2006, and Super League while it existed.

==Logos==

The Nine Network logo, which consists of a numeral 9 beside nine dots arranged in a 3x3 grid, is one of the most popular logos in Australia.Desktop Magazine - Nine Network
In 1998, the dots were changed to spheres. The spheres returned to dots as a new on-air ident package was created by Velvet mediendesign in 2001.Velvet mediendesign - Nine Network Rebrand 2001
In 2006, the network and its affiliates relaunched their logos to coincide with Nine's 50th anniversary. The logo uses a 2D blue cube with the 9 inside it, which saw the removal of the nine dots. The graphics package used during that time was designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates.
Later in 2007, the cube became a solid 3D box, and on May 2007 partially relaunched the nine dots, which is visible in every second surface of the box.
As a part of a major relaunch, Nine Network completely reinstated the nine-dots logo in January 14, 2008. The dots are represented by translucent 3D discs during that year. The music used throughout the network's idents and promotions was "Smile" by The Supernaturals.
On July 2009, the dots are 2D again as part of a brand refresh. Later on September 2009, the dots are changed to spheres yet again when the network's current slogan Welcome Home was launched. It also began to re-use the iconic "Still The One" theme tune in its idents.
In April 2012, Nine Network's identity changed, applying the logo in different colors such as red, green, purple and more. It is also reminiscent of the 2002 ident package.ZSPACE - Nine Network 2012
