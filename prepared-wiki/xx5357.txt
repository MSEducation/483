==History==

===National Council of Education, Bengal===

The first university in modern India was set up by the British in Calcutta in 1861 as a means of spreading western philosophical thought among the elite in India and to create in the words of Lord Macaulcay, “a class of Indians who would be Indian in blood and colour but western in thought and ideas.” This initiative was furthered by the passing of the Universities Act of 1904. This resulted in the reorganization of the Calcutta University’s Senate and Syndicate by the nomination of more white members into them, which in turn would enable the government to control its policies. The government also decided to disaffiliate many private Indian colleges, which had come up lately and were regarded by the Government as hot beds of nationalist agitation. The measures stirred the educated middle class to move for alternative systems of education.
The nationalists in the freedom struggle of India dubbed Calcutta University, another pillar of India’s education movement, as “Goldighir Ghulamkhana”, or the slave house of Goldighi, with reference to the lake adjacent to Calcutta University, and the number of graduates it churned out who were used in British merchant offices as clerks. Hence, the need for setting up an institution which would impart education along nationalist lines was strongly felt by the luminaries of the period. The real impetus though was provided by the partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, the Governor-General of India, into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become Bangladesh in 1971) and West Bengal and Odisha on the other. On 16 November 1905, the Landholders Society organized a meeting at Park Street, attended by 1500 delegates, including Rabindranath Tagore, Aurobindo Ghosh, Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick and Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury. The idea of the National Council of Education was mooted here. In a meeting held on 9 November 1905 at the Field and Academic Club, Subodh Chandra Mullick pledged Rupees one lakh for the foundation of a National University in Bengal. The objective in setting up the  institution that was to challenge the British rule over education by offering education to the masses 'on national lines and under national control'. Generous sums of money were also donated by Brojendra Kishore Roy Choudhury, Maharaja Suryya Kanto Acharya Choudhury and Rashbihari Ghosh, who was appointed the first president of the university.

===Bengal Technical Institute===

Almost on the same day that the National Council of Education was set up, a rival organisation, the Society for Promotion of Technical Education in Bengal, was set up by Taraknath Palit.Haridas Mukherjee and Uma Mukherjee, The Origins of the National Education Movement (Calcutta: National Council of Education, 1992) The Bengal Technical Institute came into being on July 25, 1906 under the umbrella of the SPTE with the objective of spreading technical education among the masses in West Bengal, India.

===Merger of the Bengal Technical Institute with the National Council of Education===

The two organisations fought it out for a few years until the SPTE was amalgamated with the NCE in 1910 and the Bengal Technical Institute passed into its hands. In 1921 the Institute became the first in India to introduce Chemical Engineering as a discipline. By 1940, the institute had outgrown itself as more than just a small institute and was virtually functioning as an independent university.

===Post Independence period and formation of Jadavpur University===

After Indian Independence in 1947, the West Bengal State Legislature, with the concurrence of the Government of India, enacted the Jadavpur University Act, 1955 to convert the institute into Jadavpur University with full autonomy on (December 24, 1955). Since then the university has observed this date in its calendar as Convocation Day.
Jadavpur University has had its share of ups and downs since its formation as an autonomous university. On the one hand, this period has seen the university’s growth as one of the foremost centres of the excellence in the country, while on the other, this period has also seen it being affected by Naxalite violence that claimed, among others, the life of Prof. Gopal Chandra Sen, who was the vice chancellor of the university at the time of his death.

==Emblem==

The emblem of the university is a three-flamed lamp encircled by lotus petals. The lamp represents knowledge. The three flames represent Intellectual Training, Cultivation of Emotions and Imagination, and Spiritual Development. Petals of the lotus on the periphery represent Fine Arts and Culture. It was designed by Nandalal Bose, a key member of the Bengal School of Art, who was one of the great masters at Kala Bhavan in Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan. As the university celebrated its Golden Jubilee on December 24, 2005, a special emblem (see above) was created to commemorate the occasion, and the motto 'To Know Is To Grow' was coined. This date was also the centenary of the National Council of Education.Ananda Lal, Rama Prasad De, and Amrita Sen, The Lamp in the Lotus: A History of Jadavpur University (Calcutta: Jadavpur University, 2005)

==Campus==

Jadavpur University is semi-residential, which at present operates out of two urban campuses: one in Jadavpur ([tpl]convert|58|acre|m2[/tpl]) and another in Salt Lake ([tpl]convert|26|acre|m2[/tpl]).

===Jadavpur Campus===

The main campus of Jadavpur University is bordered by the Raja S.C. Mullick Road, the Jadavpur Station Road, the Kolkata Suburban Rail, South Line and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR India). The present campus was first leased to the NCE in 1922 by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation when Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das was the mayor. On 11 March 1922 the foundation stone of Aurobindo Bhavan, which is currently the main administrative centre of the university, was laid. The seat of engineering was shifted to the Aurobindo Bhavan in 1924 when the building was completed.
The Jadavpur campus houses most of the departments of the three faculties — Engineering, Science and Arts — in addition to the Jadavpur University Central Library and the Blue Earth Workshop. It is adjacent to research institutes like the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute.  
The architecture of the campus is typical sub–continental in nature with flat-roof rectangular plans. Some of the older buildings, especially in the engineering faculty and the Aurobindo Bhavan in particular, have a strong Bengali influence which can be seen in the design of the pillars and even the wooden doors and windows.

===Landmarks on the main campus===

Some of the prominent landmarks on the engineering side include the Blue Earth Workshop — which, in addition to being among the foremost centres of learning techniques in workshop technology, also has the dubious distinction of having been used by students affected by the naxalite violence to manufacture blow guns, the “gachchtola”, the “jheel paar”, ashirwad canteen ( now converted into the SURUCHI canteen), the windmill and the “green zone”.
On the arts and science side, some of the prominent landmarks include the English department “ledge”, the “Bhanga Bridge”, worldview bookstore, Open Air Theatre and “Milan Da’s” canteen.

===Salt Lake City Campus===

The Salt Lake City Campus is a newer campus and was set up after it was felt that the space on the main campus was insufficient to meet the demands of setting up departments for emerging fields of study. It is a 28 acre campus in LB block, Salt Lake just off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass near the Chingrighata crossing. It is surrounded by many renowned educational institutes like The West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, National Institute of Fashion Technology, Kolkata and Government college of Engineering and leather technology along with the Headquarters of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited.  Five engineering departments operate out of the campus — Information Technology, Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering, Printing Engineering, Construction Engineering and Power Engineering. It also houses the School of Mobile Computing and Communication, a Library, the administrative block(KMR) and a hostel complex for out-station students. The main ground at the Salt Lake campus has been leased out to the Cricket Association of Bengal and it often plays host to inter- and intrastate cricket matches.

===National Instruments Limited Campus===

Jadavpur University has recently acquired the erstwhile National Instruments Limited (CSIR), becoming the first Indian university to acquire such a research unit. It is on a nine-acre plot opposite the main campus. After renovation, the new campus is expected to add much-needed space for new laboratories especially for the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, and Computer Science & Engineering. The NIL campus is to be connected to the main campus by an underground tunnel to bypass the traffic on the busy Raja S.C. Mullick Road.

===Affiliated institutes===

In addition to being a unitary university, it has other institutes like the Jawahari Devi Birla Institute of Commerce and Management, Jadavpur Vidyapith as well as the Institute of Business Management, Jadavpur University affiliated to it, which operate out of independent campuses. While these institutes have their own independent curriculum as well as examination systems, the final degree is offered by Jadavpur University.

===Faculty housing===

Unlike most universities which provide accommodation to faculty and staff on campus, due to a shortage of space, faculty housing is provided in the campus as well in nearby areas. This includes housing in areas like Santoshpur and Tollygunge.

==Jadavpur University Press and publication house==

The university press publishes all documents of record in the university including PhD theses, question papers and journals. On 26 October 2010 the institution announced plans to launch a publication house, named Jadavpur University Press. The main focus of the publication house will be to publish textbooks and thesis written by research scholars and authors from all universities. The first two titles of JUP were launched on February 1, 2012 at the Calcutta Book Fair. The two titles were Rajpurush (translation of Niccolò Machiavelli's Il Principe); translated by Doyeeta Majumder, with an introduction by Swapan Kumar Chakravorty, and Shilpachinta (translation of selections from Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks); translated by Sukanta Chaudhuri. Both books were translated from the original Italian.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-26/kolkata/28271067_1_publication-house-pradip-narayan-ghosh-research-scholars |title=JU to launch publication house |work=timesofindia.indiatimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2010 |date=2010-10-26[/tpl]

==Administration and organization==

Jadavpur University is an autonomous state university. The governor of the state of West Bengal is its chancellor. However, the daily administration is handled under the leadership of the vice chancellor, who is appointed by the governor on the recommendations of the government of West Bengal. The vice chancellor is assisted in his duties by the pro vice chancellor who is de facto a senior faculty member of faculty of engineering and technology.
Within the university’s administrative structure, the highest body is the university court. It consists of members elected by the staff members of the university from amongst themselves as well as members of the alumni.
Next in hierarchy comes the executive council of the university, which takes all the decisions relating to day to day functioning. It consists of staff and student members from all the three faculties. The student members of the faculties finding representation on the executive council are the chairmen of the three student councils of unions.
The three faculties in turn have their own councils which are changed every four years and differ in their compositions. The engineering faculty for example has members who are nominated either by the vice chancellor or are invited from the various schools functioning under the faculty. The Arts and Science Faculties have member from the affiliated institutes like J.D. Birla in addition to members from the respective faculties. However, a common factor in each of the three faculties is that each department is represented on the council by the Head of the Department and at least one other faculty member of the department.
Outside these councils are the offices of the registrar, finance officer, controller of examinations, university engineer, faculty secretaries, placement coordinator and deans of the three faculties and students welfare which are responsible for the administrative tasks delegated to them. Finally, at the departmental level are the heads of departments.

==Academics==

Admission to Jadavpur University is highly competitive, as it consistently ranks amongst the best colleges in India.
For admissions to the Engineering Faculty at the undergraduate level, students are admitted through the WBJEE, an entrance examination open to students from all over India. Unlike in a large number of states, there is no domicile quota in JU as well as for the remaining engineering colleges admitting students through the WBJEE. Postgraduate students in engineering are admitted through GATE. 
Admission to the Arts and Science Faculties is by means of individual examinations for each of the departments at the undergraduate as well as the postgraduate levels. Weight age is given to marks obtained at the higher secondary level for undergraduate admissions at the undergraduate level for postgraduate level.
To facilitate interdisciplinary learning and research in diverse fields, there are a number of schools and centre for studies. Some of the major research ventures undertaken by these schools include the pioneering work done by the School of Environmental Studies in highlighting the presence of arsenic in groundwater in countries like India and Bangladesh and the development of the first alcohol based car by the School of Automobile Engineering. 
The centres for studies are usually directly associated with a particular department and the centres in Jadavpur University are: 
In March 2011, Indian American scientist Manick Sorcar assisted in the opening of a one-of-a-kind laser animation lab under the School of Illumination Science, Engineering and Design."Wizard of light brings magic of laser to JU," The Telegraph, 2011

==International collaborations==

Internship opportunities to pursue research in institutes in USA and Europe are available to students at JU. Engineering and science students can avail of DAAD and ERASMUS fellowships in Europe. In addition the university has collaborations with the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds Metropolitan University, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute, University of California, Staffordshire University and International Centre for Theoretical Physics.

===Library and digital resources===

Jadavpur University has one of the largest libraries among universities in India. It has the third largest library within the state of West Bengal. There is a Central Library on the Main Campus in Jadavpur and another smaller one at the Salt Lake Campus. Besides these, the thirty three departments, and schools have their own libraries.
The Central Library or CL is housed in a three-storey building near the third gate of the main campus. It has the biggest stock of books, journals, theses, dissertations, pamphlets, maps and microfilms in the university. The total record of books in the university is around 600,000. In addition there are around 80,000 journals, 13,000 theses and dissertations and 37,000 non-book materials.
The Centre for Digital Library and Documentation known simply as the Digital Library or DL is housed in the new annex building of the Central Library. It was set up in 2003 to assist in the digitization of data on campus. The learning resource centre of the DL has around sixty nodes for accessing digital data both on the internet as well as the internal database of the university.

===Rankings===

While most Indian engineering colleges barring IITs emphasize on undergraduate teaching, Jadavpur University is primarily recognized on research, after IITs it has been ranked sixth in research output in India for its engineering faculty.
Some other rankings are:

==Student life==

Unlike most Indian universities, Jadavpur University has the distinction of having three separate faculties of learning within its ambit — Arts, Engineering & Technology and Science. This creates the ground for a vibrant student life. However, the absence of a residential campus denies the students many of the additional facilities which are usually available to students in other universities.

===Accommodation===

Jadavpur University is primarily non-residential. Housing on campus is usually quite difficult to get. Accommodation is usually reserved for out-of-state and financially weak students. Some of the Masters and Research scholars are accommodated on the hostel On the main campus. The main men's hostel is near the Jadavpur Police Station on Prince Anwar Shah Road at a walking distance from the university. The women's hostel is on the main campus near the guest house. Hence, usually most of the students from towns and cities other than Kolkata take up accommodation in guest houses and as paying guests in residences in the vicinity.

===Unions===

Student bodies are an important aspect of student life inside Jadavpur University. All the three faculties have their own student representative bodies also known as student unions. The members to these bodies are elected by students of the respective faculties.
The elections to these bodies are held once a year and are keenly followed both inside as well as outside campus. Some of the groups contesting these elections are affiliates of the major political parties, while others are so-called independent student bodies.

===Clubs and activities===

There are a number of student clubs and associations in the university. Some of these are:
In addition to these clubs, there are numerous other activities which are pursued by the students of the university including sports like cricket, football, table tennis etc., street plays, theatrics and robotics. The various student unions organize annual tournaments in sports at the inter-departmental levels in the months of August and September

====Sanskriti====

The annual cultural festival (or culfest) of Jadavpur University is called "Sanskriti", which in Bengali or Hindi means Culture. Each of the three faculties organizes separate editions which spread over a fortnight. It is usually held over the months of February and March. The festivals feature a series of events which portray the cultural talents of not just the participating students but also established artists from across the region. The highlight of the events is usually the live performance, featuring some of the best musical acts of the region on the last day of each of the editions.

====Srijan====

The annual technical festival of Jadavpur University is called “Srijan”, which in the vernacular means an act of creation. It is organized by the students of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology in the month of March with the aim of promoting the spirit of innovation and discovery among the participants and features competitions in coding, robotics, hardware designing, and even mathematical puzzles. Also in this fest some workshops are organised like ethical hacking to give student the current updates on technologies.

====METALLIX====

METALLIX is the annual event organised by the Department of Metallurgical & Material Engineering, Jadavpur University in association with the student chapter of the Kolkata chapter of the Indian Institute of Metals. The first day of the event is attributed to a National symposium on a topic related to the field of Metallurgical & Material Engineering, where distinguished speakers from all over India and abroad present lectures. A National Student Metallurgists Meet is held on the second day of the event, where students from the Metallurgical, Mechanical, Chemical, Nano-Science departments of other colleges participate in a host of competitions-Technical Paper Presentation, Poster Presentation, Metallurgical Essay Writing, Metallography, Debate and Quiz competitions.

====VOX POP====

VOX POP refers to debate of Jadavpur University. It started off as an event for freshers to showcase their oratorical skills in the Policy debating format but has since evolved into a multi-format national level debate highlighting the ways in which the Voice of the people is represented. It is held twice every year, once for fresher students to be selected into the debating society and then again as an inter-college event between some of the best colleges from across the region.

====Qriosity====

Qriosity is the annual quizzing festival of Jadavpur University. It is one of the biggest quizfests in the country and draws enthusiasts and quiz buffs from across the nation. Qriosity 2011 saw the participation of around 1500 quizzards in 7 different events which were hosted by reputed quiz masters including Joy Bhattacharya, the CEO of Kolkata Knight Riders.

====YESM====

The Young Economist Students’ Meet (YESM) is an initiative pioneered by the students of the Department of Economics, Jadavpur University. The basic objective of the meet is to create a common platform for the students and scholars of Economics, thereby offering opportunities to young minds to know and grow through interaction with each other and the stalwarts of the field.

===Rivalry===

There is intense competitiveness between the students of the three faculties as well as between Jadavpur University and that of the other city colleges like Presidency College, Kolkata and St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. This has been aggravated by the transfer of the best students from the other colleges after their graduation especially in the field of Arts to Jadavpur University for their post- graduation.

==Alumni==

===Alumni Association===

The Alumni Association, one of the oldest in the country, was founded in 1921 by the ex-students of National Council of Education. Prof. Hiralal Roy A. B. (Harvard) was its first secretary and Dr. Abinesh Ch. Bhattacharjee, Ph.D. (Berlin) its first president.
Shri Kiron Roy, who was an alumnus and an ex-student of MIT, founded his electrical firm in Calcutta and helped the College of Engineering and Technology. The alumni of Jadavpur living abroad helped fellow-Jadavpurians to be admitted to various universities and research institutions in Boston, Michigan, Pittsburgh, Cornell, Edinburg, Munich etc.
For the first few years of its existence, the activities of the Alumni Association were mainly educational, practically confined to the guidance of and assistance to the NCE and the development of the BTI (Bengal Technical Institute). The connections of the Alumni Association with the NCE, the BTI and, later, the College of Engineering & Technology (CET) considerably helped these institutions to spread and improve engineering and technological education in India. The NCE was a private organization. Its formation, operation and development had to be funded entirely by public donations, with no Government support. The Alumni Association became a vital factor in the growth of the NCE and development of the CET.
The construction of the K. C. Roy Hall in the Electrical Engineering Building, expansion of the Chemical Engineering Building, construction of the Gymnasium (now Indoor Stadium), a revolving Theatrical Stage, the Wind Mills for pumping out the water from the Play Grounds are all Alumni creations. As regards the Alumni Building, the present home of the Association, a two storied building was built in 1941 at the north-western corner of the University playgrounds. The cost of construction was Rs. 18,000/-, fully financed by the Alumni. The original name of the building was the “Old Boys Home”. When girl ex-students became a reality, the home was renamed as the “Alumni Building”.
After the formation of the Jadavpur University in 1955 the rules were modified to include ex-students of the University as alumni. The name of the Association itself was formally changed and registered in 1990 as “The Alumni Association, NCE Bengal and Jadavpur University.

===Notable faculty and alumni===

Aurobindo Ghosh was the first Principal of the Bengal National College and among the teachers were luminaries like Rabindranath Tagore, Sir Gurudas Bandyopadhyay, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Surendranath Banerjee, Ramendra Sundar Tribedi, Radha Kumud Mukherjee and Benoy Kumar Sarkar. 
Pioneering efforts came from such dedicated and learned people like Prof. Hemchandra Das Gupta, Prof. Hiralal Roy, Prof. Satish Chandra Bhattacharyya, and many others, who introduced new disciplines and domains of engineering and changed the dimensions of the colonial engineering education. Their work was carried further by Dr. Triguna Sen, Prof. Hemchandra Guha, Prof. Karuna Roy, Prof. M. L. Schroff., Prof. Tuhin Roy, Prof. Gopal Chandra Sen and many others.
The University has been enriched by contributions from people like Prof. Amartya Sen, Prof. Sudhindranath Datta, Prof.Buddhadeb Bosu and Prof.Panchanan Chakravorty and many others who steered the early progress of the Arts and Science Faculties-the new additions to the original Faculty of Engineering & Technology.
