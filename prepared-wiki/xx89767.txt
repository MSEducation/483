==Archaeology career==

Finkelstein specializes in Middle Eastern archaeology of the ancient history of the Land of Israel. He is critical of scholars who read the results of their excavations as confirming the biblical narratives of conquest. One of his most controversial theories is his description of 10th century BCE Jerusalem, the period associated with the biblical kings David and Solomon, as a mere 'village' or tribal center,Miller, Laura King David was a nebbish Salon. 2001-02-07 retrieved 2007-11-30Archaeological Debate about a Proposed "Low Chronology" for Iron I-IIA http://www.cjconroy.net/bib/chron-low.htmhttp://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/12/david-and-solomon/draper-text/1 Robert Draper, Kings of Controversy, National Geographic, December 2010.
Though rejecting the ultra-minimalist position that places the composition of the Bible in the Persian or Greek period, i.e., after the return from the Babylonian exile, he argues that much of the Bible was written from the seventh through the 5th century BCE.Israel Finkelstein, 'A Short Summary: Bible and Archeology,’ in Israel Finkelstein, Amihai Mazar, Brian B. Schmidt The Quest for the Historical Israel:Debating Archeology and the History of Early Israel , Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta, 2007 pp.183-188 p.183 Notwithstanding his dismissal of the literal approach to Biblical history, Finkelstein believes that 'New archaeological discoveries should not erode one's sense of tradition and identity'.Tel Aviv University.

Finkelstein is a proponent of the "low chronology," an archaeological reconstruction that attempts to solve problems in the traditional Levantine chronology by "lowering the date of 11th-century BCE assemblages to the early-to-mid-10th century, and 10th century BCE assemblages to the early 9th century, with the late Iron I/early Iron IIA transition fixed in the late 10th century BCE".Finkelstein, Israel A Low Chronology Update Archaeology, history and bible http://megiddo.tau.ac.il/info/The_Bible_and_Radiocarbon_Dating_2005_Update.pdf
