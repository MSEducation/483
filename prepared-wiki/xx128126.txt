CATEGORIES: Four-dimensional geometry, Polychora

In geometry, the rectified 24-cell or rectified icositetrachoron is a uniform 4-dimensional polytope (or uniform polychoron), which is bounded by 48 cells: 24 cubes, and 24 cuboctahedra. It can be obtained by reducing the icositetrachoron's cells to cubes or cuboctahedra.
It can also be considered a cantellated 16-cell with the lower symmetries B4 = 3,3,4. B4 would lead to a bicoloring of the cuboctahedral cells into 8 and 16 each. It is also called a runcicantellated demitesseract in a D4 symmetry, giving 3 colors of cells, 8 for each.
