The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is an American non-profit and charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco, California that operates many wikis. The foundation is mostly known for hosting Wikipedia, an Internet encyclopedia which ranks in the top-ten most-visited websites worldwide;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&lang=none |title=Top 500 |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |publisher=Alexa[/tpl] as well as Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikimedia Commons, Wikispecies, Wikinews, Wikiversity, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, Wikimedia Incubator, and [tpl]srlink|m:Main Page|Meta-Wiki[/tpl]. It also owned the now-defunct Nupedia.
The organization was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sister projects through non-profit means.[tpl]cite news | first = Rupert | last = Neate | title = Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales goes bananas | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/3399843/Wikipedia-founder-Jimmy-Wales-goes-bananas.html |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date= October 7, 2008 | accessdate =October 25, 2009 | quote = The encyclopedia's huge fan base became such a drain on Bomis's resources that Mr Wales, and co-founder Larry Sanger, thought of a radical new funding model – charity.[/tpl]
As of 2013, the foundation employs more than 142 people, with revenues of US$48.6 million and cash equivalents of $22.2 million. Sue Gardner led the foundation as its executive director but was replaced in May 2014 by Lila Tretikov, while Jan-Bart de Vreede serves as chairman of the board.

==Goal==

The Wikimedia Foundation falls under section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code as a public charity. Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing education).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.guidestar.org/npo/ntee.jsp | title = NTEE Classification System | accessdate =January 28, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://nccs2.urban.org/ntee-cc/b.htm#b60 | title = NCCS definition for Adult Education | accessdate =January 28, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] The foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally.[tpl]cite web | url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws#ARTICLE_II_-_STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE | title = Wikimedia Foundation bylaws | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation | accessdate =January 28, 2008 | archiveurl = https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws&oldid=20641#ARTICLE_II_-_STATEMENT_OF_PURPOSE | author = Jd | authorlink = foundation:User:Jd | archivedate = April 20, 2007 [/tpl]

==History==

In 2001, Jimmy Wales, an Internet entrepreneur, and Larry Sanger, a software developer, founded Wikipedia, an Internet encyclopedia. The project was originally funded by Bomis, Wales' for-profit business. However, as Wikipedia's popularity skyrocketed, revenues to fund the project stagnated. Since Wikipedia became a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and Sanger, thought of a different way to fund the project – charity. The Wikimedia Foundation was created from Wikipedia and Nupedia on June 20, 2003.[tpl]cite web|author=Jimmy Wales|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-June/010743.html |title=Announcing Wikimedia Foundation|date=June 20, 2003|publisher=Lists.wikimedia.org|accessdate=November 26, 2012[/tpl] It applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark Wikipedia on September 17, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on January 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded by Japan on December 16, 2004, and, in the European Union, on January 20, 2005. There were plans to license the use of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or DVDs.[tpl]cite news |first=Vipin |last=Nair|title=Growing on volunteer power |date=December 5, 2005 |publisher=Business Line |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ew/2005/12/05/stories/2005120500070100.htm |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl]
The name "Wikimedia" was coined by American author Sheldon Rampton in a post to the English mailing list in March 2003.[tpl]cite web | url = http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2003-March/001887.html | title = Wikipedia English mailing list message | date = March 16, 2003 | first = Sheldon | last = Rampton | authorlink = Sheldon Rampton [/tpl][tpl]or|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In April 2005, the US Internal Revenue Service approved the foundation as an educational foundation in the category "Adult, Continuing education", meaning all contributions to the foundation are tax-deductible for US federal income tax purposes.
On December 11, 2006, the Foundation's board noted that the corporation could not become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory law. Accordingly, the by-laws were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the board unanimously.Bylaws revision.
On September 25, 2007, the foundation's board gave notice that the operations would be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and potential partners, a better talent pool, as well as cheaper and more convenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg, Florida.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/sep/25/wikimedia-foundation-moving-another-bay-area/?news-breaking | title= Wikimedia Foundation Moving To Another Bay Area | author = Carlos Moncada | work = The Tampa Tribune |date = September 25, 2007 | quote = [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url= http://www.tbo.com/news/money/MGBNF5F517F.html | title = Online Encyclopedia To Leave St. Petersburg For San Francisco | author = Richard Mullins | work = The Tampa Tribune |date = September 26, 2007 | quote = [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/10/BU69SNMQ2.DTL&tsp=1 | title = Wikipedia team plans move to San Francisco | first = Ryan | last = Kim |work=San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 10, 2007 | quote = [/tpl]

==Projects and initiatives==

===[tpl]anchor|Projects[/tpl] Wikimedia projects===

In addition to Wikipedia, the foundation operates other wikis that follow the free content model with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge. These include:

===Chapters===

Wikimedia chapters are national (or in some cases sub-national) not-for-profit organisations created to promote the interests of Wikimedia projects locally. They support the foundation, the Wikimedia community and Wikimedia projects in different ways—by collecting donations, organizing local events/projects and conducting outreach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_chapters|title=Wikimedia chapters|author=Various|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation[/tpl] The chapters are independent of the Wikimedia Foundation with no legal control of nor responsibility for the Wikimedia projects. The organisations are recognised and overseen by a Chapters Committee; following approval they enter into a "Chapters Agreement" with the foundation.[tpl]cite book|author=Morell, Mayo Fuster|chapter=The Wikimedia Foundation and the Governance of Wikipedia's Infrastructure|editors=Geert Lovink, Nathaniel Tkacz|title=Critical Point of View: A Wikipedia Reader|publisher=Institute of Network Cultures|year=2011|isbn=978-90-78146-13-1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Konieczny, P|title=Wikipedia: Community or Social Movement|journal=Interface|date=November 2009|volume=1|edition=2|pages=212–232[/tpl] As of April 2012 there were 39 recognised Wikimedia chapters.[tpl]cite journal|author=Fontanills, David Gómez|pages=77–87|title=Academic research into Wikipedia|number=14|journal=Digithum|issn=1575-2275|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Wikimania===

Each year, an international conference called Wikimania brings the people together who are involved in the Wikimedia organizations and projects. The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2005. Nowadays, Wikimania is organized by a committee supported usually by the national chapter, in collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation. In 2013, Wikimania took place in Hong Kong. In 2014, Wikimania will take place in London.

===Strategic plan===

In response to the growing size and popularity of Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a Strategic Plan to improve and sustain the Wikimedia movement. The plan was announced in July 2009, followed by a process of interviews and surveys with people from across the Wikimedia movement, including board of trustees, members of staff and volunteer editors.[tpl]cite web|title=Strategic Plan/Background and Context|url=http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan/Background_and_Context|work=Wikimedia Strategy|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] After wide consultation, the ongoing plan was intended to be the basis of a five-year plan to further outreach, improve content quality and quality control, and optimising operational areas such as finance and infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|title=Emerging strategic priorities|url=http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Emerging_strategic_priorities#Enhancing_Community|work=Wikimedia Strategy|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

===Wikipedia Usability Initiative===

In December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a restricted donation grant of $890,000 from the Stanton Foundation, to improve Wikipedia's accessibility.[tpl]cite web|author=Az1568|title=Press releases/Wikipedia to become more user-friendly for new volunteer writers|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Wikipedia_to_become_more_user-friendly_for_new_volunteer_writers|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 13, 2011|authorlink=wmf:User:Az1568[/tpl] Later named the Wikipedia Usability Initiative, the grant was used by the Wikimedia Foundation to appoint project-specific staff to the technology department.Mailing list post by [tpl]srlink|User:Brion VIBBER|Brion Vibber[/tpl], chief technology officer to the Wikimedia Foundation (January 9, 2009)
A series of surveys were conducted throughout 2009. This began with a qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability.[tpl]cite web|title=Usability and Experience Study|url=http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_and_Experience_Study|work=Wikimedia Usability|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 14, 2011[/tpl] The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited different new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia skin.[tpl]cite web|title=Usability, Experience, and Progress Study|url=http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability,_Experience,_and_Progress_Study|work=Wikimedia Usability|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 14, 2011[/tpl]
The initiative ultimately culminated in a new Wikipedia skin named Vector, constructed based on the results of the usability studies. This was introduced by default in stages, beginning in May 2010.Mailing list post by Jay Walsh, Head of Communications to the Wikimedia Foundation (May 2010)

===Public Policy Initiative===

In May 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation announced the Public Policy Initiative, following a $1.2 million donation by the Stanton Foundation. The Initiative was set up to improve articles relating to public policy–related issues.[tpl]cite web|last=Pantages|first=Moka|title=Press releases/May 2010 Wikimedia Foundation will engage academic experts and students to improve public policy information|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/May_2010_Wikimedia_Foundation_will_engage_academic_experts_and_students_to_improve_public_policy_information|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] As part of the initiative, Wikipedia collaborated with ten universities to help students and professors create and maintain articles relating to public policy.[tpl]cite web|last=Hicklin|first=Andrea|title=UC Berkeley students help improve Wikipedia's credibility|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2010/11/05/wikipedia/|publisher=UC Berkeley News Center|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl] Volunteer editors of Wikipedia, known as "ambassadors", provided assistance to students and professors. This was either done on campus sites or online.[tpl]cite web|last=Nelson|first=Anne|title=Wikipedia Taps College 'Ambassadors' to Broaden Editor Base|url=http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/07/wikipedia-taps-college-ambassadors-to-broaden-editor-base200.html|work=Mediashift|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl]

==Technology==

The foundation employs technology including hardware and software to run its projects.

===Hardware===

Wikimedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu),[tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia simplifies IT infrastructure by moving to one Linux vendor |first=Todd R. |last=Weiss |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9116787/Wikipedia_simplifies_IT_infrastructure_by_moving_to_one_Linux_vendor?taxonomyId=154&pageNumber=1&taxonomyName=Servers%20and%20Data%20Center |newspaper=Computerworld |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=November 1, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia adopts Ubuntu for its server infrastructure |first=Ryan |last=Paul |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/wikipedia-adopts-ubuntu-for-its-server-infrastructure.ars |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=November 1, 2008[/tpl] with a few OpenSolaris machines for ZFS. As of December 2009, there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.[tpl]cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers|title=Wikimedia servers|accessdate=August 16, 2013[/tpl] Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture. In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers in Florida. This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL, multiple slave database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers.
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of day."Monthly request statistics", Wikimedia. Retrieved on October 31, 2008. Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid-caching servers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dammit.lt/uc/workbook2007.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikipedia: Site internals, configuration, code examples and management issues |author=Domas Mituzas |publisher=MySQL Users Conference 2007 |accessdate=June 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl] Further statistics are available based on a publicly available 3-months Wikipedia access trace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html |title=Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting |author=Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen |publisher=Elsevier Computer Networks 53(11), pp. 1830–1845, June 2009[/tpl] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.

===Software===

The operation of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nedworks.org/~mark/presentations/san/Wikimedia%20architecture.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikimedia Architecture |author=Mark Bergman |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate=June 27, 2008[/tpl] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software.
In April 2005, a Lucene extension[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-04-18/Lucene_search|title=Lucene search: Internal search function returns to service|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc.|author=Michael Snow|accessdate=February 26, 2009[/tpl] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Currently Lucene Search 2.1,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Lucene-search|title=Extension:Lucene-search|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc.|accessdate=August 31, 2009[/tpl] which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3,[tpl]cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/branches/lucene-search-2.1/lib/|title=mediawiki – Revision 55688: /branches/lucene-search-2.1/lib|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc.|accessdate=August 31, 2009[/tpl] is used.

==Finances==

The Wikimedia Foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[tpl]cite web | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/a/ac/FINAL_10_11From_KPMG.pdf | title = Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. – Financial Statements – June 30, 2011 and 2010 | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation [/tpl] It is exempt from federal income taxSee also Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and from state income tax.See also Chapter 220.13 of the Florida Statutes It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions. The continued technical and economic growth of each of the Wikimedia projects is dependent mostly on donations but the Wikimedia Foundation also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as grants, sponsorship, services and brand merchandising. The Wikimedia OAI-PMH update feed service, targeted primarily at search engines and similar bulk analysis and republishing, has been a source of revenue for several years, but is no longer open to new customers.Wikimedia update feed service DBpedia was given access to this feed free of charge.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web|author=C Bizer|volume=7|issue=3|date=September 2009|pages=154–165|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
Since the end of fiscal year ended 2004, the Foundation's net assets have grown from $57K[tpl]cite web | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/2/28/Wikimedia_2006_fs.pdf | title = Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. – Financial Statements – June 30, 2006–2004 | publisher = Wikimedia Foundation [/tpl] to $45.2M at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Under the leadership of Sue Gardner, who joined the Wikimedia Foundation in 2007, the Foundation's staff levels, number of donors and revenue have seen very significant growth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/sue-gardner/ |title=Sue Gardner |publisher=Forbes |date=April 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 26, 2012[/tpl]
