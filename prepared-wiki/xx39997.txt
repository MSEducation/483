Class M is a fictional classification for planets and planetoids in the Star Trek science fiction media franchise. The term is explained in-universe as deriving from the Vulcan term "Minshara."Star Trek: Enterprise: Strange New World
Their atmospheres are composed of nitrogen and oxygen and have an abundance of liquid water necessary for carbon-based life to exist. Extensive plant and animal life often flourishes; often, a sentient race is also present. Earth is a textbook example of a Class M world; other Class M planets that appear throughout the franchise include Vulcan, Cardassia Prime, Bajor, Betazed, Romulus, Ferenginar, Qo'noS, and Nibiru.[tpl]cite book|last=Erdmann|first=Terry J.|coauthors=Paula M.

It is a designation used to describe a planet capable of supporting life “as we know it”. With a breathable oxygen–nitrogen atmosphere and a temperature range that won’t boil the crew’s blood. Most of the planets the Enterprise stops at fit the classification and are very Earth-like.

In fiction, Class M planets are similar to those suggested to be found in the real-world astronomical theory of life supporting planets found within the habitable zone (HZ), sometimes also referred to as the 'Goldilocks' zone. The Earth Similarity Index, a scale used in planetary science, includes within its classification of habitable planets (hClass) a "Class M", where the "M" stands for mesoplanet (not to be confused with Asimov's mesoplanet proposal), i. e., a planet with moderate (as necessary for liquid water) temperatures, more technically speaking: the thermal surface requirements necessary to support complex (multicellular) Earth-like life.
