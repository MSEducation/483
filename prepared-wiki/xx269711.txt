TDL-4 is a highly advanced, fourth generation botnet found worldwide (over a quarter of infected machines are in the US) and the name of the rootkit that runs the botnet (also known as Alureon). Over 4.5 million machines were infected with it in the first three months of 2011, and the botnet continued to grow after that.
