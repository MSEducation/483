==History==

The Bradley House was designed very late in Sullivan's career, and his role in the design is often overstated. "Both of the late residences (Babson and Bradley) were designed by Elmslie with only occasional suggestions from Sullivan."[tpl]cite web |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/72000047.pdf |format=pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Mrs. Josephine Crane Bradley Residence / Harold C.
