This is a list of the mayors of the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Until 1854, Ottawa was known as Bytown. Over the course of Ottawa's history, the borders of the municipality have greatly expanded through annexations. This most recently occurred in 2001 when a number of neighbouring communities were amalgamated with Ottawa, resulting in a new legal entity that took the name of one of its municipal predecessors.
