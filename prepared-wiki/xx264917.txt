CATEGORIES: 2011 albums

Buen Soldado (Good Soldier) is the second studio album by Chilean-American singer-songwriter Francisca Valenzuela. Feria Music released it on March 3, 2011 in Chile. The bilingual artist achieved success in both North and South America with her debut album, 2007's Muérdete la Lengua. She wrote and recorded the album while taking a gap year from her collegiate studies in Santiago. The album was preceded by the upbeat lead single "Quiero Verte Más" (I Want To See You More Often), which was released in January 1, 2011. The song's brisk mix of pop, folk and '60s go-go presaged the album's lighthearted tone.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HP8TI4 |title=Amazon: Francisca Valenzuela - Quiero Verte Más.|accessdate=2011-01-02|work=Amazon[/tpl] The album was certified gold in Chile in January 2013 for sales of 5,000 copies or more.http://www.latercera.com/noticia/entretencion/2013/01/661-504385-9-francisca-valenzuela-alcanza-disco-de-platino-y-prepara-nuevo-album.shtml Francisca Valenzuela receives platinum and gold album status

==Production==

Francisca began the process of writing for her second album in mid 2008 to early 2009. In 2010, pre-production was done in Berlin, Germany for two months (touring and the production phase of the album forced Valenzuela to put her Journalism studies at the Universidad Católica in Santiago on hold for a year.). While in Europe, Valenzuela produced a lot of songs with the producer and DJ Vicente Sanfuentes, who has worked with several groups and emerging Chilean artists like Los Mono, Gepe and Hermanos Brothers.  The album was also recorded and produced in Santiago and was completed in late 2010. Production group joined the Canadian producer Mocky, who produced songs for Jamie Lidell, Jane Birkin, Peaches and Nikka Costa.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2011/01/02/01/contenido/cultura-entretencion/30-54856-9-francisca-valenzuela-sale-a-confirmar-su-ascenso-con-nuevo-disco-para-marzo.shtml |title=Francisca Valenzuela sale a confirmar su ascenso con nuevo disco para marzo.|accessdate=2011-01-02|work=La Tercera[/tpl]

===Recording and writing process===

In August 2010, Valenzuela returned to Santiago, Chile, to start the recording the album at the Atomic studios in Santiago, Chile, with the technical control engineer Gonzalo "Chalo" Gonzalez and Camilo Salinas collaborations on the Hammond organ and Pablo Ilabaca, member of the Chilean band Chancho en Piedra in electric guitars. The album contains songs with recognizable instruments such as pianos, guitars, bass and drums. Francisca said that is not a very experimental album, but also explores new sounds and rhythms unlike her debut album, Muérdete La Lengua, and is of more groove and dance, with greater inclusion of new ringtones synthesizers on some tracks. The general tone of the album is much more fun and there are slow songs. Also includes folk songs and other slow, dark, with shades of jazz. Valenzuela says that an album is more varied and mature, changing the feminist side of her debut album now even include topics from the perspective of a man, and political or social opinions. The album contains 12 Spanish songs, all written and composed by Francisca Valenzuela.
