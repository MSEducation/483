==Governors==

Pennsylvania was one of the original thirteen colonies, and was admitted as a state on December 12, 1787. Prior to declaring its independence, Pennsylvania was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain; see the list of colonial governors for the pre-statehood period.

===The Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council===

The first Pennsylvania constitution in 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the state's executive branch, with the President as its head.1776 Constitution § 3 The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.1776 Constitution § 19
The original 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president", though no provision was made if the office of president became vacant, which occurred four times. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice president, without any notion of succeeding to the presidency. One acting president, George Bryan, has since been recognized as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months.

===Governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania===

The 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor,1790 Constitution article II, § 1 and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years.1790 Constitution article IV, § 3 The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years.1838 Constitution article II, § 3 The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.1874 Constitution article IV, § 3 The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms.PA Constitution article IV, § 3 There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as long as there is a four year break after a second term.
If the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor.PA Constitution article IV, § 13 Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor.PA Constitution article IV, § 14 The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the death of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/executive.phtml | title=Executive Branch of the Several States | publisher=The Green Papers | accessdate=April 30, 2008[/tpl]
