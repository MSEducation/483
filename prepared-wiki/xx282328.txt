==Significance==

The Kottiyoor Temple is highly revered in Kerala and neighboring areas of adjoining states. The legend goes that the shrine is blessed with the divine presence of The Holy Trinity or The Trimurthy(Brahma - Vishnu - Shiva). The Mother Goddess "Parashakti" in the temple, due to this Kali Yuga (the personification of Kali Yuga), has promised Parashurama in the presence of Trimurthy of not entering the premises of the holy shrine.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/about/parashuramasEntry.html
Kottiyoor is one of the most sacred shrines of Shakti. There are very few shrines in India for Sati Devi amongst which Kottiyoor is one. As it is forbidden to built any permanent structures abiding by religious principles, there are only temporary and simple-looking structures, which resemblance what would look like hermits of sages. As there is no sanctum-sanatorium, Sati is worshiped as Shakti in 'Ammarakkalu Thara', a raised platform adjacent to the Swayambhoo linga where Sati Devi is believed to have committed suicide. This is believed to be the temple of the origin of the Shakti Peethas. As it is the confluence of the presence of all the known Hindu Divinities, the place is called Kottiyoor from Koodi and Uuru meaning Meeting Precinct.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/about.html

===Social participation===

The Kottiyoor Pilgrimage has far reaching participation from the entire society. The Hindu communities in the region bring the raw materials as a ritual each year from even more than a hundred of kilometer away by walking. Each community have been delegated specific duty, and has not been re-delegated from the inception. They consider this as a right given to them and exercise their part as a duty. This has been happening as a ritual for ages and is centuries of years old tradition. The pilgrimage has become a part of their culture. The temple is located in a serene dense forest which is now declared as a Wild Life Sanctuary by Government of Kerala.[tpl]cite news|title=Wildlife sanctuary area in Kannur increases|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wildlife-sanctuary-area-in-kannur-increases/article1772084.ece|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|archivedate=April 27, 2011[/tpl]
The rites and rituals of the festival is a symbol of Shaiva-Vaishnava communal harmony. Rohini Aradhana http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/rituals/rohiniAaraadhana.html is considered as one of the sacred ritual during the Vysakha Mahotsavam where the head of the Vaishnavite family named 'Kurumathoor', conduct 'Aalingana pushpanjali' to the Swayambhoo linga, this is to commemorate Vishnu embracing Shiva to pacify him, who was in deep sorrow when he found the burned dead body of his beloved wife Sati Devi.

===Thruchherumana Temple origin===

The 'Prathishta'(i.e. the installation of idol) of the Thruchherumana Temple, was done by Parashurama on the opposite river bank of the Swayambhuu linga. The Thruchherumana Temple has its objective to worship Shiva for the entire year as the Swayambhoo linga on the other bank of the river can only be worshiped during 27 days of a year. Sankaracharya had classified the rites and rituals of the temple. He came to the Thruchherumana temple and worshiped there but he did not cross the river and worshiped the Swayambhoo linga as it was not the period of Vysakha pilgrimage. This belief is strictly followed until this time, of not going to the premises of Swayambhoo linga or Akkare kottiyoor if it is not the Vysakha pilgrimage time. Sankaracharya made ablutions in the Vavali river and prayed from the west bank of the river with out crossing and continued his journey.http://kottiyoordevaswom.com/about/newKottiyoor.html

A pious Namboothiri of Kalakkatt Illam (one of the four major Mantravada(Sorcery) lineages of Kerala)[tpl]cite web|title="Manthravaadam" (Conjuration / Sorcery)|url=http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/manthravaadam.htm|publisher=namboothiri.com|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] was returning from Kottiyoor. To pray for Sandhya vandanam in Manathana Shrine he took bath in the pond, after which a young lady from the adjacent bay offered him Taali(herbal shampoo), and told that she would apply it onto his forehead. He immediately recognized that she was none other than Bhadrakali and showing his head would meand his death. He folded his hand in-front of her and said any thing given by The Mother is nectar. He took the shampoo and drank it. Devi was pleased with him and presented him with three sacred insignia which he installed in three temples in the Kannur region.

Present day rituals of Kottiyoor were set out by Sri Shankaracharya. With his spiritual vision, he felt the presence of Shiva at 'Akkare Kottiyoor' and not willing to pollute the holy ground with the touch of his feet, prayed from 'Ekkare Kottiyoor' and left.
The Vaisakha Maholsavam festival is held every year during the months of May - June. The twenty eight day festival commences with the 'Neyyattam' ritual on the 'chodi' Day in Edavam and concludes with the Thrikkalashaattu.
