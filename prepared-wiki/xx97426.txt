Apache Lenya is a Java/XML open-source content management system based on the Apache Cocoon content management framework.  Features include revision control, scheduling, search capabilities, workflow support, and browser-based WYSIWYG editors.
Lenya was originally started by Michael Wechner in early 1999 to manage the content of the journal of pattern formation. Michael previously did basic research in physics by writing computer simulations on dendritic growth.
In early 2000 Michael co-founded Wyona, which continued to develop Lenya on the basis of the interactive newspaper edition of Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung. The name Lenya is a combination of the names of his two sons Levi and Vanya.
In the spring of 2003, Wyona donated Lenya to the Apache Software Foundation, where Lenya was incubated and became a Top Level Project in September 2004.
In 2006 Michael has started a new CMS called Yanel (an anagram of Lenya) featuring versioned interfaces as an approach to provide backwards compatibility at all times and hence replacing the classical approach of periodical releases by continuous deployment.
