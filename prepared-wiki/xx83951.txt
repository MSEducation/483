Ľubor Kresák (born 23 August 1927 in Topoľčany; died 20 January 1994 in Bratislava) was a Slovak astronomer.
He discovered two comets: the periodic comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak and the non-periodic C/1954 M2 (Kresak-Peltier).
He also suggested in 1978 that the Tunguska event was a fragment of the periodic comet Encke.
