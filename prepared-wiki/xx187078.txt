WCJB-DT2 is the CW-affiliated television station for Gainesville, Florida. The station is part of The CW Plus. It is a second digital subchannel of ABC affiliate WCJB-TV that is owned by Diversified Communications. Over-the-air, WCJB-DT2 broadcasts a digital signal on UHF channel 16.2 from a transmitter in Wacahoota. The station is also offered on cable. In High Springs, it can be seen on Communicomm channel 6 while in Gainesville it can be seen on Cox channel 10. 
WCJB-DT2 is known on-air as Gainesville CW 10 and its parent station has studios on Northwest 43rd Street in Gainesville.
Prior to the 2006 merger of UPN and the WB, the area's WB affiliate was operated by WGFL on a second digital subchannel and Cox channel 10. On September 18, WCJB-DT2 was launched to be the area's affiliate as part of the CW Plus service after UPN and The WB ceased broadcasting and merged. This took the channel location of WGFL-DT2 on Cox systems.
In June 2012, WCJB-DT2 started broadcasting in 720p high definition in June 2012, as The CW Plus recently began broadcasting in HD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/blog/index.php?post/2012/06/20/CW-HD-and-TSReader-Data |title=CW+ HD and TSReader Data - RabbitEars Blog |publisher=Rabbitears.info |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-06-26[/tpl]

==Newscasts==

Beginning February 2010, the channel stopped airing a weeknight 10 o'clock show on. Rather, it opted to rebroadcast the main channel's weeknight 6 o'clock show. Like all CW Plus affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone, WCJB-DT2 continues to air the nationally syndicated show The Daily Buzz on weekday mornings from 6 to 9. During the show, there are local weather cut-ins.
