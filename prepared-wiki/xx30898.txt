The group accuses Israel of apartheid and has recommended action against Israel at the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) and prosecution in various international courts. They also defend victims of alleged human rights abuses in both Israeli and Palestinian courts. A nearly daily newsletter reported all right violations. A monthly magazine was published in English and Arabic.
The organization seeks to further the cause of Palestinians through the law courts rather than through violence, but some Israelis accuse the group of selectively ignoring alleged crimes committed by the Palestinian Authority and presenting a unilateral position of a propagandist nature.[tpl]cite news |author=Scott Sherman |date=5 June 2006 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/target-ford |work=The Nation |title=Target Ford |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl]

===Misuse of donations controversy===

A 2004 investigation by some donors found that financial aid was misappropriated by LAW's Board.[tpl]cite news |author=Arnon Regular |date=25 March 2003 |title=Veteran Palestinian NGO suspected of defrauding donors |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/veteran-palestinian-ngo-suspected-of-defrauding-donors-1.15179 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] Soon after, many donors ceased funding. As a result, the organization had to lay off staff and to close down the office in Al-Ram. The LAW website has been inaccessible since 2005 which may indicate that the organization is no longer active.Internet Archive Wayback archives of http://www.lawsociety.org/AboutL/Index.html
