Dillon, Read & Co. was a prominent American investment bank from the 1920s into the 1960s.

==History==

===Origins===

Dillon Read traces its roots to 1832 with the founding of the Wall Street brokerage firm Carpenter & Vermilye. This firm was succeeded by Read & Company in which chief principal was William A. Read.The last partnerships: inside the great Wall Street money dynasties.  2001  An area of particular activity was underwriting the bonds of Latin American governments. However, it is best known for its actions during the 1920s.  During that time Clarence Dillon managed the rescue of faltering Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, engineered the buyout (in 1925) and subsequent sale of Dodge Motors (in 1928) to Chrysler, launched the first post-war closed-end investment trust (in 1924), and led the largest-ever stock offering (in 1926). By the end of the decade, Dillon Read was considered to be an investment-banking powerhouse, alongside J.P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co.

===Acquisition by SBC===

Dillon Read was purchased by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) in 1997 and merged with London-based investment bank S. G. Warburg & Co. (purchased by SBC in 1995) to become SBC Warburg Dillon Read. The merged entity then became part of UBS AG when the latter firm bought SBC.

===Dillon Read Capital Management===

The Dillon Read name was dropped by 2000 but recently re-emerged in the name of UBS's internal hedge-fund division, Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM), led by former UBS Investment Bank head John P. Costas . During its brief 18-month existence, DRCM launched a successful fund of US$1.2 billion (which was over-subscribed by 50%) for outside investors which returned 16.6% after fees, making it one of the top multi-strategy funds for 2007. 
On May 3, 2007, UBS announced the closure of Dillon Read Capital Management due to "operational complexities". DRCM had a loss of 3% of assets in UBS proprietary accounts  in the first quarter while the external hedge fund was profitable.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-ubs-results.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin&oref=slogin|title=UBS Posts Lower Earnings and Closes Hedge Fund | work=The New York Times[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]  According to Bloomberg, "In 2006, the fund, which invested in U.S. Treasuries, currencies, investment-grade corporate debt and mortgage securities, earned US$720 million in pretax profit, after fees, on revenue of US$1.2 billion, according to a person familiar with the figures." During 2007 after UBS took over the proprietary positions and eliminated market hedges in May 2007,  losses grew from approximately $100 million (1.5% loss) under Dillon Read management's oversight to "16% of the US$19 billion in losses UBS recorded"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a3sm9FOrsWcg|title=UBS $100 Billion Wager Prompted $24 Billion Loss in Nine Months | work=Bloomberg | date=18 May 2008[/tpl]  The April 2008 report by UBS to the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC, in German: Eidgenössische Bankenkommission, EBK, in French: Commission fédérale des banques, CFB) stated that UBS claimed while there was liquidity through the summer of 2007 that "by October 2007 that the assets could not be sold given the illiquidity in the market".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ubs.com/1/ShowMedia/investors/releases?contentId=140331&name=080418ShareholderReport.pdf|title=Shareholder report on UBS's writedowns[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aY0VAFwXBbeM&refer=news|title=UBS Scraps Costas's Hedge Fund After Mortgage Losses | work=Bloomberg | date=3 May 2007[/tpl]  Myret Zaki in the book, UBS: les dessous d'un scandale, asserts that had UBS listened to Dillon Read Management regarding the mortgage crisis that 99% of UBS' losses would have been avoided.
