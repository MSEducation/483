[[Beta hairpin]]

CATEGORIES: Protein structural motifs

The beta hairpin (sometimes also called beta-ribbon or beta-beta unit) is a simple protein structural motif involving two beta strands that look like a hairpin. The motif consists of two strands that are adjacent in primary structure, oriented in an antiparallel direction (the N-terminus of one sheet is adjacent to the C-terminus of the next), and linked by a short loop of two to five amino acids. Beta hairpins can occur in isolation or as part of a series of hydrogen bonded strands that collectively comprise a beta sheet.
Researchers such as Francisco Blanco et al. have used protein NMR to show that beta-hairpins can be formed from isolated short peptides in aqueous solution, suggesting that hairpins could form nucleation sites for protein folding.[tpl]cite journal |last=Blanco |first=F.

==Classification==

Beta hairpins were originally categorized solely by the number of amino acid residues in their loop sequences, such that they were named one-residue, two-residue, etc.Sibanda, B.L.; Blundell, T.L.; Thorton, J.M. (1985). "Conformations of Beta-Hairpins in Protein Structures".  Nature(London)   316  170–174. This system, however, is somewhat ambiguous as it does not take into account whether the residues that signal the end of the hairpin are singly or doubly hydrogen bonded to one another. An improved means of classification has since been proposed by Miner-White and Poet.Milner-White, J.; Poet, R. (1986). "Four Classes of Beta-Hairpins in Proteins".  Biochemical Journal   240  289–292. Beta hairpins are broken into four distinct classes as shown in the figure below. Each class begins with the smallest possible number of loop residues and progressively increases the loop size by removing hydrogen bonds in the beta sheet. The primary hairpin of class 1 is a one-residue loop where the bound residues share two hydrogen bonds. One hydrogen bond is then removed to create a three-residue loop, which is the secondary hairpin of class 1. Singly bound residues are counted in the loop sequence but also signal the end of the loop, thus defining this hairpin as a three-residue loop. This single hydrogen bond is then removed to create the tertiary hairpin; a five-residue loop with doubly bound residues. This pattern continues indefinitely and defines all beta hairpins within the class. Class 2 follows the same pattern beginning with a two-residue loop with terminating residues that share two hydrogen bonds.  Class 3 begins with a three-residue, and class 4 with a four-residue. Class 5 does not exist as that primary hairpin is already defined in class 1.
This classification scheme not only accounts for various degrees of hydrogen bonding, but also says something about the biological behavior of the hairpin. Single amino acid replacements may destroy a particular hydrogen bond, but will not unfold the hairpin or change its class. On the other hand, amino acid insertions and deletions will have to unfold and reform the entire beta strand in order to avoid a beta bulge in the secondary structure. This will change the class of the hairpin in the process. As substitutions are the most common amino acid mutations, a protein could potentially undergo a conversion without affecting the functionality of the beta hairpin.
