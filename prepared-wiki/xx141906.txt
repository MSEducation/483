CATEGORIES: Judge Dredd characters

Oola Blint AKA "The Angel of Mercy" was a character in Judge Dredd, along with her weak-willed husband Homer.
An outwardly friendly and nice person, she believed that she was doing people a favour by killing them as it brought them peace from the madness of Mega-City One. Homer didn't believe this but went along with it out of love for her. While the judges were aware of their killings, they proved unable to identify her.
In one occasion, she took advantage of a citywide war to kill more people. Judge Dredd Megazine 3.58
Her identity finally discovered by Dredd in "Shakedown" during a raid on an apartment block when crime levels in said block were at an all time high. Megazine #208 However, she ecaped to Brit-Cit (via Oz) with Homer and opened  legal a euthanasia clinic. Much to Homer's dismay, however, Oola began murdering people again (leading to Dredd being sent to Brit-Cit to investigate): she revealed her motive to be a sham when she admitted that killing wasn't the same when the victims "want it". She also revealed she intended to kill him as well, as a present for Christmas. Homer informed the Brit-Cit judges and they and Dredd raided the Blint's apartment block, but Oola had already fled after injecting her husband. Dredd managed to save his life and continued his pursuit. Oola willingly give herself up and both Blints were incarcerated for life for their crimes, in a couples block – but Oola refused to talk to Homer anymore. Prog 2005: "Christmas with the Blints"
