The British Ornithologists' Union (BOU) aims to encourage the study of birds ("ornithology") in Britain, Europe and around the world, in order to understand their biology and to aid their conservation. The BOU was founded in 1858 by Professor Alfred Newton, Henry Baker Tristram and other scientists.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bowdler Sharpe|first=R|title=Alfred Newton|journal=British Birds|year=1908|volume=1|pages=33â€“9|url=http://www.britishbirds.co.uk/search?id=9|accessdate=21 July 2013[/tpl]  Its quarterly journal, Ibis, has been published since 1859.
The British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) is a committee of the BOU established to maintain the British List, the official list of birds recorded in Great Britain.
