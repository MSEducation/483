==Music video==

The music video was directed by Steven Goldmann. The video starts out with a woman running out of the house, then with the duo playing while spinning around the house with everything rotting, and clocks with their hands turning quickly. At the end, the duo fades away, and the house appears to have rotted out, and the pages on the calendar that was flipping throughout the video are all gone.

==Chart positions==

"How Long Gone" debuted at number 70 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of June 29, 1998.
