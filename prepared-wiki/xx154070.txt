==About WCCD==

The first annual World Crohn's and Colitis Day (WCCD) was celebrated on May 23, 2007."First Annual World Crohn's and Colitis Day May 23", PRNewswire, May 22, 2007  The event was created by Josh Golder and recognized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, as well as by people from around the world.  Josh is a prominent figure and activist in the Crohn's and Colitis community (who himself has Crohn's disease), who directed and produced the internationally known, community-wide movie, "True Guts: Struggle and Triumph over Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis" (which is more commonly known as "True Guts").  Josh created WCCD as a way to bring people affected by either disease together, as well as friends and family members of those individuals, and even those who knew nothing about either disease in order to increase awareness of them.

===WCCD Events===

In a statement posted on his MySpace blog, Josh said, "The first World Crohn's and Colitis Day will not be big. The first Earth Day was pretty weak. So was the first a-lot-of-days. But this day is different anyway, and different already."  However, Josh was soon to find out how mistaken he was, as people from around the country, and even far away parts in the world recognized and celebrated WCCD.  
-  Josh set out on WCCD to the streets of Boston during the middle of the day to capture people on film and discuss the meaning of WCCD, and to promote awareness of it as well as the True Guts movie.  He approached 30 people and handed out free DVDs (need picture) and T-shirts (need picture) to further increase awareness and motivation about Crohn's disease and Colitis.
