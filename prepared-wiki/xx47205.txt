Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, [tpl]post-nominals|country=GBR|GCB|PC[/tpl] (30 September 1788 – 29 June 1855), known before 1852 as Lord FitzRoy Somerset, was a British Army officer. As a junior officer he served in the Peninsular War and the Hundred Days, latterly as military secretary to the Duke of Wellington. He also took part in politics as  Tory Member of Parliament for Truro before becoming Master-General of the Ordnance. He became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea in 1854: while his primary objective was to defend Constantinople he was ordered to besiege the Russian Port of Sevastopol. After an early success at the Battle of Alma, a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Despite further success at the Battle of Inkerman, a piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol in June 1855 was a complete failure. Somerset died later that month from a mixture of dysentery and clinical depression.

==Crimean War==

Somerset became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea with the temporary rank of full general on 21 February 1854[tpl]London Gazette|issue=21524|startpage=515|date=21 February 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] and was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 20 June 1854.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=21564|startpage=1931|date=22 June 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] While Somerset's primary objective was to defend Constantinople he was ordered by the Duke of Newcastle, who was at the time Secretary of State for War, to besiege the Russian Port of Sevastopol "unless it could not be undertaken with a reasonable prospect of success".Hibbert, p. 56 An Anglo-French force under the joint command of Somerset and General Jacques St. Arnaud defeated General Alexander Menshikov's Russian army at the Battle of Alma in September 1854.
At the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854, Somerset issued an order to the Earl of Lucan, his cavalry commander, who in turn ordered the Earl of Cardigan, a subordinate commander who happened to be Lucan's brother-in-law and who detested him, to lead the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade leading to some 278 British casualties.Calthorpe, p. 132 Despite an indecisive result at Balaclava the British and French allied army gained a victory at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and Somerset was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 5 November 1854.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=21630|startpage=3593|date=21 November 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] He was also awarded the Ottoman Empire Order of the Medjidie, 1st Class on 15 May 1855.[tpl]London Gazette|issue=21714|startpage=1915|date=18 May 1855|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]
Somerset was blamed by the press and the government for the sufferings of the British soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter before the Siege of Sevastopol owing to shortages of food and clothingMartin, p. 181 although this, in part, was the fault of the home authorities who failed to provide adequate logistical support. A piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol on 18 June 1855 was a complete failure. The anxieties of the siege began to seriously undermine Somerset's health and he died from a mixture of dysentery and clinical depression on 29 June 1855. His body was brought home and interred at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton.
Somerset had also served as honorary colonel of the 53rd Regiment of Foot[tpl]London Gazette|issue=18747|startpage=2420|date=19 November 1830|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] and then as honorary colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards (The Blues).[tpl]London Gazette|issue=21551|startpage=1442|date=9 May 1854|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] Cefntilla Court, Llandenny was built as a lasting memorial to Somerset in 1858: an inscription over the porch there reads:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5b3fa2e2-6194-11e3-916e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2sqle7ptC|title=How a family feud threatened the legacy of a Crimean War leader|publisher=Financial Times|date=27 December 27, 2013|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl] [tpl]quote|"This house with 238 acres of land was purchased by 1623 of the friends, admirers and comrades in arms of the late Field Marshal Lord Raglan GCB and presented by them to his son and his heirs for ever in a lasting memorial of affectionate regard and respect."[/tpl] A blue plaque was erected outside Somerset's house at Stanhope Gate in London in 1911.[tpl]cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/162|title=Lord Fitzroy Somerset Raglan, 1st Baron lived here|accessdate=9 February 2014[/tpl]
