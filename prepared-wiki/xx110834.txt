Lustre is a formally defined, declarative, and synchronous dataflow programming language for programming reactive systems. It began as a research project in the early 1980s. A formal presentation of the language can be found in the 1991 Proceedings of the IEEE.http://www6.in.tum.de/pub/Main/TeachingWs2009Echtzeitsysteme/procieee1991-3.pdf N. Halbwachs et al. The Synchronous Data Flow Programming Language LUSTRE. In Proc. IEEE 1991 Vol. 79, No. 9. Accessed 17 March 2014. In 1993 it progressed to practical, industrial use in a commercial product as the core language of the industrial environment SCADE, developed by Esterel Technologies. It is now used for critical control software in aircraft, helicopters, and nuclear power plants.
