Dedicated to the pursuit of education and humanitarian programs, the Texas Federation of Women's clubs was founded in 1897. The goal of a permanent state headquarters was realized with the construction of this building in the early 1930s. Designed by prominent Dallas architect Henry Coke Knight (1896â€“1966), it is one of the best examples of Georgian revival architecture in Texas and features a dominant central two-story portico and fine detailing.
