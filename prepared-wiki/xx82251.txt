</ref> Organolithium reagents are used in industry as an initiator for [[anionic polymerization]], which leads to the production of various [[elastomers]]. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=orglipharm>

Due to the large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and the lithium atom, the C-Li bond is highly ionic. This extremely polar nature of the C-Li bond makes organolithium reagents good nucleophiles and strong bases. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, sometimes pyrophoric. thumb|right|Glass bottles containing butyllithium

==History and development==

Studies of organolithium reagents began in the 1930 and were pioneered by Karl Ziegler, Georg Wittig, and Henry Gilman. These chemists found that in comparison with Grignard reagents, organolithium reagents can often perform the same reactions with increased rates and higher yields, such as in the case of metalation. Since then, organolithium reagents have surpassed Grignard reagents in usage. Ongoing research focuses on the nature of carbon-lithium bonding, structural studies of organolithium aggregates, chiral organolithium reagents and asymmetric synthesis, and the role of organolithium reagents in the preparation of new organometallic species.[ref]

==Structure==

Although simple alkyllithium species are often represented as monomer RLi, they exist as aggregates (oligomers) or polymers. 
Their structures depend on the nature of organic substituent and the presence of other ligands.[tpl]cite journal|last=Reich|first=Hans J.|title=Role of Organolithium Aggregates and Mixed Aggregates in Organolithium Mechanisms|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2013|volume=113|pages=7130â€“7178|doi=10.1021/cr400187u[/tpl] These structures have been elucidated by a variety of methods, notably 6Li, 7Li, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.

===Nature of carbon-lithium bond===

The relative electronegativities of carbon and lithium, indicates that the C-Li bond will be highly polar.[ref]

However, certain organolithium compounds possess properties such as solubility in nonpolar solvents that complicate the issue.
