==Early years and education==

Forster, a Roman Catholic, graduated from Brother Martin High School in New Orleans, then known as St. Aloysius High School. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tulane University in New Orleans and has been a fellow of the Institute of Politics at Loyola University in New Orleans. He is a past district chairman of the Boy Scouts of America. Forster is married to the former Stephanie Price.[tpl]cite web|url= http://enlou.com/officeholders/housedistrict98.htm|title=House District 98|publisher=enlou.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Forster formerly owned a direct mail company. He completed a specialty training course sponsored by the interest group, the National Federation of Independent Business.

==State representative==

In 1982, Forster won the House District 99 seat as a Democrat in a special election called because of the resignation of Republican Representative Lane Anderson Carson, who joined the administration of one-term Republican Governor David C. Treen. Forster prevailed thereafter in the regular elections of 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1995. His party conversion came in 1984, and the district was renumbered to 98. In the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary, also known as the jungle primary, Forster defeated Democratic opponent C. Joseph "Joe" Murray, 7,709 (54.6 percent) to 6,415 (45.4 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&rqsdta=10248736|title=Louisiana election returns, October 24, 1987|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In 1991, Forster won the primary outright by defeating three Democrats and an Independent with 57.7 percent of the vote.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&rqsdta=10199136|title=Louisiana election returns, October 19, 1991|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In 1995, Forster polled 52.6 percent in the primary against a Democrat, Norbert Rome and a Republican challenger, Joyce S. Sackett.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&rqsdta=10219536|title=Louisiana election returns, October 21, 1995|publisher=sos.louisiana.gov|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
On several occasions during the 1990s, Forster was honored by the interest group, the Alliance for Good Government. He also received the Monte Lehman Award from Louisiana Civil Service and was honored by the French Quarter Business Association for legislative achievements in promoting business. His district included the French Quarter. New Orleans businessman Rob Couhig, a leader in the efforts to revive the Orleans Parish Republican Party, was an early campaign manager for Forster.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.couhigpartners.com/team/couhig.php|title=Couhig Partners, LLC|publisher=couhigpartners.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]
As a legislator, Forster was a member of the nonpartisan and conservative American Legislative Exchange Council.

===Cockfighting===

Forster was an early vigorous advocate of a ban on cockfighting in Louisiana. In 1990, with the support of animal rights activists, he proposed two bills, one to ban the practice outright and the other to reclassify fowl as “animals” so that they could gain protection through laws banning animal cruelty. "We've been trying to get this thing passed for years, and we'll probably try again ...," Forster said.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-14/news/mn-233_1|title=Garry Boulard, Regional Report: Custom Survives: Cockfighting Dies Slow Death in Tradition-Bound Louisiana|publisher=The Los Angeles Times, June 14, 1990|accessdate=October 17, 2009 | date=June 14, 1990[/tpl]
A defender of cockfighting, then Representative Raymond "La La" Lalonde, then a Democrat from Sunset in St. Landry Parish, but who later switched parties, said that the practice is ingrained in Cajun heritage: “This is part of their culture and heritage, and they're not going to give up on this issue without a fight."
Cockfighting started in ancient Persia and was introduced into North America in the 18th century. In 1836, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the breeding and training of such birds. Louisiana was ultimately the last state in the Union to ban the practice, and the measure did not take effect until 2008. Only one House member dissented on the 2007 vote to ban cockfighting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=6493974|title=Louisiana State House Passes Cockfighting Ban|publisher=wafb.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] The first raid in Louisiana against an alleged cockfighting operation occurred in March 2009 in Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/acf/news/louisiana_cockfighting_bust_031809.html|title="Louisiana Cockfighting Bust Makes History", March 18, 2009|publisher=hsus.org|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]

===Successor===

On leaving the legislature, Forster was succeeded by another Democrat, who later turned Republican, but one more liberal than most Louisiana Republicans, Melinda Schwegmann, who in 1991 was elected to a single term as lieutenant governor. Schwegmann thereafter lost a bid for governor in 1995 and an attempt to return to the office of lieutenant governor in 2003.

==As labor secretary==

As secretary of labor, Forster’s assistant was Raj Jindal, mother of current Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.laworks.net/Downloads/LMI/1999laempwage.pdf|title=1999 Louisiana Employment and Wages|publisher=laworks.net|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl] Forster worked with Governor Foster to pursue the “one-stop” concept; that is, having different government offices in a centralized location to accelerate access by those needing services. A prototype of the concept was unveiled in Slidell in suburban St. Tammany Parish in 2001. Forster explained, accordingly: "All of the services that we offer in our regular offices, like computer training, placement services and Internet access, will now be available at the East St. Tammany Job Center. This is just another way that we are making things as easy as possible for anyone needing assistance."[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.workforceatm.org/articles/template.cfm?results_art_filename=laslidell.htm|title=Louisiana Department of Labor Opens On-Stop in Slidell|publisher=workforceatm.org|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]
Employers visiting the location can list job openings, recruit and interview applicants, and receive tax credits. They can also gain knowledge about subsidized training programs.
Forster and Foster came under fire from organized labor for having allegedly selected judges for the workers compensation program who were inclined to favor business over employees. The pair denied the charge. Governor Foster said: “All I've ever asked the department to do – as far as anybody we appointed – was just to get good, fair judges, not biased on either side.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.injuredworker.org/forums/injuredworker/posts/36.html|title=The Politics of Workers’ Compensation|publisher=injuredworker.org|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]
In a typical year at the time, Louisiana had some six thousand disputes over whether employees merit worker’s compensation. Forster portrayed the dispute as the result of labor’s opposition to changes that he launched when he became secretary: “Wake up and smell the coffee... This place is no longer run by the AFL-CIO. It's no longer 'just cut the check.'"
Forster said that he had quickly filled vacant worker’s compensation judgeships without regard to the political views of the candidates. Under Louisiana law, employers must pay all necessary medical costs for injuries sustained while at work. The injured can also obtain two-thirds of their regular salary but with a limit which changes over time. In order to pay such claims, employers either purchase insurance or pool resources with other companies to create a special fund.

==Radio program==

Forster and Anthony Patton, listed as a marketing entrepreneur, co-host a radio program on New Orleans FM station 99.5 FM. The website lists few details.[tpl]cite web|url= http://radiotime.com/program/p_125732/Anthony_Patton__Garey_Forster.aspx|title=Radio Time: Anthony Patton and Garey Forster|publisher=radiotime.com|accessdate=October 17, 2009[/tpl]
In May 2010, Forster substituted for several days for the statewide conservative radio host Moon Griffon of Monroe while Griffon was on a cruise in Hawaii.
