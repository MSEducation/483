==Synopsis==

At home in Africa, Tarzan assists Myrna, a photojournalist, and Ken, her associate, in their search for Erik Brunik, a thirteen-year-old boy lost in the jungle since he was seven years old.  Tarzan is assisted by his friend Buhara, whose brother Nagambi does not wish the boy found, and attempts to kill him before Tarzan saves the day.

==Production notes==

The movie was filmed on location in Brazil and along the Amazon River immediately after production of the previous film, Tarzan and the Great River.
All three of Mike Henry's Tarzan films were completed before the first (Tarzan and the Valley of Gold) was released in 1966.
The roles of opposing brothers Nagambi and Buhara were played by real life brothers Rafer and Ed Johnson.
Citing exhaustion and unsafe work conditions (Henry's jaw was bitten by the chimpanzee that was playing Cheeta, named Dinky in Tarzan and the Great River previously) Mike Henry bowed out of the Tarzan television series (for which he had been signed to play the lead) and sued Sy Weintraub's Banner Productions.  The case was settled for an undisclosed sum.  Ron Ely replaced him as Tarzan.
