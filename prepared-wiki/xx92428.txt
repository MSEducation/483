Hans Jakob "Jack" Steinberger (born May 25, 1921) is a physicist currently residing near Geneva, Switzerland. He co-discovered the muon neutrino, along with Leon Lederman and Melvin Schwartz, for which they were given the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Life==

Steinberger was born in the city of Bad Kissingen in Bavaria, Germany, in 1921.  The rise of the Nazi party in Germany, with its open anti-Semitism, prompted his parents, Berta and Ludwig Steinberger, who was a cantor and religious teacher,http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1988/steinberger-autobio.html to send him out of the country.
Steinberger emigrated to the United States at the age of 13, making the trans-Atlantic trip with his brother Herbert. Barnett Farroll cared for him as a foster child, the connection was made by Jewish charities in the United States. During this period, Steinberger attended New Trier Township High School, in Winnetka, Illinois.
Steinberger studied chemical engineering at Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) but left after his scholarship ended to help supplement his family's income. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the University of Chicago, in 1942.  Shortly thereafter,  he joined the Signal Corps at MIT.  With the help of the G.I. Bill, he returned to graduate studies at the University of Chicago in 1946, where he studied under Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi.  His Ph.D. thesis concerned the energy spectrum of electrons emitted in muon decay; his results showed that this was a three-body decay, and implied the participation of two neutral particle in the decay (later identified as the electron ([tpl]SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino[/tpl]) and muon ([tpl]SubatomicParticle|muon neutrino[/tpl]) neutrinos) rather than one.
As an atheist and a humanist, Steinberger is a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism.The International Academy of Humanism at the website of the Council for Secular Humanism.

He is the father of Ned Steinberger, founder of the eponymous company for headless guitars and basses.

==Early career==

After receiving his doctorate, Steinberger attended the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a year.  In 1949 he published a calculation of the lifetime of the neutral pion,[ref]

Following Princeton, Steinberger went to the Radiation Lab at the University of California at Berkeley, where he performed an experiment which demonstrated the production of neutral pions and their decay to photon pairs.  This experiment utilized the 330 MeV synchrotron and the newly invented scintillation counters.[ref]
