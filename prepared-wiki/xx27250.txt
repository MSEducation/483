   but in modern times the term without modification usually means tomato ketchup, sometimes called  tomato sauce, or red sauce.  It is a sweet and tangy sauce, typically made from tomatoes, vinegar, a sweetener, and assorted seasonings and spices.  The sweetener is most commonly sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Seasonings vary by recipe, but commonly include onions, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, garlic, and celery.  
Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment with various dishes that are usually served hot, including french fries (chips), hamburgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as a basis or ingredient for other sauces and dressings.  Mushroom ketchup is widely available in the UK.The Independent 5 June 1999, Condiments to the Chef

==History==

In the 17th century (?) the Chinese mixed a concoction of pickled fish and spices and called it (in the Amoy dialect) kôe-chiap or kê-chiap (鮭汁, Mandarin Chinese guī zhī, Cantonese gwai1 zap1) meaning the brine of pickled fish (鮭, salmon; 汁, juice) or shellfish.
By the early 18th century, the table sauce had made it to the Malay states (present day Malaysia and Singapore), where it was discovered by English explorers. The Indonesian-Malay word for the sauce was kecap (pronounced "kay-chap"). That word evolved into the English word "ketchup".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ketchup |title=Ketchup - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-26[/tpl] English settlers took ketchup with them to the American colonies.
Many variations of ketchup were created, but the tomato-based version did not appear until about a century after other types. By 1801, a recipe for tomato ketchup was created by Sandy Addison and was later printed in an American cookbook, the Sugar House Book.Taken from "The Sugar House Book", 1801.
James Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in The Virginia Housewife (an influential 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin). American cooks also began to sweeten ketchup in the 19th century.Elizabeth Rozin (1994). The Primal Cheeseburger. New York: Penguin books. ISBN 978-0-14-017843-2.
As the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the United States. Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were.[tpl]cite web|title=Tomato History: From Poison to Obsession|url=http://www.tomatogardeningguru.com/history.html[/tpl] Many Americans[tpl]who|date=August 2013[/tpl] continued to question whether it was safe to eat raw tomatoes. However, they were much less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.
Tomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. A man named Jonas Yerks (or Yerkes) is believed[tpl]by whom|date=August 2013[/tpl] to have been the first man to make tomato ketchup a national phenomenon. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally.[ref]Quentin R.Skrabec,H.J. Heinz: a biography
