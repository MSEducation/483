Measles is extremely infectious and its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities which generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized in measles by Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the Critical community size.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=M.S.|title=Measles periodicity and community size|journal=J.

Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. In Ireland, vaccination was introduced in 1985. There were 99,903 cases that year. Within two years, the number of cases had fallen to 201, but this fall was not sustained. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the Measles Initiative: the American Red Cross, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005.

==History and culture==

===History===

The Antonine Plague, 165–180 AD, also known as the Plague of Galen, who described it, was probably smallpox or measles. The disease killed as many as one-third of the population in some areas, and decimated the Roman army.Plague in the Ancient World Estimates of the timing of evolution of measles seem to suggest this plague was something other than measles. The first scientific description of measles and its distinction from smallpox and chickenpox is credited to the Persian physician Rhazes (860–932), who published The Book of Smallpox and Measles.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Harminder S. Dua, Ahmad Muneer Otri|first=Arun D. Singh|year=2008|title=Abu Bakr Razi|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|publisher=BMJ Group|volume=92|page=1324[/tpl] Given what is now known about the evolution of measles, this account is remarkably timely.
Measles is an endemic disease, meaning it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of Honduras, and had ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.[ref][tpl]Cite book | first = Joseph Patrick | last = Byrne | title = Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A–M | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA413&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2008 | page = 413 | isbn = 0-313-34102-8 [/tpl]

Some experts stated that the persistence of the disease in Europe could be a stumbling block to global eradication.  It has proven difficult to vaccinate a sufficient number of children in Europe to eradicate the disease, because of opposition on philosophical or religious grounds, or fears of side-effects, or because some minority groups are hard to reach, or simply because parents forget to have their children vaccinated.  Vaccination is not mandatory in some countries in Europe, in contrast to the United States and many Latin American countries, where children must be vaccinated before they enter school.
