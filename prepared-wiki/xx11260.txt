==History==

The first marketed soft drinks in the Western world appeared in the 17th century.  They were made of water and lemon juice sweetened with honey.  In 1676, the Compagnie des Limonadiers of Paris was granted a monopoly for the sale of lemonade soft drinks.  Vendors carried tanks of lemonade on their backs and dispensed cups of the soft drink to thirsty Parisians.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |year= |title =Soft Drink |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher= |location=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/552397/soft-drink |id= [/tpl]

===Carbonated drinks===

In the late 18th century, scientists made important progress in replicating naturally carbonated mineral waters. In 1767, Englishman Joseph Priestley first discovered a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water[tpl]cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blJosephPriestley.htm |title=Joseph Priestley — Soda Water — Joseph Priestley |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl] when he suspended a bowl of distilled water above a beer vat at a local brewery in Leeds, England. His invention of carbonated water (also known as soda water) is the major and defining component of most soft drinks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truetex.com/priestley-1772-impregnating_water_with_fixed_air.pdf |title=Impregnating Water with Fixed Air |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl]
Priestley found that water treated in this manner had a pleasant taste, and he offered it to friends as a refreshing drink. In 1772, Priestley published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air in which he describes dripping oil of vitriol (or sulfuric acid as it is now called) onto chalk to produce carbon dioxide gas, and encouraging the gas to dissolve into an agitated bowl of water.
Another Englishman, John Mervin Nooth, improved Priestley's design and sold his apparatus for commercial use in pharmacies. Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman invented a generating apparatus that made carbonated water from chalk by the use of sulfuric acid. Bergman's apparatus allowed imitation mineral water to be produced in large amounts. Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius started to add flavors (spices, juices, and wine) to carbonated water in the late eighteenth century.

===Soda fountain pioneers===

Artificial mineral waters, usually called "soda water", and the soda fountain were mostly popular in the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Beginning in 1806, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman sold soda waters in New Haven, Connecticut. He used a Nooth apparatus to produce his waters. Businessmen in Philadelphia and New York City also began selling soda water in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, John Matthews of New York City and John Lippincott of Philadelphia began manufacturing soda fountains. Both men were successful and built large factories for fabricating fountains.

===Soda fountains vs. bottled sodas===

In 19th century America, the drinking of either natural or artificial mineral water was considered a healthy practice. The American pharmacists selling mineral waters began to add herbs and chemicals to unflavored mineral water. They used birch bark (see birch beer), dandelion, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts, and other substances. Flavorings were also added to improve the taste. Pharmacies with soda fountains became a popular part of American culture. Many Americans frequented the soda fountain on a daily basis. Due to problems in the U.S. glass industry, bottled drinks were a small portion of the market in the 19th century. (However, they were known in England. In The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, published in 1848, the caddish Huntingdon, recovering from months of debauchery, wakes at noon and gulps a bottle of soda-water.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZEVaAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA198&vq=soda&dq=%22tenant+of+Wildfell+Hall%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1 |title=Wildfell Hall, ch. 30 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl]) In America, most soft drinks were dispensed and consumed at a soda fountain, usually in a drugstore or ice cream parlor. In the early 20th century, sales of bottled soda increased exponentially. In the second half of the 20th century, canned soft drinks became an important share of the market.

===Soft drink bottling industry===

Over 1,500 U.S. patents were filed for either a cork, cap, or lid for the carbonated drink bottle tops during the early days of the bottling industry. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas. Inventors were trying to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. In 1892, the "Crown Cork Bottle Seal" was patented by William Painter, a Baltimore, Maryland machine shop operator. It was the first very successful method of keeping the bubbles in the bottle.

====Automatic production of glass bottles====

In 1899, the first patent was issued for a glass-blowing machine for the automatic production of glass bottles. Earlier glass bottles had all been hand-blown. Four years later, the new bottle-blowing machine was in operation. It was first operated by the inventor, Michael Owens, an employee of Libby Glass Company. Within a few years, glass bottle production increased from 1,400 bottles a day to about 58,000 bottles a day.

====Home-Paks and vending machines====

During the 1920s, "Home-Paks" were invented. "Home-Paks" are the familiar six-pack cartons made from cardboard. Vending machines also began to appear in the 1920s. Since then, soft drink vending machines have become increasingly popular. Both hot and cold drinks are sold in these self-service machines throughout the world.

==Production==

===Soft drink production===

Soft drinks are made by mixing dry ingredients and/or fresh ingredients (for example, lemons, oranges, etc.) with water. Production of soft drinks can be done at factories or at home.
Soft drinks can be made at home by mixing either a syrup or dry ingredients with carbonated water. Carbonated water is made using a soda siphon or a home carbonation system or by dropping dry ice into water. Syrups are commercially sold by companies such as Soda-Club; dry ingredients are often sold in pouches, in the style of the popular U.S. drink mix Kool-Aid.
Drinks like ginger ale and root beer are often brewed using yeast to cause carbonation.

===Ingredient quality===

Of most importance is that the ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters. This is not only the functional parameter (in other words, the level of the major constituent), but the level of impurities, the microbiological status, and physical parameters such as color, particle size, etc.[tpl]cite book | last = Ashurst | first = P. | title = Soft drink and fruit juice problems solved | publisher = Woodhead Publishing Limited | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-84569-326-8[/tpl]

====Potential alcohol content====

A report in October 2006 demonstrated that some soft drinks contain measurable amounts of alcohol. In some older preparations, this resulted from natural fermentation used to build the carbonation. In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for carbonation, but there is some speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in an unsterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/mymasjid@yahoogroups.com/msg00028.html |title=myMasjid.com.my Alcohol: In soft drinks |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=2004-11-08 |accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl]
