==Career==

===1994–2007: Lareine===

In August 1994, Mayu and Kamijo (then using the name Shoki) met for the first time while they were working as roadies for Malice Mizer. The same year, in November, they decide to form a band together, which they named Laliene ru cheri, commonly called just Laliene; named that way for the French Queen Marie Antoinette. Along with guitarist Sakuren and drummer Kyouka, they begin to play. Later bass player Emiru entered the band, completing the first line-up.http://www.visunavi.com
In March, 1996, Laliene held a live concert for their first anniversary, where they changed the name of the band to Lareine. That same year they released their first recording "Saikai no Hana", distributed freely at the anniversary concert in a limited number of 100 copies. After many years of releasing many albums, EPs and singles, during a short separation of the band, Kamijo created the band New Sodmy, and recorded two albums and five singles.http://www.jame-world.com/us/artists-biography-36-lareine.html
