Sled dogs (also sledge dogs and sleigh dogs[tpl]cite book|author=Alistair Macleod|editor=Jeanne Schinto|title=The Literary Dog: Great Contemporary Dog Stories|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aaAX7PKgLSoC&pg=PA49|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=12 January 1994|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|isbn=978-0-87113-504-9|pages=41–56|chapter=Winter Dog[/tpl]) are a group of dog breeds and mongrels that, historically, were bred for the purpose of pulling a dog sled. These dog sleds were important for transportation in arctic areas, hauling supplies in areas that were inaccessible by other methods. They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush. Until snowmobiles became reliable, sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska and northern Canada.
Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Alaska and Canada and throughout Greenland. They are also used for recreational purposes, and are raced in events known as dog sled races such as the Iditarod and the Yukon Quest. Numerous sled dog breeds are also kept as pets or raised as show dogs.

==History==

Sled dogs probably evolved in Mongolia between 35,000 and 30,000 years ago. Scientists believe that humans migrated north of the Arctic Circle with their dogs 25,000 years ago, and began using them to pull sleds 3,000 years ago, when hunting and fishing communities were forced north to Siberia by pastoralists.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=-9Nh2I9J0mUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sled+dogs | title=Sled Dogs: Powerful Miracle | publisher=Bearport Publishing | author=Person, Stephen | year=2011 | pages=4–10 | isbn=1617721344[/tpl] Sled dogs have been used in Canada, Lapland, Greenland, Siberia, Chukotka, Norway, Finland, and Alaska.[tpl]cite book | title=Born to Pull: The Glory of Sled Dogs | publisher=U of Minnesota Press | author=Cary, Bob | year=2009 | location=Minneapolis, Minnesota | pages=7–11 | isbn=081666773X | url=http://books.google.com/?id=bLSw9pATz5gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sled+dogs | others=Illustrated by Gail De Marcken[/tpl]

===North America===

Historical references of the dogs and dog harnesses that were used by Native American cultures date back to before European contact.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.yukonquest.com/site/sled-dogs-in-the-north/ | title=Sled Dogs in the North | publisher=Yukon Quest | work=Yukon Quest Sled Dogs | accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl] The use of dogs as draft animals was widespread in North America. There were two main kinds of sled dogs; one kind is kept by coastal cultures, and the other kind is kept by interior cultures such as the Athabascan Indians. These interior dogs formed the basis of the Alaskan Husky. Russian traders following the Yukon River inland in the mid-1800s acquired sled dogs from the interior villages along the river. The dogs of this area were reputed to be stronger and better at hauling heavy loads than the native Russian sled dogs.
The Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter.[tpl]cite book | title=Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Martin, Elizabeth Libbie | year=2012 | location=Mount Pleasant, South Carolina | isbn=0738596272 | page=11 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=scRaxgw1QiYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sled+dogs[/tpl] "Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team; prospectors, trappers, doctors, mail, commerce, trade, freighting of supplies … if it needed to move in winter, it was moved by sled dogs." This, along with the dogs' use in the exploration of the poles, led to the late 1800s and early 1900s being nicknamed the "Era of the Sled Dog".[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2156-11-71.pdf | title=A genetic dissection of breed composition and performance enhancement in the Alaskan sled dog | author=Huson, Heather J | journal=BMC Genetics |date=July 2010 | doi=10.1186/1471-2156-11-71 | author2=Parker, Heidi G | author3=Runstadler, Jonathan | author4=Ostrander, Elaine A | volume=11 | page=71 | pmid=20649949 | pmc=2920855[/tpl]
Sled dogs were used to deliver the mail in Alaska during the late 1800s and early 1900s.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/dogsled-mail-alaska | title=Dogsled mail in Alaska | publisher=Alaska Dispatch | date=June 2, 2011 | accessdate=February 18, 2013 | author=Hegener, Helen[/tpl] Malamutes were the favored breed, with teams averaging eight to ten dogs. Dogs were capable of delivering mail in conditions that would stop boats, trains, and horses. Each team hauled between [tpl]convert|500|and|700|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl] of mail. The mail was stored in waterproofed bags to protect it from the snow. By 1901, dog trails had been established along the entirety of the Yukon River. Mail delivery by dog sled came to an end in 1963 when the last mail carrier to use a dog sled, Chester Noongwook of Savoonga, retired. He was honored by the US Postal Service in a ceremony on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea.
Airplanes took over Alaskan mail delivery in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1924, Carl Ben Eielson flew the first Alaskan airmail delivery.[tpl]cite book | title=The Iditarod: Story of the Last Great Race | publisher=Capstone Classroom | author=Young, Ian | year=2002 | pages=5–13 | isbn=073689523X | url=http://books.google.com/?id=FLfNdyiDs-EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | others=Illustrated by Timothy V. Rasinski[/tpl] Dogsleds were used to patrol western Alaska during World War II. Highways and trucking in the 40s and 50s, and the snowmobile in the 50s and 60s, contributed to the decline of the working sled dog.
Recreational mushing came into place to maintain the tradition of dog mushing. The desire for larger, stronger, load-pulling dogs changed to one for faster dogs with high endurance used in racing, which caused the dogs to become lighter than they were historically.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.yukonquest.com/site/modern-sled-dog/ | title=The Modern Sled Dog | publisher=Yukon Quest | work=Yukon Quest Sled Dogs | accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl] Americans then began to import Siberian Huskies to increase the speed of their own dogs, presenting "a direct contrast to the idea that Russian traders sought heavier draft-type sled dogs from the Interior regions of Alaska and the Yukon less than a century earlier to increase the hauling capacity of their lighter sled dogs."
Outside of Alaska, dog-drawn carts were used to haul peddler's wares in cities like New York.[tpl]cite book|title=Outing: Sport, Adventure, Travel, Fiction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fhygAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA134|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1901|publisher=W.

====Nome, Alaska and the Iditarod====

In 1925, there was a diphtheria outbreak in Nome, Alaska. There was not enough serum in Nome to treat the number of people infected by the disease. There was serum in Nenana, but the town was [tpl]convert|700|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] away, and inaccessible except by dog sled. A dog sled relay was set up by the villages between Nenana and Nome, and 20 teams worked together to relay the serum to Nome. The serum reached Nome in six days.
The Iditarod Trail was established on the path between these two towns. It was known as the Iditarod Trail because, at the time, Iditarod was the largest town on the trail. During the 1940s, the trail fell into disuse. However, in 1967, Dorothy Page, who was conducting Alaska's centennial celebration, ordered [tpl]convert|9|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] of the trail to be cleared for a dog sled race. In 1972, the US Army performed a survey of the trail, and in 1973 the Iditarod was established by Joe Redington, Sr. The race was won by Dick Wilmarth, who took three weeks to complete the race.
The modern Iditarod is a [tpl]convert|1100|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|disp=flip[/tpl]  endurance sled dog race.[tpl]cite book|author1=Lew Freedman|author2=DeeDee Jonrowe|title=Iditarod Dreams: A Year in the Life of Alaskan Sled Dog Racer DeeDee Jonrowe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UwvE_67z8TQC|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=1995|publisher=Epicenter Press|isbn=978-0-945397-29-8|pages=11–15|chapter=Introduction[/tpl] It usually lasts for ten to eleven days, weather permitting. It begins with a ceremonial start in Anchorage, Alaska on the morning of the first Saturday in March, with mushers running [tpl]convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] to Eagle River along the Alaskan Highway, giving spectators a  chance to see the dogs and the mushers.[tpl]cite book|author1=Lew Freedman|author2=DeeDee Jonrowe|title=Iditarod Dreams: A Year in the Life of Alaskan Sled Dog Racer DeeDee Jonrowe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UwvE_67z8TQC|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=1995|publisher=Epicenter Press|isbn=978-0-945397-29-8|pages=25–33|chapter=The Race Is On[/tpl] The teams are then loaded onto trucks and driven [tpl]convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] to Wasilla for the official race start in the afternoon. The race ends when the last musher either drops out of the race or crosses the finish line in Nome. The winner of the race receives a prize of US$50,000. It has been billed as the "World Series of mushing events"[tpl]cite book|author1=Lew Freedman|author2=DeeDee Jonrowe|title=Iditarod Dreams: A Year in the Life of Alaskan Sled Dog Racer DeeDee Jonrowe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UwvE_67z8TQC|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=1995|publisher=Epicenter Press|isbn=978-0-945397-29-8|pages=17–23|chapter=The Starting Line[/tpl] and "The Last Great Race on Earth".[tpl]cite book|author=Janet Woolum|title=Outstanding Women Athletes: Who They Are and How They Influenced Sports in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DWmCWO6SpsYC&pg=PA94|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-57356-120-4|pages=94–96|chapter=Susan Butcher (dog-sled racer)[/tpl]

====Arctic expedition====

The first Arctic explorers were men with sled dogs.[tpl]cite book|author=William J. Mills|title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&pg=PA192|accessdate=27 February 2013|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-422-0|pages=189–192[/tpl]

====Antarctic expedition====

Due to the success of using sled dogs in the Arctic, it was thought they would be helpful in the Antarctic exploration as well, and many explorers made attempts to use them. Sled dogs were used until 1992, when they were banned from Antarctica by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
Carsten Borchgrevink used sled dogs in Antarctica in 1898, but it was much colder than expected at Cape Adare. The dogs were used to working on snow, not on ice, in much milder temperatures. The dogs were also inadequately fed, and eventually all of the dogs died
Erich von Dryhalski used sled dogs in his expedition in his 1901–1903 expedition, and fared much better because his dogs were used to the cold and he hired an experienced dog handler. His dogs were allowed to breed freely and many had to be shot because there was no room on the ship to take them home. Many that were not shot were left behind on the Kerguelen Islands.
Otto Nordenskjold intended to use sled dogs in his 1901–1904 expedition, but all but four of his dogs died on the journey south. He picked up more dogs in the Falklands, but these were all killed upon his arrival by Ole Jonassen's huskies, as Ole had not bothered to tether his dogs. These huskies were later able to pull [tpl]convert|265|kg|lb|abbr=off[/tpl] over [tpl]convert|18|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] in three and a half hours.
Robert Falcon Scott bought twenty Samoyeds with him. The dogs struggled under the conditions Scott placed them in, with four dogs pulling heavily loaded sleds through [tpl]convert|45|cm|in|adj=mid|-deep[/tpl] snow with bleeding feet. Scott blamed their failure on rotten dried fish.
Roald Amundsen's expedition was planned around ninety-seven sled dogs. On his first try, two of his dogs froze to death in the [tpl]convert|-56|C[/tpl] temperatures. He tried a second time and was successful. Amundsen was covering [tpl]convert|17|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] a day, with stops every [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=flip[/tpl] to build a cairn to mark the trail. He had fifty five dogs with him, which he culled until he had 14 left when he returned from the pole. On the return trip, a man skied ahead of the dogs and hid meat in the cairns to encourage them to run.

==Sled dog breeds==

The original sled dogs were chosen for size, strength and stamina, but modern dogs are bred for speed and endurance [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.yukonquest.com/site/modern-sled-dog/ | title=The Modern Sled Dog | publisher=Yukon Quest | work=Yukon Quest Sled Dogs | accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl] Most sled dogs weigh around [tpl]convert|25|kg[/tpl], but they can weigh as little as [tpl]convert|16|kg[/tpl], and can exceed [tpl]convert|32|kg[/tpl].  Sled dogs have a very efficient gait, and "mushers strive for a well balanced dog team that matches all dogs for both size (approximately the same) and gait (the walking, trotting or running speeds of the dogs as well as the 'transition speed' where a dog will switch from one gait to another) so that the entire dog team moves in similar a fashion which increases overall team efficiency." They can run up to [tpl]convert|45|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. Because of this, sled dogs have very tough, webbed feet with closely spaced toes. Their webbed feet act as snow shoes.
A dog's fur depends its use. Freight dogs should have dense, warm coats to hold heat in, and sprint dogs have short coats that let heat out. Most sled dogs have a double coat, with the outer coat keeping snow away from the body, and a waterproof inner coat for insulation. In warm weather, dogs may have problems regulating their body temperature and may overheat. Their tails serve to protect their nose and feet from freezing when the dog is curled up to sleep. They also have a unique arrangement of blood vessels in their legs to help protect against frostbite.
Appetite is a big part of choosing sled dogs; picky dogs off trail may be pickier on the trail. They are fed high-fat diets, and on the trail may eat oily salmon or blubbery sea mammals. Sled dogs also must not be overly aggressive with other dogs.

====Alaskan Husky====

The most commonly used dog in dog sled racing,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/sled-dogs-an-alaskan-epic/introduction/3146/ | title=Sled Dogs: An Alaskan Epic | publisher=PBS | date=November 1999 | accessdate=February 15, 2013[/tpl] the Alaskan Husky is a mongrel bred specifically for its performance as a sled dog. They first came into existence in the late 1800s. Occasionally, Alaskan Huskies are referred to as Indian Dogs, because the best ones supposedly come from Native American villages in the Alaskan and Canadian interiors. They weigh between [tpl]convert|40|and|75|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl] and may have dense or sleek fur. Alaskan Huskies bear little resemblance to the typical husky breeds they originated from, or to each other.
There are two genetically distinct varieties of Alaskan Husky: A sprinting group and a long-distance group.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2156-11-71.pdf | title=A genetic dissection of breed composition and performance enhancement in the Alaskan sled dog | author=Huson, Heather J | journal=BMC Genetics |date=July 2010 | doi=10.1186/1471-2156-11-71 | author2=Parker, Heidi G | author3=Runstadler, Jonathan | author4=Ostrander, Elaine A | volume=11 | page=71 | pmid=20649949 | pmc=2920855[/tpl] Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies contributed the most genetically to the long-distance group, while Pointers and Salukis contributed the most to the sprinting group. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs contributed a strong work ethic to both varieties. There are many Alaskan Huskies that are partially Greyhound, which improves their speed. Although some Alaskan Huskies are known to be part wolf, which increases their endurance, these wolfdogs are generally disliked since they have a reputation of being difficult to control.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Alaskan Malamute====

Malamutes are large, strong freight-type dogs. They weigh between [tpl]convert|80|and|120|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl] and have round faces with soft features. Freight dogs are a class of dogs that includes both pedigree and non-pedigree dogs. Malamutes are thought to be one of the first domesticated breeds of dogs, originating in the Kotzebue Sound region of Alaska.[tpl]cite book|author=Betsy Sikora Siino|title=Alaskan Malamutes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tsWvW3IYGHUC|accessdate=27 June 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-3676-4|pages=6–7[/tpl] These dogs are known for their broad chests, thick coats, and tough feet. Speed has little to no value for these dogs - instead, the emphasis is on pulling strength. They are used in expedition and long adventure trips, and for hauling heavy loads. Malamutes were the dog of choice for hauling and messenger work in World War II. [tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Canadian Eskimo Dog====

Also known as the Exquimaux Husky, Esquimaux Dog, and Qimmiq, the Canadian Eskimo Dog has its origins in the aboriginal sled dogs used by the Thule people of Arctic Canada.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/breed_info/br618.html | title=Canadian Eskimo Dog | publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club | accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl] The breed as it exists today was primarily developed through the work of the Canadian government. It is capable of pulling between [tpl]convert|45|and|80|kg|lb[/tpl] per dog for distances between [tpl]convert|15|and|70|mi|km|disp=flip[/tpl]. The Canadian Eskimo Dog was also used as a hunting dog, helping Inuit hunters to catch seals, musk ox, and polar bears.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Chinook====

The Chinook is a drafting and sled dog developed in New Hampshire in the early 1900s, and is a blend of Mastiff, Greenland Husky, German Shepherd, and Belgian Shepherd.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dogchannel.com/dogsinreview/news/2013/01/15/new-akc-breeds.aspx | title=AKC Recognizes Two New Breeds for 2013 | publisher=Dog Channel | date=February 20, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl] It is the state dog of New Hampshire and was recognized by the AKC as a Working breed in 2013. Its name means "warm winter winds" in Inuit. They are described as athletic and "hard bodied" with a "tireless gait".[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Greenland Dog====

Eskimo dogs that originated in Greenland, Greenland Dogs are heavy dogs with high endurance but little speed. They are frequently used by people offering dog sled adventures and long expeditions. There are more than 30,000 Greenland Dogs living in Greenland.[tpl]cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDv3hVcc8A | title=Human Planet – Arctic: Greenland sled dogs | publisher=ABC1 | date=March 10, 2011 | medium=Video[/tpl] In the winter, they are a primary mode of transportation. Most hunters in Greenland favor dog sled teams over snowmobiles as the dog sled teams are more reliable.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Samoyed====

The Samoyed was developed by the Samoyede people of Siberia, who used them to herd reindeer and hunt in addition to hauling sleds.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/samoyed/index.cfm | title=Get To Know The Samoyed | publisher=American Kennel Club | work=Meet The Breed | accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl] These dogs were so prized, and the people who owned them so dependent upon them for survival, that the dogs were allowed to sleep in the tents with their owners.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Siberian Husky====

Smaller than the similar-appearing Malamute, the Siberian Husky pulls more, pound for pound, than a malamute, but cannot pull as long. They weigh between [tpl]convert|40|and|60|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl], and have been selectively bred for both appearance and pulling ability.[tpl]clear[/tpl]

====Other Breeds====

Numerous non-sled dog breeds have been used as sled dogs. Poodles,[tpl]cite web | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1127077/index.htm | title=The Very Latest In Mushing: Poodle-powered Sleds | publisher=Sports Illustrated | date=March 7, 1988 | accessdate=2013-06-27 | author=Thornton, James S.[/tpl] Irish setters, German shorthaired pointers, Labrador retrievers, Newfoundlands, and St. Bernards have all been used to pull sleds in the past.

==Famous Sled Dogs==

===Togo===

Togo was the lead sled dog of Leonhard Seppala and his dog sled team in the 1925 serum run to Nome across central and northern Alaska.

===Balto===

Balto was the lead dog of the sled dog team that carried the diphtheria serum on the last leg of the relay to Nome during the 1925 diphtheria epidemic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/sled-dogs-an-alaskan-epic/balto/3145/ | title=Sled Dogs: An Alaskan Epic: Balto | publisher=PBS | work=Nature | accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl] He was driven by musher Gunnar Kaasen, who worked for Leonhard Seppala. Seppala had also bred Balto.
In 1925, ten months after Balto completed his run,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/balto.html | title=Balto | publisher=Central Park Conservancy | work=Things To See | accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl] a bronze statue was erected in his honour in Central Park near the Tisch Children's Zoo.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/balto.html | title=Balto | publisher=Central Park.Com | work=Attractions | accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl]  The statue was sculpted by Frederick George Richard Roth. Children frequently climb the statue to pretend to ride on the dog. The plaque at the base of the statue reads "Endurance · Fidelity · Intelligence". Balto's body was stuffed following his death in 1933, and is on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
In 1995, a Universal Pictures movie based on his life, Balto, was released. Roger Ebert gave it three of four stars.[tpl]cite web | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19951222/REVIEWS/512220301/1023 | title=Balto | publisher=rogerebert.com | date=December 22, 1995 | accessdate=March 4, 2013 | author=Ebert, Roger[/tpl]
