Northampton [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Northampton.ogg|n|ɔr|ˈ|θ|æ|m|p|t|ən[/tpl] is a large town, borough, non-metropolitan district and the county town of Northamptonshire in the East Midlands region of England. It lies on the River Nene, situated about [tpl]convert|67|mi|km|0[/tpl] north-west of London and around [tpl]convert|50|mi|km|0[/tpl] south-east of Birmingham. With a population of 212,100 recorded in the 2011 census, Northampton is one of the largest urban centres in the United Kingdom without city status and is the most populous non-metropolitan district of England.
Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by King Richard I in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by King John in 1215. The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460.
Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The town also suffered the Great Fire of Northampton (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union Canal and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and leather manufacture.
After the World Wars, Northampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a New Town in 1968, accelerating development in the town. Northampton unsuccessfully applied for unitary status in 1996 and city status in 2000; the town continues to expand with many areas undergoing urban renewal.

==History==

===Etymology===

The earliest reference to Northampton in writing occurred in 914 under the name of Ham tune. The prefix "North" was added to distinguish it from other towns called "Hampton".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=445DFDCCA215340BB5C3C71703542FC1?text_id=977650&word=NULL |title=NORTHAMPTON | As described in John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870-72) |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] The Domesday Book (1086) records the town as Northantone, which evolved into Norhamptone by the 13th century and later Northampton by the 17th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47460 |title=Charles II, 1675 - An Act for the better and more easy rebuilding the Towne of Northampton. | Statutes of the Realm: volume 5 (pp. 798-801) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=2003-06-22 |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl]

===Ancient===

Present-day Northampton is the latest in a series of settlements that began in the Bronze Age. Remains found in the Briar Hill district show evidence of a Neolithic encampment within a large circular earthwork where local farmers assembled for tribal ceremonies and seasonal events from approximately 3500 BC to 2000 BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/mapping-ancient-landscapes-northamptonshire/mapping-ancient-landscapes-in-northamptonshire-chp6-7.pdf|title=Late Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman settlements and landscapes|publisher=english-heritage.org.uk|first=Alison|last=Deegan|accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northamptonshiretimeline.com/scene/3500bc-briar-hill/|title=3500 BC: First Settlements at Briar Hill|publisher=Northamptonshire Timeline|accessdate=2013-07-17[/tpl]
During the British Iron Age, people typically lived in protected hill forts. Present-day Hunsbury Hill is an example of this settlement; a circular ditch and a bank faced with a wall of timber and enclosing an area of [tpl]convert|160|acres|0|abbr=on[/tpl] which dates to around 400 BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northamptonshiretimeline.com/scene/400bc-hunsbury-hillfort/|title=400 BC: Hillfort Begun at Hunsbury Hill in Northampton|publisher=Northamptonshire Timeline|accessdate=2013-07-17[/tpl] In the Roman period, a small rural settlement is thought to have existed in the present-day district of Duston; remains of Roman pottery were found there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paintedpixels.co.uk/northampton/northampton/roman.html|title=Roman remains|publisher=Paintedpixels.co.uk|first=Tony|last=Doyle|accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl]
Following Danish invasion, the central area of the town was turned into a stronghold called a burh and became the base for one of the Danish armies in 850. A ditch was dug around the settlement and it was fortified with earth ramparts.[tpl]cite web|title=An Archaeological Resource Assessment and Research Agenda for the  Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon Period (c. 400-850) in the East Midlands|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/publications/documents/emidas_000.pdf|publisher=le.ac.uk|first=Alan|last=Vince|accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl] Having conquered Mercia, the Danes turned the settlement into a centre for military and administrative purposes, which was part of the Danelaw.

By 918, Northampton had an earl and an army dependent upon it, whose territory extended to the River Welland.
The settlement was recovered by Edward the Elder the same year, turning it into the centre of one of the new shires, which prospered as a river port and trading centre. In 940, it successfully resisted the invading forces of Danish opposition in Northumbria, but was burnt in 1010 by a Danish army, and again in 1065 by the rebellious northern earls Edwin and Morcar. Despite this, the Domesday Book records Northantone as possessing 316 houses with a population of 2000 people, ranking between Warwick and Leicester in size.

===Medieval===

With the Norman conquest of England, the town rose to national significance: its geographical location in the centre of England made Northampton a valuable strategical point for government and as a convenient meeting place for political, social, ecclesiastical and military events.[tpl]cite web|title=Northampton|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/constituencies/northampton#constituency-main-article|publisher=historyofparliamentonline.org|accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl]
Northampton Castle is thought to have been built by Simon de Senlis, who became the first Earl of Northampton, circa 1084. It was originally an earth and timber stockaded construction which was later rebuilt in stone.Andrew, Martin: Northampton The Francis Frith Collection, 2002 The castle became an occasional royal residence from the reign of King Henry I in 1130 until that of King Richard II. King John regularly stayed at the castle and moved The Treasury there in 1205. Many Parliaments, including the Parliament of England, were held there. The last Parliament at Northampton was held in 1380. Significant events in the castle's history include the trial of Thomas Becket in 1164, the publication of the Assize of Northampton in 1176, the declaration of peace with Scotland in the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton, the passage of the Statute of Northampton in 1328 and the imposition of poll tax in 1380. Royal tournaments and feasts were also held at the castle.The borough of Northampton - Introduction | A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3 (pp. 1-26). British-history.ac.uk (1913-09-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.
Simon de Senlis is also thought to have built the medieval town walls, which enclosed about [tpl]convert|245|acres|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and had four main gates at the four compass points. Though demolished now, the circular pattern of the main roads surrounding the town centre marks the original position of the walls. de Senlis founded the Cluniac priory of St Andrew's{–}where St Andrew's Hospital now stands{–}and  built The Church of the Holy Sepulchre{–}one of four remaining round churches in England{–}and All Hallows Church on the current site of All Saint's Church. His son, Simon II de Senlis, built St Peter's Church on a site between a former Anglo-Saxon palace and Northampton Castle. Simon II de Senlis also founded Delapré Abbey{–}another Cluniac priory{–}which still stands today. Other priories in medieval Northampton include St James' Abbey, Graye Friers, Blackfriars and Whitefriars. St. John's, a medieval hospital, was situated east of Bridge Street. A large network of medieval tunnels remains under the centre of Northampton around All Saint's Church; their purpose has been disputed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northamptonshire/content/articles/2009/04/03/underground_northampton_tunnels_feature.shtml |title=Underground Northampton |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl]
The town was originally controlled by officials acting for the King who collected taxes and upheld the law. This changed on 18 November 1189 when King Richard I granted the town its first charter in exchange for money to fund his crusades. The charter allowed the townspeople certain rights and independence in legal and administrative matters. In 1215, King John authorised the appointment of William Tilly as the town's first Mayor and ordered that "twelve of the better and more discreet residents of your town" join him as a council to assist him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.co.uk/webhp?source=search_app#hl=en&sugexp=les%3B&gs_nf=1&cp=21&gs_id=2d&xhr=t&q=mayors+of+northampton&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&oq=Mayors+of+Northamptom&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=34d01fe90270ff60&biw=1920&bih=951 |title=Mayors of Northampton W N Terry Central Art Gallery, Northampton, updated June 2011, accessed 5 October 2012 |publisher=Google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] The importance of Northampton at this time is underlined by the fact that only London, York and King's Lynn had mayors by this date. The mayor later ruled with 24 councillors and 48 freemen in a closed body until 1835.
Markets and fairs were a key element in the town's economy in medieval times. The Market Square came to prominence in 1235 when Henry III ordered that the selling of goods in the churchyard of All Saint's should be relocated to the Market Square. Street names in the town give an indication of trades and market centres; Corn Hill, Malt Hill, Mercer Row, Gold Street, Sheep Street and Horse Market. Cloth and wool were very important but these industries declined. In the 13th century, Northampton had a large Jewish population centred around Gold Street. In 1277{–}two years after Edward I passed the Statute of the Jewry{–}some Jewish residents were executed while the remainder were driven out of town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/thesis/thesischapterone.htm |title=Jewish Communities and Records |publisher=Jewishgen.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] Archaeological sites include a medieval Jewish cemetery and the Northampton Medieval Synagogue.Northampton synagogue discovered under kebab shop Jewish Chronicle – Marcus Dysch – 15 April 2010 TheJC.com
The First Barons' War caused significant destruction to Northampton. The barons besieged Northampton Castle in protest at King John's oppression of his subjects. In retaliation, royalist forces destroyed a large part of the town. When the forces of King Henry III overran the supporters of Simon de Montfort, the Second Barons' War broke out. The first Battle of Northampton{–}a battle in the second civil war{–}took place in 1264 at the site of Northampton Castle where King Henry III and his son Prince Edward attacked with a large army, pillaged the town and took prisoners.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In 1349, the Black Death pandemic killed more than half the population of Northampton. In 1377, the population was 2,200. The town was rapidly losing its wealth and its importance as a national centre. In 1460, the second Battle of Northampton took place during the War of the Roses in the meadows between the River Nene and Delapré Abbey. The Yorkists defeated the Lancastrians and King Henry VI was taken prisoner. In 1484, the Mayor declared that Northampton was "in great desolation and ruin". The dissolution of the monasteries in 1538 led to further destruction of what remained of the medieval town. Northampton was severely affected by Plague between March and September 1638 when 533 people{–}a seventh of the population{–}died.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Modern===

The royal connection to Northampton Castle had became less significant, and by the time of the English Civil War, Northampton was decidedly pro-Parliament. Though Spencer Compton, Earl of Northampton, was a royalist (Cavalier) and backed King Charles I, the people of Northampton supported Parliament and Oliver Cromwell's republican Roundhead army. The town had a long history of religious dissent from the Lollards and Puritanism gained a strong hold on the town. The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious ship money tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against papists and bishops.
When war broke out in 1642, the town willingly became the main Parliamentarian garrison for the south-east Midlands area with the former royal castle as its headquarters. In 1643, Prince Rupert attacked Northampton with approximately 2,000 men, but was beaten back at the North Gate of the town. Oliver Cromwell visited in 1645 and General Fairfax marched from the town to Naseby, where Charles I's Royalist army was decisively defeated. Over 4,000 pairs of leather shoes and 600 pairs of cavalry jack-boots for the Parliamentary armies were manufactured in Northampton during the Civil War, and a further 2,000 for Cromwell's New Model Army in 1648. Until well into the 19th century, the shoe industry boomed in and around the town with small manufacturing workshops set up in the surrounding areas.
The War ended with a Parliamentary victory, resulting in England becoming a Commonwealth, which lasted a decade. Following the restoration of King Charles II in 1660, he took revenge on the town by ordering the destruction of its walls and partial demolition of its castle in 1662, since it did not support his father Charles I and his cavaliers.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl] From then on, the castle was used as a court and a gaol, but its physical condition worsened. The new council of the town had to pay £200 to have its charter renewed and also required all officials to swear the oath of allegiance and some confirmed by the Crown.
The town centre was further destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675, caused by sparks from an open fire in a thatched cottage by the castle. The fire spread eastwards by strong westerly winds and consumed three-quarters of the town centre in 24 hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66254 |title=The borough of Northampton - Description | A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3 (pp. 30-40) |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] Matters were worsened because most buildings were chiefly made of wood and covered with thatch. An estimated 600 buildings were destroyed, amounting to £150,000 lost. Very little survived the fire, apart from buildings made of stone, like the Welsh House on Market Square, built in 1595, and Hazelrigg House in Mare Fair, built in 1662.
The devastation led to an Act of Parliament for the rebuilding the town. Local people and businesses helped to raise around £25,000 towards the rebuilding of the town centre based around the Market Square.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northampton.gov.uk/info/200242/market/1144/history_of_the_northampton_market_square |title=Timeline | History of the Northampton Market Square | Northampton Borough Council |publisher=Northampton.gov.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] Streets were widened and buildings made of brick and stone and tiled to prevent such devastation again. In an act of reconciliation, King Charles II donated timber from the royal forests of Salcey and Whittlebury to help with the rebuild.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northamptonshiretimeline.com/scene/1675reets-great-fire-of-northampton/ |title=More Information |publisher=The Northamptonshire Timeline |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] In 1678, the Sessions House and what is now County Hall were amongst the first buildings to be completed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northamptonshiretimeline.com/scene/1678-sessions-house/ |title=1678 AD: Sessions House and County Hall in George Row Completed - More Information | Tudors & Stuarts |publisher=The Northamptonshire Timeline |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] A Georgian town with new houses, shops and workshops eventually grew out of the old medieval town destroyed by the fire.

By the end of the 18th century, Northampton had become a major centre of footwear and leather manufacture. In 1801, the population was 7,020; it more than doubled to 15,351 in 1831, attributed to the fact that there was great demand for footwear caused by the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A third of the adult males alone were shoemakers at the time. Northampton grew beyond the old town walls and industry grew rapidly with the mechanisation of factories by the middle of the 19th century.
The Nene Navigation Company had previously made the River Nene navigable from King's Lynn as far up as Northampton in 1762, allowing cheap transportation of coal and other goods to the town, but in 1815, the Grand Union Canal reached the town, joining the River Nene, giving the town a direct link to the Midlands coalfields and to Birmingham, Manchester and London. Tram lines were also laid down in the town in 1881 and electrified in 1903. An early omnibus service ran to Wellingborough, and since 1919 motor omnibus services ran to villages around the town which brought buyers and sellers to the market.
The first railway to be built into Northampton was a branch from the main London-Birmingham line at Blisworth to Peterborough through Northampton which opened in 1845 alongside the town's first railway station, Bridge Street station. This was followed by the opening of Castle station in 1859 by the site of the historic Northampton Castle,[tpl]sfnp|Leleux|1984|p=54[/tpl][tpl]cite news | first = Chaz | last = Harrison | title = Ever wondered what lies beneath? | date = 2009-08-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northampton/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8195000/8195170.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-08-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/NPTONCentralArea1-21.pdf | title = Northampton Central Area Design, development and movement framework (Final Report) | accessdate = 2010-08-30 | first = Building Design Partnership | date = November 2006 | at = para. 2.15 | format = PDF[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Quick|2009|p=295[/tpl] and later St. John's Street station in 1872. The Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line was built in the late 1870s. Castle station was rebuilt and expanded over the site of Northampton Castle, the remains of which were purchased and demolished in 1880 to make way for the goods shed.[tpl]sfnp|Leleux|1984|p=56[/tpl] Both stations at Bridge Street and St John's Street closed in the mid-1900s,[tpl]sfnp|Butt|1995|p=173[/tpl] leaving only Castle station serving the town.[tpl]sfnp|Kingscott|2008|p=70[/tpl] It is now known simply as Northampton railway station.

===Contemporary===

Following World War I, the shoe industry was increasingly in decline, despite the town's factories supplying over 23 million pairs of boots to the armed forces. A total of 1,700 men from the town were lost from the 6,000 lost by the Northamptonshire Regiment. The town expanded further during the 1920s and saw the erection of Northampton Power Station, which supplied electricity to areas as far away as Wolverton, until its closure in 1975. Much council housing was also built largely to the east, north and south of the town, including Abington, Far Cotton, Kingsley, Kingsthorpe and Dallington – areas which had been incorporated within the borough's boundaries in 1901. However, the population growth slowed down as people moved beyond its boundaries. In 1901, the population had expanded to 90,923; in 1931, the population was 92,341.
After World War II, Northampton vastly changed. In 1959, the M1 motorway was opened to the south-west of the town; in 1968,  Northampton was designated a New Town. Both these events and the rail link helped Northampton's growth as a commuter town for London. The Northampton Development Corporation (NDC) was set up in 1968 to substantially redevelop the town in partnership with the local council and work started on new housing and industrial estates, initially to the east and south the town centre mainly to accommodate the overflow population of new residents from the London area. In the town centre, older buildings were demolished and replaced or redeveloped for other buildings, including the former Greyfriars bus station, the Grosvenor Shopping Centre, Peacock Place (now Market Walk), shops, flats and hotels. Although growth was slower than planned, the population grew from 105,421 in 1961 to 157,217 by 1981.
When the NDC wound up in 1985 after 20 years, another 20,000 homes and 40,000 residents had been added to the town. The borough boundaries also changed following a split of the Northampton parliamentary constituency into Northampton North and Northampton South in 1974. Northampton was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district which also covered areas outside the former borough boundaries but inside the designated New Town. The town tried for unitary status during the 1990s UK local government reform, but failed and remains a non-metropolitan district to this day, meaning it relies on a two-tier system of government. Northampton also applied for city status in 2000 during a competition for the grant of city status to mark the Millennium, but failed and remains a town.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/669580.stm|title=Millennium city leak angers bookies|date=7 March 2000|publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1074434.stm|title=City winners named|date=18 December 2000|publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 October 2008[/tpl] Northampton also suffered ill-fortune of severe flooding, particularly in the areas of Far Cotton and St James, on Good Friday 1998. Two people were killed and thousands of homes were affected.
Since the turn of the Millennium, Northampton has continued to expand. In 2006, Northampton became a government expansion zone with new growth promoted by West Northamptonshire Development Corporation (WNDC), an unelected quango, which has provoked a series of regeneration schemes across the town. Some have been completed, including the opening of the Radlands Plaza Skatepark and the development of Becket's Park Marina just south of Northampton's town centre, as well as the improvement of the town's Market Square and the building of the new North Gate bus station. Current projects include the redevelopment of the current railway station, improvement of Northampton's waterside and renovation of the Grosvenor Shopping Centre.West Northamptonshire Development Corporation website.

==Administration==

===Politics===

The Northampton constituency was established in 1295, which returned two MPs to the House of Commons. Spencer Perceval was the elected MP for the constituency in 1796, and became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1809, the only Solicitor General or Attorney General to have been Prime Minister, but also the only Prime Minister to have been assassinated. John Bellingham shot him dead in the House of Commons lobby in 1812. By the late 19th century, Northampton had acquired a reputation for political radicalism. In 1880, radical non-conformist Charles Bradlaugh was elected as second MP for the constituency. During an election campaign involving Bradlaugh, a riot broke out in the Market Square that required military to disperse the action. For the 1918 general election, Northampton's representation was reduced to one MP.
The original constituency was abolished for the February 1974 general election and replaced by the new constituencies of Northampton North and Northampton South, which elect one MP each. These boundaries changed further for the 2010 general election when the South Northamptonshire constituency was created, covering the most southern areas of the borough. The borough of Northampton continues makes up all of the electoral wards in Northampton North and Northampton South.
Northampton is currently represented by three Conservative MPs: Brian Binley (Northampton South), Michael Ellis (Northampton North) and Andrea Leadsom (South Northamptonshire). Northampton is also included in the East Midlands constituency for elections to the European Parliament, electing five MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

===Local government===

The town existed as an ancient borough in the medieval period before being one of the 178 boroughs to be reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act in 1835, with a democratically-elected council replacing the oligarchic Tory corporation before it. Town government alternated between the Liberals and Conservatives, with the town achieving independence from Northamptonshire in 1888 when it became a county borough. It had 6 electoral wards from 1898, 9 wards from 1900 and 12 wards from 1911.
Northampton was granted modern borough status in 1974, but was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district, a subdivision of its non-metropolitan county (Northamptonshire).[tpl]cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/mar/28/district-councils-and-boroughs#S5CV0871P0_19740328_CWA_145|title=District Councils and Boroughs|date=28 March 1974|work=Hansard 1803–2005|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Local Government in England and wales. a Guide to the New System.|year=1974|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0117508470|pages=15–109|chapter=Table III(a)[/tpl] It failed to obtain unitary authority status in the 1990s local government reform and again in 2011 when the motion was voted down by the council,[tpl]Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1074434.stm|accessdate =2 April 2008 | date=18 December 2000 |work=BBC News  | title=City winners named[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-16055929 |title=BBC News - Northampton Borough Council unitary authority bid defeated |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl] meaning the borough retains its two-tier structure of local government: the non-metropolitan district of Northampton is administered by Northampton Borough Council and Northamptonshire County Council which are both controlled by the Conservative Party.
Policing in the town remains the responsibility of Northamptonshire Police; and firefighting, the responsibility of Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service. The Royal Anglian Regiment serves as the county regiment for Northamptonshire.

===Health service===

NHS Northampton guides primary care services (general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists) in the town, directly provides adult social care and services in the community such as health visiting and physiotherapy and also funds hospital care and other specialist treatments. Northampton General Hospital is an NHS trust hospital which founded in 1744 and moved to its present site in 1793, and has continued to provide healthcare to the local community for more than 200 years. The East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust is responsible for the provision of statutory emergency medical services in Northampton.
St Andrew's Hospital, the flagship mental health facility of St Andrew's Healthcare, is also based in Northampton. It has served Northampton since 1838, providing specialist services for people with mental illness, learning disability, autism, brain injury and dementia.

==Geography==

===Areas and suburbs===

Northampton is subdivided into suburbs, council wards, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas.
There are 33 electoral wards, as defined by the borough council (the county council divides the town into much larger wards which have different boundaries), in Northampton:[tpl]cite web|title=My Council|url=http://selfserve.northampton.gov.uk/mycouncil/|publisher=northampton.gov.uk|accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl]

===Climate===

As with the rest of the British Isles, Northampton experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The official Metoffice Weather Station for Northampton is the Moulton Park Weather Station at the University of Northampton. Situated at an elevation of around [tpl]convert|130|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl]  above sea level compared to Northampton town centre at [tpl]convert|50|to|60|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl], it is one of the highest points in the Borough, and so may not be a perfect representation of other parts of the town. Its hilltop location means less pooling of cold air on calm clear nights, and lower maxima during summer. The absolute maximum recorded is [tpl]convert|34.7|C|1|abbr=on[/tpl] on 3 August 1990. A high of 34.4c (93.9f) was recorded on 19 July 2006. The absolute minimum is −16.8c (1.8f), recorded during February 1986. It is likely the absolute maximum in the town centre is a degree or so higher owing to the lower elevation, and absolute minimum on the eastern and western edges of the Borough around the Nene valley a couple of degrees colder due to katabatic drainage of cold air allowing a frost hollow effect. Most recently, the temperature fell to −9.6c(14.7f) on 20 December 2010.
Rainfall, at around [tpl]convert|650|mm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] per year is not high, though is often unpredictable, giving rise to flooding events such as 1998, but also short term droughts. Desborough Weather Station also supplies the public with a local weather service.

==Notable buildings==

Northampton's oldest standing building, The Holy Sepulchre, is one of the largest and best-preserved round churches in England. It was built in 1100 on the orders of the first Earl of Northampton, Simon de Senlis and based on a plan of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.
Simon de Senlis also built Northampton Castle c. 1084, which was for many years one of the country's most important castles. It was a royal residence, held The Parliament of England many times, and was the site of royal tournaments and feasts. Thomas Becket was imprisoned there until he escaped. The castle suffered many fates and was eventually demolished for the train station. A postern, dismantled from its original position and rebuilt into a wall by the station, is all that remains.
The current All Saints' Church was built on the site of a great Norman church, All Hallows, which was almost completely destroyed by the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675. All that remained was the medieval tower and the fine vaulted crypt, but by 1680 All Saints had been rebuilt, with the help of donations from all over England, including 1,000 tons of timber from King Charles II, whose statue can be seen above the portico. Famously, the poet John Clare liked to sit beneath the portico of the church. It is home to a choral foundation, with choral services sung every day by one of its choirs, who also record commercially and tour throughout the world.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Other notable church buildings include Northampton Cathedral, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton and seat of the Bishop of Northampton; St Edmunds, which closed in 1978 and was demolished in 2007 (its bells are now in St Paul's Cathedral in Wellington); St Giles Church; St Matthew's in Phippsville, which was built between 1891-4, has a Henry Moore sculpture of the Madonna.
Just south of the town centre Delapré Abbey, a former Cluniac nunnery, the County Records Office and site of the second Battle of Northampton, which was founded by Simon II de Senlis, the son of first Earl of Northampton, in 1145. At the edge of the Abbey, one of the three standing Eleanor crosses still remains, in memory of Eleanor of Castile, whose body rested here on its way to London. The original top of the monument has been knocked off and replaced several times from as early as 1460.Hardingstone Eleanor Cross:: OS grid SP7558 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland – photograph every grid square!.

St Andrew's Hospital, which opened 1838, and its new building William Wake House, is one of the largest neo-classical structures in England. Northampton & County Club, which was established in 1873, was also the old county hospital before becoming a private members' club; the cellars are medieval. Northampton Guildhall, which is Grade II* listed, was constructed mostly in the 1860s in Victorian Gothic architecture designed by Edward William Godwin, and extended in the 1990s.
78 Derngate is a Grade II* listed Georgian Town House remodelled by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke in 1916–17. It contains notable Mackintosh interiors (which have been restored) and is his only major domestic commission outside Scotland. It is open to the public.
The [tpl]convert|127.45|m|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl] tall Express Lift Tower is a dominant feature and visible from most of the town. A Terry Wogan radio phone-in during the 1980s to came up with the name "Northampton Lighthouse" as Northampton is one of the furthest places from the sea. It is also known as the "Cobblers' Needle". It was built for testing new lifts at the Express Lifts factory, now closed. Though now redundant, it is a listed building.
The former Greyfriars bus station served the town from 1976 until 2014. In the 2000s, it was featured on Channel 4's Demolition programme as the ugliest transport station in the United Kingdom and worthy of demolition. Demolition work will start in March 2014, following the move of bus services to North Gate bus station.

No longer used for freight, the waterway is now popular with anglers and narrowboaters. Principal outlying villages on the canal include Gayton, Blisworth, Braunston and Stoke Bruerne.
Northampton once had a horse-drawn tramway which opened in 1881. The system was extended in stages and taken over by the council in 1897 and named Northampton Corporation Tramways. It was electrified in 1904, but closed in 1934 mainly as a result of competition from motor buses which were introduced in 1929.
