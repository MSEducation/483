A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work, so they don’t have to worry about copyright infringement, as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.
There are several types of CC licenses. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by Creative Commons, a U.S. non-profit corporation founded in 2001.

==Applicable works==

Work licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/legalcode |title=Creative Commons Legal Code |date=January 9, 2008 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites. Creative Commons does not recommend the use of Creative Commons licenses for software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F |title=Creative Commons FAQ: Can I use a Creative Commons license for software? |publisher=Wiki.creativecommons.org |date=2013-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]
However, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions. Furthermore, Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable. Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license.
In the case of works protected by multiple Creative Common licenses, the user may choose either.

==Types of licenses==

The CC licenses all grant the "baseline rights", such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide for non-commercial purposes, and without modification.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Baseline_Rights |title=Baseline Rights |publisher=Creative Commons |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] The details of each of these licenses depends on the version, and comprises a selection out of four conditions:
|-
! Icon !! Right || Description
|-
| 40px|Attribution
| Attribution (BY)
| Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified by these.
|-
| 40px|Share-alike
| Share-alike (SA)
| Licensees may distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs the original work. (See also copyleft.)
|-
| 40px|Non-commercial
| Non-commercial (NC)
| Licensees may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and make derivative works based on it only for noncommercial purposes.
|-
| 40px|Non-derivative
| No Derivative Works (ND)
| Licensees may copy, distribute, display and perform only verbatim copies of the work, not derivative works based on it.
|}
The last two clauses are not free content licenses, according to definitions such as DFSG or the Free Software Foundation's standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as Wikipedia. For software, Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the BSD License, the GNU LGPL license, and the GNU GPL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622222019/http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archivedate=2009-06-22|title=Creative Commons GNU LGPL|accessdate=2009-07-20[/tpl]
Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the "nd" and "sa" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the "by" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website.[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses |title=Retired Legal Tools |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |publisher=Creative Commons[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 |title=Announcing (and explaining) our new 2.0 licenses |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=2004-05-25 |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |title=Creative Commons Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] This leaves six regularly used licenses:
|-

| alt=CC-by icon || Attribution alone || BY
|-
| alt=CC-by-ND icon || Attribution + NoDerivatives || BY-ND
|-

|-

|}
For example, the Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license allows one to share and remix (create derivative works), even for commercial use, so long as attribution is given.[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ |title=Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 United States |date=November 16, 2009 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl]

==Version 4.0 and international use==

The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind, so the wording could be incompatible within different local legislations and render the licenses unenforceable in various jurisdictions. To address this issue, Creative Commons had started to port the various licenses to accommodate local copyright and private law. As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been "ported" to over 50 different jurisdictions worldwide.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221084154/ |url=http://creativecommons.org/worldwide |title=Worldwide |publisher=Creative Commons |date= |archivedate=21 December 2009[/tpl] 
The latest version 4.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, released on 25 November 2013, are generic licenses that are applicable to most jurisdictions and do not usually require ports.[tpl]cite web|last=Peters|first=Diane|title=CC’s Next Generation Licenses — Welcome Version 4.0!|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768|work=Creative Commons|accessdate=26 November 2013|date=25 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=What's new in 4.0?|url=http://creativecommons.org/Version4|work=Creative Commons|accessdate=26 November 2013|year=2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=CC 4.0, an end to porting Creative Commons licences?|url=http://www.technollama.co.uk/cc-4-0-an-end-to-porting-creative-commons-licenses|publisher=TechnoLlama|accessdate=11 August 2013|date=25 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Music Manumit Lawcast with Jessica Coates of Creative Commons|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHgbWFNEztg|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 August 2013|author=Doug Whitfield|date=5 August 2013[/tpl] No new ports have been implemented in version 4.0 of the license.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network#The_Licensing_Suite |title=CC Affiliate Network |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=July 8, 2011[/tpl] Version 4.0 discourages using ported versions and instead acts as a single global license.[tpl]cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: What if CC licenses have not been ported to my jurisdiction?|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#What_if_CC_licenses_have_not_been_ported_to_my_jurisdiction.3F|work=Creative Commons|accessdate=26 November 2013[/tpl]

==Rights==

===Attribution===

Since 2004, all current licenses require attribution of the original author (the BY component). The attribution must be given to "the best of one's ability using the information available".[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F |title=Frequently Frequently Asked Questions |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] Generally this implies the following:

===Non-commercial licenses===

The "non-commercial" option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition,[tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127 |title=Defining Noncommercial report published |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl] as it's sometimes unclear what can be considered a noncommercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of open content promoted by other permissive licenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC |title=The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]

===Zero / Public domain===

Besides licenses, Creative Commons also offers a way to release material into the public domain through CC0,[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero |title=CC0 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible, worldwide. Development of CC0 began in 2007[tpl]cite press release |url=http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919 |title=Creative Commons Launches CC0 and CC+ Programs |date=December 17, 2007 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] and the tool was released in 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/report-from-cc-board-meeting.html |title=Report from CC board meeting |first=Gavin |last=Baker |work=Open Access News |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304 |title=Expanding the Public Domain: Part Zero |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]
In 2010, Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark,[tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 |title=Marking and Tagging the Public Domain: An Invitation to Comment |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl] a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification,[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |title=Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification |date=August 20, 2009 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl] which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.
In 2011, the Free Software Foundation added CC0 to its free software licenses, making CC0 a recommended way of dedicating software to the public domain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081 |title=Using CC0 for public domain software |date=April 15, 2011 |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=May 10, 2011[/tpl]
In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval but, due to problems, it was rejected. The OSI FAQ concludes "At this time, we do not recommend releasing software using  the CC0 public domain dedication" because of the reservations of being able to waiver copyright (aka "public domain") from a legal standpoint in all jurisdictions. The OSI FAQ further explains that "CC0 was not explicitly rejected, but the License Review Committee was  unable to reach consensus that it should be approved, and Creative Commons eventually withdrew the application". In the withdrawal message the Creative Commons representative explained that CC0 was initially developed for the needs of the scientific data community in order to help sharing data freely.[tpl]cite web| url = http://projects.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/000231.html| title = CC withdrawl of CC0 from OSI process| author = Christopher Allan Webber (In the Open Source Initiative Licence review mailing list)| accessdate = 2012-02-24[/tpl]

===Adaptation===

Rights in an adaptation can be expressed by a CC license that is compatible with the status or licensing of the original work.[tpl]cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Can_I_combine_material_that_uses_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work.3F|publisher=CC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]

==Legal aspects==

The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing is difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it.[tpl]cite journal|last=Katz|first=Zachary|title=Pitfalls of Open Licensing: An Analysis of Creative Commons Licensing|journal=IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review|year=2005-6|volume=46|issue=3|page=391[/tpl]
Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law|title=Creative Commons Case Law|accessdate=31 Aug 2011[/tpl]  Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses. Here are some notable cases:

===Dutch tabloid===

In early 2006, podcaster Adam Curry sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry's Flickr page without Curry's permission. The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Science of the University of Amsterdam, commented, "The Dutch Court's decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and bind users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6052292.html |title=Creative Commons license upheld by court|publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.se/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&pg=PA271&dq=The+Dutch+Court%27s+decision+is+especially+noteworthy+because+it+confirms+that+the+conditions+of+a+Creative+Commons+license+automatically&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=SzKvUMOkJseF4gSp4oEY&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Dutch%20Court%27s%20decision%20is%20especially%20noteworthy%20because%20it%20confirms%20that%20the%20conditions%20of%20a%20Creative%20Commons%20license%20automatically&f=false |title=Digital Copyright and the Consumer Revolution: Hands Off My Ipod - Matthew Rimmer - Google Böcker |publisher=Books.google.se |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060316052623594|title=Creative Commons License Upheld by Dutch Court|work=Groklaw|date=2006-03-16|accessdate=2006-09-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823|title=Creative Commons Licenses Enforced in Dutch Court|accessdate=31 Aug 2011[/tpl]

===Virgin Mobile===

In 2007, Virgin Mobile Australia launched an Australian bus stop ad campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to Flickr using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15 year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church,[tpl]Cite news|first= Noam|last= Cohen|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Use My Photo? Not Without Permission. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html |quote=One moment, Alison Chang, a 15-year-old student from Dallas, is cheerfully goofing around at a local church-sponsored car wash, posing with a friend for a photo. Weeks later, that photo is posted online and catches the eye of an ad agency in Australia, and the altered image of Alison appears on a billboard in Adelaide as part of a Virgin Mobile advertising campaign. |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=2007-09-25 [/tpl] caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile.  The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license. In 2008, the case (concerning personality rights rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713050011/http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archivedate=2011-07-13 |title=No personal jurisdiction over Australian defendant in Flickr right of publicity case |author=Evan Brown |date=January 22, 2009 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases, a blog about law and technology |accessdate=25 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680|title=Lawsuit Against Virgin Mobile and Creative Commons – FAQ|accessdate=31 Aug 2011[/tpl]

===SGAE vs Fernández===

In the fall of 2006, collecting society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in Badajoz who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties from public performance of music during the period between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830 |title=Spanish Court Recognizes CC-Music |author=Mia Garlick |date=March 23, 2006 |work= |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=25 September 2010[/tpl]

===GateHouse Media, Inc. vs. That's Great News, LLC===

On June 30, 2010 GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit against That's Great News. GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including Rockford Register Star, which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That's Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/07/02/new-copyright-lawsuit-involves-creative-commons/ |title=New Copyright Lawsuit Involves Creative Commons |author=Evan Brown |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases: A blog about law and technology |accessdate=20 April 2012[/tpl] GateHouse sued That's Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/gatehouse-media-v-thats-great-news#description |title=GateHouse Media v.

==Works with a Creative Commons license==

Creative Commons maintains a content directory wiki of organizations and projects using Creative Commons licenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Content_Directories|title=Content Directories|publisher=creativecommons.org|accessdate=2009-04-24[/tpl] On its website CC also provides case studies of projects using CC licenses across the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies |title=Case Studies |publisher=Creative Commons |date= |accessdate=20 December 2011[/tpl] CC licensed content can also be accessed through a number of content directories and search engines (see CC licensed content directories).

==Retired licenses==

Due to either disuse or criticism, a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired,[tpl]cite web |url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7520 |title=Retiring standalone DevNations and one Sampling license |accessdate= July 5, 2007 |publisher=Creative Commons |date=June 4, 2007 |first=Lawrence |last=Lessig |authorlink=Lawrence Lessig[/tpl] and are no longer recommended for new works. The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element other than CC0, as well as the following four licenses:
