San Francisco International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|SFO|KSFO|SFO[/tpl] is an international airport located [tpl]convert|13|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of downtown San Francisco, California, near Millbrae and San Bruno in unincorporated San Mateo County.[tpl]cite gnis|id=1653945|name=San Francisco International Airport|accessdate=May 3, 2009[/tpl] It has flights to points throughout North America and is a major gateway to Europe and Asia.
SFO is the largest airport in the Bay Area and the second busiest in California, after Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013, it was the seventh busiest in the United States and the twenty-second busiest airport in the world by passenger count.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.panynj.gov/airports/pdf-traffic/ATR2013.pdf |title=Airports Council International - Worldwide Airport Traffic Report - Calendar Year 2013 |publisher=The Port Authority of NY & NJ[/tpl] It is the fifth largest hub of United Airlines. It also serves as Virgin America's principal base of operations.[tpl]cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.virginamerica.com/va/about.do|publisher=Virgin America|accessdate=August 3, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090925073622/http://www.virginamerica.com/va/about.do|archivedate=September 25, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] It is the sole maintenance hub of United Airlines, and houses the Louis A. Turpen Aviation Museum.
SFO is owned and policed by the City and County of San Francisco, but is located in and entirely surrounded by adjacent San Mateo County. Between 1999 and 2004, the San Francisco Airport Commission operated city-owned SFO Enterprises, Inc., to oversee its business purchases and operations of ventures such as operating Honduran airports.[tpl]cite news |title=Flying Blind|first=Matt|last=Smith|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-03-28/news/flying-blind/|newspaper=SF Weekly|date=March 28, 2001|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Financial Audits|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/208862/San-Francisco-City-Government-Controller-SFO-Enterprises-Report|publisher=City and County of San Francisco|date=January 22, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=SFO Enterprises, Inc.|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/related/to/SFO+Enterprises+Inc./|newspaper=SF Weekly|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl]The Shock Doctrine, Naomi Klein; pg. 396.

==History==

The airport opened on May 7, 1927[tpl]cite journal|title=Mills Field Memories, Part 2: An Air Port for San Francisco|work=Update, SFO’s Community Newsletter|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–5|publisher=San Francisco International Airport|date=Spring 2007|url=http://www.flysfo.com/web/export/sites/default/download/about/news/update/pdf/SFOUpdateSpring2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 18, 2009[/tpl] on [tpl]convert|150|acres|ha[/tpl] of cow pasture. The land was leased from Ogden L. Mills who had leased it from his grandfather Darius O. Mills. It was named Mills Field Municipal Airport until 1931, when it became San Francisco Municipal Airport. "Municipal" was replaced by "International" in 1955.
After the war United Airlines used the Pan Am terminal [tpl]coord|37.6347|-122.39|display=inline[/tpl] for its DC-6 flights to Hawaii starting in 1947. SFO is now one of five United Airlines hubs and their largest maintenance facility.
In 1954 the airport's Central Passenger Terminal opened.[tpl]cite news |title=A Guide to the New International Wing|first=Marshall|last=Wilson| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/12/04/MN147657.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=A–1|publisher=Hearst Communications|date=December 4, 2000|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] (It was heavily rebuilt into the international terminal c. 1984, then re-rebuilt into present Terminal 2.) The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 71 scheduled weekday departures on United (plus ten flights a week to Honolulu), 22 on Western, 19 on Southwest, 12 on TWA, 7 American and 3 PSA. Pan American had 21 departures a week, Japan Air had 5 and QANTAS had 5. Jet flights at SFO began in March 1959, with TWA 707-131s; United built a large maintenance facility at San Francisco for its new Douglas DC-8s. In July 1959 the first jetway bridge was installed, one of the first in the United States.
The first international nonstops were ANA/BCPA DC-4s to Vancouver in 1946-47; the first nonstops to the East Coast were United DC-7s in 1954. TWA's L1649 nonstops to Europe started in 1957 and Pan Am tried to fly 707-320s nonstop Tokyo to SFO starting 1960-61 (the westward nonstops had to await the 707-320B).
The airport closed following the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989, reopening the following morning.[tpl]cite news |title=Search For Bodies to Take Days—State Puts Toll at 273, Then Says It Is Uncertain|first=Kevin|last=Roderick|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-19/news/mn-344_1_downtown-san-francisco?pg=3|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 19, 1989|accessdate=September 5, 2009[/tpl] It suffered some damage to runways.

===Operations, expansion, retreat, and recovery===

In 1989 a master plan and Environmental Impact Report were prepared to guide development over the next two decades.Environmental Impact Report for the San Francisco International Airport Master Plan, Earth Metrics Inc. and Jefferson Associates, prepared for the city of San Francisco and California State Clearinghouse (1989)[tpl]Verify source|date=August 2009[/tpl]
During the boom of the 1990s and the dot-com boom SFO became the sixth busiest airport in the world, but since 2001, when the boom ended, SFO has fallen out of the top twenty.
SFO has expanded through the decades. A $1 billion international terminal opened in December 2000, replacing Terminal 2. This terminal has an aviation library and museum.[tpl]cite web|title=San Francisco Airport Commission Aviation Library & Louis A.

A long-planned extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system to the airport opened on June 22, 2003, allowing passengers to board BART trains at the international terminal to San Francisco or the East Bay.[tpl]cite news |title=History is Here – New Line Creates Transit Hub, Link to Future|first=Michael|last=Cabantuan|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/06/22/MN100396.DTL|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=A–1|publisher=Hearst Communications|date=June 22, 2003|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] In 2003, the AirTrain people mover opened, transporting passengers between terminals, parking lots, the BART station, and the rental car center on small automatic trains.
SFO experiences delays (known as flow control) in overcast weather when only two of the airport's four runways can be used at a time because the centerlines of the parallel runways are only [tpl]convert|750|ft|m[/tpl] apart. Airport planners have floated proposals to extend the airport's runways into San Francisco Bay to accommodate arrivals and departures during low visibility. To expand into the bay the airport would be required by law to restore bay land elsewhere in the Bay Area to offset the fill. Such proposals have met resistance from environmental groups, fearing damage to the habitat of animals near the airport, recreational degradation (such as windsurfing) and bay water quality.  Such delays (among other reasons) caused some airlines, especially low-cost carriers, to shift service to Oakland and San Jose.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Since the mid-2000s recovery at SFO has been evident.  SFO has become the base of operations for start-up airline Virgin America, with service to over 15 destinations. In June 2010 Swiss International Airlines began service from San Francisco to Zurich Airport; in July 2012 United Airlines announced resumption of flights to Taipei and Paris. In April 2013 Scandinavian Airlines plans to launch a new non-stop route to Copenhagen.  In August 2012 China Eastern Airlines announced non-stop service to Shanghai starting in 2013.  SFO set a record of 41 million passengers in 2011, and surpassed it with 44.5 million in 2012.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/transportation/2013/02/sfo-sets-passenger-traffic-record-2012 |title=SFO sets passenger traffic record in 2012 |author=Will Reisman |date=February 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 12, 2013[/tpl]
The FAA has warned that the airport's control tower would be unable to withstand a major earthquake and has requested that it be replaced.  On July 9, 2012 ground was broken for the airport's new air traffic control tower. The new tower, between terminals 1 and 2, is to be shaped like a torch and be completed in fall 2015.[tpl]cite news |url=http://photos.mercurynews.com/2012/07/09/sfo-to-get-new-control-tower/ |title=SFO To Get New Control Tower |date=July 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2013[/tpl]
SFO was one of several US airports which operated the Registered Traveler program from April 2007 until funding ended in June 2009, which had allowed travelers to pass through security checkpoints quickly.[tpl]cite news |title=Getting Through Airport Security with CLEAR|url=http://www.onthegroundtravel.com/adventures/tips/airport-security-with-clear/|work=On the Ground Travel|date=December 11, 2012|accessdate=January 31, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Clear Lanes Are No Longer Available|url=http://www.flyclear.com/|work=Clear|publisher=Verified Identity Pass, Inc.|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Baggage and passenger screening is operated by Covenant Aviation Security, a TSA contractor, nicknamed "Team SFO." SFO was the first airport in the United States to integrate in-line baggage screening into its baggage-handling system and has been a model for other airports in the post-9/11 era.

==Aircraft noise abatement==

SFO was one of the first airports to implement a Fly Quiet Program which grades individual air carriers on their performance on noise abatement procedures while flying in and out of SFO. The Jon C. Long Fly Quiet Program was started by the Aircraft Noise Abatement Office to encourage individual airlines to operate as quietly as possible at SFO. The program promotes a participatory approach in complying with the noise abatement procedures.
SFO was also one of the first U.S. airports to conduct a residential sound abatement retrofitting program. Established by the FAA in the early 1980s, this program evaluated the cost effectiveness of reducing interior sound levels for homes near the airport, within the 65 CNEL noise contour. The program made use of a noise computer model to predict improvement in specific residential interiors for a variety of noise control strategies. This pilot program was conducted for a neighborhood in South San Francisco and success was achieved in all of the homes analyzed. The costs turned out to be modest, and the post-construction interior sound level tests confirmed the predictions for noise abatement. To date over $153 million has been spent to insulate more than 15,000 homes in the neighboring cities of Daly City, Pacifica, San Bruno, and South San Francisco.[tpl]cite web |title=Residential Sound Insulation Program|url=http://www.flyquietsfo.com/rsip.asp|work=SFO – Aircraft Noise Abatement Office|publisher=BridgeNet International|date=September 1, 2009|accessdate=September 12, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091224221741/http://www.flyquietsfo.com/rsip.asp|archivedate=December 24, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Terminals==

The airport has four terminals (1, 2, 3, and International) and seven concourses (A through G) arranged in a ring. Terminal 1 (Boarding Areas B and C), Terminal 2 (Boarding Area D), and Terminal 3 (Boarding Areas E and F) handle domestic flights (including precleared flights from Canada). The International Terminal (Boarding Areas A and G) handle international flights and some domestic flights.

===Terminal 1===

Formerly known as the "South Terminal," Terminal 1 has Boarding Area B (including gates 20-23, 24A-24B, 25-31, 32A-32B-32C, 33-35, 36A-36B, 37-39) and Boarding Area C (gates 40-48). A third boarding area, Rotunda A, was demolished in 2007.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2, formerly known as the "Central Terminal," opened in 1954 as the main airport terminal. After a drastic rebuilding designed by Gensler, it replaced Rotunda A as SFO's international terminal in 1983[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.7x7.com/travel-active/first-look-sfos-new-terminal-2 |title=A First Look at SFO's New Terminal 2 |publisher=7x7.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=San Francisco International Airport Competition Plan|publisher=San Francisco International Airport|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110518182159/http://www.flysfo.com/web/export/sites/default/download/about/competition/pdf/Competition_Plan.pdf| archivedate=2011-05-18|deadurl=yes|url=http://www.flysfo.com/web/export/sites/default/download/about/competition/pdf/Competition_Plan.pdf|format=PDF|date=August 8, 2000|accessdate=July 14, 2013[/tpl] and was closed for indefinite renovation when the current international terminal opened in 2000. Its only concourse is Boarding Area D that has 14 gates (gates 50, 51A, 51B, 52, 53, 54A, 54B, 55, 56A, 56B, 57, 58A, 58B, 59). The control tower and most operations offices were (and still are) located on the upper levels, and the departure and arrival areas served as walkways between Terminal 1 and Terminal 3.
On May 12, 2008, a $383 million renovation project was announced that included a new control tower, the use of green materials, and a seismic retrofit.[tpl]cite news |title=SFO Brings Ghost Terminal Back From the Dead|first=Michael|last=Manekin|url=http://www.airportbusiness.com/web/online/Top-News-Headlines/SFO-brings-ghost-terminal-back-from-the-dead/1$20075|newspaper=San Mateo County Times|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl]

===International Terminal===

SFO's international terminal was designed by Craig W. Hartman of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and opened in December 2000 to replace International Departures from Terminal 2. It is the largest international terminal in North America, and is the largest building in the world built on base isolators to protect against earthquakes.[tpl]cite web|title=Fact Sheet – International Terminal|url=http://www.flysfo.com/web/export/sites/default/download/about/news/pressres/fact-sheet/pdf/International_Terminal_Fact_Sheet.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=San Francisco International Airport|date=January 30, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Food service focuses on quick service versions of leading Bay Area restaurants, following other SFO terminals.

All international arrivals and departures are handled here (except flights from cities with customs preclearance). The BART train station is in this terminal, at the garage leading to Boarding Area G. The SFO Medical Clinic is located next to the security screening area of Boarding Area A. All the gates in this terminal have two jetway bridges except gates A2 and A10 which have one. Gates A1, A3, and A11 can accommodate two aircraft. Six gates are designed for the Airbus A380, making SFO one of the first airports in the world with such gates when it was built in 2000.[tpl]cite news |title=Super-Size Skies – SFO Says It's Ready for a 555-Person Plane Arriving in 2006|first=David|last=Armstrong|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/15/BUG7H7KVDS1.DTL&hw=A380&sn=003&sc=726|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=C–1|publisher=Hearst Communications|date=July 15, 2004|accessdate=August 3, 2009[/tpl] Gates A9 (9A,9B,9C) and G101 (101A,101B,101C) have three jetways for boarding.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Giant-A380-jetliner-proves-SFO-planners-were-right-2371963.php#photo-1899699|title=A380 at SFO|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=March 21, 2013[/tpl] Four other gates have two jetways fitted for the A380.
For lack of space, the terminal was built on top of the airport's main access road at enormous expense, completing the continuous ring of terminals. The terminal required its own set of ramps to connect it with Highway 101. The design and construction of the international terminal is owed to Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Del Campo & Maru Architects, Michael Willis Associates, and built by Tutor Perini (main terminal building), Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum in association with Robin Chiang & Company, Robert B. Wong Architects, and built by Tutor Perini (Boarding Area G), and Gerson/Overstreet Architects and built by Hensel Phelps Construction (Boarding Area A). The contracts were awarded after an architectural design competition. If all gates in an airlines' designated international boarding area are full, passengers will board or deplane from the opposite international boarding area.
All SkyTeam, Oneworld and non-aligned international carriers operate from Boarding Area A (gates A1–A10, A11–A11A, A12). TACA Airlines, Asiana, and Air Canada are the only Star Alliance carriers that use Boarding Area A.
All international Star Alliance members aside from Air Canada (some flights), Asiana (some flights), and TACA use Boarding Area G (gates G91, G92–G92A, G93–G98, G99–G99A, G100, G101–G101A, G102). In 2010, some United domestic flights now utilize the Area G, as shown in the table below.
Domestic flights on JetBlue Airways, Sun Country Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines also operate from the International Terminal at boarding area A.
