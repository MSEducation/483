==Biography==

Born Abdul-Ahad Dawood Tappouni, Baptized as Leo Gabriel, Tappouni was born in Mosul (in modern Iraq) and there studied at the Syro-Chaldean Dominican Seminary. He was ordained to the priesthood on November 3, 1902, taking the name Dominic. After teaching at the same seminary until 1908, Tappouni was then made Secretary of the Apostolic Delegation to Mesopotamia.
On September 12, 1912, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Danaba and the Chaldean Apostolic Vicar of Mardin. Tappouni was reassigned to Titular Bishop of Batnae dei Siri on January 19, 1913, which was the same date he received his episcopal consecration from Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II Rahmani. At his consecration he took the name Theophile Gabriel.  During World War I, he was imprisoned by the Ottoman Turks in Aleppo during an Ottoman campaign to slaughter Christians.  Many people attempted to interfere and negotiate for Tappouni's release, including Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria.
After his release, he was named Archbishop of Aleppo by Patriarch Rahmani on February 24, 1929. On 24 June of the same year, Tappouni was unanimously chosen by the Syrian Synod to replace the late Rahmani as Patriarch of Antioch and thus leader of the Syriac Catholic Church. Pope Pius XI confirmed his election on the following July 15, and created him Cardinal Priest of Ss. XII Apostoli by Pope Pius XI in the consistory of December 16, 1935. Tappouni, who took the name Ignatius Gabriel, was the first Eastern Rite prelate to be raised to the College of Cardinals since the reign of Pope Leo XIII.[tpl]efn|Prior to Patriarch Tappouni, the last Eastern Catholic prelate to be elevated to the College of Cardinals was Sylvester Sembratovych, archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church who was made Cardinal-Priest of Santo Stefano al Monte Celio by Pope Leo XIII on November 29, 1895.[/tpl]   
Tappouni was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII, and again voted in the 1958 conclave, which selected Pope John XXIII. From 1962 to 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council, and sat on its Board of Presidency. After serving as a cardinal elector in the 1963 conclave, Tappouni resigned his cardinalatial church on February 11, 1965.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/btappouni.html|title=Ignace Gabriel I Cardinal Tappouni|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy.org|accessdate=2008-12-31[/tpl]  Cardinal Tappouni's resignation was made pursuant to Pope Paul VI's motu propio Ad Purpuratorum Patrum issued on February 11, 1965 which decreed that Eastern Patriarchs who are elevated to the College of Cardinals would be made cardinal bishops, ranked after the suburbicarian cardinal-bishops, but not part of the Roman clergy and would not be assigned any Roman church or deaconry, their patriarchal see instead becoming their cardinalitial see.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-t.htm#Tappouni|title=Tappouni, Ignace Gabriel I|publisher=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|accessdate=2013-05-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/adpurpuratorum.htm|title=Ad Purpuratorum Patrum|publisher=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|accessdate=2013-05-27[/tpl]  Accordingly, Patriarch Tappouni resigned his cardinal-priest title to the church of Ss. XII Apostoli and was promoted to the order of cardinal-bishops.
He died in Beirut at age 88, and is buried at the Syriac Catholic cathedral there.
Theologically conservative, Tappouni urged Cardinal Giuseppe Siri to put forward his candidacy at the conclave of 1963.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
