==Career==

Ciotola began his career at local club Monteruscello. In 2003, he joined Napoli, but was immediately sold to Sassari Torres in a co-ownership deal. In June, Sassari Torres acquired him outright. He then left for Giugliano and then Pisa. He followed the team through promotion to Serie B as 2006–07 Serie C1 playoffs winners.
After Pisa's relegation at the end of season, Ciotola joined newly promoted Serie B team Avellino in another co-ownership deal. Despite the team's relegation, Avellino purchased the remaining half of his rights. However, the team soon fell to bankruptcy.
In July 2009, Ciotola joined Verona on a three-year contract.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hellasverona.it/news.php?id=8332|title=Calciomercato, Ciotola ed Esposito all'Hellas Verona|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=26 September 2011|work=Hellas Verona FC|language=Italian[/tpl] He played 31 out of 34 games, but only started a handful of times.
