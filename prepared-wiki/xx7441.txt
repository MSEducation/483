==Biography==

Kobayashi embarked on a career in film in 1941 when he entered Shochiku Studios as an apprentice director, but his career was almost immediately interrupted when he was drafted into the army and sent to Manchuria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-masaki-kobayashi-1358495.html |title=Masaki Kobayashi: Obituary|first=James |last=Kirkup|publisher=The Independent|location=London|date=October 15, 1996|accessdate=[/tpl] Kobayashi regarded himself as a pacifist. His way of resisting was to refuse promotion to a rank higher than private.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/381 |title=Harakiri: Kobayashi and History – From the Current – The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |date= |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl] He spent time as a prisoner of war. After his release, in 1946, he returned to Shochiku as assistant to the director Keisuke Kinoshita. His own directorial debut was in 1952 when he made Musuko no Seishuri (My Son's Youth). 
From 1959 to 1961, Kobayashi directed The Human Condition (1959–1961), a trilogy on the effects of World War II on a Japanese pacifist and socialist. The total length of the films is over nine hours. 
In 1962 he directed Harakiri, which won the Jury Prize at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival.
