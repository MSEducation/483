She has appeared in an eclectic range of films, including the 2004 comedy Jersey Girl, the indie film Lonesome Jim (2005), the drama Reign Over Me (2007) and big-budget studio films such as Armageddon (1998), The Strangers (2008) and The Incredible Hulk (2008).

From 1972 to 1979, Liv’s mother Bebe Buell had a longtime relationship with rock musician Todd Rundgren. During their cohabitation, sometimes they were on-and-off. In 1976, Buell became unexpectedly pregnant from her brief relationship with Steven Tyler. On July 1, 1977, Buell gave birth to Liv. But Buell initially named the daughter Liv Rundgren and claimed that Todd Rundgren was the biological father. Rundgren and Buell ended their romantic relationship shortly after Liv's birth, but Rundgren put his heart and soul into the "white lie".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/liv_tyler/biography|title=Liv Tyler Biography|accessdate=2008-06-23|work=People[/tpl] At age eight Liv met Steven Tyler and noticed a resemblance she shared with his other daughter, Mia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3553957/Liv-Tyler-living-for-today.html|title=Liv Tyler: living for today|last=Dominus|first=Susan|date=2008-06-20|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-01-07 | location=London[/tpl] When she asked her mother about the similarity, the secret was revealed. The truth about Tyler's paternity did not become public until six years later in 1991, when she changed her name from Rundgren to Tyler,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23789004-5009160,00.html|title=Tyler Liv's life to the full|last=Reinhart|first=Ernst|coauthors=Gillian Cumming|date=2008-06-01|work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|accessdate=2009-01-07[/tpl] but kept the former as a middle name.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Buell's stated reason for the initial decision was that Steven was too heavily addicted to drugs at the time of her birth. Since learning the truth about her paternity, Liv and Steven have developed a close relationship. They also have worked together professionally, once when she appeared in Aerosmith's music video for "Crazy" in 1993, and again when Aerosmith performed many of the songs in the film Armageddon (1998) in which Tyler starred.
According to Tyler "... Todd Rundgren basically decided when I was born that I needed a father so he signed my birth certificate. He knew that there was a chance that I might not be his but …." He paid to put her through private school, and she visited him several times a year.[tpl]cite web|last=Brealey|first=Louise|title=Liv Tyler interview|url=http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/0911/04/liv-tyler/|publisher=Wonderland Magazine|accessdate=29 November 2012|date=Feb–Mar 2009|quote=Todd Rundgren was my father.

Tyler maintains a close relationship with Rundgren. "I’m so grateful to him, I have so much love for him. You know, when he holds me it feels like Daddy. And he’s very protective and strong."

When asked about the way she spent her early life, Tyler said: "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany ... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mylifetime.com/lifestyle/entertainment/celebrities/liv-tyler-looking-back-no-regrets?page=0,1|title=Liv Tyler: Looking Back With No Regrets|last=Hay|first=Carla|date=2008-06-11|work=Lifetime|accessdate=2009-01-14[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early work===

Tyler received her first modeling job at age 14 with the assistance of Paulina Porizkova, who took pictures of her that ended up in Interview magazine. She later starred in television commercials. She, however, became bored with her modeling career less than a year after it started, and decided to go into acting, although she never took acting lessons. Tyler first became known to television audiences when she starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the music video for Aerosmith's 1993 song "Crazy".

===1994–2000===

Tyler made her feature film debut in Silent Fall in 1994, where she played the elder sister of a boy with autism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E6DF103FF93BA15753C1A962958260|title=Two Parents, Two Murders, Two Children, Too Much|last=James|first=Caryn|date=1994-10-28|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-07[/tpl] In 1995, she starred in the comedy drama Empire Records.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6130443/review/5989963/empire_records|title=Empire Records — Review|last=Levy|first=Joe|date=2003-05-20|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] Tyler has described Empire Records as "one of the best experiences" she has ever had. Soon after, she landed a supporting role in James Mangold's 1996 drama Heavy as Callie, a naive young waitress. The film received favorable reviews;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/heavy|title=Heavy (1996): Reviews|date=1996-06-05|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] critic Janet Maslin noted: "Ms. Tyler ... gives a charmingly ingenuous performance, betraying no self-consciousness about her lush good looks."[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E5D91F39F936A35755C0A960958260|title=A Chance To Love Unsettles Daydreams Of a Loner|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=1996-06-05|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl]
Tyler had her breakthrough role in Stealing Beauty (1996), in which she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/stealingbeauty|title=Stealing Beauty (1996): Reviews|date=1996-06-14|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] but Tyler's performance was favored by the critics; Variety wrote: "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117905114.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Stealing Beauty Review|last=Rooney|first=David|date=1996-03-29|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] Empire noted, "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with a rare opportunity to enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=4085|title=Review of Stealing Beauty|work=Empire|accessdate=2009-01-13[/tpl] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci claimed "there was something missing in all of them".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984714-2,00.html|title=Living it Up!|last=Bellafante|first=Ginia|coauthors=Georgia Harbison and Jeffrey Ressner|date=1996-06-17|work=Time|page=2|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] He later admitted that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler admitted she wanted to separate herself from the character during production; "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny."
She later appeared in That Thing You Do! (1996), a movie about a fictional one-hit wonder rock band called The Oneders, following their whirlwind rise to the top of the pop charts, and just as quickly, their plunge back to obscurity.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947453/review/5947454/that_thing_you_do|title=That Thing You Do!: Review|last=Travers|first=Peter|date=2001-04-17|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] The film was written and directed by Tom Hanks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961004/REVIEWS/610040307/1023|title=That Thing You Do!|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=1996-10-04|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] It grossed over $25 million worldwide,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&id=livtyler.htm|title=Liv Tyler Movie Box Office Results|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] and was met with favorable reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/thatthingyoudo|title=That Thing You Do!

Tyler next appeared in Armageddon (1998), where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/armageddon|title=Armageddon (1998): Reviews|date=1998-07-01|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl] but was a box office success earning $553 million worldwide.

I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career - I just want it to be special when I make a movie."
She was then cast in the drama Onegin (1999), a film based on the 19th century Russian novel of the same name by Alexander Pushkin, in which she portrayed Tatyana Larina and co-starred with Ralph Fiennes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/livtyler/?view=jobs|title=Hello Magazine Filmography — Liv Tyler|accessdate=2008-06-23|publisher=Hello!

She later appeared in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000).

Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon.

Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin, but this was tough." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/dvd/5947505/review/5947506/one_night_at_mccools|title=One Night at McCool's — Review|last=Travers|first=Peter|date=2001-04-02|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-01-14[/tpl]
