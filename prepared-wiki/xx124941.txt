The Luxury Gap is the second album by the English synthpop band Heaven 17. Recorded under the working title "Ashes and Diamonds" [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/51106326@N00/8326264565/in/set-72157632383750505/ |title=Smash Hits magazine February 3 - 19 1983 page 12[/tpl] and released in 1983, it is the band's biggest selling album, peaking at number 4 in the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum (300,000 copies sold) by the BPI in 1984.
In contrast to their debut album, Penthouse and Pavement, the singles charted strongly, particularly "Temptation" which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and was the 32nd biggest selling single of 1983.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Other hits included "Come Live With Me" (UK number 5) and "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry" (UK number 17).
The band performed the album in its entirety on 14 October 2011 at Londonâ€™s Roundhouse, the first night featured Heaven 17 (Martyn Ware and Glenn Gregory) performing the album in "3-D sound" developed by Ware himself. The show is a sequel of sorts to the Penthouse and Pavement concerts the band played in 2010.

==Track listing==

All songs written by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh, Martyn Ware.
The US Arista issue of this album omitted "Who'll Stop the Rain" and "Let Me Go", both of which had appeared on a US-only release titled Heaven 17 (featuring most tracks from Penthouse and Pavement) in 1982. They were replaced with re-recorded versions of "Let's All Make a Bomb" and "Song With No Name" (from Penthouse and Pavement, and released as B-sides in the UK).
