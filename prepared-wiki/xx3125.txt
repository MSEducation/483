I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:

things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use

Other notable computer scientists who participated in this thread include David Touretzky, Guy Steele, and Jaime Carbonell.
Within a few months, it had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet.  Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.

==Western style==

Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by nose and the mouth. The two character version :) which omits the nose is also very popular.

===Common western examples===

The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or a without hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example :( equals sad and :(( equals very sad or weeping. A  blush can be expressed as :"> . Others include wink ;), a grin :D, smug :->, and tongue out :P for disgust or simply just to stick the tongue out for silliness, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also   for a heart, and  3  for a broken heart. A representation of a cat face can be expressed like this: :3, along with a mustache emoticon :-{ or :{D.
A broad grin is often shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; XD and the addition of further "D" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. XDDDD.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] There are hundreds of other variations including  >:D for an evil grin or     >:(    for anger, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappily angry face, in the shape of  D:. =K for vampire teeth, :s for grimface, and ;P can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it.Dresner & Herring (2010).

===Variation===

An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as =), without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an "o" as in =O . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/denoser/ |title=Denoser strips noses from text |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon :-) or :^). Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, o, O, and 0 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as ] instead of ).
Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley =) may occur in Scandinavia, where the keys for = and ) are placed right beside each other. However, the :) variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the =) version a rarity. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters Ö and Ü can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of :O (meaning that one is surprised) and :D (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.
Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example D: which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of :D.

==Japanese style==

Users from Japan popularized a style of emoticons (顔文字, kaomoji) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.[tpl]cite web|url=http://staff.aist.go.jp/k.harigaya/doc/kao_his.html |title=The History of Smiley Marks |publisher=Staff.aist.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Emoticons Free said |url=http://whatjapanthinks.com/2007/09/19/turns-25-but-how-old-are-japanese-emoticons/ |title=The History of Smiley Marks (English) |publisher=Whatjapanthinks.com |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] Similar looking emoticons were used by Byte Information Exchange (BIX) around the same time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt |title=Jargon file, version 2.6.1, February 12, 1991 |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]
These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to (*_*). The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.
Different emotions such as (")(-_-)("), are expressed by changing the character representing the eyes, for example "T" can be used to express crying or sadness (T_T). T_T may also be used as meaning 'unimpressed'. The emphasis on the eyes is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. ^^. Looks of stress are represented by the likes of (x_x) while (-_-;) is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon indicating sweat that occurs during anxiety. Repeating the /// mark can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing. This "three slash method of blushing" was eventually adopted by Japanese animators for use in their animations, demonstrating a subtle example of one media following another.[tpl]cite web|title=KawaiiFace.net|url=http://kawaiiface.net|accessdate=21 March 2014|year=2014[/tpl] Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth or to represent a nose, e.g. (^.^). Alternatively, as popularized by Daniel Spaulding, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. (^^).
Parentheses also can often be replaced with braces, e.g. {^_^}. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. ^^, >., o_O, O.O, e_e and/or e.e. A quotation mark ", apostrophe ', or semicolon ; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in popular and common Asian animation.
Microsoft IME 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the use of both forms of emoticons by enabling Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary. In IME 2007, it was moved to Emoticons dictionary.
Further variations of emoticons may be produced by using combining characters, e.g. ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶  and  ᶘᵒᴥᵒᶅ.

===Common eastern examples[tpl]anchor|Eastern_style[/tpl]===

||happy ||
||laughing out loud||
||headphones or listening to music;||
||Thumbs up!
|-
|
||Sleepy head||
||sleepy person||
||cheers, "Hurrah!"||
||shyness
|-
|
||Uninterested, irritated, Tired, a "tsk tsk" face  ||
||confused||
||winking 
|
||       sad (crying face), can also be used in a similar context as -.-
|-
|
||Surprised||
||shifty, suspicious, serious; could also be sarcasm or irritation||
||"Have a cookie/waffle/drink from a cup with a spiral straw"||
||ashamed or embarrassed
|}
All of these can be used also with  instead of ( ), or without the parentheses at all in some of the cases. There is also the \(0O0)\, indicating a hooligan or crazed behaviour, and the (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧.

===Western use of Japanese style===

English-language anime forums adopted those emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on western keyboards. Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in the English-speaking Internet. They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and other non-anime related forums. Emoticons such as , , , ,  or (>';..;')> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs ) also are often referred to as "[tpl]not a typo|Kirbys[/tpl]" in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character, Kirby.  The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier, (e.g. ^_^ for very happy) for the emoticon in question. This emoticon t(-_-t) uses the eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the western "middle-finger flick-off (commonly known as 'the bird')" using a "t" as the arm, hand, and finger. Also, one of the newer ones, *,..,*, or `;..;´ as such for a "vampire" or other mythical beasts with fangs.

===Mixture of Western and Japanese style===

Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or emoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture, has given rise to emoticons that have an upright viewing format. The parentheses are similarly dropped in the English language context and the emoticons only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as -O-, -3-, -w-, '_', ;_;, T_T, :>, and .V. are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime or manga-styled sweat drop, for example: ^_^' or !>_ as well as: _;;, ;O; and *u*
The equal sign can also be used for closed, anime looking eyes, for example: =0=, =3=, =w=, =A= and =7=.
There are also more faces along those lines like >ousing the ; as a sweat mark, and the o as a mouth, and the inequality signs as the eyes, it shows stress, or slight confusion. The number of emoticons that can be made are limitless, and all have their own meaning.
In Brazil, sometimes combining character (accent) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, like: ò_ó, ó_ò, õ_o, ù_u or o_Ô. They can also replace (or add) = or : with > , for example >D, >=D, >P, >:P, >3 or >:3.

===2channel style===

The Japanese language is usually encoded using double-byte character codes. As a result there is a bigger variety of characters that can be used in emoticons, many of which cannot be reproduced in ASCII. Most kaomoji contain Cyrillic and other foreign letters to create even more complicated expressions analogous to ASCII art's level of complexity. To type such emoticons, the input editor that is used to type Japanese on a user's system is equipped with a dictionary of emoticons, after which the user simply types the Japanese word (or something close to it) that represents the desired emoticon to convert the input into such complicated emoticons. Such expressions are known as Shift JIS art.
Users of 2channel in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from obscure languages, such as Kannada: ಠ_ಠ (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion); these were quickly picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after. Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Mona.

==Korean style==

In South Korea, emoticons use Korean Hangul letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean jamo (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos : ㅅ or ㅁ or ㅂ as the mouth/nose component and ㅇ,ㅎ,ㅍ for the eyes. For example: ㅇㅅㅇ, ㅇㅂㅇ, ㅇㅁㅇ and -ㅅ-. Faces such as 'ㅅ', "ㅅ", 'ㅂ' and 'ㅇ', using quotation marks " and apostrophes ' are also commonly used combinations.
Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: ㅜㅜ, ㅠㅠ and 뉴뉴 (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash "—" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in ㅜ.ㅜ, ㅠ.ㅜ, ㅠ.ㅡ, ㅜ_ㅠ, ㅡ^ㅜ and ㅜㅇㅡ. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or - they depict a bad feeling. Examples: -;/, --^, ㅡㅡ;;;, -_-;; and -_^. However, ^^ means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: ~_~, --a, -6-, +0+.

==Chinese ideographic style==

The character 囧 (U+56E7), which means "bright",[tpl]cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/181979.htm |title=Baidu: 囧 |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] is also used in the Chinese computing community for a frowning face.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.people.com.cn/BIG5/61602/7815716.html |title=生僻字大行其道 "囧"衍生出各種表情 |publisher=Tv.people.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as 囧rz. The character existed in Oracle bone script, but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nownews.com/2005/01/20/327-1744028.htm |title=心情很orz嗎？ 網路象形文字幽默一下 |publisher=Nownews.com |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]
Other ideographic variants for 囧 include 崮 (king 囧), 莔 (queen 囧), 商 (囧 with hat), 囧興 (turtle), 卣 (Bomberman).
The character 槑 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for "plum" (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/82855.htm |title=Baidu: 槑 |publisher=Baike.baidu.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) may be duplicated to express emphasis.

===Orz===

Orz (also seen as [tpl]nowrap|Or2,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|on_,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|OTZ,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|OTL,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|STO,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|JTO,[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/07/all-about-orz.html|author=Boing Boing|title=All about Orz|accessdate=2009-03-24[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|_no,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|＿冂○,[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfnt.net/t/photo/your/craft_06suman.shtml |title=みんなの作った  "paper craft of orz" |accessdate=2009-08-18 [/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|囧[tpl]zwsp[/tpl]rz,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|O7Z,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|_|7O,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|Sto,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|O|¯|_,[/tpl] [tpl]nowrap|orz,[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|Jto[/tpl])[tpl]Or|date=August 2009[/tpl] is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person, with the "o" being the head, the "r" being the arms and part of the body, and the "z" being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure represents failure and despair. It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, Japanese personal website. At the "Techside FAQ Forum" (TECHSIDE教えて君BBS(教えてBBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing [tpl]nowrap|"＿|￣|○"[/tpl] to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. However, one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread on [tpl]iawm|http://210.136.179.189/cgi-bin/ch/log/log.html|"Techside Chitchat Forum" (Techside一言板。)[/tpl], on December 23, 2002.[tpl]Or|date=August 2009[/tpl] By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase "nice guy"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like "You are a nice guy."
Orz should not be confused with [tpl]nowrap|m(_ _)m,[/tpl] which means "Thank you" or an apology.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

==Multimedia variations==

A portmanteau of emotion and sound, an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

In 2004, The Trillian chat application introduced a feature called "emotiblips", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients "as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/faqs/ |title=The Creators of Trillian and Trillian Pro IM Clients |publisher=Cerulean Studios |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl]
In 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show The Hills. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley & Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as "greeting cards that just happen to be selling something".AdWeek Article about Emoticlip[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2009[/tpl]
In 2008, an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The Adobe Flash and Java-based application allows users to create a short animation.

==Emoticons and intellectual property rights==

In 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the "frowny" emoticon :-( when used on "greeting cards, posters and art prints." In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot.Schwartz, John. "Compressed Data; Don't Mind That Lawsuit, It's Just a Joke", New York Times
A number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have issued as US patents. [tpl]cite patent|US|6987991[/tpl], for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop down menu. The stated advantage over the prior art was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.
In Finland, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked,[tpl]cite web|author=STT |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2012081315947358_uu.shtml |title=Hymiölle ei saa tavaramerkkiä | Kotimaan uutiset |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2013-03-14[/tpl] thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons :-), =), =(, :) and :(.[tpl]cite journal | title = Tavaramerkkilehti | journal = Tavaramerkkilehti | issue = 10 | pages = 27–28 | publisher = National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland | date = 2006-05-31 | url = http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/lehti/tm/Tavaramerkkilehti10S_2006.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-06-16 [/tpl] The emoticon :-) was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM).
