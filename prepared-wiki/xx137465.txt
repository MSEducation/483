Granborough Road railway station was a station serving the village of Granborough, to the north of Quainton in Buckinghamshire, England.

==History==

The station was first served in 1868 and closed in 1936.
It was the third station north of Aylesbury on the section of the Metropolitan Railway between Aylesbury and Verney Junction that was abandoned when the Metropolitan Railway became the Metropolitan line in 1936 when it was subsumed into London Transport. London Underground continued to run services as far as Aylesbury until 1961 after which point the terminus became Amersham.
Whilst open, this station was accessed via a branch line off the former Great Central Main Line with the junction being just to the north of Quainton Road. The branch line continued through Winslow Road and ended at a terminating platform at Verney Junction.
Today very little remains of this station, the permanent way between Quainton Road and Verney Junction having long ago been lifted. The site is now a farmer's field and although bit of platform does remain, the track bed itself is now a route for pylons.
Despite being over 30 miles from London and not underground, the association with the Metropolitan line means this station is considered to be one of the closed London Underground stations. It is briefly referred to as such in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall.
