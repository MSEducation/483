The Polish minority in Belarus numbers officially about 294,549 according to 2009 census.Statistics from belstat.gov.by (бюллетень). See page 22. RAR data compression of [tpl]PDF|171.5KB[/tpl] file.

An estimated 180,905 Polish Belarusians live in large agglomerations and 113,644 in smaller settlements, with the number of women exceeding the number of men by about 33,000. Some estimates by Polish non-governmental sources in the U.S. are higher, citing the previous poll held in 1989 under the Soviet authorities with 413,000 Poles recorded.Boris Kleyn (1994), Poles in Belarus: Revival of Heritage and Search for Ancestors.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of sovereign Republic of Belarus, the situation of the Polish minority has been steadily improving. The politics of Sovietization pursued by decades of indoctrination, went down in history. Poles in Belarus began re-establishing the Polish language schools and their legal right of participating in the religious life. However, the attitude of new authorities to Polish minority are not very consistent. The new laws are insufficient, and the local levels of Belarusian government are largely unwilling to accept the aspirations of their own ethnic Poles,Prof. Piotr Eberhardt, "Polacy na Białorusi." Świat Polonii. Stowarzyszenie Wspólnota Polska. Accessed August 6, 2011. making them into new targets for state-sanctioned intolerance, according to 2005 report by The Economist."Bordering on madness: Belarus mistreats its Polish minority."

==History==

Polish ethnic and cultural presence in modern Belarus are an intricate part of its history. The lands of modern Belarus are the birthplace of Mickiewicz and Domejko among others.Boris Kleyn (1994), "Poles in Belarus: Revival of Heritage and Search for Ancestors." PolishRoots. The Polish Genealogy Source. Accessed August 08, 2011. The proto-Belarusian language, called Ruthenian or Old Belarusian was protected by law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and used as local vernacular, while both Polish and Latin languages were the lingua franca of the throne. "As the 16th century drew to a close" – wrote Andrew Savchenko about the local nobles, they had to contend with "an increasingly stark choice: to strengthen their ties with Poland or to suffer disastrous military defeat and subjugation" by the Russian Empire,Andrew Savchenko, Belarus: a perpetual borderland. BRILL, 2009. ISBN 90-04-17448-6. Accessed August 8, 2011. thus leading to their voluntary Polonization. Throughout the 19th century, "the mass of unassuming peasants was subjected to active Russification" by the Tsarist authorities including the abolition of the Uniate Church created by the Union of Brest, a uniquely Belarusian institution and the cornerstone of the Belarusian nation.Andrew Savchenko, Belarus: a perpetual borderland. BRILL, 2009. Ibidem, page 39.
The territories of the Russian Empire consisting of modern Belarus were divided in 1921 between Poland and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic at the Treaty of Riga, thus ending the Polish-Soviet War. Thousands of Poles settled in the area following the peace treaty.[tpl]cite book|title=Economic Change and the National Question in Twentieth-century Europe|author=Alice Teichova, Herbert Matis, Jaroslav Pátek|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8UVxY-8Xk-sC&pg=PA345&dq=nowogrodek++++minorities&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a | isbn=978-0-521-63037-5[/tpl] In the elections of November 1922, a Belarusian party (in the Blok Mniejszości Narodowych coalition) obtained 14 seats in the Polish parliament (11 of them in the lower chamber, Sejm).Eugeniusz Mironowicz, "Białoruś", Trio, Warszawa, 1999, [tpl]nowrap|ISBN 83-85660-82-8[/tpl]  [tpl]pl icon[/tpl] In 1923, a new regulation was passed allowing for the Belarusian language to be used officially both in courts and in schools. Obligatory teaching of the Belarusian language was introduced in all Polish gymnasia in areas inhabited by Belarusians in 1927.
Across the border, in the Belarusian SSR, Minsk was home to Polish community organizations and a Polish-speaking national theatre of Belarus. In addition, a Polish Autonomous District, Dzierzynszczyzna, was proclaimed on Soviet territory. However, in East Belarus the Soviet authorities liquidated most Polish organizations in the early 1930s. In 1937–1938 the Soviet NKVD and the Communist Party attempted to eradicate Poles as a minority group in East Belarus during the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action of the Great Terror.

===The "Polish operation" of the NKVD===

Just prior to the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the Soviet Byelorussia witnessed the genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union resulting in the virtual eradication of Polish minority along the border.[tpl]cite web | url=http://bookhaven.stanford.edu/tag/timothy-snyder/ | title=A letter from Timothy Snyder of Bloodlands: Two genocidaires, taking turns in Poland | publisher=Stanford University | work=The Book Haven | date=December 15, 2010 | accessdate=April 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thepolishreview.org/backissues.html | title=Execute the Poles: The Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union, 1937–1938.

===1939 invasion of Poland===

Following the Nazi–Soviet Invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish anti-German resistance movement Armia Krajowa was actively operating on the territory of modern Belarus, although many ethnic Belarusians also actively participated in the movement.According to the historian Jan Siamashka, ethnic Belarusians of only Orthodox faith constituted about 40% of the Navahrudak Discrict Military Group of the AK (Zgrupowanie Okręgu AK Nowogródek). This number does not include Roman Catholic Belarusians http://www.jivebelarus.net/history/new-history/army-krayova-part-02b.html?page=4 Soon after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the former territories of Kresy were divided between Germany and the Soviet Union in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and subsequently, incorporated into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic following staged elections. The area that became part of the USSR formed the new West Belarus. 
In their attack, the Red Army overrun 52.1% of territory of interwar Poland with over 13,700,000 inhabitants. The Soviet occupation zone included also 336,000 new refugees who escaped from Polish lands invaded by Germany, numbering at around 198,000.[tpl]pl icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author =Elżbieta Trela-Mazur | coauthors = | title =Sowietyzacja oświaty w Małopolsce Wschodniej pod radziecką okupacją 1939–1941 (Sovietization of education in eastern Lesser Poland during the Soviet occupation 1939–1941) | year =1997 | editor =Włodzimierz Bonusiak, Stanisław Jan Ciesielski, Zygmunt Mańkowski, Mikołaj Iwanow | page =294 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Wyższa Szkoła Pedagogiczna im.

Many inhabitants of Belarus who identified themselves as Poles were allowed to go back to Poland. In exchange, several thousands of Belarusians from parts of the former Belastok Voblast were resettled to Belarus. [tpl]details|Repatriation of Poles (1944-1946)[/tpl]
The remaining Polish minority in Belarus was significantly discriminated against during the times of the Soviet Union. Until 1949 all Polish language schools were replaced with the Russian, and not even a single one remained due to continuing policies of Sovietization. All Polish organizations and social clubs were liquidated. Incidentally, the Poles were the only ethnic group in Belorussian SSR whose existence was denied by communist administration. The situation of the Polish minority started to improve only in the later years of the Soviet Union prior to its dissolution, but faced difficulties from the government of Alexander Lukashenko.

==Current situation==

According to 2009 census Polish minority in Belarus numbers officially about 295,000. After the Russian minority, Poles certainly form the second largest minority group in Belarus. The majority of Poles live in the Western regions including 230,000 in the Hrodna voblast. The largest Polish organization in Belarus is the Union of Poles in Belarus (Związek Polaków na Białorusi), with over 20,000 members.
As Poland supports the pro-democracy opposition in Belarus, Polish-Belarusian relations are poor, and representatives of the Polish minority in Belarus often complain about various repressions, such as the jailing for 15 days, of the former head of the Union of Poles, Tadeusz Gawin. He was sentenced on 2 August 2005 for arranging a meeting between a visiting deputy speaker of the Polish parliament, Donald Tusk, and the ethnic Polish activists including Veslaw Kewlyak, also sentenced for 15 days.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4147666.stm | work=BBC News | title=Belarus Polish chief jailed again | date=August 13, 2005[/tpl]Wirtualna PoloniaBiałoruś: Polowanie na Polaków The Lukashenko government launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority claiming that they were trying to destabilise the balance of power, and that the Polish minority is a fifth column (see, earlier Soviet proclamations). In May and June of that year a Polish diplomat was expelled, a Polish-language newspaper was closed and the democratically-elected leadership of a local Polish organisation, the Union of Poles in Belarus (UPB), had their own nominees forcibly replaced by those sympathetic to Lukashenko.[tpl]cite news| url=http://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4085710 | work=The Economist | title=Bordering on madness | date=June 16, 2005[/tpl]
The introduction of the Karta Polaka (Polish Charter) in 2007 confirming Polish heritage of individuals who cannot obtain dual citizenship in their own countries, enabled many thousands of inhabitants of Belarus to formally declare their Polish identity for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland. The introduction caused protests from Belarusian officials."Najwięcej wniosków o Kartę Polaka we Lwowie i Grodnie" (The most applications for the Polish Charter from Lviv and Grodno). Interia.pl after Polish Press Agency, 21 January 2009. Accessed August 9, 2001.
Poles in Belarus have an unusual linguistic situation; a slight majority use Belarusian, while a majority of ethnic Belarusians actually use Russian, as do the rest of the Poles. This unusual situation arose because the Poles in Belarus live mostly in the Belarusian-speaking parts of the country, whereas Russian now dominates in Minsk and most of eastern Belarus. Very few Belarusian Poles use Polish in everyday life.
