Knowles was born in Fairmont, West Virginia, the son of James M. Knowles, a purchasing agent from Lowell, Massachusetts, and Mary Beatrice Shea Knowles from Concord, New Hampshire. His father was vice president of a coal company, earning an income which afforded them a comfortable living.Rowe, Gabriell. “John Knowles.”  Magill’s Survey of American Literature.  EBSCO.

==A Separate Peace==

A Separate Peace was first published in London by Secker and Warburg in 1959. Published in New York in 1960 by Macmillan, it would be his most celebrated work.
The novel is based upon Knowles's experiences at Phillips Exeter Academy. Indeed, "The Devon School" setting is a thinly veiled fictionalization of it, with both campus and town easily recognizable. The plot should not be taken as autobiographical, however, even if elements of the novel stem from personal experience; these include Knowles' membership in a secret society, and sustaining of a foot injury while jumping from a tree during society exercises. In his essay, "A Special Time, A Special Place," Knowles wrote:[tpl]cite web|author=John Knowles|title=A Special Time, A Special School|accessdate=2012-04-04|url=http://www.exeter.edu/libraries/553_4390.aspx[/tpl]
 
 The only elements in A Separate Peace which were not in that summer were anger, violence, and hatred. There was only friendship, athleticism, and loyalty.

The secondary character Finny (Phineas) was the best friend of the main character, Gene. Knowles has stated that he modeled Finny on David Hackett from Milton Academy, whom he met when both attended a summer session at Phillips Exeter Academy. Hackett was a friend of Robert Kennedy's, under whom he later served in the U.S. Justice Department. A student called Phineas Sprague lived in the same dormitory as Knowles during the summer session of 1943 and may have inspired the character's name.
In his memoir Palimpsest, Gore Vidal acknowledges that he and Knowles concurrently attended Phillips Exeter Academy, with Vidal two years ahead. Vidal states that Knowles told him that the character Brinker is based on Vidal. "We have been friends for many years now," Vidal said, "and I admire the novel that he based on our school days, A Separate Peace."Goodreads -- John Knowles
