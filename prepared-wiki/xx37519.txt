Spaced is a British television sitcom written by and starring Jessica Stevenson and Simon Pegg, and directed by Edgar Wright. Two series of seven episodes each were broadcast in 1999 and 2001 on Channel 4. They were re-aired early in 2011 on both More4 and Dave and have been broadcast on 4Music.

==Plot==

Daisy Steiner (Jessica Stevenson) and Tim Bisley (Simon Pegg) are two London twenty-somethings who meet by chance in a café while both are flat-hunting. Despite barely knowing each other, they conspire to pose as a young professional couple in order to meet the requisites of an advertisement for a relatively cheap flat in the distinctive building at 23 Meteor Street, Tufnell Park, which is owned by and also houses the landlady, Marsha Klein (Julia Deakin). Also in the building is Brian Topp (Mark Heap), an eccentric conceptual artist who lives and works on his various pieces in the ground floor flat. Frequent visitors are Daisy's best friend, Twist Morgan (Katy Carmichael) and Tim's best friend, Mike Watt (Nick Frost), who ends up becoming a lodger after Marsha's daughter Amber Weary "flies the nest".
The series largely concerns the colourful and surrealistic adventures of Tim and Daisy as they navigate through life, decide on what they want to do with their lives, come to terms with affairs of the heart, and try to figure out new and largely unproductive ways of killing time. Tim and Daisy repeatedly stress that they are not a couple to everyone but Marsha, but despite (or because of) this, romantic tension develops between them, particularly during the second series.

==Production==

The show has a distinctive cinematic style set by Wright and is shot with a single camera. In addition to borrowing liberally from the visual language of film (in particular genre films), it has particular stylistic mannerisms, such as the recurring device of scene changes occurring in the middle of a pan. The series' atmosphere is also established by the use of a particular flavour of contemporary dance music on its soundtrack.[tpl]cite web|url=|title=BBC — Comedy Guide — Spaced|first=Mark|last=Lewisohn|authorlink=Mark Lewisohn|work=The bbc.co.uk Guide to Comedy |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/spaced_66603210.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070301015447/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/spaced_66603210.shtml|archivedate=1 March 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]
Northern Exposures frequent use of fantasy sequences was "one of the key influences" in the creation of the show, and Pegg and Stevenson pitched the show to LWT as "a cross between The Simpsons, The X-Files and Northern Exposure."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/whatisspaced.shtml|title=About Spaced — What Is Spaced?|first=Simon|last=Pegg|coauthors=Nick Lee|date=April 2001|work=Spaced Out|at=Influences |url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/whatisspaced.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080505031406/http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/whatisspaced.shtml|archivedate=5 May 2008|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.partypeoplemovie.com/film_sub.php?section=1&subsection=1&article_id=64|title=We Grab the Spaced Leading Man in a Quiet Moment Between Projects...|work=24 Hour Party People|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080416072720/http://www.partypeoplemovie.com/film_sub.php?section=1&subsection=1&article_id=64|archivedate=16 April 2008[/tpl]
The series is dense with references to popular culture, including but not limited to science fiction and horror films, comic books, and video games.  The Series 2 DVD release introduced the "Homage-o-meter", an alternative set of subtitles listing every reference and homage; the "Definitive Collectors Edition" boxed set introduced a similar subtitle track for Series 1.[tpl]cite web|title=Spaced (1999-2001)|first=Emma|last=Perry|work=BFI Screenonline |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/966650/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302033135/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/966650/index.html|archivedate=2 March 2008|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl] 2000 AD artists Jim Murray and Jason Brashill provided the artwork for Tim's comic The Bear, as well as other incidental artwork for the show. Tim's boss Bilbo wears a 2000 AD comic T-shirt whilst lecturing Tim about The Phantom Menace.
The series is also noted for its regular recreational drug use references, from its title onwards. Tim and Daisy smoke cannabis on a number of occasions, one episode centering on its use. Tim and Mike take speed on one occasion, and it is implied that Tim, Mike, Daisy, Twist and Brian take ecstasy while clubbing.

==Awards==

Spaced was nominated in 2000 and 2002 for a British Academy Television Award for situation comedy. Jessica Stevenson won the British Comedy Award in 1999 and 2001 for best TV Comedy Actress. Simon Pegg was nominated in 1999 for the British Comedy Award for Best Male Comedy Newcomer, and the series was nominated that same year for the British Comedy Award for Best TV Sitcom. The show's second series was nominated for an International Emmy Award in 2001 for Popular Arts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187664/awards|title=Awards for "Spaced" (1999)|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]

==DVD releases==

Spaced Series 1 and 2 were both released on DVD in the United Kingdom. These were followed by a boxed set which collects the previously released single-series DVDs, adding a bonus disc with a feature-length documentary, Skip to the End, behind the scenes of the show, as well as a music video by Osymyso.
Music rights issues long prevented the release of Spaced in Region 1 (U.S. and Canada). Despite the raised profile resulting from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (film collaborations between Pegg and Wright that performed well in the Region 1 countries), no DVDs surfaced between 2004 and 2007. In an interview,[tpl]Nonspecific|date=July 2010[/tpl] it was suggested a deal with Anchor Bay Entertainment failed to come to fruition over the music rights.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Wright announced the release of a Region 1 Spaced DVD release on 22 July 2008, which included an all-new commentary with Wright, Pegg, and Stevenson, as well as special guests Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Bill Hader, Matt Stone, and Patton Oswalt. Supplemental features included the original commentaries, the Skip to the End documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, and raw footage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/36638|title=Details Finally Drop on SPACED!!!

==Music==

Individual tracks that were particularly featured in an episode included "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?" by Louis Jordan, "Smash It" by Fuzz Townshend, and "The Staunton Lick" by Lemon Jelly. A Guy Pratt remix of the A-Team theme song, featured at the conclusion of "Epiphanies", was a fan favourite, but was never made commercially available.
In 2001, a soundtrack to the first series was released in tandem with the first series' release on DVD and videotape. A second soundtrack was not released, although the series' official fan website has an episode-by-episode list of music featured in the second series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/s2soundtrack/|title=The Series 2 Soundtrack|last=Lee|first=Nick|work=Spaced Out|accessdate=21 March 2007[/tpl]

==End of the series==

Since the show's end, cast and crew associated with Spaced have been quoted with differing opinions as to whether a third series would be produced, with their most recent statements reflecting a consensus that the show has concluded and will not see a third series.
Soon after series 2 had aired on television, the official Spaced fan website announced that, "despite what certain national newspapers might have said, series 2 is not the last series of Spaced. There will be a third series of Spaced - we just don't know when."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/future.shtml|title=About Spaced — The Future|first=Nick|last=Lee|work=Spaced Out|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080505021219/http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/about-spaced/future.shtml|archivedate=5 May 2008|accessdate=11 March 2007[/tpl]
Edgar Wright initially was "torn" about making more Spaced, saying "we have genuinely talked about it and have some neat ideas that could work in a Before Sunset/Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? kind of way".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/forums/index.php?showtopic=7146|title=Interview With Edgar Wright, the Results Are In|author=Downsy|date=12 October 2004|work=Spaced Out|at=Margate Steve|accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl] However, in April 2007, Wright confirmed that the show no longer had any possibility of returning in any form, as the actors were all now "too old", and he and Pegg feared it would ruin a good thing.Question-and-answer session following the Los Angeles screening of "Hot Fuzz" on 7 April 2007 at the Aero Theater, 1328 Montana Avenue, Santa Monica, California. In August of that same year, Wright told Rotten Tomatoes that "there's not going to be a third season, it would be silly now" but that they could "do something that sort of like catches our heroes ten years later."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/comic_con_2007/news/1658038/edgar_wright_on_the_spaced_dvd_and_reunion_show|title=Edgar Wright On the Spaced DVD (and Reunion Show?)|first=Jen|last=Yamato|date=2 August 2007|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]
In 2006, Simon Pegg stated in a Chain Reaction interview (conducted by co-star Bill Bailey, who had played Tim's boss, Bilbo) that he would like to bring back Spaced for a one-hour special to "tie up all the loose ends."[tpl]cite episode|title=Programme 6 of 6|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/chainreaction.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017194954/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/chainreaction.shtml |archivedate=17 October 2007 |series=Chain Reaction|serieslink=Chain Reaction (radio)|credits=Bill Bailey, host|network=BBC Radio 4|airdate=2006[/tpl] In a March 2007 interview on a New Zealand radio station,[tpl]Nonspecific|date=July 2010[/tpl] Pegg was asked by the interviewer if Spaced was "an ongoing production" and responded, "No, I think that's done." In May 2008, Pegg said, "We have never categorically ruled out the possibility of more. Tim, Daisy, Mike, Brian, Twist, Marsha, and Colin all have destinies locked in mine and Jess's collective grey matter, who's to say they won't some day be played out."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaced-out.org.uk/forums/index.php?showtopic=14148|title=Simon's Response to the Deadline Hollywood Post|first=Simon|last=Pegg|authorlink=Simon Pegg|date=2 May 2008|work=Spaced Out|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl] Pegg tweeted in December 2009 that if he was given the chance to continue Spaced, he would decline,[tpl]cite web|url=http://twitter.com/simonpegg/statuses/7175129079|title=RT @Unclegabby: @simonpegg if given the chance to continue Spaced would you?

In 2007, Nick Frost called the series "dead", saying that Pegg was holding out the possibility only to not disappoint the fans and keep them happy, but that Frost could declare it dead as he had no emotional attachment.[tpl]cite journal|year=2007|journal=Drum Media[/tpl] Frost said Pegg and Stevenson decided that series 2 would be the end whilst writing episode 7.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl] 
During an interview with the Guardian in July 2013 promoting The World's End with Edgar Wright and Nick Frost, Pegg stated: "Whenever we get asked about ... another series of Spaced ... one of the reasons we're not going to do it is because we couldn't possibly write it with any degree of truth now, because that's not where we are or who we are any more. I always find it's better to write from a perspective of truth."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2013/jul/17/worlds-end-simon-pegg-nick-frost-video |title=The World's End: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright on their apocalypse comedy - video interview |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-17[/tpl]
Pegg had joked that a hypothetical third series would end with a Blake's 7 style shoot-out,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] but a brief in-character epilogue at the end of the documentary feature Skip to the End reveals that Daisy and Tim formed a romantic relationship and had a daughter (whom Tim professes a wish to call "Luke").[tpl]cite video|people=Dan Mudford, dir.; Nira Park, prod.|date=14 August 2006|title=Skip to the End|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471388/|medium=DVD|publisher=Channel 4 Television Corporation|location=United Kingdom|accessdate=6 July 2010[/tpl] As one of the show's writers, Pegg noted that Tim and Daisy were always going to end up together from the beginning, and described a moment he envisioned for the show where they both realize they love each other. In the same instance, he outlined the futures considered for other characters: Brian has a long and happy life with Twist, and after his death, his works become incredibly popular and sell for millions. Twist, however, ends up in suspended animation and awakes in the future, to find everyone, to her disgust, is wearing silver. Mike ends up with Dexter and moves to South London.[tpl]cite video|date=10 November 2007|title=Spaced on Stage — BFI Spaced Reunion|url=http://blip.tv/file/2641239|format=Flash|medium=Live recording|location=National Film Theatre, London, England|accessdate=24 September 2009|time=54 minutes[/tpl]

==American remake==

Fox announced on 29 October 2007 that it would commission a pilot for an American version of Spaced, a project they then scuttled in May 2008 following a generally negative reaction from the series' creators and fans of the original show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.televisionaryblog.com/2008/05/where-pilots-go-to-die-foxs-spaced.html|title=Where Pilots Go to Die: FOX's "Spaced"|first=Jace|last=Lacob|date=28 May 2008|work=Televisionary|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]
Wright was initially approached about an American version after the first series was broadcast in 1999, and felt an American remake was impossible due to the series' fundamental theme. "Same reason it couldn't be a film," Wright said. "Part of the charm of 'Spaced' is it's people in north London acting out stuff from American films ... you know, Hollywood in, kind of, suburbia. ... American TV is much more glamorous. It doesn't make any sense. I remember that the producer at the time said, 'Yeah, we'd have to change a few things. We'd have to take out the drugs and the swearing, and obviously, Mike can't have guns.'"[tpl]cite video|date=10 November 2007|title=Spaced on Stage — BFI Spaced Reunion|url=http://blip.tv/file/2641239|format=Flash|medium=Live recording|location=National Film Theatre, London, England|time=48 minutes[/tpl]
Neither Wright, Pegg, nor Stevenson were at any point approached regarding the proposed American remake, which Wright had dubbed "McSpaced", due to the involvement of film director McG. Wright was upset that "they would a) never bother to get in touch but still b) splash my and Simon's names all over the trade announcements and imply that we're involved in the same way Ricky & Steve were with The Office". Pegg and Stevenson also complained of the "lack of respect" demonstrated by the creators of the proposed American series, who left them out of discussions as well.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/mar/23/channel4.newscorporation|title=Hollywood snubbed us, says angry comedy star|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|coauthors=Ben Walters|date=23 March 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]
Wright was also angry at the media for what he felt was their overlooking of Stevenson's role in the creation of Spaced by connecting the series to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in news articles.
