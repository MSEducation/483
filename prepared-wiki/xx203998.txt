==History==

During the interwar period, Lithuanian politicians and medical experts perceived a need for a major hospital complex in the area, and gathered to discuss the possibility on February 5, 1936.Džiuljeta Kulvietienė .Draugystės konferencija. Retrieved on 2008-05-23 Soon afterwards the Lithuanian cabinet adopted a resolution to build a hospital near the Seventh Fort. An international competition was held to select the best project. Six different proposals were submitted, two of them from outside Lithuania. The commission chose proposal "XXX", by the French architects Urbain Cassan and Elie Ouchanoff.
The development of the hospital quickly gained momentum. Urbain Cassan met with physicians to gather feedback and hear specific requests and proposals for the arrangement of rooms. These discussions went on for about ten days. The building commission acted in coordination to review the designs and sketches, which resulted in redesigns of, and improvements to, several aspects of the initial proposal. In 1937 the cornerstone was laid, marking the active phase of construction. The work continued until July 1939; it employed several of the newest building technologies. The hospital complex comprised six buildings, covering about 160,000 square meters, including a 75-meter-tall chimney. Its major buildings were linked through underground tunnels, with a total length of one kilometer.bendri duomenys.
