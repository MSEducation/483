[[Otanthus]]

CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera, Flora of Lebanon

Otanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family.
The Cotton weed plant(otanthus maritimus) is a small pioneering perennial that grows in the dune areas throughout the Mediterranean and exerts a stabilizing action on the sandy soils. The gender name otos (ear) and anthos (flower) derive from 
the Greek language, from the form of the corolla, which is composed of three membranous bracts that create 
a peculiar profile. A thick white down covers both the stems and the small oval, slightly saw-toothed alternate leaves. 
The globose flower heads, with their short peduncles, are composed of an envelope of white-wooly scales around tubular 
yellow flowers that are visible from June through to September.
