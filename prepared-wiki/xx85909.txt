[[Blood chit]]

CATEGORIES: Military personal equipment, Military aviation

A blood chit is a notice carried by military personnel and addressed to any civilians who may come across an armed-services member – such as a shot-down pilot – in difficulties. As well as identifying the force to which the bearer belongs as friendly, the notice displays a message requesting that the service member be rendered every assistance.
Alternative names are escape and identification flags ([tpl]zh|c=人物證明書|p=rénwù zhèngmíng shū[/tpl]). Chit (also 'chitty') is a British English term for a small document, note or pass; it is an Anglo-Indian word dating from the late 18th century, derived from the Hindi citthi.[tpl]cite web|title=Chit source|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chit|accessdate=22 February 2012[/tpl]
The idea of blood chit originates from 1793 when French balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated his hot air balloon in the USA. Because he could not control the direction of the balloon, no one knew where he would land. Because Blanchard did not speak English, George Washington gave him a letter that said that all US citizens were obliged to assist him to return to Philadelphia.
In World War I, British Royal Flying Corps pilots in India and Mesopotamia carried a "goolie chit" printed in four local languages that promised a reward to anyone who would bring an unharmed British aviator back to British lines. The term "goolie" is British slang for "testicles" and was so called (and still is called by the Royal Air Force) because, in the areas where the chits were used, local tribesmen were said to turn over aviators to their womenfolk, who castrated the pilots for use as servants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] But the British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathan women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955) of British India (now modern day Pakistan) during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead and castrate non Muslim soldiers who were captured, like British and Sikhs.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bugles-Tiger-Gurkhas-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304361569/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1276361279&sr=1-1|title=Bugles and a Tiger|author=John Masters|date=June 13, 2002|publisher=Cassell Military (June 13, 2002)|location=|isbn=0-304-36156-9|page=190|pages=|accessdate=5 April 2011[/tpl]
In the Second Sino-Japanese War prior to World War II, foreign volunteer pilots of Flying Tigers carried notices printed in Chinese that informed the locals that this foreign pilot was fighting for China and they were obliged to help them.[tpl]cite web|last=Rossi |first=Dick |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger2.htm |title=A Flying Tigers Story |date=1980s |work=The Flying Tigers - American Volunteer Group - Chinese Air Force[/tpl] A text from one such blood chit translates as follows:
 
 "I am an American airman.
My plane is destroyed.
I cannot speak your language.
I am an enemy of the Japanese.
Please give me food
and take me to the nearest Allied military post.
You will be rewarded."

When the USA officially joined the war in 1941, flight crew survival kits included blood chits printed in 50 different languages that sported a US flag and promised a reward for a safe return of a pilot. The kit might also include gifts like gold coins, maps or sewing needles. Many US flight crews that flew over Asia had their "blood chit" sewn to the back of their flight jackets. Some units added the blood chit to the crew's flight suits while other units gave the blood chit out only for specific flights.

==Britain's armed forces==

Examples of blood chits issued to British RAF personnel in India in the 1940s are printed on thin sheets of silk cloth measuring 20 by 11½ inches (about 50 x 30 cm);  they have the Union flag printed at the top left, and the following text in English and French alongside it:
The main area of the document is printed in three columns with the same text in 15 Asian languages, including Malay, Burmese, Tamil, Thai and Bengali.
