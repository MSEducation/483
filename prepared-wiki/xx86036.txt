He was a writer for the Huntley Brinkley Report. He opened the first news bureau for NBC News during the Vietnam War.   Horowitz was then offered a chance to develop a consumer-awareness segment for NBC's Los Angeles newscast, but nearly turned it down because they had offered it to six other people before him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-19/entertainment/8701130664_1_coupons-grocery-david-horowitz|title=Life is One Long Mass of Fine Print for Consumer Advocate Horowitz|publisher=Chicago Tribune|author=Benet, Lorenzo|date=1987-02-19|accessdate=2012-02-28[/tpl]

==Appearances==

Horowitz made a guest appearance on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! in 1989.  He also appeared as himself on an episode of Silver Spoons, ALF, the Golden Girls, The Munsters Today, and Saved by the Bell. Horowitz was also a regular guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (which also occasionally parodied him as "David Howitzer").

==Hostage situation==

On August 19, 1987, during KNBC's 4 p.m. newscast, a gun-wielding mental patient identifying himself as "Gary" got into the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, as a guest of an employee on the set and took Horowitz hostage live on the air. With the gun pressed on his side, Horowitz calmly read the gunman's statements on camera; unbeknownst to the gunman, the news feed had been taken off the air. The unidentified man revealed at the end of his statement that the gun was an empty BB gun, and set the gun down on the newsdesk, at which point anchorman John Beard quickly confiscated it. It led Horowitz to start a successful campaign to help ban "look-alike" toy guns in several states, including California and New York.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Controversies==

In 1998, Horowitz joined a political campaign to urge voters to defeat a California ballot initiative calling for a 20% cut in electricity rates for private utility customers and ending surcharges on ratepayers to pay for nuclear power plants.  Horowitz later admitted he was paid $106,000 by the campaign.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/28/entertainment/ca-36715|title=The High Price of Advocacy|date=1998-10-28|accessdate=2012-02-28|publisher=latimes.com|author=Rosenberg, Howard[/tpl]  Horowitz approached the organizers of the campaign and asked to be a part of it.
