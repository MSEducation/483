In 2010, globally, approximately 281,500 people died of leukemia.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|first2=M|first3=K|first4=S|first5=K|first6=V|first7=J|first8=T|first9=R|first10=SY|first11=M|first12=HR|first13=LM|first14=KG|first15=C|first16=LM|first17=S|first18=DH|first19=ML|first20=EJ|first21=D|first22=K|first23=B|first24=A|first25=G|first26=F|first27=I|first28=S|first29=C|first30=M|displayauthors=30[/tpl] In 2000, approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world developed a form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. This represents about 3% of the almost seven million deaths due to cancer that year, and about 0.35% of all deaths from any cause. Of the sixteen separate sites the body compared, leukemia was the 12th most common class of neoplastic disease, and the 11th most common cause of cancer-related death.
About 245,000 people in the United States are affected with some form of leukemia, including those that have achieved remission or cure. Approximately 44,270 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in the year of 2008 in the US."Leukemia Facts & Statistics." The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Retrieved 2009-07-02. This represents 2.9% of all cancers (excluding simple basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers) in the United States, and 30.4% of all blood cancers.
Among children with some form of cancer, about a third have a type of leukemia, most commonly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A type of leukemia is the second most common form of cancer in infants (under the age of 12 months) and the most common form of cancer in older children.James G. Gurney, Malcolm A. Smith, Julie A. Ross (1999) Cancer Incidence and Survival among Children and Adolescents, United States SEER program 1975–1995, chapter on Leukemia Cancer Statistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, available online from the SEER web site  Boys are somewhat more likely to develop leukemia than girls, and white American children are almost twice as likely to develop leukemia than black American children.  Only about 3% cancer diagnoses among adults are for leukemias, but because cancer is much more common among adults, more than 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults.
Race is a risk factor.  Hispanics, especially those under the age of 20, are at the highest risk for leukemia, while whites, Native Americans, Asians, and Alaska Natives are at higher risk than blacks.Childhood Blood Cancers | The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society
Sex is also a risk factor.  More men than women are diagnosed with leukemia and die from the disease. Around 30 percent more men than women have leukemia.[ref]

==History==

Leukemia was first observed by pathologist Rudolf Virchow in 1845.  Observing an abnormally large number of white blood cells in a blood sample from a patient, Virchow called the condition Leukämie in German, which he formed from the two Greek words leukos (λευκός), meaning "white", and aima (αίμα), meaning "blood".  Around ten years after Virchow's findings, pathologist Franz Ernst Christian Neumann found that one deceased leukemia patient's bone marrow was colored "dirty green-yellow" as opposed to the normal red.  This finding allowed Neumann to conclude that a bone marrow problem was responsible for the abnormal blood of leukemia patients.
By 1900 leukemia was viewed as a family of diseases as opposed to a single disease.  By 1947 Boston pathologist Sidney Farber believed from past experiments that aminopterin, a folic acid mimic, could potentially cure leukemia in children.  The majority of the children with ALL who were tested showed signs of improvement in their bone marrow, but none of them were actually cured.  This, however, led to further experiments.
In 1962, researchers Emil J. Freireich Jr. and Emil Frei III used combination chemotherapy to attempt to cure leukemia.  The tests were successful with some patients surviving long after the tests.[tpl]cite web|last=Patlak|first=Margie|title=Targeting Leukemia: From Bench to Bedside|url=http://opa1.faseb.org/pdf/leukemia.pdf|work=Breakthroughs in Bioscience|publisher=The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology|accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl]

==Society and culture==

Leukemias are often romanticized in 20th century fiction. It is portrayed as a joy-ending, clean disease whose fair, innocent and gentle victims die young or at the wrong time.  As such, it is the cultural successor to tuberculosis, which held this cultural position until tuberculosis was discovered to be an infectious disease.  The 1970 romance novel Love Story is an example of this romanticization of leukemia.

==Research directions==

Significant research into the causes, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of leukemia is being performed. Hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time.Search of: leukemia – List Results – ClinicalTrials.gov Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.
In general, there are two types of leukemia research: clinical or translational research and basic research. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patient-applicable way, such as testing a new drug in patients.  By contrast, basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause leukemic changes in isolated cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside leukemia cells as the disease progresses.  The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to patients with the disease.[tpl]cite web|first=The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society|title=Understanding Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers|url=http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1162487596.pdf|publisher=Leukemia and Lymphoma Society|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl]
Treatment through gene therapy is currently being pursued.  One such approach used genetically modified T cells to attack cancer cells. In 2011, a year after treatment, two of the three patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be cancer-free[tpl]cite web|last=Jaslow|first=Ryan|title=New Leukemia Therapy Destroys Cancer by Turning Blood Cells into "Assassins"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-leukemia-therapy-destroys-cancer-by-turning-blood-cells-into-assassins/|publisher=CBSnews.com HealthPop section|accessdate=11 August 2011[/tpl] and in 2013, three of five subjects who had acute lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be in remission for five months to two years.Coghlan, Andy (26 March 2013) Gene therapy cures leukaemia in eight days The New Scientist, Retrieved 15 April 2013 Identifying stem cells that cause different types of leukaemia is also being researched.[tpl]cite web|first=Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research|title=How we're beating leukaemia|url=http://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/research/how-were-beating-blood-cancers/how-were-beating-leukaemia|accessdate=24 September 2013[/tpl]

==Pregnancy==

Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women.  How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia.  Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias.  Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester.  Chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones.  Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which are rare in pregnant women, can often be postponed until after the end of the pregnancy.
