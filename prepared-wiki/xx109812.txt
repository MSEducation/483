Michigan Jake was a barbershop quartet that formed in 1995. The quartet borrowed the name from Michigan J. Frog,  the singing frog in the 1955 Merrie Melodies short One Froggy Evening.
The original line-up comprised the section leaders of the Louisville Times chorus of Louisville, Kentucky. After a few changes in the line-up, Michigan Jake won the 2001 International Quartet Contest in Nashville. They announced their retirement on July 1, 2004.
