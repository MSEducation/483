[[Composite bow]]

CATEGORIES: Bows (archery)

A composite bow is a traditional bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, cf., laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the back of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made similar to that of all-wood "self" bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, a composite bow requires more different materials than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.
Composite bows have been known from archaeology and art since the second millennium BCE, but their history is not well recorded as they were developed by cultures without a written tradition. They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities, classically for mounted archery although they can also be used on foot. Such bows spread among the military (and hunters) of civilizations that came into contact with nomad tribes; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa, and southwards in the Arabian peninsula and in India.
The details of manufacture varied between the various cultures that used them. Initially the tips of the limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, siyahs, made as an integral part of the wooden core of the bow.
Like other bows, they lost importance with the introduction and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made of fiberglass.

==Construction and materials==

The wooden core gives the bow its shape and dimensional stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, and the use of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections. The wood of the bending part of the limb ("dustar") must endure intense shearing stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.ottoman-turkish-bows.com/ |title=Ottoman Turkish bows, manufacture & design. |first=Adam |last=Karpowicz. |isbn=978-0-9811372-0-9[/tpl] Bamboo, and wood of the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.[ref]* (1992) The Traditional Bowyers Bible Volume 1.

A thin layer of horn is glued onto what will be the belly of the bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle.A BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF HUNGARIAN ARCHERY, PART I. Chris Szabó Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon delaminate with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.
The sinew, soaked in animal glue, is then laid in layers on the back of the bow; the strands of sinew are oriented along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.
Hide glue or gelatin made from fish gas bladders is used to attach layers of sinew to the back of the bow, and to attach the horn belly to the wooden core.
Stiffening laths, if used, are attached. Both horn and laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying the bow is ready for use. Further finishing may include thin leather or waterproof bark, to protect the bow from moisture, and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and gold leaf.
Strings and arrows are essential parts of the weapon system, but no type of either is specifically associated with composite bows throughout their history.

==Advantages and disadvantages of composite construction==

===Advantages===

The main advantage of composite bows over self bows (made from a single piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight in the early stages of the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.
For most practical non-mounted archery purposes, composite construction offers no advantage; "the initial velocity is about the same for all types of bow... within certain limits, the design parameters... appear to be less important than is often claimed." However, they are superior for horsemen and in the specialized art of flight archery: "A combination of many technical factors made the composite flight bow better for flight shooting."[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/users/kooi/kobe97.pdf |title=An Approach to the Study of Ancient Archery using Mathematical Modelling. |first1=B.W. |last1=Kooi |first2=C.A. |last2=Bergman |journal=Antiquity |volume=71:(271) |pages=124–134 |year=1997[/tpl] The higher arrow velocity is only for well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight. At the weights more usual for modern amateurs, the greater density of horn and sinew compared to wood usually cancels any advantage.

===Disadvantages===

Constructing composite bows requires much more time and a greater variety of materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions and be quickly ruined by submersion. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.
Medieval Europeans favoured self bows as hand bows, but they made composite prods for crossbows. The prods were usually well protected from rain and humidity which are prevalent in much of Europe.

==Origins and use==

===By charioteers===

Bows of any kind seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian laminated bows.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/ct07yrml6fcbanuj |first=Ragnar |last=Insulander |title=The Two-Wood Bow |journal=Acta Borealia |year=2002 |volume=19 |pages=49–73 |archiveurl=http://www.freebirdarchery.com/images/twowoodbow.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008[/tpl] However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records of any kind are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta-Petrovka culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta-Petrovka culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan,Archaeology, March/April 1995, 39. As quoted by Central Asia Images, http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/millwarj/website%20images/centralasiaimages.htm and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration.
Composite bows were soon adopted and adapted by civilizations who came into contact with nomads, such as the Chinese, Assyrian, and Egyptian. Several composite bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE.Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation. (The notes were made in the 1920s and describe composite bows as "compound"; the modern compound bow did not exist at this time.) http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/135z.html Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE).Shang Civilization. Kwang-Chih Chang.ISBN 0-300-02885-7 By the 4th century BCE, chariotry had ceased to have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).

===By mounted archers===

The mounted archer became the archetypal warrior of the steppes and the composite bow was his archetypal weapon, used to protect the herds, in steppe warfare, and in incursions (notably those of the Huns, Magyars, Mongols, and Turks) into settled lands. Classic tactics for horse-mounted archers included skirmishing; they would approach, shoot, and retreat before any effective response could be made.Maurice's Strategikon: Handbook of Byzantine Military Strategy. George T. Dennis (Translator) ISBN 978-0-8122-1772-8 The term Parthian shot refers to the widespread horse-archer tactic of shooting backwards over the rear of their horses as they retreated. Parthians inflicted heavy defeats on Romans, the first being the Battle of Carrhae. However, horse archers did not make an army invincible; Han General Ban Chao led  successful military expeditions in the late 1st century CE that conquered as far as central Asia, and both Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great defeated horse archer armies. Well-led Roman armies defeated Parthian armies on several occasions and twice took the Parthian capital.

===By infantry===

The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. The Battle of Lepanto (1571) was the last major use of composite archery by the Ottoman Empire.

==Technical changes to classical times==

The details of bow construction changed somewhat with time. It is not clear that the various developments of the composite bow led to measurable improvements: "the development of archery equipment may not be a process involving progressive improvements in performance. Rather, each design type represents one solution to the problem of creating a mobile weapon system capable of hurling lightweight projectiles."

===Scythian bows, bending tips===

Variants of the Scythian bow were the dominant form in Asia until approximately the first century BCE. These were short weapons - one was 119 cm long when strung, with arrows perhaps 50–60 cm long - with flexible, "working" tips; the wooden core was continuous from the centre to the tip.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atarn.org/chinese/scythian_bows.htm |title=Scythian-style bows discovered in Xinjiang: From the photographs and drawings of Stephen Selby |first=Bede |last=Dwyer |date=19 March 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl]

===Siyahs/kasans, stiff tips===

From about the 4th century BCE, the use of stiffened ends on composite bows became widespread. The stiffened end of the bow is a "siyah" (Arabic),In Arabic سِئَة siʾaẗ, سِیَة siyaẗ (pl. سِیَات siyāt), سَأَة saʾaẗ (or سَاءَة sāʾaẗ), سُؤَة suʾaẗ "szarv" (Hungarian), "sarvi" (Finnish; both 'sarvi' and 'szarv' mean 'horn') or "kasan" (Turkish); the bending section is a "dustar" (Arabic), "lapa" (Finnish) or "sal" (Turkish). For centuries, the stiffening was accomplished by attaching laths of bone or antler to the sides of the bow at its ends. The bone or antler strips are more likely to survive burial than the rest of the bow. The first bone strips suitable for this purpose come from "graves of the fourth or third centuries" BCE.[ref]
