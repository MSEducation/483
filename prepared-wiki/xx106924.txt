KWEX-DT, channel 41, is the local Univision owned and operated station in San Antonio, Texas.  It has studios located in the Southtown District of Downtown San Antonio, and its transmitter is based outside Elmendorf, Texas.
The station is the first commercially based Spanish-language television station in the United States, and considered the founding station of the entire Univision network.

==History==

KWEX-TV began as KCOR-TV in 1955, named after its radio sister station, which itself was named for Raoul CORtez, the owner and pioneer of the first full-time Spanish-language radio and television stations in the United States by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). KWEX-TV was also the first UHF channel in south Texas.
In 1961, after years of losing money with KCOR-TV, Cortez sold the station to Emilio Nicolas (his son-in-law), Renold Anselmo, Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, Julian Kaufman, and Frank Fouce. Since the station's beginnings, Nicolas had worked side by side with Cortez, not only running the station, but producing many of its variety shows. Nicolas made the station a financial success and in 1962 Nicolas and his partners built their second station in Los Angeles, KMEX-TV channel 34. Thus the first Spanish-language television network began to form.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===

KWEX-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to its former analog-era UHF channel 41.

At the time, KWEX broadcast solely in 480i, so both KENS and KWEX broadcast over digital channel 39 without any issues between the two stations.
