The Buckingham House and Industrial School Complex is a historic trade school complex located near Buckeystown, Frederick County, Maryland. It consists of thirteen buildings associated with a trade school that operated from the 1870s to 1944. The complex centers on a 3-story dormitory building built for the school, but also includes the late 18th-century Federal style Buckingham House. The surrounding farm was, uniquely for the area, irrigated.  Bordering the Monocacy River, the grounds include several significant late Woodland period archeological sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=683&COUNTY=Frederick&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Frederick|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Frederick County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust[/tpl]
