[[Antedating]]

CATEGORIES: Etymology, English language

In lexicography, antedating means finding earlier citations of a particular term than those already known.James Gleick: Cyber-Neologoliferation. The Oxford English Dictionary meets Cyberspace, New York Times Magazine, 5 November 2006
Historical dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary provide citations meant to show the evolution of every word, beginning with the earliest known usage. Antedating is a key task in lexicography and a popular sport. By indicating limitations of dictionaries they raise important questions of the consistency of editorial policies and the exhaustiveness and accuracy of dictionary material. The issue has thus been addressed in several major studies as well as in hundreds of papers tracing individual words, some of which are by-products of historical or linguistic research.Miros≈Çawa Podhajecka: Antedating headwords in the third edition of the OED: Findings and problems
