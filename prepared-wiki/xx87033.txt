Anna Kathryn Holbrook (born April 18, 1956 in Fairbanks, Alaska) is an American soap opera actress, best known for her role as Sharlene Frame Hudson on Another World, a role she played originally from 1988 to 1991. She returned from 1993 to 1997 and again in 1999.
An interesting fact about the circumstances of Holbrook's hiring is that she was picked not only for her dramatic aptitude, but also for her ability to look much older than she was; the character of Sharlene was a plain farm girl and Holbrook proved she could act in the appropriate manner.

The first actress to play her daughter on the show, Alexandra Wilson, was only twelve years younger than Holbrook herself. Alexandra Wilson was replaced by Amy Carlson in 1993.
She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress award for her role as Sharlene in 1996.
