Le Théâtre du Soleil (lit. "The Theater of the Sun") is a Parisian avant-garde stage ensemble founded by Ariane Mnouchkine, Philippe Léotard and fellow students of the L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in 1964 as a collective of theatre artists. Le Théâtre du Soleil is located at La Cartoucherie, a former munitions factory in the Vincennes area of eastern Paris. The company creates new theatrical works using a devising process based on utilizing physical theatre and improvisation.

==Sociohistorical context==

The Theatre du Soleil was founded as a theatre collective in 1964, in the midst of cultural turmoil that was sweeping the western world.[tpl]cite news|title=Egalité! Liberté! Sexualité!: Paris, May 1968|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/egalit-libert-sexualit-paris-may-1968-784703.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=23 February 2008|location=London[/tpl] With the capitalist west and the Communist east locked in the midst of the Cold War, nuclear warfare was imminent while the whole of Europe was slowly recovering from the destruction of World War II. In 1965 Charles de Gaulle was re-elected President of France in the first election with universal suffrage. 1968, a watershed year for protests and turmoil around the world, was characterized by rebellion against conventional culture, huge political demonstrations, and labor strikes in France involving 11 million workers, students, and far-left politicians. It was in the middle of this period of uncertainty, changing cultural attitudes, and disillusionment that Mnouchkine, a student in Paris, started Le Theatre du Soleil with her peers who were interested in creating original theatre.

==Mission and philosophy==

The Theatre du Soleil was founded in the 1960s as a reaction against traditional theatrical institutions in France.[tpl]cite web|last=Bablet|first=Marie-Louise|title=Vers un theatre autre|url=http://www.theatre-du-soleil.fr/thsol/a-propos-du-theatre-du-soleil,1/l-historique/vers-un-theatre-autre?lang=fr|publisher=Le Theatre du Soleil|accessdate=13 April 2011|coauthors=Denis Bablet[/tpl] Although they have never presented a formalized mission statement, from their inception they have been characterized by a commitment to long-term collaborative rehearsal processes; the merging of a wide variety of art forms both Western and non-Western, including music, dance, and puppetry; actively communicating and mingling with their audiences; and maintaining a large, hierarchy-free company that lives together and equally shares the work of creating their productions. Company members describe working for the Theatre du Soleil as "a style of life",[tpl]cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Troupe's communal vision includes lunch|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/theater/06mnouchkine.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 April 2011|date=6 July 2009[/tpl] while a reviewer for The New York Times said of their production Les Ephemeres: "The aim here is not to shape life into taut dramatic form but to present lived experience intimately and without evidence of artists' interpretation and manipulation." Mnouchkine summarized the philosophy of the organization as "Theatre du Soleil is the dream of living, working, being happy and searching for beauty and for goodness….It's trying to live for higher purposes, not for richness. It's very simple, really."[tpl]cite web|last=Rockwell|first=John|title=Behind the masks of a moralist|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=13&hid=123&sid=8c10cbac-f897-419f-9ad3-fd5c9870a38d%40sessionmgr111&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=30166921|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=August 27, 1992[/tpl] 
The company's productions have included both re-imaginings of classics of Western theatre such as Shakespeare's Richard II and Moliere's Tartuffe,[tpl]cite web|title=A touch of Soleil|url=https://libris.catawba.edu:2443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=3122502&site=ehost-live|publisher=Economist|accessdate=14 April 2011|date=2000-05-20[/tpl] but the company is equally well-known for their original works. The collective, consisting of 70 members as of July 2009, takes the concept and direction for their original productions from founder Ariane Mnouchkine, and works together in a collaborative rehearsal process that stretches out over many months to create a finished performance event. For example, their six-hour-long 2005 production Le Dernier Caravansérail (Odyssées) was based on a compilation of letters and interviews collected by Mnouchkine and her colleagues from refugee camps from around the world, while Les Ephemeres in 2009 was based on nine months of improvisations stemming from Mnouchkine's question: What would you do if you found out that all of humanity would die out within three months?
At other times, they provocatively, directly comment on contemporary events, such as their production of Tartuffe in which the title character was presented as an Islamic zealot at a time when there was a movement in France against foreign immigration.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jennison|first=Mark|title=Le Tartuffe by Moliere|journal=Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism|date=October 25, 1995|year=1996|month=Fall|pages=119–124|url=https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/download/1951/1914|accessdate=16 April 2011[/tpl] They have drawn inspiration from non-Western cultures, such as when they used bunraku-style puppetry in their production Tambours sur la Digue.[tpl]cite web|title=Theatre du Soleil Tambour|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5RXsjTU34M|publisher=artlabchicago|accessdate=12 April 2011[/tpl] The company's emphasis on movement and physical theatre is in part due to Mnouchkine's study under Jacques Lecoq.[tpl]cite book|last=Murray|first=Simon David|title=Physical theatres: a critical introduction|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=96|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aR7TJC5HXAAC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=mnouchkine+influence+lecoq&source=bl&ots=s6Tf7Ms4dt&sig=9hrbcRw4AePpdmFU0gyrxMegMyk&hl=en&ei=HKW4TZaNFNC4twep9ajeBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mnouchkine%20influence%20lecoq&f=false|coauthors=John Keefe|accessdate=17 April 2011|chapter=Contemporary Practices[/tpl] Their performances also frequently feature direct contact between the actors and the audience members, whether through a dressing and makeup area that is open to the public's view[tpl]cite web|last=Richardson|first=Helen E.|title=Book Review - Collaborative Theater: The Theatre du Soleil Sourcebook|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v052/52.2richardson.html|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|accessdate=14 April 2011|year=2000[/tpl] or lunch for both actors and audience served at intermission.[tpl]cite web|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Troupe's communal vision includes lunch|url=http://www.nytimes. com/2009/07/06/theater/06mnouchkine.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 April 2011[/tpl] 
Beyond their production process, part of the company's philosophy includes communal living and a complete lack of hierarchy for every member of the organization. All employees, whether actors, administrators, or technicians, are paid the exact same wage, and must sometimes go without a salary for months when the company is not performing and earning income. The company lives together in shared housing and equally shares the work of cooking, cleaning, and otherwise maintaining their living space. In addition, all performers do technical work on productions, such as maintaining moving set pieces for Les Ephemeres.

==Major works==

The Theatre du Soleil's premiere performance was in 1964–65 with Les Petits Bourgeois. The company's first widely recognized production was in 1967 with Wesker's The Kitchen. They continued on to form a theatre collective and produce their first major success 1789, a show about the French Revolution. Their performance suggested "the Revolution was subverted by those more concerned about property than justice".[tpl]cite book|last=Brockett|first=Oscar G.|title=History of the Theatre, Foundation Edition|year=2007|publisher=Allyn & Bacon|pages=505[/tpl] Another of the company's most famous works was Les Atrides. This was made up of Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis and Aeschylus' The Oresteia. The production took over two years to mount, played in numerous countries including the United States and Germany, and integrated several forms of Asian dance and drama. In 2005, Le Theatre du Soleil presented Le Dernier Caravanserail (Odyssees) or The Last Caravansary (Odysseys). 
One of the company's most recent major works was their production of Les Ephemeres created and directed by Ariane Mnouchkine. The show premiered at the 2009 Lincoln Center Festival. Les Ephemeres is centered around the river of time with its events both past and present. The Village Voice characterized the show's theme as "To go with the flow, to accept the fact that time is the great devastator. Tout passe, tout casse, tout basse, says a French proverb: Everything passes, everything breaks, everything sinks."[tpl]cite web|last=Feingold|first=Michael|title=Les Éphémères Goes with Reality's Flow; Ivanov Twists Chekhov into Postmodern Shapes|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-07-15/theater/les-eacute-ph-eacute-m-egrave-res-goes-with-reality-s-flow-ivanov-twists-chekhov-into-postmodern-shapes/|publisher=The Village Voice|accessdate=15 April 2011[/tpl] The performance is split in two three-and-a-half-hour-long sections with the full run time just over seven hours long.

==Major players==

While Ariane Mnouchkine, acknowledged as the founder of the troupe, regularly acts as the company's concept creator and director, a number of her fellow students were also her collaborators in the initial founding of the company, including: 
Senior members such as Mnouchkine are not given preferential treatment. Mnouchkine, for example, refused to be interviewed alone for a New York Times article, although individuals such as Helene Cixous (playwright) and Jean-Jacques Lemetre (composer and musician) repeatedly fulfill specific production roles and have done so for many years.[tpl]cite web|title=Le Theatre du Soleil: L'ecriture|url=http://www.theatre-du-soleil.fr/thsol/a-propos-du-theatre-du-soleil,1/l-ecriture/|publisher=Le Theatre Du Soleil|accessdate=20 April 2011[/tpl]
