Cates attended the Professional Children's School and the Juilliard School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800041437/bio |title=Yahoo movies |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-07[/tpl] When she was ten, she wanted to become a dancer. She eventually got a scholarship to the School of American Ballet, but after suffering a serious knee injury at age 15, she gave up her dancing career.Cohen, D. & S. Young and Famous: Hollywood's Newest Superstars, 1987. p.75. ISBN 0-671-63493-3 She next began a career as a professional model, which was short-lived, although successful. Cates, however, did not like the industry: "It was just the same thing, over and over. After a while I did it solely for the money."

==Acting career==

After ending her modeling career, Cates decided to begin acting. Although her father was an actor as well, he was not enthusiastic about his daughter's  new acting career. Cates's acting debut was in Paradise (filmed 22 March 1981 - 6 May 1981 and released May 1982http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084469/business?ref_=tt_dt_bus), a role she won after replying to a casting call in New York.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084469/business At age 17 she played the role of Sarah and did several full nude scenes in the movie, which had a plot very similar to The Blue Lagoon. In a 1982 interview, she recalled having trouble with the change of career, because as a model she had to be conscious of the camera, whereas in front of the movie camera, she could not. Cates later regretted being in the movie and said: "What I learned was never to do a movie like that again." According to her co-star Willie Aames, "she will have nothing to do with the film. She's really upset about it. She won't do any promotion with me.""Hollywood: Nude scenes too much for Aames" by Marilyn Beck, The Orange County Register, March 17, 1982. p. C3
Later in 1982, Cates starred in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which features "the most memorable bikini-drop in cinema history".[tpl]cite news |author=Rolling Stone staff |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12625824/escape_your_family_sneak_upstairs/print |title=Escape Your Family: Sneak Upstairs! |work=Rolling Stone |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090915180542/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/12625824/escape_your_family_sneak_upstairs/print |archivedate=September 15, 2009[/tpl] She was quoted as saying that she had the most fun in filming that movie. The following year, she was in the sex comedy Private School (which co-starred Matthew Modine and Betsy Russell), for which she sang on two songs of the film's soundtrack.
Her later film roles were more modest and largely oriented toward younger audiences, such as the two Gremlins films and the 1991 film Drop Dead Fred. Her face graced the covers of teen magazines such as Seventeen, Tiger Beat,  Teen Beat, and others. In 1984, she starred in the TV mini-series Lace. She played the role of Lili "to get away from a sameness in her movie portrayals"."'Lace' miniseries is soap-opera tangle" by Associated Press, Star-News, February 24, 1984. p. 5C During her audition, she so impressed the writer, that he wanted to hire her there and then. Cates struggled with the portrayal of a bitter movie star because, despite her character's vicious persona, she intended for the audience to sympathize with her."Angela Lansbury leads 'Lace' cast" by Julianne Hastings, Stars and Stripes, March 7, 1984. p. 12. She did not read the novel on which the movie was based because she did not want to have a "fixed image". Her line in the film, "Which one of you bitches is my mother?", was named the greatest line in television history by TV Guide in 1993.TV Guide  April 17-23, 1993. pg. 96 
In 1985, Cates appeared Off-Broadway in Rich Relations, written by David Henry Hwang of the Second Stage Theatre.[tpl]cite news|last=Rich |first=Frank |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/theater/stage-rich-relations-from-david-hwang.html?&pagewanted=all |title=New York Times-Stage: 'Rich Relations' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1986-04-22 |accessdate=2010-03-07[/tpl] In 1994, she starred in the romantic comedy Princess Caraboo.
