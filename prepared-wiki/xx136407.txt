==Arts Curriculum==

Four disciplines of art are hosted at Mayfield: Drama, Dance, Music, and Visual Arts. Each has its own night to showcase the talents of the students at a junior (grades 9 and 10) and senior (grades 11 and 12) level. Mayfield's drama program is one of the finest in the Peel District.  They put on a spectacular fall musical and spring play every year.  Their improv team also competes in various National competitions.  Mayfield has an impressive music program that offers many unique ways for students to strive for their maximum potential. Jazz, Classical, and Alternative music styles are offered, and students grow close bonds with other students through their extra-curricular activities. Mayfield's music program has won many awards, and is regularly invited to Musicfest National's for several of its performance ensembles.

==Dance Program==

The dance program is one of the disciplines offered at Mayfield Secondary School as part of the Regional Arts Program. Students audition for the Dance Program in Grade Eight and approximately 50 - 60 students are accepted per year. The students then embark on a four year journey of learning about dance as part of their high school curriculum. The program includes a theoretical and practical component. Theory includes leaning about dance history, culture, important figures in the dance world, the dance industry and different styles of dance among other topics. The practical component focuses on two primary styles which are classical ballet and modern dance. However, to ensure students are exposed to other styles of dance, the program brings in experienced instructors to hold workshops a few times per semester. In this way, students are able to learn important dance technique while experiencing other styles of dance such as jazz, hip hop, ballroom styles, and many other styles of dance from around the world. Every year, the department prepares a winter dance production. Each year explores a different winter related theme but every other year, the department performs The Nutcracker. In 2011, the department performed a show called Winter Miracles which explored the idea of miracles. The department also prepares a spring show in May and themes for this show can vary greatly. Although during the winter show students are able to show off their dancing talent, during the May show, students are able to choreograph their own pieces and audition them into the show. Therefore the show includes teacher and student choreography. Furthermore, the May show is largely organized by the Grade 12 students as their final leadership project. Each student is assigned a role to ensure the success of the show. Some roles include Student Producer, Stage Manager, Runners, Decorations Crew, Photography Crew, and more. Overall, the Dance Program provides students with an incredible opportunity to enjoy the arts while pursuing their studies.
