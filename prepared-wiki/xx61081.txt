[[Outliner]]

CATEGORIES: Notetaking software, Outliners, Project management software, Text editor features

An outliner is a computer program that allows text to be organized into discrete sections that are related in a tree structure or hierarchy. Text may be collapsed into a node, or expanded and edited.
Outliners are typically used for computer programming, collecting or organizing ideas, as personal information management or for project management. Mind mappers and wikis are related types of software.

==Design==

The principal attribute of outline editors is that they support or enforce the use of a hierarchy of their items. 

==Layout==

There are two basic types of outliners: one-pane or intrinsic, and two-pane or extrinsic, each with its strengths and weaknesses. 
A one-pane outliner is known as an intrinsic outliner because the text itself is organized into an outline format—individual sections (such as paragraphs) of text can be collapsed or expanded, while keeping others in view. Everything is displayed within a single area, hence the term one pane.  One of the strengths of one-pane outliners is that, because the text itself is what is structured and because several nodes of text are visible at once, it is easy to edit across sections. The drawback is that, because the structure is not always visible, there is not as strong an overview of the whole or ability to quickly navigate between sections as with a two-pane outliner. Some word processors, such as Microsoft Word, have an Outline Mode to help with structuring documents.[tpl]cite web|author=Robert S.

A two-pane outliner separates structure from content—the structure is extrinsic to the text. A tree structure with node titles is presented in one pane, and the text is shown in another. Since the structure is always clearly shown at all times separately from content, this format allows for a quick overview of the structure, and easy navigation. The drawback is that since only one node's worth of text is shown at one time and navigation has the additional step of crossing panes, the structure is more rigid, making editing across nodes more difficult. This view is similar to many file browsers and email programs (which can be thought of as three-pane outliners).[tpl]cite web|url=http://john.redmood.com/organizers.html |title=Overview of Windows Outliners |publisher=John.redmood.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-18[/tpl]  This type of structure is useful also as a document management tool where the second pane is a document in place of textual information.
A one- and two-pane outliner may be combined as a hybrid.  This allows multiple notes' text and graphics to be shown at the same time.  The organizational power of outline in hybrid is in the parent outline structure, not in the second pane text, making it a very effective structure for topical organization.  One additional advantage of hybrid is that single pane can be used as single pane outliner with second pane used for notes or reference tracking.
A third approach to intrinsic outlines is the multi-column outliner. It is similar to the one-pane outliner in that the text itself is organized into an outline format. However, the text sections do not collapse or expand, and all sections are visible but held in a separate column (one for each level). This approach allows structure and content to be visible at the same time.

==File formats==

Several file formats support an outline structure natively or encourage the use/creation of outline structures.

==Desktop outliners==

==Mobile Device outliners==

==Browser-based outliners==

This table shows a list of browser-based outliners categorised by the functionality that they provide (see 'Design' above). Browser-based outliners run inside a desktop or mobile web browser (smart phone or tablet), and may synchronise the outline's data with a remote server, or store it locally on the user's device.
