[[Single-subject rule]]

CATEGORIES: Constitutional law

The single-subject rule is a rule in the constitutional law of some jurisdictions that stipulates that ballot initiatives and legislation may deal with only one main issue.

==United States==

The single subject rule is provided for by many state constitutions in the United States of America.  Its purpose is to avoid complexity in laws, to avoid any hidden consequences that legislators or voters may miss when reading the proposed law.  This in turn prevents politicians from sneaking unpopular legislation through, piggybacked on legislation which is more likely to pass.  
For example, the constitution of Minnesota, Article IV, Section 17, requires that "No law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.". Conversely, neither the U.S. Congress nor the U.S. Constitution has such a rule so riders which are completely unrelated to the main bill are commonplace. These amendments are often put into bills at the last minute, so that any representative who may read the legislation before actually voting on it will not have a chance to catch it.
It has been charged that single-subject rules have been misused as a political or judicial measure to slow or nullify ballots or laws.  An example of accusation of misuse of this law occurred in Colorado when a former governor made statement against a single-subject ruling.

===Case law===

==Switzerland==

In Swiss law, the "principle of the unity of the subject matter" ([tpl]lang-de|Grundsatz der Einheit der Materie[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|principe de l'unité de la matière[/tpl]) applies to ballot initiatives and to parliamentary legislation that is subject to a referendum. It has been derived by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court from the provision in article 34, section 2 of the Swiss Federal Constitution which guarantees "the freedom of the citizen to form an opinion and to give genuine expression to his or her will" in the exercise of political rights. The Court has outlined the principle as follows:
