Anna Christina De Ozorio Nobre
http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/Teaching_and_Research/Staff_Profile_Page.php?staffId=44 She is known as Kia
(b. 1963, Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian neuroscientist working in the United Kingdom.
She is Tutorial Fellow in Experimental Psychology at New College, Oxford and Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Oxford, where she heads the Brain and Cognition Laboratory in the Department of Experimental Psychology. In collaboration with Professor Miles Hewstone, Nobre has set up the Oxford Social Neuroscience laboratory, which uses non-invasive imaging approaches to investigate how social factors affect experience and behaviour. She is also Adjunct Professor at Northwestern University in Chicago, USA and the Psychology and Neuroscience Delegate for Oxford University Press. She is married to the philosopher Luciano Floridi.

==Life and work==

Nobre was educated at the Escola Americana do Rio de Janeiro (EARJ) and Williams College. She received her M.Phil, MSc and PhD (1992) from Yale University for her research on intracranial as well as non-invasive electrophysiological studies of human cognition. During her postdoctoral research at Yale, and Harvard (1992-1994), she was involved in some of the first brain-imaging studies of cognitive functions in the human brain. Prior to her current appointment, she was McDonnell Pew Lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience and the Astor and Todd Bird Junior Research Fellow at New College (1994-1996). She currently serves on the advisory board of NeuroFocus, a Berkeley, California based neuromarketing company.http://www.neurofocus.com/company.htm

==Research==

Nobre uses multiple and complementary non-invasive brain-imaging methods (FMRI, ERP, EEG, TMS), combined with behavioural studies, in order to explore and understand the neural systems that support cognitive functions in the human brain. In particular, much of her work investigates 'attentional orienting': how the brain generates moment-to-moment predictions about events to unfold in order to optimise perception and action. Other topics in her research include the representation of time, how words and objects acquire meaning, and the influence of motivation over perception.
