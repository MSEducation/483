"Wildflowers" is a song written by Dolly Parton, which was included on Parton's 1987 album Trio with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt.  In the song, Parton talks about being restless and wanting to branch out, using wildflowers as a metaphor,  concluding that "wildflowers don't care where they grow".  The original recording featured an autoharp, acoustic guitar (played by Harris) and fiddle, and was arranged to sound like an old fashioned country waltz.  It was the fourth single released from the Trio album, and reached the U.S. country singles top ten in July 1988.
In 2008, the recording was played at a reception by the Texas State Democratic Party, honoring former First Lady Ladybird Johnson. Johnson's love of wild flowers was well known, and she had long championed the planting of them along the U.S. highways.
