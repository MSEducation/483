[[Crop]]

CATEGORIES: Crops

A crop is any cultivated plant, fungus, or alga that is harvested for food, clothing, livestock fodder, biofuel, medicine, or other uses. In contrast, animals that are raised by humans are called livestock, except those that are kept as pets. Microbes, such as bacteria or viruses, are referred to as cultures. Microbes are not typically grown for food, but are rather used to alter food. For example, bacteria are used to ferment milk to produce yogurt.
Major crops include sugarcane, pumpkin, maize (corn), wheat, rice, cassava, soybeans, hay, potatoes and cotton.[tpl]cite web|title=Maize, rice and wheat : area harvested, production quantity, yield|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567|author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Statistics Division|year=2009[/tpl]
Based on the growing season, the crops grown in India can be classified as Kharif crops and Rabi crops.
