==History==

Mount View High School was built on Thomas Mountain in the late 1970s and is still operational today. Mount View High School's population came from three other schools: Welch High, Gary High, and Northfork High. In 2002, McDowell County Schools (MCS) decided to move the seventh and eighth grade to Mount View. Afterwards, the school experienced major renovations including building a new wing for the seventh graders and building a new auditorium for all the students; the auditorium would be named after the first principal of the school as Bob N. Jack Auditorium. In 2005, MCS decided to move the sixth grade to Mount View. Lack of space for the six graders caused MVHS to take a section of the media center off to form a new wing for the sixth graders. Mount View High School also built a new gymnasium for middle school students. In 2007 former principal Adam E. Grygiel became the main principal of the entire school. Before the 2009–2010 school term began it was announced that Mount View Middle and Mount View High was going to merge to form one school. In 2009 current eighth grade science teacher Edward Evans became the National Science Teacher of the Year which brought new technology to the school.
