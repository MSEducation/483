EUCLID, also called Pôle Universitaire Euclide or Euclid University, is an international intergovernmental organization with a university charter established in 2008 and headquartered in The Gambia.

==History and legal status==

EUCLID’s origins are connected with the creation of a group of universities called “Euclid Consortium” by the University of Bangui and the University of N’Djamena in 2006. The project was administered by the International Organization for Sustainable Development, an international non-governmental organization headed by Syed Zahid Ali.[tpl]cite web |url= http://acuns.org/euclid-university/ |title= ACUNS Euclid University |work= Academic Council of the United Nations System |date= March 2014[/tpl]
Conceived as an international extension for the University of Bangui, EUCLID was redefined and constituted and a distinct institution in 2008 by an intergovernmental convention. The same year, the rector of the University of Bangui, Faustin-Archange Touadera was appointed as Prime Minister, and signed the convention formalising his country’s participation in EUCLID in 2010.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pmcar.org/euclide.asp |title= EUCLIDE et la République Centrafricaine |work= Permanent Mission of the Central African Republic |date= October 2012[/tpl]
In January 2008, Syed Zahid Ali, acting as Secretary-General of IOSD, presented to various governments a new legal framework called EUCLID Phase 2.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.iosd.org/news.asp |title= News for January 2008 |work= International Organization for Sustainable Development |date= January 2008[/tpl] Several governments interested in using the Euclid programs to train their own staff approved the statutes of the new international university in 2008 and 2009.[tpl]cite web |url= http://issuu.com/oic-journal/docs/journal_issue18_english |title= Intergovernmental body and ICCI partner fosters inter-religious dialogue and Islamic cooperation |work= Organization of Islamic Cooperation |date= August 2011[/tpl]
According the Ministry of Higher Education of The Gambia, “According to the normative practice of international law regarding intergovernmental universities, EUCLID was granted degree-granting authority under Article 1 with a clause of accreditation by the Ministries of Education”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euclid.int/documents/GambiaOfficialCircular.pdf |title= Official Circular |work= Ministry of Higher Education |date= 27 June 2013[/tpl]

===Headquarters===

In 2011, EUCLID signed a first headquarters agreement with the Central African Republic and obtained office space in the Prime Minister’s building and on the campus of the University of Bangui. Due to unrest in the country which began in December 2012, EUCLID relocated its headquarters to the Republic of The Gambia in 2013.[tpl]citation |url=http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/euclid-to-transfer-headquarters-to-gambia |title=EUCLID to transfer headquarters to Gambia |author=Amadou Jallow |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Gambia Daily Observer [/tpl]

==Accreditation and recognition==

===Headquarters State===

The National UNESCO Commission of Gambia has posted its “UNESCO Portal to Recognized Higher Education Institutions” documents which describe EUCLID as “recognized / accredited”.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.unesco.gm/content/unesco-portal-documents |title= UNESCO Portal Documents |author= The Gambia National Commission for UNESCO |date=June 2013 |publisher= The Gambia National Commission for UNESCO [/tpl]
The Ministry of Higher Education indicated in 2013 that it was “the proper accrediting body and oversight authority of higher education in The Gambia” and acknowledged “the charter, academic accreditation and legal recognition granted to EUCLID in the instrument of participation signed on July 15, 2012”. It also indicated that “EUCLID will also participate in any Quality Assurance Framework being implemented to ensure ongoing conformity with updated processes of academic accreditation.” In April 2014, EUCLID announced that it would transition to the new Gambia AQAA accreditation system  which will be introduced in the Gambia by the end of the year.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.euclid.int |title= EUCLID Home Page |author= EUCLID |date=April 2014 |publisher= euclid.int[/tpl][tpl]citation |url= http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/mohrst-validate-aqaa-legal-framework |title= MOHRST validate AQAA legal framework |author= Omar Wally |date=January 2014 |publisher= observer.gm[/tpl]

===UN / UNESCO / IAU status===

Historically, the UNESCO-based International Association of Universities (IAU) did not include the five “international universities” (i.e. EUCLID, the European University Institute, the IMO International Maritime Law Institute, the United Nations University and the World Maritime UniversityList of HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) - List of Universities of the World - by the International Association of Universities  in its World Higher Education Database. This issue was addressed by the United Nations in a December 2012 letter to the Permanent Representative of the Central African Republic stating that "both IAU/UNESCO and the UN Secretariat recognize Euclide- Pole Universitaire Euclide and the other four UN institutions ... as being accredited" in spite of not being included in WHED. The UN also indicated that these institutions which are “regional or global in nature” would be included under their headquarters states in future editions of the IAU WHED database.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euclid.int/documents/Reply%20from%20UN%20regarding%20WHED%20database.pdf|author=Martha Helena Lopez, United Nations, Director, Strategic Planning and Staffing Division |title=Reply to letter with reference 0218/RCA/MP/ONU-12 |date=December 10, 2012 |publisher=Permanent Mission of the Central African Republic to the United Nations official website [/tpl] Afterwards, IAU removed its “Regional/International”  group and began transferring these institutions under their headquarters state. Following its headquarters relocation in 2013, three governments formally notified the United Nations of the new listing[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.burundi-un.org/documentsposted/JointLetter-EUCLIDUniversity-UN2013.pdf |author=Permanent Delegation of Burundi to UNESCO |title=Joint Letter |date=September 2013 |publisher=Gambia National Commission for UNESCO[/tpl] and EUCLID was submitted for inclusion in the WHED in November 2013 by the Permanent Delegation of The Gambia to UNESCO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.gm/information/ |author=Permanent Delegation of The Gambia to UNESCO |title=Note Verbale |date=November 2013 |publisher=Gambia National Commission for UNESCO[/tpl]

===In Participating States and Africa===

The 2008 intergovernmental agreement states in its Article I that “EUCLID is chartered to confer diplomas, degrees and completion certificates accredited by the ministries of Education of the Participating Parties.”[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.euclid.int/documents/openmou.pdf |title= Open Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Participating EUCLID Parties regarding their Participation in the Educational Framework defined herein |work= EUCLID |date= March 2008[/tpl]
Gambia[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.euclid.int/documents/gambia.pdf |title= EUCLID Instrument of Participation and Approval Government of The Gambia|work= EUCLID |date= July 2012[/tpl] and Timor-Leste[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.euclid.int/documents/timorleste.pdf |title= EUCLID Instrument of Participation and Approval Government of Timor-Leste|work= EUCLID |date= May 2011[/tpl] indicate that the degrees issued by EUCLID upon completion of the required coursework will be legally valid for use in the country by the graduates.
According to the Permanent Mission of the Central African Republic to the United Nations, the UNESCO Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Certificates, Diplomas, Degrees and other Academic Qualifications in Higher Education in the African States applies to EUCLID with effect in the 22 ratifying States.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pmcar.org/euclide.asp |title= EUCLIDE ("Euclid University") et la RCA|work= Permanent Mission Central African Republic |date= July 2012[/tpl]UNESCO | Education - Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Certificates, Diplomas, Degrees and other Academic Qualifications in Higher Education
EUCLID is since June 2012 a member of the Association of African UniversitiesEUCLID (Pôle Universitaire Euclide / Euclid University) News and Events which requires its members to be accredited.http://www.aau.org/page/introduction

===United States===

EUCLID is not a US-based university and it not accredited by an organization recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or Council on Higher Education Accreditation.
The letters sent in 2012 by the governments of Burundi, Central African Republic and Comoros to the US State Department describe the institution as being “duly chartered to confer degrees by its Participating States and enjoys full academic accreditation according to its constitutive mandate under international law (Article I).”[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pmcar.org/docs/LettreJointe.pdf |format=PDF |title=Re: Transmission of Documents Regarding Euclide and Graduates |deadurl=no |accessdate=11 December 2012[/tpl]
The state of Maine formerly listed “Euclid University” as an unaccredited institution. Maine removed the school from its list after receiving correspondence from EUCLID.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euclid.int/documents/mainetosza.pdf |title=Copy of Official Email Communication, State of Maine|author=Wanda Monthey |date=July 28, 2010 |publisher=EUCLID University website[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/education/highered/Non-Accredited/ea-gu.htm |title=Maine DOE - Higher Education |publisher=Maine.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]
Michigan published until 2012 a list of non-CHEA accredited universities who graduates could not use their degree for public service employment, a list that included Euclid University (and the United Nations University). Following an exchange of letters with EUCLID, Michigan no longer maintains a list of unaccredited institutions, but advises that EUCLID graduates and all graduates from non-CHEA accredited universities applying for jobs with the State of Michigan must demonstrate that their degrees are equivalent to studies at a similar school accredited by a CHEA-recognized accrediting body.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euclid.int/documents/michigantosza.pdf |author=John Gnodtke, General Counsel of Michigan Civil Service Commission |title=Re: Transmission of Legal Document by email and fax |date=February 26, 2012 |publisher=EUCLID University website [/tpl]http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Non-accreditedSchools_78090_7.pdf
In December 2013, following a correspondence with EUCLID’s legal counsel and two ambassadors to the United States, Oregon's Attorney General’s office wrote that the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (ODA) had stopped maintaining and publishing its list of unrecognised universities. Regarding "Euclid University", the ODA had since 2008 posted a notice that “ODA is currently evaluating the present legal status of this entity.”http://www.oregonstudentaid.gov/oda-degree-authorization-academic-unauthorized-Invalid.aspx As of March 2014, the Texas listing indicates that Euclid University is still under review.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/index.cfm?objectid=EF4C3C3B-EB44-4381-6673F760B3946FBB |title=THECB - Institutions Whose Degrees are Illegal to Use in Texas |publisher=Thecb.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
EUCLID has posted the relevant correspondence regarding these processes on its “legal affairs” page.[tpl]cite web|author=EUCLID |url=http://www.euclid.int/legalaffairs.asp |title=EUCLID Legal Affairs and Enforcement |publisher=Euclid.int |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl]

===Accredibase criticism===

Verifile, a private UK-based company, published in December 2011 a reportAccredibase - Status of Euclid University criticizing the existence of intergovernmental universities in general as “procedurally unfortunate, academically risky and generative of a high potential for confusion and dispute” and of EUCLID in particular. The report also accused the International Association of Universities of having “erroneously listed Euclid as an international degree granter” when it included EUCLID in its list of “Regional/International” institutions in May 2011 because “none of the nations has granted that authority and listed Euclid with UNESCO as a degree-granting university”. In November, The Gambia did register EUCLID with IAU to be filed under The Gambia as headquarters state. The Verifile “Accredibase” report was also reviewed and replied to by EUCLID[tpl]cite web|author=EUCLID |url=http://www.euclid.int/accredibase_verifile/ |title=EUCLID vs Accredibase Verifile |publisher=Euclid.int |date= |accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl] in parallel with the publication of an article entitled “Understanding the Legal Status and Degree-Granting Authority of the ‘Regional-International’ Universities”.http://www.euclid.int/documents/internationaluniversities.pdf
Several Permanent Missions to the United Nations have also documented and refuted the Accredibase claims and in January 2013 notified the government of the United Kingdom and the ERIC NARIC Network that “Accredibate, a private UK label, is to be dismissed”.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pmcar.org/docs/J001-2013-PMUK.pdf |title=Joint Letter to the United Kingdom |publisher=Pmcar.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/comoros/pid/32110 |title=Permanent Mission of the Union of the Comoros to the United Nations - EUCLID Documents |publisher=Un.int |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2013-10-19[/tpl] As of August 2012, Accredibase maintained the “unaccredited” designation and in return EUCLID lists Verifile/Accredibase in its own list of “Unqualified entities”.EUCLID (Euclid University) - Official and Deceptive Entities
