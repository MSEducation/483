==History==

In the 1950s, Louis and Cyril Keller operated Keller Welding and Repair near Rothsay, Minnesota. In 1956 Eddie Velo, a turkey farmer from the area, described to the Kellers a need for a machine small enough to maneuver inside a pole barn, and light enough to operate on its upper level. The brothers worked out[tpl]When|date=December 2010[/tpl] a small, 3-wheeled design with a belt-driven transmission, and delivered it to Velo on February 4, 1957.[tpl]cite web|last=Keller|first=Joe|title=How the Bobcat Skid -Steer Loader Came To Be|url=http://www.skidsteerhistory.com/How%20it%20began.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011[/tpl] Velo allowed the Kellers full access to his operations.  The Kellers soon learned of drawbacks to the belt-driven transmission, and developed and patented a clutch-based transmission system in 1958 which was more robust.  The new transmission became the basis of the Melroe M60 loader; their uncle, an equipment dealer for the Gwinner, ND-based Melroe Manufacturing Company advocated for that company marketing the machines, resulting in Melroe inviting the Kellers to exhibit at the 1958 Minnesota State Fair.   Melroe introduced the four-wheeled M400 model "Skid-Steer Loader" in 1960, and began using "Bobcat" as a trade name for such products in 1962, on the 440-model loader.  Les Melroe and advertising agent Lynn Bickett settled on the "Bobcat" name while exchanging name ideas during a drive between Minneapolis and Gwinner, and Bickett and Sylvan Melroe developed the "tough, quick, and agile" slogan used in advertising the early loaders.[tpl]cite book|last=Karolevitz|first=Robert|title="E.G."

Melroe was purchased by Clark Equipment Company in 1969, and then by Ingersoll-Rand in 1995. Doosan currently owns Clark Equipment Company, which does business as Bobcat Company.  
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small- to medium-sized businesses in his book Hidden Champions.[tpl]When|date=December 2010[/tpl]
