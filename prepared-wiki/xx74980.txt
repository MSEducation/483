[[Latin dance]]

CATEGORIES: Latin dances

Latin dance is a general label, and a term in partner dance competition jargon. It refers to types of ballroom dance and folk dance, and includes a wide range of dances originating in Latin America, Cuba and Puerto Rico.
The category of Latin dances in the international dancesport competitions consists of the cha-cha-cha, rumba, samba, paso doble, and also the jive of United States origin.Lavelle, Doris 1983. Latin & American dances. 3rd ed, Black, London, p108.The reason jive is included with the latin dances is because its dance style is similar: "... a non-progressive dance which can be danced in a small space when the floor is crowded". and "The hold is similar to latin dances" it is quite different from the modern or ballroom dances.

Social Latin dances include salsa, mambo, merengue, tumba, bachata, bomba, plena, and the Argentine tango. There are many dances which were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only historical interest. The Cuban danzón is a good example.Santos, John. 1982. The Cuban Danzón (liner notes). New York, Folkways Records FE 4066
