CATEGORIES: Canadian short story collections, 2005 short story collections

Rust and Bone is a collection of short stories by Canadian author Craig Davidson, first published in 2005 by Viking Canada. Four of the short stories were published in the Canadian literary magazines Event, Prairie Fire and The Fiddlehead before being collected in a single work.

==Short stories==

Rust and Bone includes eight short stories. Although most of the stories stand alone, a few are loosely connected. James Paris, the main character of "A Mean Utility", also appears in "On Sleepless Roads". "On Sleepless Roads" makes reference to an event that took place in "Rocket Ride".

==Adaptations==

French director Jacques Audiard adapted Rust and Bone into a film in 2012. The adaptation stars Matthias Schoenaerts and Marion Cotillard. The script merged two unconnected short stories, "Rust and Bone" and "Rocket Ride", and moved the setting from Canada to France. Additionally, the principal character of "Rocket Ride" was changed to a woman.
