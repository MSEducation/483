After serving nearly 19 years as member of the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house, after the 2013 general election he became a member of the Senate.
On 1 August 2013, he was convicted of tax-fraud by the final appeal instance, Court of Cassation, and sentenced to four years imprisonment (of which three years are automatically pardoned) along with a public office ban for two years. As his age exceeds 70 years, he will be exempted from direct imprisonment, and instead serve his sentence by doing unpaid social community work. Because of being sentenced to a gross imprisonment for more than two years, a new Italian anticorruption law made the Italian Senate expel and bar him from serving any legislative office for six years.Italy's Senate expels ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi, BBC, 27 November 2013.
