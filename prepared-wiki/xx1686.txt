==History==

The cheese originates from the village of Cheddar in Somerset, South West England. Cheddar Gorge on the edge of the village contains a number of caves, which provided the ideal humidity and constant temperature for maturing the cheese. Cheddar cheese traditionally had to be made within [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] of Wells Cathedral.
Cheddar has been produced since at least the 12th century. A pipe roll of King Henry II from 1170 records the purchase of [tpl]convert|10240|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] at a farthing per pound (totaling £10.13s.4d., about £10.67 in decimal currency).[tpl]Cite web| title=History| work=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company | url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk/acatalog/about-cheddar-gorge.html | accessdate=1 August 2009[/tpl]  
Charles I (1600–1649) also bought cheese from the village.
Romans may have brought the recipe to Britain from the Cantal region of France.[tpl]cite book| last1 = Barthélemy| first1 = Roland| last2 = Sperat-Czar| first2 = Arnaud| title = Guide du fromage: Choisir, reconnaître, goûter 1200 fromages du monde| year = 2003| isbn = 978-2-01-236867-5| page = 89 [/tpl]
Central to the modernisation and standardisation of cheddar cheese, was the 19th century Somerset dairyman Joseph Harding.[tpl]Cite web| title=History of Cheddar Cheese | work=Icons of England | url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/cheddar-cheese/biography/history-of-cheddar-finished | accessdate=9 May 2007[/tpl]
For his technical innovations, promotion of dairy hygiene, and volunteer dissemination of modern cheese-making techniques, he has been dubbed "the father of cheddar cheese".[tpl]Cite book|last=Heeley |first=Anne |author2=Mary Vidal |title=Joseph Harding, Cheddar Cheese-Maker |year=1996 |publisher=Friends of the Abbey Barn |location=Glastonbury [/tpl]
Harding introduced new equipment to the process of cheese-making, including his "revolving breaker" for curd cutting, saving much manual effort.Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, 1866-7 volume 1, AberdeenChristabel Susan Lowry Orwin, Edith Holt Whetham, "History of British Agriculture, 1846–1914", Agriculture (1964), page 145
The "Joseph Harding method" was the first modern system for cheddar production based upon scientific principles. Harding stated that cheddar cheese is "not made in the field, nor in the byre, nor even in the cow, it is made in the dairy".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.gourmetbritain.com/encyclo_entry.php?item=2391 |title=Encyclopedia – Harding, Joseph |publisher=Gourmet Britain |accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] He and his wife were behind the introduction of the cheese into Scotland and North America. His sons, Henry and William Harding, were responsible for introducing cheddar cheese production to Australia[tpl]cite book | title=From Artisans to "Factories": The Interpenetration of Craft and Industry in English Cheese-Making 1650–1950 | first1=Richard | last1=Blundel | first2=Angela | last2=Tregear | publisher=Enterprise and Society | date=17 October 2006[/tpl] and facilitating the establishment of the cheese industry in New Zealand respectively. 
During the Second World War, and for nearly a decade after, most milk in Britain was used for the making of one single kind of cheese nicknamed "government cheddar" as part of war economies and rationing.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/government-cheddar-cheese |title=Government Cheddar Cheese |publisher= Practically Edible |accessdate=30 April 2011[/tpl] This almost resulted in wiping out all other cheese production in the country. Before the First World War there were more than 3,500 cheese producers in Britain; fewer than 100 remained after the Second World War.[tpl]Cite news| url= http://www.thestar.com/News/article/264784 | title= Cool Britannia rules the whey  |last=Potter |first=Mich | publisher= |work= Toronto Star | date= 9 October 2007 | accessdate= 4 January 2009[/tpl]
According to a United States Department of Agriculture researcher, cheddar cheese is the world's most popular variety of cheese, and the most studied type of cheese in scientific publications.[tpl]cite news |last=Tunick |first=Michael H. |date=23 February 2014 |title=The biggest cheese?

==Process==

The curds and whey are separated using rennet, an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of newborn calves (in vegetarian or kosher cheeses, bacterial-, yeast- or mould-derived chymosin is used).[tpl]Cite web| url= http://www.vegsoc.org/info/cheese.html | publisher= Vegetarian Society | title= Information Sheet – Cheese & Rennet | accessdate= 10 March 2008[/tpl]
Cheddaring refers to an additional step in the production of cheddar cheese where, after heating, the curd is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the whey and then stacked and turned.[tpl]Cite news| url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2005/06/18/edsavvy18.xml | publisher= | work= The Daily Telegraph | title= Savvy shopper: Cheddar | date= 18 June 2005 | accessdate= 10 March 2008 | location=London | first=Harry | last=Mount[/tpl] Strong, extra-mature cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for up to 15 months. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature often requiring special facilities. As with other hard cheese varieties produced worldwide, caves provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some cheddar cheese is matured in the caves at Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge. Additionally, some versions of cheddar cheese are smoked.American Cheeses: The Best Regional, Artisan, and Farmhouse Cheeses, Who ... – Clark WolfKelly Jaggers, Moufflet: More Than 100 Gourmet Muffin Recipes That Rise to Any Occasion,  p. 104.

==Character==

The ideal quality of the original Somerset cheddar was described by Joseph Harding in 1864 as "close and firm in texture, yet mellow in character or quality; it is rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth, the flavour full and fine, approaching to that of a hazelnut".Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society for the Year 1864, page 232, volume 14 1865, Albany
Cheddar made in the classical way tends to have a sharp, pungent flavour, often slightly earthy. Its texture is firm, with farmhouse traditional cheddar being slightly crumbly; it should also, if mature, contain large cheese crystals consisting of calcium lactate – often precipitated when matured for times longer than six months.[tpl]Cite thesis | last= Phadungath | first = Chanokphat| title = The Efficacy of Sodium Gluconate as a Calcium Lactate Crystal Inhibitor in Cheddar Cheese | type = |chapter = | url = http://purl.umn.edu/116278 | year = 2011 | publisher = University of Minnesota | accessdate = 12 October 2013[/tpl]
Cheddar is usually a deep to pale yellow (off-white) colour, but food colourings are sometimes used in industrial varieties of cheddar-style cheeses. One commonly used example is annatto, extracted from seeds of the tropical achiote tree. The largest producer of industrial cheddar-style cheese in the United States, Kraft, uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of paprika.[tpl]cite book| last = Feldman| first = David| title = When Do Fish Sleep? And Other Imponderables of Everyday Life| year = 1989| publisher = Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc.| isbn = 0-06-016161-2| page = 15 [/tpl] Coloured cheddar cheese has long been sold, but even as early as 1860, the real reason for this was unclear: Joseph Harding stated "to the cheese consumers of London who prefer an adulterated food to that which is pure I have to announce an improvement in the annatto with which they compel the cheesemakers to colour the cheese."[tpl]cite journal| last = Murray| first = John| title = Recent Improvements in Dairy Practice| url = http://books.google.com/?id=OKsGTRlEfSgC&pg=PA82| volume = 21| year = 1860| publisher = | location = London| page = 90| journal = Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England [/tpl] According to David Feldman, an author of trivia books, "The only reason why cheesemakers colour their product is because consumers seem to prefer it."
Cheddar cheese was sometimes (and still can be found) packaged in black wax, but was more commonly packaged in larded cloth, which was impermeable to contaminants, but still allowed the cheese to "breathe", although this practice is now limited to artisan cheese makers.
The Slow Food Movement has created a Cheddar Presidium,[tpl]Cite web|author=Blulab sas |url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.org/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 |title=La Fondazione – slow food per la biodiversità – ONLUS |publisher=Slowfoodfoundation.org |accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] claiming that only three cheeses should be called "original cheddar". Their specifications, which go further than the "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), require that cheddar cheese be made in Somerset and with traditional methods, such as using raw milk, traditional animal rennet, and a cloth wrapping.[tpl]Cite web| title=Presidia Artisan Somerset Cheddar | work=The Slow Food Foundation | url=http://www.slowfoodfoundation.com/eng/presidi/dettaglio.lasso?cod=148 | accessdate=9 May 2007[/tpl]
Notable cheddar cheeses include "Quickes", which in 2009 was awarded cheese of the year by the British Cheese Association, "Keen's", with a strong tang, and "Montgomery's", with an apple aftertaste. Lincolnshire Poacher cheese is an example of a cheese made in the style of a traditional cheddar in Lincolnshire.

==International production==

===Status===

The cheddar cheese name is used internationally; its name does not have a protected designation of origin (PDO) but the use of the name "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" does. Countries making cheddar cheese include Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Cheddars can be industrial or artisan cheeses. The flavour, colour and quality of industrial cheese varies significantly, and food packaging will usually indicate a strength, such as mild, medium, strong, tasty, sharp, extra sharp, mature, old, or vintage; this may indicate the maturation period, or food additives used to enhance the flavour. Artisan varieties develop strong and diverse flavours over time.

===Canada===

Following a wheat midge outbreak in Canada in the mid-nineteenth century, farmers in Ontario began to convert to dairy farming in large numbers, and cheddar cheese became their main exportable product, even being exported to England. By the turn of the twentieth century there were 1,242 cheddar factories in Ontario, and cheddar had become Canada’s second largest export after timber.Manufacturing Taste · thewalrus.ca Cheddar exports totaled [tpl]convert|234000000|lbs[/tpl] in 1904, but by 2012, Canada was a net importer of cheese. James L. Kraft grew up on a dairy farm in Ontario, before moving to Chicago. Acording to the writer Sarah Champman, "Although we cannot wholly lay the decline of cheese craft in Canada at the feet of James Lewis Kraft, it did correspond with the rise of Kraft’s processed cheese empire." Most Canadian cheddar is produced by a number of large companies in Ontario, though other provinces produce some and there are some smaller artisanal producers. The annual production is 120,000 tons Types of cheddar cheese, Canadian Living It is aged a minimum of three months, but much of it is held for much longer, up to 10 years.

===New Zealand===

Much of the cheddar cheese in New Zealand is factory produced but of good quality. Most of it is sold young within the country. The Anchor dairy company ships New Zealand cheddars to the UK, where it matures for another year or so.

===United Kingdom===

Only one producer of the cheese is now based in Cheddar itself, The Cheddar Gorge Cheese Co.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cheddargorgecheeseco.co.uk|title=Cheddar Gorge Cheese Company[/tpl] The name "cheddar" is not protected by the European Union, though the name "West Country Farmhouse Cheddar" has an EU protected designation of origin, and may only be produced in Somerset, Devon, Dorset and Cornwall, using milk sourced from those counties.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/industry/regional/foodname/products/registered/westcoun.htm | publisher= Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs | title= EU Protected Food Names Scheme – UK registered names | accessdate= 22 July 2009[/tpl] Cheddar is usually sold as mild, medium, mature, extra mature or vintage.

===United States of America===

The state of Wisconsin produces the most cheddar cheese in the U.S.A.; other centres of production include California, Idaho, upstate New York, Vermont, Tillamook (in Oregon), Texas and Oklahoma. It is sold in several varieties (mild, medium, sharp, extra-sharp, New York-style, white and Vermont). New York cheddar-style cheese is particularly sharp, but usually slightly softer than the milder-tasting varieties. Cheese that has not been artificially-coloured the familiar yellow-orange hue is frequently labelled as "white cheddar" or "Vermont cheddar" (regardless of whether it was actually produced there). Vermont has three creameries that produce what is regarded as first-class cheddar cheeses: the Cabot Creamery, which produces the sixteen-month-old "Private Stock Cheddar", the Grafton Village Company and Shelburne Farms.Ridgway, Judy. The Cheese Companion. Running Press, 2004, p. 77.
Some cheeses called "cheddar" are actually flavoured processed cheeses or "cheese foods"; they often bear little resemblance to the natural cheeses they were named for. Examples include Easy Cheese, a cheese food packaged in a pressurized spray can, or in packs of individually-wrapped, processed cheese slices.
Cheddar is one of several products used by the United States Department of Agriculture to track the status of America's overall dairy industry; reports are issued weekly detailing prices and production quantities.
