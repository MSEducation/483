#REDIRECT Needle lace

Buratto is an Italian needle lace made by darning on a net.  It is quite similar in appearance to filet lace but with one important distinctionâ€”it is darned onto a woven net, rather than the knotted net used for filet.  Buratto tends to also be heavier in appearance due to the woven nature of the netting used.Earnshaw, Pat.  Identification of Lace.  Shire.  2009.
