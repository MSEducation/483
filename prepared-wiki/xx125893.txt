[[MF 67]]

CATEGORIES: Paris Métro rolling stock

The MF 67 is a steel-wheel variant of electric multiple units used on Paris's Métro system. It is the most common Paris Metro rolling stock variant, being used on Lines 3, 3bis, 9, 10 and 12. 1482 cars have been built in 5 batches, first initially introduced on Lines 7 and 12.
On Lines 5 and 9 the MF 67 is being replaced by the newer MF 2000 stock, as these aging trains are approaching 40 years old (the first deliveries were in 1967/1968). The trains underwent mid-life refurbishment from 1995 through and until  2007 (the trains on Line 3 were the last to be refurbished).

==Conception==

It was originally envisioned by the RATP to convert all Metro lines to rubber-tyred pneumatic operation. However, this plan was later abandoned due to high costs, which in turn, would have prolonged the service of the aging Sprague-Thomson trainsets to 80 years. Therefore, a new class of steel-wheel rolling stock was developed.

==Series==

The MF 67 actually comprises seven different series of trainsets; however, two series of these trains were prototypes.

==Technical specifications==

==Service trains==

Currently, the RATP uses a string of MF-67 "Auteuil Convoy" trains (retired MF 67C trainsets from Line 2 in four car compositions), to supply the Auteuil and Vaugirard Depots, these trains are colored yellow and brown and serve as auxiliary equipment of the work of the RATP (VMI). They replaced the aging tractor variants of the Sprague-Thomson.
