==Name==

The Japanese name, [tpl]nihongo|edamame|枝豆|[/tpl], is used commonly to refer to the dish.[tpl]Ref|A|A[/tpl] It literally means, "twig bean" (eda = "twig" + mame = "bean"). Edamame is a popular side dish at Japanese izakaya restaurants with local varieties being in demand, depending on the season.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Salt is a typical condiment for edamame. In Japan, arajio is the preferred salt, because it is a natural sea salt. This coarse salt is wet with brine, thus loaded with marine and mineral flavors.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==History==

The earliest documented reference to the term "edamame" dates from the year 1275, when the Japanese monk, Nichiren, wrote a note thanking a parishioner for the gift of "edamame" he had left at the temple.History of Edamame, Green Vegetable Soybeans, and Vegetable-Type Soybeans (1275-2009) Edamame appeared in haikai verse in Japanese in the Edo period (1603 – 1868), with one example as early as 1638.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten | title = 枝豆 | trans_title = Edamame | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-06-06 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | oclc = 56431036[/tpl] The earliest recorded usage in English of the word edamame is in 1951 in the journal Folklore Studies.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Oxford English dictionary | title = Edamame, n. | url = http://www.oed.com | accessdate = June 6, 2012 | edition = 3rd |date=March 2012 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England | lccn = 2002565560 | oclc = 357047940[/tpl] Edamame appeared as a new term in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003, and in the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2008.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia =Jōhō chishiki imidas | title = Edamame | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = June 6, 2012 | language = Japanese | year = 2012 | publisher =Shūeisha | location =Tōkyō | oclc =297351993[/tpl]  In the United States, specialty seed companies such as Wannamaker Seeds, created in 1998, helped to introduce the opportunity to grow edamame in the US for the US consumer.http://www.edamameseed.com/aboutus.html

==Preparation==

To effectively harvest edamame the pods should be picked by hand and not by machine to avoid stems and leaves.http://edamameusa.com/ Green soybeans in the pod are picked before they ripen in order to prepare edamame. The ends of the pod may be cut before boiling or steaming.
Then the pods are boiled in water, steamed or microwaved. The most common preparation uses salt for taste. The salt may either be dissolved in the boiling water before introducing the soybean pods, or it may be added after the pods have been cooked.  Fresh edamame should be blanched first before being frozen.http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/freeze/blanching.html
