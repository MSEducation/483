The predominant occupation of the Igbide is fishing. This is done mainly in the Urie lake, Owodokpokpo. In the first week of February the clan holds a festival on the Urie marking the start of the fishing season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deltastate.gov.ng/igbide.htm|title=Urie Fishing Festival of Igbide|publisher=Delta State Government|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl] Cultivation, mainly of cassava and groundnuts, is also undertaken by the Igbide.
While popular folklore has it that the Igbide people originated from Mgbidi in the Eastern (Igbo) part of Nigeria, some more recent writers attribute their origins to Awka in present day Anambra state with a blend of later immigrants from Uvwie (Effurun) in Delta State .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waado.org/Organizations/Uhs/Debates/UrhoboBeninRelations/Omoigui.html|title=Reply to Peter Ekeh on Benin-Urhobo Relationships |author=Nowamagbe Omoigui, M.D.[/tpl]
This affiliation to the Igbos can be observed in the dress and costume codes of the Igbides in festivals like ABAME.,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYq0goVWkVs|title=Abame festival of the Igbide people of Isoko South L.G.A of Delta State, Nigeria[/tpl] and the salutation sequence and chants as well as the mercantile nature of a typical Igbide man.
