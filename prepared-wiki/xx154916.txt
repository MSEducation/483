===On loan to Surrey===

On 4 August 2010, Cheetham moved to Surrey until the end of the 2010 season on loan. With limited opportunities to play first-team cricket at Lancashire, there was a greater chance to play at Surrey who at the time had suffered injuries to their bowling attack. According to Chris Adams, Surrey's cricket manager, "Steven is a young bowler with terrific physical attributes, who bowls wicket to wicket and is very much at the start of his career".[tpl]citation |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/domestic/surrey-snap-up-cheetham,311442,EN.html |title=Surrey snap up Cheetham |publisher=ECB |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=5 August 2010[/tpl] Drafted straight into the team, Cheetham played his first match for Surrey the same day.
