California ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-California.ogg|ˌ|k|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɔr|n|j|ə[/tpl]) is a state located on the West Coast of the United States.

California is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, Arizona to the southeast, and the Mexican State of Baja California to the south. It is home to the nation's second and fifth most populous census statistical areas (Greater Los Angeles area and San Francisco Bay Area, respectively), and eight of the nation's 50 most populated cities (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Oakland).[tpl]cite web | title = E-4 Population Estimates for Cities, Counties and the State, 2001–2009, with 2000 Benchmark. | location = Sacramento, California | publisher = State of California, Department of Finance |date=May 2009 | url = http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-4/2001-09/ | accessdate =December 24, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl] Sacramento is the state capital.
What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but would later be ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican-American War. The western portion of Alta California was soon organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large-scale immigration from the U.S. and abroad and an accompanying economic boom.
California's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west, to the Sierra Nevada in the east – from the Redwood–Douglas-fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States (Mount Whitney and Death Valley), and has the 3rd longest coastline of all states (after Alaska and Florida). Earthquakes are a common occurrence because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire: about 37,000 are recorded annually, but most are too small to feel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/rate_of_seism.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Seismo.berkeley.edu |accessdate=April 22, 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The word California originally referred to the entire region composed of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, the current U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.
The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia.[tpl]cite book|last=Putnam|first=Ruth|editor=Herbert Ingram Priestley|title=California: the name|url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924008278347|year=1917|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|pages=356–361|chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word "California": Surmises and Usage[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Vogeley|first=Nancy|date=April 20, 2001|title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|publisher=University of Washington|volume=62|issue=2|pages=165–188|url=http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/62/2/165|doi=10.1215/00267929-62-2-165[/tpl] The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandián, written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo.Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

Shortened forms of the state's name include CA, Cal., Cali., Calif. and us-CA.

==Geography==

California is the 3rd largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc3-us-pt1.pdf |format=PDF |title=2000 Census of Population and Housing|date=April 2004 |publisher=US Census Bureau |page=29|accessdate=December 25, 2009[/tpl]
In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Cascade Range in the north and the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California's agricultural heartland.
Divided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River; both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are seaports.
The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta, that traverse nearly the length of the state, including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population, and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. The Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast.
The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for "snowy range") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at [tpl]convert|14505|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite ngs|id=GT1811|designation=Whitney|accessdate=October 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html|title=Elevations and Distances in the United States|publisher=United States Geological Survey|year=2001|accessdate=October 21, 2011[/tpl]Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.  The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume.
To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States.
About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests,[ref]
