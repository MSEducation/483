Guarana ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|w|ɑr|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː[/tpl], from the Portuguese guaraná [tpl]IPA-pt|ɡwaɾɐˈna|[/tpl]), Paullinia cupana, syn. P. crysan, P. sorbilis) is a climbing plant in the maple family, Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil. Guarana features large leaves and clusters of flowers, and is best known for its fruit, which is about the size of a coffee bean.  As a dietary supplement, guarana is an effective stimulant:[tpl]Cite news| last = Johannes| first = Laura  | title = Can a Caffeine-Packed Plant Give a Boost?| newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| page = D3 |date = March 2, 2010[/tpl] its seeds contain about twice the concentration of caffeine found in coffee beans (about 2–4.5% caffeine in guarana seeds compared to 1–2% for coffee beans).[tpl]cite journal |author=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int.

As with other plants producing caffeine, the high concentration of caffeine is a defensive toxin that repels herbivores from the berry and its seeds.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ashihara H, Sano H, Crozier A |title=Caffeine and related purine alkaloids: biosynthesis, catabolism, function and genetic engineering |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=841–56 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18068204 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.10.029 [/tpl]
The guarana fruit's colour ranges from brown to red and contains black seeds which are partly covered by white arils. The colour contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs; this has formed the basis of a myth.[tpl]cite book |editor=Prance G, Nesbitt M |title=Cultural History of Plants |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |location=New York |page=179 [/tpl]

==History and culture==

The word guarana comes from the Guaraní word guara-ná, which has its origins in the Sateré-Maué word for the plant, warana,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/guarana | title=guarana | publisher=Merriam Webster | accessdate=2007-09-18[/tpl] that in Tupi-Guarani means "fruit like the eyes of the people"
Guarana plays an important role in Tupi and Guaraní Paraguayan culture. According to a myth attributed to the Sateré-Maué tribe, guarana's domestication originated with a deity killing a beloved village child. To console the villagers, a more benevolent god plucked the left eye from the child and planted it in the forest, resulting in the wild variety of guarana. The god then plucked the right eye from the child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.[tpl]cite book |author=Beck HT |chapter=10 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Sweeteners |title=Cultural History of Plants  |editor=Ghillean Prance |editor2=Mark Nesbitt |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=179 |isbn=978-0-415-92746-8 [/tpl]
The Guaranís would make an herbal tea by shelling, washing and drying the seeds, followed by pounding them into a fine powder. The powder is kneaded into a dough and then shaped into cylinders. This product is known as guarana bread, which would be grated and then immersed into hot water along with sugar.[tpl]cite book |author=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=259–60[/tpl]
This plant was introduced to European colonizers and to Europe in the 16th century by Oviedo, Hernández, Cobo and other Spaniard chroniclers. By 1958, guarana was commercialized.

==Composition==

The table contains a partial listing of some of the chemicals found in guarana seeds, although other parts of the plant may contain them as well in varying quantities.
According to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, guaranine is defined as only the caffeine chemical in guarana, it is identical to the caffeine chemical derived from other sources, for example coffee, tea, and maté. Guaranine, theine, and mateine are all synonyms for caffeine when the definitions of those words include none of the properties and chemicals of their host plants except the chemical caffeine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/gen_metab_summary_5.php?molName=caffeine#SYNONYMS |title=Caffeine |publisher=Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=2007-09-19[/tpl] Natural sources of caffeine contain widely varying mixtures of xanthine alkaloids other than caffeine, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine and other substances such as polyphenols, which can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.
The main natural phenols found in guarana are (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin.[tpl]cite journal  |title=Liquid chromatographic determination of methylxanthines and catechins in herbal preparations containing guaraná |author=Carlson M, Thompson RD |journal=Journal of AOAC International |date=July–August 1998 |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=691–701 |pmid=9680692[/tpl]

==Uses==

Guarana is used in sweetened or carbonated soft drinks and energy shots, an ingredient of herbal teas or contained in capsules. Generally, South America obtains most of its caffeine from guarana.[tpl]cite book |author=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=230[/tpl]

===Beverages===

Brazil, which is the third-largest consumer of soft drinks in the world,[tpl]cite book |author=Weinberg BA, Bealer BK |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92723-9 |pages=192–3[/tpl] produces several soft drink brands from guarana extract. The Portuguese word guaraná is widely used in Brazil as a reference to soft drinks containing guarana extract. Guarana in energy drinks is known to help athletes recover from strains and aches in legs.Mainly quadriceps and hamstrings.

===Cognitive effects===

As guarana is rich in caffeine, it is of interest for its potential effects on cognition. In rats, guarana increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo.[tpl]cite journal |author=Espinola EB, Dias RF, Mattei R, Carlini EA |title=Pharmacological activity of Guarana (Paullinia cupana Mart.) in laboratory animals |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=223–9 |date=February 1997 |pmid=9080343 |doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(96)01506-1 [/tpl]
A randomized controlled trial has shown that cognition may be improved with guarana.[tpl]cite pmid|24067387[/tpl]

===Other uses and side effects===

In the United States, guarana has received the designation of "generally recognized as safe" by the American Food and Drug Administration.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/InfoSheets/ANR/EnergyDrinkFact.pdf |title=Energy Drinks |publisher=University of California, Davis |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-18 | format=PDF[/tpl]
Preliminary research has shown guarana may affect how quickly the body perceives itself to be full. One study showed an average 5.1 kg (11.2 lb) weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guarana, and damiana, compared to an average one-pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days.[tpl]cite journal |author=Anderson T, Foght J |title=Weight loss and delayed gastric emptying following a South American herbal preparation in overweight patients |journal=J Hum Nutr Diet |year=2001 |pages=243–50 |volume=14 |issue=3 | url= |doi=10.1046/j.1365-277X.2001.00290.x |pmid=11424516[/tpl] Although inconclusive about specific effects due only to guarana, this study differs from another showing no effect on body weight of a formula containing guarana.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sale C, Harris RC, Delves S, Corbett J |title=Metabolic and physiological effects of ingesting extracts of bitter orange, green tea and guarana at rest and during treadmill walking in overweight males |journal=Int J Obes (Lond) |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=764–73 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16418760 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803209 [/tpl]
