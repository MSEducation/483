Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to "nanotech") is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology[tpl]cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology|year=1986|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-19973-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computatin|year=1992|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-57547-X[/tpl]  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars.  The European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.Apply nanotech to up industrial, agri output, The Daily Star (Bangladesh), 17 April 2012.
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, microfabrication, etc.[tpl]cite journal|last=Saini|first=Rajiv|coauthors=Saini, Santosh, Sharma, Sugandha|title=Nanotechnology: The Future Medicine|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=32–33|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.63301|pmc=2890134|pmid=20606992[/tpl]  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.
Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in medicine, electronics, biomaterials and energy production. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials,[tpl]cite journal|author= Cristina Buzea, Ivan Pacheco, and Kevin Robbie|title=Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity|volume=2|year=2007|journal=Biointerphases|doi=10.1116/1.2815690|pmid=20419892|issue= 4|pages= MR17–71[/tpl] and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

==Origins==

The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. The term "nano-technology" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known.
Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K. Eric Drexler independently used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.
Thus, emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter.
For example, the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.[tpl]Cite journal|first1=G. |last1=Binnig |first2=H. |last2=Rohrer|title=Scanning tunneling microscopy|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=30|page=4|year=1986[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Press Release: the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=15 October 1986[/tpl] Binnig, Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year.
Fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto, Richard Smalley, and Robert Curl, who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/318162a0 |title=C60: Buckminsterfullerene |year=1985 |last1=Kroto |first1=H.

In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress. Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the Royal Society's report on nanotechnology.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl] Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37–42 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037[/tpl]
Meanwhile, commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging. These products are limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials and do not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples include the Silver Nano platform for using silver nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent, nanoparticle-based transparent sunscreens, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.[tpl]cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=American Elements|accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl]
Governments moved to promote and fund research into nanotechnology, beginning in the U.S. with the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale.
By the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish.  Projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps[tpl]cite web|title=Productive Nanosystems Technology Roadmap|url=http://www.productivenanosystems.com/docs/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=NASA Draft Nanotechnology Roadmap|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501325main_TA10-Nanotech-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf[/tpl]  which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.

==Fundamental concepts==

Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.
One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range [tpl]nowrap|0.12–0.15 nm[/tpl], and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range [tpl]nowrap|1 to 100 nm[/tpl] following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size that phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.[tpl]cite book |first=Fritz |last=Allhoff |first2=Patrick |last2=Lin |first3=Daniel |last3=Moore |title=What is nanotechnology and why does it matter?: from science to ethics |pages=3–5 |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |isbn=1-4051-7545-1 [/tpl] These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.[tpl]cite book |first=S. K. |last=Prasad |title=Modern Concepts in Nanotechnology |pages=31–32 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2008 |isbn=81-8356-296-5 [/tpl]
To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth.[tpl]cite journal|last =Kahn| first =Jennifer |title=Nanotechnology|journal=National Geographic |volume=2006 |issue=June |pages=98–119 |year=2006[/tpl] Or another way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man's beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.
Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the "bottom-up" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition. In the "top-down" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|author=Rodgers, P. |year=2006|title=Nanoelectronics: Single file|doi=10.1038/nnano.2006.5[/tpl]
Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.

===Larger to smaller: a materials perspective===

Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the “quantum size effect” where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. Mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with biomaterials.
Materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminum); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lubick N | year = 2008 | title = Silver socks have cloudy lining | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 42 | issue = 11| page = 3910 | pmid=18589943 | doi = 10.1021/es0871199 | last2 = Betts | first2 = Kellyn|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.3910L [/tpl]

===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===

Modern synthetic chemistry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or commercial polymers. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.
These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom-up approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces. The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate, or the specific folding of the protein itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.
Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in biology, most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.

===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===

Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the molecular assembler, a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis. Manufacturing in the context of productive nanosystems is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.
When the term "nanotechnology" was independently coined and popularized by Eric Drexler (who at the time was unaware of an earlier usage by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on molecular machine systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, stochastically optimised biological machines can be produced.
It is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using biomimetic principles. However, Drexler and other researchersNanotechnology: Developing Molecular Manufacturing have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|title=Some papers by K. Eric Drexler[/tpl] The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book Nanosystems.
In general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno,California NanoSystems Institute is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.
This led to an exchange of letters in the ACS publication Chemical & Engineering News in 2003.C&En: Cover Story – Nanotechnology Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy. Leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are Dr. Alex Zettl and his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley. They have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage: a nanotube nanomotor, a molecular actuator,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.physics.berkeley.edu/research/zettl/pdf/312.NanoLett5regan.pdf|doi=10.1021/nl0510659|pmid=16159214|year=2005|last1=Regan|first1=BC|last2=Aloni|first2=S|last3=Jensen|first3=K|last4=Ritchie|first4=RO|last5=Zettl|first5=A|title=Nanocrystal-powered nanomotor|volume=5|issue=9|pages=1730–3|journal=Nano letters|bibcode = 2005NanoL...5.1730R [/tpl] and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sabl/2005/May/Tiniest-Motor.pdf|doi=10.1063/1.1887827|title=Surface-tension-driven nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator|year=2005|last1=Regan|first1=B.

An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999. They used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.

==Current research==

===Nanomaterials===

The nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.[ref]
</ref>

===Bottom-up approaches===

These seek to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies.

===Top-down approaches===

These seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly.

===Functional approaches===

These seek to develop components of a desired functionality without regard to how they might be assembled.

===Biomimetic approaches===

===Speculative===

These subfields seek to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield, or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry might progress. These often take a big-picture view of nanotechnology, with more emphasis on its societal implications than the details of how such inventions could actually be created.

==Tools and techniques==

There are several important modern developments. The atomic force microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of scanning probe microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.
The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). Feature-oriented scanning methodology suggested by Rostislav Lapshin appears to be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.[tpl]cite journal|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=2004|title=Feature-oriented scanning methodology for probe microscopy and nanotechnology|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1135–1151|publisher=IOP|location=UK|issn=0957-4484|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/9/006|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#feature2004|format=PDF|bibcode=2004Nanot..15.1135L[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=2011|contribution=Feature-oriented scanning probe microscopy|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology|editor=H. S. Nalwa|volume=14|pages=105–115|publisher=American Scientific Publishers|location=USA|isbn=1-58883-163-9|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#fospm2011|format=PDF[/tpl] However, this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope.
Various techniques of nanolithography such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography dip pen nanolithography, electron beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.
Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.
The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.
In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is molecular beam epitaxy or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.
However, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive Transfersome vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]

==Applications==

As of August 21, 2008, the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies estimates that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week. The project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database. Most applications are limited to the use of "first generation" passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings,[tpl]cite journal | author = Kurtoglu M.

The National Science Foundation (a major distributor for nanotechnology research in the United States) funded researcher David Berube to study the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz. This study concludes that much of what is sold as “nanotechnology” is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a “nanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like” which will “end up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes." Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a "nano bubble" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.[tpl]cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1822/ [/tpl]

==Implications==

An area of concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials would have on human health and the environment, as suggested by nanotoxicology research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments. Others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations. Public health research agencies, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are actively conducting research on potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nanotech/|title=CDC - Nanotechnology - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=June 15, 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-24[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-101/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Filling the Knowledge Gaps for Safe Nanotechnology in the Workplace|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=November 7, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]

===Health and environmental concerns===

Nanofibers are used in several areas and in different products, in everything from aircraft wings to tennis rackets.   Inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may lead to a number of pulmonary diseases, e.g. fibrosis.[tpl]cite journal|title=The significance of nano particles in particle-induced pulmonary fibrosis|author1=James D Byrne|author2=John A Baugh|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine|year=2008|volume=11|pages=43–50|pmc=2322933[/tpl]  Researchers have found that when rats breathed in nanoparticles, the particles settled in the brain and lungs, which led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress responseElder, A.

A major study published more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests some forms of carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the “nanotechnology revolution” – could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said "We know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully."[ref]Weiss, R. (2008).

==Regulation==

Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology.[ref]
</ref> There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes (to varying degrees) – by “bolting on” nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes.<ref>[tpl]cite journal |author=Bowman D, and Hodge G|title=Nanotechnology: Mapping the Wild Regulatory Frontier |journal=Futures |volume=38 |pages=1060–1073 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2006.02.017 |issue=9[/tpl]</ref> Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.<ref>Davies, J.

Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease), thalidomide, genetically modified food,[tpl]cite journal |author=Rowe G, Horlick-Jones T, Walls J, Pidgeon N, |title= Difficulties in evaluating public engagement initiatives: reflections on an evaluation of the UK GM Nation? |journal=Public Understanding of Science. |volume=14 |year=2005 |page=333[/tpl] nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and asbestosis. Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology.Maynard, A.Testimony by Dr. Andrew Maynard for the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology. (2008-4-16). Retrieved on 2008-11-24. As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.[ref]Faunce TA et al.

The Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that “manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure” (p. xiii). Reflecting the challenges for ensuring responsible life cycle regulation, the Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards has proposed that standards for nanotechnology research and development should be integrated across consumer, worker and environmental standards. They also propose that NGOs and other citizen groups play a meaningful role in the development of these standards.
The Center for Nanotechnology in Society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently, depending on application – with participants in public deliberations more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications – suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector.
