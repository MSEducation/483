The Nutshell is a pub in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk,  England, claiming to be the smallest pub in Britain, although this claim is challenged by several others, including the Smiths Arms at Godmanstone and the Lakeside Inn in Southport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/southport-news/southport-southport-news/2008/09/05/southport-s-smallest-british-pub-title-holder-scoops-big-award-101022-21676650/|title=Southport's Smallest British Pub title holder scoops big award|publisher=Southport Visiter|date=5 September 2008|last=Siddle|first=John|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl] However those two establishments while having smaller interior space seat most of their clients outside in a beer garden. Whatever the truth of its claim, the pub is certainly diminutive, there being very little room for more than ten or fifteen customers to drink at any one time. The pub measures [tpl]convert|4.57|x|2.13|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml|title=Beer in a Nutshell|page=1|work=BBC Online|first=David|last=Webb|accessdate=7 July 2010|date=August 2003[/tpl] In 1984, a record number of 102 people squeezed into the pub.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/suffolk/article_2.shtml|title=Beer in a Nutshell|page=2|work=BBC Online|first=David|last=Webb|accessdate=7 July 2010|date=August 2003[/tpl]
Inside the pub is suspended the dried body of a black cat, discovered during building work. Builders used to brick cats up behind chimney hearths, where they died of starvation and heat.
