==Style==

The style of Back Breaker has proved to be somewhat a mix of their first two albums. They have returned to the heavier sound of A Chorus of Obliteration, while still keeping some of the southern elements of Temptation Come My Way. Lead vocalist Dave Bunton uses harsh screaming, growling, and yelling often, but also mixes in some singing. The band characterized Temptation Come My Way as being their "Black Album.",[tpl]cite web | url=http://musicremedy.com/t/the-showdown/album/temptation-come-my-way-3573.html | accessdate=2011-02-08 | title=The Showdown to release Temptation Come My Way[/tpl] while this album has moved towards their Pantera influences. Drummer A.J. Barrette brings back lots of double bass for this album. Bassist Eric Koruschak uses bass riffs that keep the songs feeling low and full, while guitarist Josh Childers uses heavily distorted riffs, with the occasional whining guitar solo. Each of the album's song titles is based on Greek mythology storylines.[tpl]cite news | title=Music Review: Back Breaker, The Showdown | url=http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/6530 | publisher=Cleveland Leader | accessdate=2008-09-05 | date=25 August 2008 | first=Francis | last=Petruziello | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080924053332/http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/6530| archivedate= 24 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
