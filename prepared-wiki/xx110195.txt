Chrysopelea, or more commonly known as the flying snake, is a genus that belongs to the family Colubridae. Flying snakes are mildly venomous,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.physorg.com/news4079.html|title= Researchers reveal secrets of snake flight|date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2007-11-27 [/tpl] though they are considered harmless because their toxicity is not dangerous to humans.[tpl]cite web |title=University of Chicago researchers reveal secrets of snake flight |url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2005/20050513-snake.html |date=May 13, 2005 |publisher=The University of Chicago Medical Center  |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl] Their range is in Southeast Asia (the mainland (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos), Greater and Lesser Sundas, Maluku, and the Philippines), southernmost China, India, and Sri Lanka.[tpl]cite journal | last = Ferner | first = J.W. | last2 = Brown | first2 = R.W. | last3 = Sison | first3 = R.V. | last4 = Kennedy | first4 = R.S. |year=2000 |title=The Amphibians and Reptiles of Panay Island, Philippines |journal=Asiatic Herpetological Research |volume=9 |pages=1–37 |url=http://www.nhm.ku.edu/rbrown/Rafes%20PDF%20publications/2000_Ferner_et_al_AHR.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-14 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Socha |first=J. |title=Approximate distribution of Chrysopelea |url=http://www.flyingsnake.org/faqs/images/distribution-map.html |date=1999–2005 |publisher=flyingsnake.org |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]Pawar, S. and Birand, A.

Chrysopelea is also known by its common name "flying snake". It climbs using ridge scales along its belly,[tpl]cite journal |last=Dudley |first=R |last2 = Byrnes | first2 = G. | last3 = Yanoviak | first3 = S.P. | last4 = Borrell | first4 = B. | last5 = Brown | first5 = R.M. | last6 = McGuire | first6 = J.A. |year=2007 |title=Gliding and the Functional Origins of Flight: Biomechanical Novelty or Necessity? |trans_title= |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=38 |pages=179–201 |url=http://www.nhm.ku.edu/rbrown/Rafes%20PDF%20publications/Dudley.etal.flight.annurev.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-14 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110014 [/tpl] pushing against rough bark surface of tree trunks, allowing it to move vertically up a tree. Upon reaching the end of a tree's branch, the snake continues moving until its tail dangles from the branch's end. It then makes a J-shape bend, leans forward to select the level of inclination it wishes to use to control its flight path, as well as selecting a desired landing area. Once it decides on a destination, it propels itself by thrusting its body up and away from the tree, sucking in its abdomen and flaring out its ribs to turn its body into a "pseudo concave wing",[tpl]cite book |title=Ecological morphology: integrative organismal biology |last=Garland |first=T, Jr. |last2 = Losos | first2 = J.B. |year=1994 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |isbn= |pages=240–302 |chapter=10.

The combination of sucking in its stomach and making a motion of lateral undulation in the air makes it possible for the snake to glide in the air, where it also manages to save energy compared to travel on the ground and dodge earth-bound predators. The concave wing that a snake creates in sucking in its stomach flattens its body to up to twice its width from the back of the head to the anal vent, which is close to the end of the snake's tail, causes the cross section of the snake's body to resemble the cross section of a frisbee or flying disc. When a flying disc spins in the air, the designed cross sectional concavity causes increased air pressure under the centre of the disc, causing lift for the disc to fly.Hummel, S.A. "Frisbee Flight Simulation and Throw Biomechanics." University of Missouri, Rolla Ph.D. Thesis. 1997. Accessed 2009-07-14. A snake continuously moves in lateral undulation to create the same effect of increased air pressure underneath its arched body to glide. Flying snakes are able to glide better than flying squirrels and other gliding animals, despite the lack of limbs, wings, or any other wing-like projections, gliding through the forest and jungle it inhabits with the distance being as great as 100 m.[tpl]cite book |last1=Ernst |first1=C.

Their ability to glide has been an object of interest for physicists and the United States Department of Defense in recent years,[ref]
