"Supernova Goes Pop," "Nobody's Real" and "When Worlds Collide."

==Album information==

Tonight the Stars Revolt! can be loosely considered a concept album. Although it doesn't tell a specific story, the songs have a cohesive theme, primarily oriented around campy science fiction reminiscent of the 1950s, coupled with nihilistic, apocalyptic messages, and paranoid, cyberpunk imagery.
Music critics and fans alike compare PM5K frontman Spider's fixation on bygone science fiction with older brother Rob Zombie's obsession with B-movie horror themes.  Both seem to share an affection for campy entertainment that influence their musical output, though Spider has since abandoned science fiction as the inspiration for Powerman 5000's sound and image. The CD booklet of Tonight the Stars Revolt! is also composed with science fiction imagery and text, similar to Zombie's horror-themed Hellbilly Deluxe, released the year prior.
Musically, the album bears similarity to Rob Zombie's industrial metal sound with catchy riffs and electronic elements. However, it also includes a cover of The Cars' "Good Times Roll" and "Watch the Sky for Me," a moody, lounge song with its entire melody taken from the track "One More Kiss, Dear" by Vangelis for the Blade Runner soundtrack.
