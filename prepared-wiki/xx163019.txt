==History==

According to Harrison County tax records, Lizana was settled by Henry Sabastian Lizana, from nearby DeLisle in the 1880s. The lumber boom in the area contributed to Lizana's success as an entrepreneur. Henry established a general store and post office near the logging railroad that once ran through the area. In the early 1920s, the logging industry declined. He deeded a small amount of his parcel of land to his nine children, and what remained was relinquished to the state due to unpaid taxes.
In 1901, Father Rene Sorin, also from DeLisle, oversaw the building of the first Catholic mission in the area, St. Ann Catholic Church,St. Ann Catholic Church website on land donated by Henry. The mission fell into disrepair, and in 1937 was relocated to its present location on Mississippi Highway 53.
From 1902 to 1906, the Gulf Coast Lumber Company operated the rail lines built in the area. The lines were built to transport the valuable long leaf pine trees being logged in the Lizana area to a sawmill Gulf Coast Lumber operated in nearby Lyman. In 1906 the Gulf Coast Lumber Company was purchased by Ingram-Day Lumber Company which would later be sold to Batson & Hatten Lumber Company on May 10, 1924.  Batson & Hatten discontinued operation of the Lyman mill in 1932.http://www.msrailroads.com/GulfCoastLbr.htm
