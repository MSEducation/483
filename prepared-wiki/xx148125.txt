==History==

Radio station 1510 AM first signed on in October, 1957 as KMOR in Littleton. Owned by Bob Rubin from 1960â€“65 and operated from above the theater at the Woodlawn Shopping Center, the format was country & western music. Years later, the station operated as KDKO Radio, was known as "Denver's Soul Radio" due to its rhythm & blues format, and broadcast from studios on Santa Fe Road, just south of County Line Road.
The KCKK callsign and country music format started out at 104.3 FM when Jefferson-Pilot (JP) acquired the signal. Eventually, JP did away with the staff at KYGO 1600 AM and started simulcasting KCKK programming at 1600 AM. When JP pulled the plug on KCKK at 104.3 FM, in favor of a smooth jazz format, KCKK moved exclusively to 1600 AM. KCKK 1600's last day came in mid-December 2006 when Lincoln Financial Media (which purchased Jefferson Pilot) announced that the signal at 1600 AM would be flipped to become Denver's new ESPN Radio affiliate, KEPN. Then, 1510 AM, which was airing an oldies format, took the KCKK callsign and became classic country as "Real Country".
In late July 2007, 1510 AM flipped to an all-sports format, operated by Mile High Sports, a multimedia sports-marketing and publishing company based in Denver.  The station features network programming from Sporting News Radio and a lineup of local hosts.  The sports talk format was briefly suspended and KCKK returned to "Real Country".  According to 100000watts.com, the change was due to the expiration of a local marketing agreement.  The "Mile High Sports" format remained on former sister station KSXT-AM 1570 AM in Loveland, Colorado as of August 21, 2007 and returned again to 1510 AM ten days later, on August 31.
On July 31, 2008 "Mile High Sports Radio" was announced as the new radio flagship for the Denver Nuggets basketball team, Colorado Avalanche hockey team, Colorado Mammoth, and Colorado Rapids.  The station also broadcasts the football and basketball programs at the Air Force Academy and syndicated National Football League games through the Sports USA Radio Network.  In 2008, it broadcast most games of the Mountain West Conference men's basketball tournament.  In June 2009, the station renewed its partnership with Kroenke Sports and Entertainment to remain the flagship station of the Nuggets, Avalanche, and Rapids.
In December 2013, KCKK and its translator on 93.7 FM were being sold to Hunt Broadcasting for $1.6-million. http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/125092/kckk-a-denver-sold?ref=rss
