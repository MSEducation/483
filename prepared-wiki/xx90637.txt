The European University Association (EUA) represents and supports more than 850 institutions of higher education in 47 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and exchange of information on higher education and research policies. Members of the Association are European universities involved in teaching and research, national associations of rectors and other organisations active in higher education and research.
EUA is the result of a merger between the Association of European Universities (CRE) and the Confederation of European Union Rectors' Conferences. The merger took place in Salamanca on 31 March 2001.
