PopCultured was a Canadian television program broadcast on The Comedy Network. The program featured stand-up comedian Elvira Kurt and other cast members poking fun at celebrities in the context of a mock newscast, in a format similar to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart or This Hour Has 22 Minutes.
The show began airing in 2005. Its full title was popCultured with Elvira Kurt, and it was often used to promote several shows on its host corporation's channels (CTV and the Comedy Network) in Canada.

==Reception==

The show was widely panned and due to poor ratings it was canceled after one season, in early 2006. Comedy Network removed its web site's message boards due to the huge number of complaints they received, and a number of petitions demanding the cancellation of PopCultured were circulated on the internet. However, it is unclear whether these petitions had any direct link to the cancellation of the show.
A 2005 poll on BestandWorst.com named PopCultured the worst TV show of all time.
