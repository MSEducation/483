[[East Anglian Waterways Association]]

CATEGORIES: Clubs and societies in England

The East Anglian Waterways Association is a waterway society and an umbrella organisation in East Anglia, England, UK.
The association was founded on 18 April 1958, and  it campaigns for the preservation, restoration and good management of the tidal and inland waterways in East Anglia. One of its early projects was an investigation into the complex legal status of the staithes or landing stages on the Norfolk Broads, which was carried out in the 1960s. The research paved the way for many of the staithes to be adopted by the Broads Authority, and retained as public access points to the waterways.Inland Waterways of Great Britain, (2009), Jane Cumberlidge, 8th Edition, Imray Norie Laurie and Wilson, ISBN 978-1-84623-010-3
For more than fifty years, EAWA has worked with other organisations to have the River Great Ouse reopened to Bedford, the purchase and restoration of Dilham Dyke on the Broads, and many other projects.
