[[Cycling in New York City]]

CATEGORIES: Cycling in New York City, Transportation in New York City, Cycling by city

Cycling in New York City is associated with mixed cycling conditions that include dense urban proximities, relatively flat terrain, congested roadways with "stop-and-go" traffic, and streets with heavy pedestrian activity. The city's large cycling population includes utility cyclists, such as delivery and messenger services; cycling clubs for recreational cyclists; and, increasingly, commuters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2009/11/09/count-on-it-nyc-bike-commuting-climbs-26-percent/ |title=Count on It: NYC Bike Commuting Climbs 26 Percent |work=streetsblog.org |first=Ben |last=Fried |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl]
While New York City developed the country's first bike path in 1894,[tpl]cite news |title=Expansion of Bike Lanes in New York Brings Backlash |newspaper=The New York Times |first=J. David |last=Goodman |quote=New York has a long relationship with the bicycle, with the first bike path in the country running along Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn as early as 1894.  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/nyregion/23bicycle.html |date=November 22, 2010[/tpl] and recent trends place the city "at the forefront of a national trend to make bicycling viable and safe," competing ideas of urban transportation have led to conflict, as well as ongoing efforts to balance the needs of cyclists, pedestrians, and cars.

==History==

The bicycle boom of the late 19th century had a strong impact in the area, and the City of Brooklyn was especially responsive, providing accommodation in Eastern Parkway, Ocean Parkway, and elsewhere. New York didn't produce as many bicycles as other cities, so imported many from elsewhere, including Freehold Township, New Jersey. As a spectator sport, six-day racing was popular and spurred the building of velodromes in suburbs including Washington Heights, Manhattan, and Jersey City, New Jersey. Weekly races were held in suburban roads, including Pelham Parkway, Bronx. The biggest races were in inner city locations, notably at the original Madison Square Garden which had been designed for cycle racing and at the time was located adjacent to Madison Square. The Olympic sport, Madison Racing, is named after cycle races that became popular at Madison Square Gardens.
Several of the middle 20th century parkway projects of Robert Moses included bike paths. However, when more people could afford cars, bicycling declined and the bikeways fell into disrepair. New bridges connecting Queens to The Bronx, or Brooklyn to Staten Island, did not provide for bicycles or pedestrians.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Late in the century, bicycling resurged. A narrow, physically separated bike lane in Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan had little success[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.transalt.org/newsroom/releases/1748 |title=Two Wheelers Take Back Sixth Avenue Bike Lane |publisher=Transportation Alternatives |date=December 30, 1998 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] and was eliminated but bike lanes on major bridges were created, refurbished, or improved, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and other agencies created the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway and other land bikeways.

==Utility cycling==

Delivery bikes are commonly used in New York for fast food deliveries over short distances, sometimes using mountain bikes outfitted with a lock box (for money), a wide carrier for larger loads such as pizza or other accessories. Electric bicycles are increasingly used for this service, their illegality being sporadically enforced.[tpl]cite news |title=Battery Power Gives Deliverymen a Boost, at a Cost |first=Corey |last=Kilgannon |first2=Jeffrey E. |last2=Singer |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/battery-power-gives-deliverymen-a-boost-at-a-cost/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 12, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] Bicycle messengers use narrower wheels to carry lighter loads short distances. Specialized cargo bicycles and tricycles carry heavier loads.
Pedicabs became commonplace at the turn of the 21st century, offering novel travel over short distances, including guided tours of Central Park. In April 2007 the New York City Council voted to limit the number of pedicabs to 325.[tpl]cite news |title=Pedicab Limit Withstands Mayor’s Veto |first=Jonathan P. |last=Hicks |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/nyregion/24council.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 24, 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] A court overturned the limit,[tpl]cite news |title=Court Strikes Down Pedicab Licensing Plan |first=Sewell |last=Chan |authorlink=Sewell Chan |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/court-strikes-down-pedicab-licensing-plan/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] later regulatory efforts concentrated on requirements for insurance and safety equipment[tpl]cite news |title=Stalled Plan to License Pedicabs Advances |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15pedicab.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] and in April 2011, new legislation tightened parking regulations and capped pedicab licenses at 850.[tpl]cite news|title=NY Legislation Caps Pedicabs at 850|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-states/ny-legislation-caps-pedicabs-at-850-55529.html|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=The Epoch Times|date=28 April 2011|author=Zack Stieber[/tpl]

==Bicycle sharing==

In 2007 the Department studied the prospects of a bicycle sharing system[tpl]cite news |title=In This Case, It’s O.K. to Take a Bike That’s Not Yours |first=Dalton |last=Walker |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/nyregion/10bike.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] and announced in 2011 that kiosks would be built for the service to begin in 2012.[tpl]cite news |title=The City and Bikes: Rubber Meets Road |first=Jason |last=Gay |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304070104576399972538343738.html |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] The project was slated to introduce 10,000 bikes that would be available from 600 stations made by Bixi and operated by Alta Bicycle Share,[tpl]cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/faq/|work=New York City Bike Share|publisher=The City of New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|year=2013[/tpl] the operators of similar schemes in other U.S. cities.

==Bikeways==

There are three types of bike lanes on New York City streets: Class I, Class II and Class III. Class I bike lanes are typically physically separated from vehicular/pedestrian paths. Class II bike lanes are simply marked with paint and signage, and lie between a parking lane and a traffic lane. Class III bike lanes are shared vehicular/bike lanes, usually only marked by signage.[tpl]cite web|title=Chapter 4:  Street Design|url=http://www.transalt.org/files/resources/blueprint/chapter4/chapter4b.html|work=Transportation Alternatives|publisher=Transportation Alternatives|accessdate=28 June 2013|date=1997–2009[/tpl] The majority of bike lanes in New York are Class II or Class III bike lanes.[tpl]cite web|title=New York City Bike Map 2013|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2013-nyc-bike-map.pdf|work=New York City Bike Map 2013|publisher=The City of New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|format=PDF[/tpl]
Most cycling is in Class II or Class III bike lanes, since most streets provide no separate facilities for bicycles. However, Class I bike lanes connect most neighborhoods. Those are in parks and Greenways, segregated from traffic. The Hudson River Greenway is so heavily used that it requires separation of the bikeway from pedestrians. Other parts of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway and the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway are less continuously segregated. An east-west Greenway runs through Pelham Bay Park and across the Bronx along Mosholu Parkway to Van Cortlandt Park where it connects to the South County Trailway. Others include foreshoreways along the north shore of Jamaica Bay, the south shores of Little Neck Bay and Flushing Bay and other locations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
As of February 2009, about [tpl]convert|170|mi[/tpl] of Class II bike lanes run in streets, and the network is growing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikenetwork.shtml |title=Bicycle Network and Bicycle Map |publisher=New York City Department of Transportation |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] Class II and Class III bike lanes are often blocked by trucks unloading and by double parked cars. A few, as in the westernmost block of Tillary Street between Adams Street and Cadman Plaza West in Brooklyn, replaces the parking lane and are separated from motor traffic by concrete barriers. The 8th and 9th Avenue bike lanes in Chelsea, Manhattan were rebuilt in late 2008 as Class II bike lanes between the curb and a new parking lane, and are expected to provide more safety.[tpl]cite news |title=Bloomberg's Big Pedal Push for Bike Lanes |first=Melissa |last=Klein |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/manhattan/item_0ZV1hhh9velLiVl00OcKUO |newspaper=New York Post |date=December 14, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl]  Similar layouts were used in the reconstructions of 1st and 2nd Avenues in 2010, and in that of Columbus Avenue in 2011.
On three Saturdays in August 2008, a route on the East Side of Manhattan from Brooklyn Bridge to 72nd Street along Lafayette Street, Park Avenue and other streets was cleared of motor traffic to allow easy non-motorised use as an experiment called "Summerstreets".[tpl]cite news |title=On 3 Days in August, City Will Try No-Car Zone |first=William |last=Neuman |first2=Fernanda |last2=Santos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/nyregion/17closing.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl]  It was repeated in 2009 [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml |title=Summer Streets |publisher=New York City |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] and became an annual event, including August 6, 13 and 20, 2011.
In mid-August 2008, two lanes of Broadway between 42nd Street and Herald Square were transformed into a pedestrian plaza and bike path, which were rearranged in May 2013.Broadway Boulevard IBroadway Boulevard II[tpl]cite news |title=Closing on Broadway: Two Traffic Lanes |first=William |last=Neuman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/nyregion/11broadway.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] In late May 2012, four one-way pairs of crosstown bike lanes in Midtown received preliminary approval.Crosstown Bike Lane Proposal|My Fox NY Jun 01, 2012 8:28

==Recreational==

Some parks, including Central Park and Prospect Park, ban or restrict motor vehicles during certain weekday hours and all weekend to promote bicycling. A company operates bike rental stations in several city parks[tpl]cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.bikeandroll.com/newyork/index.html|work=Bike and Roll New York City|publisher=Bike and Roll LLC|accessdate=28 June 2013|year=2008[/tpl] and local bike shops also rent them, especially in areas of tourism. Less formal operators work on street corners or out of the back of a truck or in parking garages. Additional services include paid guided tours.
Several organizations, including Five Borough Bicycle Club and Bike New York, conduct tours every weekend. Most are day trips for no fee;[tpl]cite web|title=Bike clubs: Join a free group ride in NYC|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/sport-fitness/bike-clubs-join-a-free-group-ride-in-nyc-cycling|work=Time Out New York|publisher=Time Out New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|author=Sloan Rollins|date=27 April 2012[/tpl] some larger or overnight tours require payment. New York City is host to several long annual recreational rides, including the Five Boro Bike Tour. New York Cycle Club and others specialize in fitness and speed. Bicycle track races run most summer weekends in Kissena Park and elsewhere. Road races are held on weekends and some weekday evenings at Prospect Park, Central Park, and Floyd Bennett Field.
New York City Department of Transportation distributes a free and annually updated bike map  through bike shops. The map shows Class I bike lanes in green, and Class II/Class III bike lanes in other colors. It shows the locations and names of bike shops and points of touristic interest. Shops that rent bikes are shown in red.

==Commuting==

Many New Yorkers live less than a dozen miles or 20 km from their job, and can be seen bicycle commuting over various bridges connecting Manhattan with the outer boroughs and along the Hudson or elsewhere in good weather. In 2008 the NYC Department of Transportation released a "screenline count report"[tpl]cite web|title=Bicycle Counts|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/nycbicyclescrct.shtml|work=New York City DOT|publisher=The City of New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|year=2013[/tpl] suggesting that commuter cycling had more than doubled since the turn of the century.
For mixed-mode commuting most suburban commuter rail stations provide free parking in racks, and some have bicycle lockers for security. Regulations on bicycles on trains vary by railroad and time of day; Metro-North and LIRR require a permit that can be obtained for free at Grand Central Terminal. New Jersey Transit also allows bicycles onboard trains en route to New York City but restricts them on rush hour trains. Bikes are allowed on New York City Subways at all hours, though it is sometimes difficult to fit a bike into a packed subway car. Rules against fastening bikes to subway property, including fences around street stairs, are enforced more rigorously than those concerning lampposts and other street furniture. Municipal bicycle stands are installed in many neighborhoods. Most are simple "bike staples" but a few, including one each at the northwest ends of Pulaski Bridge and Union Square are larger, with a roof. More are planned.[tpl]cite web|title=Bicyclists|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bicyclists.shtml|work=New York City DOT|publisher=The City of New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|year=2013[/tpl]
Due to traffic patterns and transport network geometries, mixed-mode bicycling-plus-subway can be the fastest way to commute, or to achieve transport within NYC, for many routes and times.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

In 2009, a local law created by the New York City Council went into effect, requiring commercial buildings with freight elevators to allow employees to transport their bikes on them up to tenant floors. The purpose of the bill was to allow access to indoor storage spaces to encourage commuting by cycling.[tpl]cite news |title=Council Bill Requires Buildings to Let Bikes In |first=J.

So far there has been limited demand by cyclists for paid off-street bicycle parking at these garages and lots.[tpl]cite news |title=You Can Park Your Bike, but at What Price? |first=J.

The non-profit organization Transportation Alternatives promotes bicycle commuting and bicycle friendly facilities to lessen the impact of cars on urban life. On its website, the organization states that is "working to make New York City’s neighborhoods safer and restore a vibrant culture of street life" and advocates "for safer, smarter transportation and a healthier city."[tpl]cite web|title=About|url=http://www.transalt.org/about|work=Transportation Alternatives|publisher=Transportation Alternatives|accessdate=28 June 2013|date=1997–2013[/tpl]

==Laws and rules==

A bicycle is treated similarly to a motorized vehicle under the law of the State of New York with several exceptions. No license is required to operate a bicycle. Cyclists must ride in the direction of traffic. On one-way streets 40 feet or wider, they may ride on either the left or right side. Children aged 13 years and under must wear a helmet. Adult cyclists must use hand signals, must only wear headphones in one ear,[tpl]cite web|title=Bike Smart|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/biketips.shtml|work=New York City DOT|publisher=The City of New York|accessdate=28 June 2013|year=2013[/tpl] must not ride on sidewalks, and must use lights at night (red in rear and white in front).[tpl]cite web |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$VAT1236$$@TXVAT01236+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=EXPLORER+&TOKEN=47331274+&TARGET=VIEW |title=Bicycling in New York State |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Bicycle Laws that Apply in New York City|url=http://www.bicycledefensefund.org/bikelaw.html|work=Freewheels Bicycle Defense Fund|publisher=Freewheels Bicycle Defense Fund|accessdate=28 June 2013[/tpl]

==Education==

Bike New York is an organization based in New York City that encourages cycling and bicycle safety. They host rides throughout the year, including the Five Boro Bike Tour, in order to fund their free bike education programs. With ten community bike education centers around all five boroughs of New York City, Bike New York is able to offer a full range of bike education programs for both children and adults

==Dangers and annoyances==

Being doored (colliding with the door of a car unexpectedly opened) is a prominent hazard.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/getdoored.asp |title=Get Doored |work=Word Spy |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] Many Class II/Class III bike lanes run in the door zone. While the law requires caution in opening car doors into traffic lanes, dooring remains common, and doored cyclists face injury and sometimes death. Cyclists must exercise caution, riding a door's length away from parked cars whenever practicable.
Approximately 20 cyclists are killed most years, usually by collision with a moving motor vehicle (including those who are knocked under wheels by a door). Some fatality locations are marked by white-painted ghost bikes. Traffic accidents kill approximately 160 pedestrians per year (about half as many as in the late 20th century) and a lesser number inside cars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newyorkinjuries.com/blog/?p=891 |title=Fatalities From Car/Auto Accidents In New York City Dropped To Lowest Level Since Records Started Being Kept In 1910 |publisher=Levine & Slavit |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-26[/tpl] In 2014 a new Mayor sought to bring these numbers to zero.
