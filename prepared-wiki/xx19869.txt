Arms control is a term for restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of weapons, especially weapons of mass destruction.[tpl]cite web |title=What Is Arms Control? |url=http://usforeignpolicy.about.com/od/defense/a/what-is-arms-control.htm |work=About.com, US Foreign Policy |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Barry Kolodkin |format=Article[/tpl]  Arms control is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such limitations upon consenting participants through international treaties and agreements, although it may also comprise efforts by a nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a non-consenting country.
On a national or community level, "arms control" can amount to programs to control civilians' access to weapons.[tpl]cite web |title=Gun Control |url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/crime/guns.shtml |work=Almanac of Policy Issues |publisher=http://www.policyalmanac.org |accessdate=21 May 2012[/tpl] As firearms are usually the primary focus of such efforts, the term "gun politics" is often used instead.[tpl]cite web |title=Gun Control Facts |url=http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp |work=Just Facts |publisher=Just Facts |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=James D.

==Enactment==

Arms control treaties and agreements are often seen as a way to avoid costly arms races which could prove counter-productive to national aims and future peace.[tpl]cite web |title=Arms Control |url=http://www.globalissues.org/issue/66/arms-control |work=Global Issues |publisher=http://www.globalissues.org |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Anup Shah |format=Article |date=6 May 2012[/tpl]  Some are used as ways to stop the spread of certain military technologies (such as nuclear weaponry or missile technology) in return for assurances to potential developers that they will not be victims of those technologies.  Additionally, some arms control agreements are entered to limit the damage done by warfare, especially to civilians and the environment, which is seen as bad for all participants regardless of who wins a war.
While arms control treaties are seen by many peace proponents as a key tool against war, by the participants, they are often seen as simply ways to limit the high costs of the development and building of weapons, and even reduce the costs associated with war itself.  Arms control can even be a way of maintaining the viability of military action by limiting those weapons that would make war so costly and destructive as to make it no longer a viable tool for national policy.

==Enforcement==

Enforcement of arms control agreements has proven difficult over time.  Most agreements rely on the continued desire of the participants to abide by the terms to remain effective.  Usually, when a nation no longer desires to abide by the terms, they usually will seek to either covertly circumvent the terms or to simply end their participation in the treaty.  This was seen in Washington Naval Treaty[tpl]cite web |title=CONFERENCE ON THE LIMITATION OF ARMAMENT, WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 12 1921-FEBRUARY 6, 1922. |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pre-war/1922/nav_lim.html |work=ibiblio |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |accessdate=21 May 2012[/tpl]  (and the subsequent London Naval Treaty[tpl]cite web |title=INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOR THE LIMITATION AND REDUCTION OF NAVAL ARMAMENT |url=http://www.microworks.net/pacific/road_to_war/london_treaty.htm |work=INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOR THE LIMITATION AND REDUCTION OF NAVAL ARMAMENT |publisher=http://www.microworks.net/pacific/road_to_war/london_treaty.htm |accessdate=21 May 2012[/tpl]), where most participants sought to work around the limitations, some more legitimately than others.[tpl]cite web |title=Naval Treaties: Born of the Second London Naval Treaty:A concise investigation of the qualitative limitations of capital ships 1936 – 1941 |url=http://www.bismarck-class.dk/miscellaneous/naval_treaties/born_of_the_second_london_naval_treaty.html |work=Bismarck & Tirpitz |publisher=John Asmussen |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=Peter Beisheim MA |format=Essay[/tpl]  The United States developed better technology to get better performance from their ships while still working within the weight limits, the United Kingdom exploited a loop-hole in the terms, the Italians misrepresented the weight of their vessels, and when up against the limits, Japan simply left the treaty. The nations which violated the terms of the treaty did not suffer great consequences for their actions.  Within little more than a decade, the treaty was abandoned. The Geneva Protocol[tpl]cite web |title=Geneva Protocol |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/geneva/intro.htm |work=FAS: Weapons of Mass Destruction |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=21 May 2012[/tpl]  has lasted longer and been more successful at being respected, but still nations have violated it at will when they have felt the need.  Enforcement has been haphazard, with measures more a matter of politics than adherence to the terms.  This meant sanctions and other measures tended to be advocated against violators primarily by their natural political enemies, while violations have been ignored or given only token measures by their political allies.[tpl]cite web |title=WMD: Law instead of lawless self help |url=http://www.blixassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/No37.pdf |work=Briefing paper 37 |publisher=The Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=Harald Muller |pages=Briefing paper |month=2005[/tpl]
More recent arms control treaties have included more stringent terms on enforcement of violations as well as verification.  This last has been a major obstacle to effective enforcement, as violators often attempt to covertly circumvent the terms of the agreements.  Verification is the process of determining whether or not a nation is complying with the terms of an agreement, and involves a combination of release of such information by participants[tpl]cite web |title=Chemical and Biological Weapons Status at a Glance |url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cbwprolif |work=Arms Control Today |publisher=Arms Control Association |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=Tom Z. Collina |author2=Daniel Salisbury (research assistant) |format=Briefing summary |date=August 2010[/tpl]  as well as some way to allow participants to examine each other to verify that information.[tpl]cite web |title=COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS FOR DISARMAMENT TREATIES |url=http://www.walterdorn.org/pub/27 |work=Walter Dorn |publisher=Verification Yearbook 2000 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |author=A. Walter Dorn and Douglas S. Scott |location=Verification Research, Training and Information Centre, London |chapter=15 |pages=229–247 |format=Article |year=2000[/tpl]   This often involves as much negotiation as the limits themselves, and in some cases questions of verification have led to the breakdown of treaty negotiations (for example, verification was cited as a major concern by opponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ultimately not ratified by the United States).[tpl]cite web |title=Comprehensive Nuclear Ban Treaty: Background and Current Developments |url=http://www.thereaganvision.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CRS-Comprehensive-Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty-Background-and-Current-Developments.pdf |work=CRS Report for Congress |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=17 May 2012 |author=Jonathan Medalia |format=Report |date=3 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Fukushima: Another reason to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/fukushima-another-reason-to-ratify-the-comprehensive-test-ban-treaty |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |accessdate=17 May 2012 |author=Lawrence J. Korb, Alexander H. Rothman |format=Article |date=23 March 2011[/tpl]
Nations may remain in a treaty while seeking to break the limits of that treaty as opposed to simply withdrawing from it. This is for two major reasons. To openly defy an agreement, even if one withdraws from it, often is seen in a bad light politically and can carry diplomatic repercussions. Additionally, if one remains in an agreement, competitors who are also participatory may be held to the limitations of the terms, while withdrawal releases your opponents to make the same developments you are making, limiting the advantage of that development.

==Theory of Arms Control==

Scholars and practitioners such as John Steinbruner, Jonathan Dean or Stuart Croft worked extensively on the theoretical backing of arms control. Arms control is meant to break the security dilemma. It aims at mutual security between partners and overall stability (be it in a crisis situation, a grand-strategy, or stability to put an end to an arms race). Other than stability, arms control comes with cost reduction and damage limitation. It is differs from disarmament since the maintenance of stability might allow for mutually controlled armament and does not take a peace-without-weapons-stance. Nevertheless, arms control is a defensive strategy in principle, since transparency, equality, and stability do not fit into an offensive strategy.

==History==

===Pre-19th century===

One of the first recorded attempts in arms control was a set of rules laid down in ancient Greece by the Amphictyonic Leagues. Rulings specified how war could be waged, and breaches of this could be punished by fines or by war.
There were few recorded attempts to control arms during the period between this and the rise of the Roman Catholic Church. The church used its position as a trans-national organization to limit the means of warfare. The 989 Peace of God (extended in 1033) ruling protected noncombatants, agrarian and economic facilities, and the property of the church from war. The 1027 Truce of God also tried to prevent violence between Christians. The Second Lateran Council in 1139 prohibited the use of crossbows against other Christians, although it did not prevent its use against non-Christians.
The development of firearms led to an increase in the devastation of war. The brutality of wars during this period led to efforts to formalize the rules of war, with humane treatment for prisoners of war or wounded, as well as rules to protect non-combatants and the pillaging of their property. However during the period until the beginning of the 19th century few formal arms control agreements were recorded, except theoretical proposals and those imposed on defeated armies.
One treaty which was concluded was the Strasbourg Agreement of 1675. This is the first international agreement limiting the use of chemical weapons, in this case, poison bullets. The treaty was signed between France and The Holy Roman Empire

===19th century===

The 1817 Rush-Bagot Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom was the first arms control treaty of what can be considered the modern industrial era, leading to the demilitarization of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain region of North America.[tpl]cite web |title=British-American Diplomacy Exchange of Notes Relative to Naval Forces on the American Lakes |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/br1817m.asp |work=The Avalon Project |publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library |accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]  This was followed by the 1871 Treaty of Washington which led to total demilitarisation.
The industrial revolution led to the increasing mechanisation of warfare, as well as rapid advances in the development of firearms; the increased potential of devastation (which was seen in the battlefields of World War I) led to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia calling together the leaders of 26 nations for the First Hague Conference in 1899. The Conference led to the signing of the Hague Convention (of 1899) that led to rules of declaring and conducting warfare as well as the use of modern weaponry, and also led to the setting up of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

===20th century to 1945===

A Second Hague Conference was called in 1907 leading to additions and amendments to the original 1899 agreement.[tpl]cite web |title=Declaration (XIV) Prohibiting the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons. The Hague, 18 October 1907. |url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.NSF/INTRO/245?OpenDocument |work=Humainitarian Law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl]  A Third Hague Conference was called for 1915, but this was abandoned due to the First World War.
After the World War I, the League of Nations was set up which attempted to limit and reduce arms.[tpl]cite web |title=Arms Control and Disarmament - Between the world wars, 1919–1939 |url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/Arms-Control-and-Disarmament-Between-the-world-wars-1919-1939.html |work=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl]  However the enforcement of this policy was not effective. Various naval conferences such as the Washington Naval Conference were held during the period between the First and Second World Wars to limit the number and size of major warships of the five great naval powers.
The 1925 Geneva Conference led to the banning of chemical weapons (as toxic gases) during war as part of the Geneva Protocol. The 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, whilst ineffective, attempted for "providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy".[tpl]cite web |title=Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm |work=Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928 |publisher=The Avalon Project |accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl]

===Since 1945===

After World War II, the United Nations was set up as a body to promote world peace.[tpl]cite web |title=History of the UN |url=http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/ |work=United Nations |publisher=http://www.un.org |accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl] The United States proposed the Baruch Plan in 1946 as a way to impose stringent international control over the nuclear fuel cycle and thereby avert a global nuclear arms race, but the Soviet Union rejected the proposal and negotiations failed. Following President Eisenhower's 1953 Atoms for Peace speech to the UN General Assembly, the International Atomic Energy Agency was set up in 1957 to promote peaceful uses of nuclear technology and apply safeguards against the diversion of nuclear material from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons. The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was signed to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons technology to countries outside the five that already possessed them: the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China.Council on Foreign Relations: Global Governance Monitor on Nonproliferation, available at http://www.cfr.org/publication/18985/
The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the United States and Soviet Union in the late 1960s/early 1970s led to further weapons control agreements. The SALT I talks led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an Interim Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement (see SALT I), both in 1972. The SALT II talks started in 1972 leading to agreement in 1979. Due to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan the United States never ratified the treaty, however the agreement was honoured by both sides.
The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed between the United States and Soviet Union in 1987 and ratified in 1988, leading to an agreement to destroy all missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers.[tpl]cite web |title=Seiitsu Tachibana, "Much ado about something : The factors that induced Reagan and Gorbachev to conclude the INF Treaty" |url=http://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/metadb/up/kiyo/hps/11/hps_11_151.pdf |work=Hiroshima Peace Science, Vol.11 |publisher=Nagasaki Institute of Applied Science |accessdate=17 May 2012 |author=Seiitsu Tachibana |page=Hirospage.151–182 |year=1998[/tpl]
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention was signed banning the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.[tpl]cite web |title=Articles of the Chemical Weapons Convention |url=http://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/articles/ |work=Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons |publisher=OPCW |accessdate=17 May 2012[/tpl]
The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties were signed, as START I and START II, by the US and Soviet Union, further restricting weapons.[tpl]cite web |title=Nuclear Treaty: A Guide to Disarmament |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/start-nuclear-weapons-treaty-guide-disarmament/story?id=12469644#.T7VB19kZHIU |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures. Yahoo! - ABC News Network |accessdate=17 May 2012 |author=KIRIT RADIA |format=News article |date=24 December 2010[/tpl]  This was further moved on by the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, which was in turn superseded by the New START Treaty.
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1996 banning all nuclear explosions in all environments, for military or civilian purposes, but it has not entered into force due to the non-ratification of eight specific states.[tpl]cite web |title=Nuclear Testing Is an Acceptable Risk for Arms Control |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nuclear-testing-is-an-acceptable-risk |work=Scientific American |publisher=Scientific American, a Division of Nature America, Inc. |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=Article |date=2 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=What is the CTBT? |url=http://www.ctbto.org/specials/who-we-are/?Fsize=xhczayqbmdyc |work=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Organization (CTBTO) |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Organization (CTBTO) |accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl]
