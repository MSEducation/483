Todd "GoGo" Gogulski is a cycling TV commentator for NBC Universal Sports and Versus and a former professional road racer.

==Early life and early career==

He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1962, but grew up in northern California and Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he first raced his bike in the Santa Fe Hill Climb. After racing locally for Gardenschwartz Sports (1981) and Strings ‘n Spokes (1982), he joined Ten Speed Drive (1983–86), for whom he won the National Team Time Trial Championship in 1986 (with Kent Bostick, Carl Maxon, and Andy Paulin), just shy of setting the national record.

==Later career==

Subsequently, he raced for four years under teams directed by Len Pettyjohn, with sponsors Lowenbrau (1987), Crest (1988), and the powerhouse American squad Coors Light (1989–90), where he was teammates with Greg LeMond. In 1991, he joined Subaru Montgomery, directed by Eddie Borysewicz, where he was teammates with Lance Armstrong; Subaru Montgomery later became the U.S. Postal Team. Following several seasons of injuries and declining results, he retired from racing in 1992.
He raced for the US National Team in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. In 1985, he represented the US at the amateur Giro d'Italia and in 1987 at the Peace Race in Eastern Europe, and in his career had over 100 victories.
In the late 1990s, after a hiatus from the sport, he worked in PR for a start-up bicycle tire company, and then shifted into promotions for the Saturn Cycling Team, announcing their Cyberbike events. In 2006, he began doing stage announcing for bicycle races, with ongoing commenting at Philly Week, Redlands, the National Championships, the Tour of Utah, and numerous others.

==Television==

In 2009, he joined the NBC Universal Sports cycling TV commentary team with Steve Schlanger, with whom he covers the Tour of the Basque Country, the Giro d'Italia, the Vuelta a España, the World Road Championships, Milan – San Remo, and others. In 2011, he joined the Versus Tour de France TV broadcasting team alongside Bob Roll, Phil Liggett, Paul Sherwen, and Liam McHugh.  He currently lives in Davis, California.
