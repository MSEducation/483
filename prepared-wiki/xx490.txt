==Politics==

The People's Republic of China is one of the world's few remaining socialist states openly endorsing communism (see Ideology of the Communist Party of China).

===Communist Party===

The country is ruled by the Communist Party of China (CPC), whose power is enshrined in China's constitution. The Chinese electoral system is hierarchical, whereby local People's Congresses are directly elected, and all higher levels of People's Congresses up to the National People's Congress (NPC) are indirectly elected by the People's Congress of the level immediately below.Article 97 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China The political system is decentralized, and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/14482/communist_party_of_china.html |title=CFR.org |publisher=CFR.org |accessdate=27 April 2010[/tpl] There are other political parties in China, referred to in China as democratic parties, which participate in the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).[tpl]cite web|title=Democratic Parties|url=http://english.people.com.cn/data/China_in_brief/Political_Parties/Democratic%20Parties.html|work=People's Daily|accessdate=8 December 2013[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

The People's Republic of China has administrative control over 22 provinces and considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province, although Taiwan is currently and independently governed by the Republic of China, which disputes the PRC's claim.Gwillim Law (2 April 2005). Provinces of China. Retrieved 15 April 2006. China also has five subdivisions officially termed autonomous regions, each with a designated minority group; four municipalities; and two Special Administrative Regions (SARs), which enjoy a degree of political autonomy. These 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities can be collectively referred to as "mainland China", a term which usually excludes the SARs of Hong Kong and Macau.  None of these divisions are recognized by the ROC government, which claims the entirety of the PRC's territory.

===Foreign relations===

The PRC has diplomatic relations with 171 countries and maintains embassies in 162.[tpl]cite web|title=Background Note: China|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/18902.htm|work=Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=10 March 2011[/tpl] Its legitimacy is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.Chang, Eddy (22 August 2004).

Under its interpretation of the One-China policy, Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, especially in the matter of armament sales. Political meetings between foreign government officials and the 14th Dalai Lama are also opposed by China, as the latter considers Tibet to be formally part of China.
Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of "harmony without uniformity", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[tpl]Cite book|last=Keith|first=Ronald C.|title=China from the inside out – fitting the People's republic into the world|publisher=PlutoPress |pages=135–136[/tpl] This policy may have led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran.[tpl]cite news|title=An Authoritarian Axis Rising?|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/06/an-authoritarian-axis-rising/|newspaper=The Diplomat|date=29 June 2012[/tpl] China has a close economic and military relationship with Russia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/china-russia-launch-largest-ever-joint-military-exercise/a-16931106|title=China, Russia launch largest ever joint military exercise|work=Deutsche Welle|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013[/tpl] and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-18327632|title=Energy to dominate Russia President Putin's China visit|publisher=BBC|date=5 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/world/middleeast/russia-and-china-veto-un-sanctions-against-syria.html|title=Friction at the U.N. as Russia and China Veto Another Resolution on Syria Sanctions|work=New York Times|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=15 November 2012|first=Rick|last=Gladstone[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21911842|title=Xi Jinping: Russia-China ties 'guarantee world peace'|publisher=BBC|date=23 March 2013|accessdate=23 March 2013[/tpl]

====Trade relations====

In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; China's Quest for Asia. Policy Review. December 2005 and January 2006. Issue No. 134. Retrieved 22 April 2006. The EAS, which includes ASEAN Plus Three, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics. China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001.
In 2000, the United States Congress approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.[tpl]cite news|title=Clinton signs China trade bill|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090505165947/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|archivedate=5 May 2009|date=10 October 2000[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market."US trade gap widens on increased Chinese imports".

===Sociopolitical issues and reform===

The Chinese democracy movement, social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, political freedom is still tightly restricted. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[tpl]cite book|first=Guy |last=Sorman |year= 2008 |title= Empire of Lies: The Truth About China in the Twenty-First Century |pages=46, 152 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=aRaLevXMZf4C&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2009/china |title=World Report 2009: China|publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl] Censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet,"China Requires Internet Users to Register Names".

==Economy==

As of 2013, China has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, totalling approximately US$9.3253 trillion according to the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China. If purchasing power parity (PPP) is taken into account (US$12.405 trillion in 2012, US$14.9614 trillion in 2013), China's economy is again second only to the United States. In 2013, its PPP GDP per capita was US$10,253, while nominal GDP per capita was US$6,853. Both cases put China behind around ninety countries (out of 183 countries on the IMF list) in global GDP per capita rankings.

===Economic history and growth===

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally planned economy. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market-oriented mixed economy under one-party rule. Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |title=China is already a market economy—Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia|publisher=EastDay.com |year=2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl] and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism."Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives".

After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement.

Classical Chinese was the written standard in China for thousands of years and allowed for written communication between speakers of various unintelligible languages and dialects in China. Written vernacular Chinese, or baihua, is the written standard, based on the Mandarin dialect and first popularized in Ming Dynasty novels. It was adopted, with significant modifications, during the early 20th century as the national standard. Classical Chinese is still part of the high school curriculum, and is thus intelligible to some degree to many Chinese. Since their promulgation by the government in 1956, Simplified Chinese characters have become the official standardized written script used to write the Chinese language within mainland China, supplanting the use of the earlier Traditional Chinese characters.

The Ministry of Health, together with its counterparts in the provincial health bureaux, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population.[tpl]cite web|title=Ministry of Health|url=http://english.gov.cn/2005-10/09/content_75326.htm|publisher=GOV.cn|accessdate=28 November 2013[/tpl] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly due to better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[tpl]cite news|title=China's $124 Billion Health-Care Plan Aims to Boost Consumption|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aXFagkr3Dr6s|newspaper=Bloomberg L.P.|date=22 January 2009[/tpl] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[tpl]cite news|title=Great Progress, but More Is Needed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/01/is-china-facing-a-health-care-crisis/chinas-health-care-reform-far-from-sufficient|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 November 2011[/tpl] In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals, but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications.[tpl]cite news|last=Barboza|first=David|title=2,000 Arrested in China in Counterfeit Drug Crackdown|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/2000-arrested-in-china-in-crackdown-on-counterfeit-drugs.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=5 August 2012|accessdate=23 March 2013[/tpl]

==Culture==

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han Dynasty.[tpl]cite book|title=China: Understanding Its Past|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=29[/tpl] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective. Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[tpl]cite journal|title=Historical and Contemporary Exam-driven Education Fever in China|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17–33 |url=http://suen.educ.psu.edu/~hsuen/pubs/KEDI%20Yu.pdf[/tpl]
The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of feudalism". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like Peking opera,[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn|title=Tour Guidebook: Beijing|publisher=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl] were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.
