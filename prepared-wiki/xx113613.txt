[[2009 Formula One season]]

CATEGORIES: 2009 in Formula One, Formula One seasons

The 2009 Formula One season was the 60th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 2009 FIA Formula One World Championship which was contested over 17 events commencing with the [tpl]F1 GP|2009|Australian[/tpl] on 29 March and ending with the inaugural [tpl]F1 GP|2009|Abu Dhabi[/tpl] on 1 November.
Jenson Button and Brawn GP secured the Drivers and Constructor Championship titles respectively in the Brazilian Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season. It was both Button and Brawn's first Championship success, Brawn becoming the first team to win the Constructors Championship in their debut season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8289217.stm |title=Brawn win title in debut F1 year|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2009-11-01| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091021043626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8289217.stm| archivedate= 21 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Button was the tenth British driver to win the championship, and following Lewis Hamilton's success in 2008 it was the first time the Championship had been won by English drivers in consecutive seasons, and the first time since Graham Hill (1968) and Jackie Stewart (1969) that consecutive championships have been won by British drivers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12538_5637133,00.html|title=Great Button!|date=2009-10-18|work=Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|accessdate=2009-10-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091020032033/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12538_5637133,00.html| archivedate= 20 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Also notable was the success of Red Bull Racing, as well as the poor performance of McLaren and Ferrari compared to the previous season.
Ten teams participated in the Championship after several rule changes were implemented by the FIA to cut costs to try to minimise the effect of the global financial crisis. There were further changes to try to improve the on-track spectacle with the return of slick tyres, changes to aerodynamics and the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) presenting some of the biggest changes in Formula One regulations for several decades.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.planet-f1.com/story/0,18954,3213_4907252,00.html |title=Newey: Biggest rule changes since 1983 |publisher=planet-F1.com |date=2009-02-09| accessdate= 20 July 2010 [/tpl]
The Brawn team, formed as a result of a management buyout of the Honda team, won six of the first seven races, their ability to make the most of the new regulations being a deciding factor in the Championship. The Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari teams caught up in an unpredictable second half of the season, with the season being the first time since [tpl]f1|2005[/tpl] that all participating teams had scored World Championship points. Sebastian Vettel and Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello were his main challengers over the season, winning six races between them to finish in second and third respectively.

==Background==

FIA President Max Mosley announced dramatic rule changes for the 2009 season in a bid to improve the spectacle of the sport, with the cars undergoing major changes in an effort to increase overtaking. The design changes significantly altered the design of the cars, incorporating wider and lower front wings, taller and narrower rear wings, and a reduction on aerodynamic bodywork. Also introduced were slick tyres and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, as well as implementing cost-cutting measures in a response to the rising costs of competing.[tpl]cite news |title=FIA confirms cost-cutting plans |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/12/8773.html |work=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration Ltd.|accessdate=2010-01-28|date=2008-12-12[/tpl] These measures were not sufficient to prevent the withdrawal of the Honda team, who announced in December 2008 they would be leaving Formula One with immediate effect.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7766092.stm |title=Global crisis ends Honda F1 dream? |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-05|date=2008-12-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081205053059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7766092.stm| archivedate= 5 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72322 |title=Honda confirm immediate F1 pull out|work=Autosport.com |publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=2008-12-05|accessdate=2008-12-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081206183210/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72322| archivedate= 6 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] After a winter of uncertainty, it was confirmed on 5 March 2009 that the team would compete in the 2009 season as Brawn GP, with Mercedes engines, following a management buyout led by Team Principal Ross Brawn, and would retain the services of both Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello as drivers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7927488.stm|title=Honda team to return as Brawn GP|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-03-06|date=2009-03-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090308172959/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7927488.stm| archivedate= 8 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/73577 |title=Brawn GP takes over Honda Racing |work=Autosport.com |publisher=Haymarket Publications |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2009-03-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090309013033/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/73577| archivedate= 9 March 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Anthony Davidson, who competed for the Honda-backed Super Aguri team before their early withdrawal in 2008, joined Brawn as a test driver.

The Drivers' World Championship would be decided in the traditional manner of points scored after Bernie Ecclestone's idea that the driver who won the most races be declared as the champion was scrapped following protests from the Formula One Teams Association.

A major source of controversy throughout the winter season were the rear diffusers.

==Report==

The season opened at the [tpl]f1 gp|2009|Australian[/tpl], won by Jenson Button with team-mate Rubens Barrichello in second, giving the team a 1–2 on its début. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel had been running in second until he collided with BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica. The accident meant the race finished behind the Safety Car, with Toyota's Jarno Trulli eventually classified third despite McLarens false protest he had illegally overtaken Lewis Hamilton.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7978186.stm|title=Hamilton loses Aussie GP points|date=2009-04-02|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-10-23[/tpl] Reigning champion Hamilton was disqualified from the Australian race for lying to the stewards and at the following Malaysian Grand Prix there were reports he was on the verge of quitting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6037246.ece|title=Lewis Hamilton wanted to quit over Melbourne lies |date=2009-04-05 |publisher=The Times|accessdate=2009-10-23|location=London|first=Mark|last=Hughes[/tpl] The race was equally dramatic, being stopped because of monsoon-like conditions, meaning only half points were awarded for only the fifth time in F1 history. Button mastered the changing conditions for his second win, while quick starting Nico Rosberg dropped to eighth when the race was stopped.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6039351.ece|title=Jenson Button storms to second hit with victory at Thunder Road|date=2009-04-09|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2009-10-23|location=London|first1=Edward|last1=Gorman|first2=Kuala|last2=Lumpur[/tpl] In the interval between races, the controversial double diffusers, used by Brawn, Williams and Toyota, were declared legal by the FIA, ending the fight over their use.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7996698.stm|title=Court rules Button's car is legal|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2009-04-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090414182036/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7996698.stm| archivedate= 14 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Chinese race also took place in wet conditions, with the rain throughout the duration of the race necessitating a safety car start and causing several accidents. Vettel led team-mate Mark Webber to Red Bull's first win in Formula One, ahead of the two Brawns and McLarens.
Dry conditions at Bahrain saw the Toyota team gain the front of the grid, but Button managed to fight up from a fourth-place start, and overtook race leader Timo Glock on his first pit stop. Hamilton and Räikkönen, in fourth and sixth respectively, gave their 2008 championship winning teams the best finishes of a disappointing season start.[tpl]cite web|title=Button makes it three wins from four in Bahrain|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/4/9266.html|work=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One Administration|date=2009-04-26|accessdate=2011-07-06[/tpl] The [tpl]f1 gp|2009|Spanish[/tpl] was a battle between the Brawn team-mates, with Barrichello getting ahead of polesitter Button while a first lap incident forced the retirement of four drivers.

Button won in dominant fashion at Monaco, leading the majority of the race from pole position ahead of his team-mate Barrichello and Räikkönen, who scored Ferrari's first podium in 2009. At the [tpl]f1 gp|2009|Turkish[/tpl] Vettel started on pole but lost the position to Button on the first lap. Button went on to win, followed by Webber and a closely pursuing Vettel. Barrichello's car developed a gearbox problem, and incidents with Heikki Kovalainen and Adrian Sutil gave Brawn's first retirement of the season. By winning six out of the first seven races, Button had opened up a 26 point lead on his team-mate, with Vettel a further six points behind.[tpl]cite web|last=Chaney|first=Sean|title=Brilliant Button on top in Turkey|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8087873.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2009-06-07|accessdate=2011-10-27[/tpl]
The British Grand Prix was seen as a turning point, being dominated by Red Bull with Vettel leading home Webber, in dry conditions. Button was not on the podium for the first time this season, finishing sixth. Red Bull also dominated the following German Grand Prix with Webber taking his first pole and race win, despite being given a drive through penalty. Ferrari were also showing signs of improvement, Felipe Massa finishing third in what would be his final race of the season. He was hospitalised after being hit on the helmet by a flying spring when he was travelling at 162 mph in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix.[tpl]cite journal|date=30 July 2009|title=How it happened|journal=Autosport |publisher=Haymarket Publications|volume=197|issue=5|page=p. 13|accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] The accident overshadowed the race, with a lightly-fueled Fernando Alonso on pole retiring early in the race, which was won by Lewis Hamilton.

==Race fixing controversy==

In a scandal dubbed "Crashgate" by the media, allegations of race-fixing during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix emerged during the second half of the 2009 season from former Renault driver Nelson Piquet, Jr. Over the course of the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix, Piquet, who had been sacked weeks earlier by Renault, claimed he was asked to crash at the Singapore race in a strategy designed to aid teammate and eventual race winner Fernando Alonso. Renault were handed a two-year suspended ban from the sport after the FIA World Motor Sport Council decided the team's managing director, Flavio Briatore and its executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds had asked Piquet to crash. Both had left the team before the WMSC hearing, where they were given life and five-year suspensions respectively. It had been rumoured Renault were prepared to quit the sport at the end of the 2009 season had the team been heavily punished,[tpl]cite web|title=F1 awaits Renault's race-fixing verdict|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78764|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|work=autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Publications|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5k5bpyw72|archivedate=2009-09-26|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-09-24[/tpl] but the FIA found Briatore and Symonds solely to blame and chose to suspend Renault's ban.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78770|title=Renault given two-year suspended ban|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|work=autosport.com|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl]
