</ref> Rudolf Diesel states, "In 1900 a small Diesel engine was exhibited by the Otto company which, on the suggestion of the French Government, was run on [[wikt:arachide|Arachide]] oil, and operated so well that very few people were aware of the fact.  The motor was built for ordinary oils, and without any modification was run on vegetable oil."  Diesel went on to say that "I have recently repeated these experiments on a large scale with full success and entire confirmation of the results formerly obtained."<ref name="Chalkley1912pp4-5">

==Patent dispute with Herbert Akroyd Stuart==

Akroyd-Stuart's compression ignition [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] engine (as opposed to spark-ignition) was patented two years earlier than Diesel's similar engine; Diesel's patentable idea was to increase the pressure. Due to the lower pressures used, the hot bulb engine, with an internal pressure of about [tpl]convert|600|kPa|psi|0[/tpl],[tpl]Citation | last = Wrangham | first = D.A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Theory & Practice of Heat Engines | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1956 | location = | nopp = 1 | pages = p. 664 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = [/tpl] as opposed to the diesel engine's c. [tpl]convert|3500|kPa|psi|0[/tpl], had only about a 12% thermal efficiency versus more than 50% for some large Diesels. Details of the claim, that a patent submitted by Herbert Akroyd Stuart pre-dated that of Rudolf Diesel, may be found under the name of that inventor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
The high compression and thermal efficiency is what distinguishes the patent granted to Diesel from a hot bulb engine patent.
