[[Oregon's congressional districts]]

CATEGORIES: Congressional districts of Oregon, Politics of Oregon

The U.S. state of Oregon has had five United States congressional districts since 1982, when the Fifth District was added. Boundaries were redrawn following the population changes to each district as determined by the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Although early projections suggested that Oregon might gain a sixth congressional district as a result of the 2010 Census, the state's population was about 42,000 people short of gaining a new district.
