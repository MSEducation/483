The Ren & Stimpy Show, often simply referred to as Ren & Stimpy, is an American animated television series, created by Canadian animator John Kricfalusi. The show premiered on August 11, 1991, on Nickelodeon as part of its Nicktoons block along with Rugrats and Doug. The series focuses on the titular characters: Ren Höek, an emotionally unstable chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a good-natured, dimwitted cat. The show ran for five seasons on the network. The show has received critical acclaim and developed a cult following during and after its run, while some critics credit it along with The Simpsons for leading the way for satirical animated shows like Beavis and Butt-head and South Park, and playing a significant role in television animation. Throughout its run, The Ren & Stimpy Show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, and violence which were rare for television animation of the time. This controversy contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. A spin-off for adult audiences, Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon", aired in 2003 on Spike, but was cancelled soon after its debut.
In the United Kingdom reruns of the series is shown on Nicktoons and 4Music.
The show was such a hit, it had vintage production music albums, music videos, VHS tapes, a UMD, a Laserdisk, and DVDs.

==Characters==

Ren Höek is a hot-tempered, "asthma-hound" Chihuahua.[tpl]cite web | author=Martin "Dr. Toon" Goodman | title=Cartoons Aren't Real!

When Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi, Billy West, already the voice of Stimpy, took the role using a combination of Burl Ives, Kirk Douglas and a slight "south of the border accent" for the rest of the Nickelodeon run.[tpl]cite web | author=J.

Ren and Stimpy play various roles, from outer-space explorers to Old West horse thieves to nature-show hosts,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/ren_stimpy/episode.html | title=The Not-So-Official Ren & Stimpy Episode Guide | author=Nick Sayer, Norman Sippel | date=April 15, 1994 | accessdate=2010-10-20[/tpl] and usually the duo were constantly at odds with each other. While the show was sometimes set in the present day, the show's crew tended to avoid "contemporary" jokes that reference current events.
The show features a host of supporting characters; some only appear in a single episode, while others are recurring characters, who occasionally appear in different roles. Some of the supporting characters factor directly into the storyline, while others make brief cameos. Other characters, such as Mr. Horse, are exclusively cameo-based, appearing in many episodes in scenes that have little bearing on the plot, as a running gag.[tpl]cite web | author=Jon Drukman | title=Interview with Chris Savino | url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.ren-n-stimpy/msg/c6f96c3e0d800adb | date=February 8, 1992 | accessdate=2010-12-26 | work=X Magazine, issue 10[/tpl] Some notable artists and performers who voiced incidental characters on the show are Frank Zappa, Randy Quaid, Gilbert Gottfried, Rosie O'Donnell, Dom DeLuise, Phil Hartman, Mark Hamill, Alan Young, Frank Gorshin and Tommy Davidson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101178/epcast|title=The Ren & Stimpy Show (1991) episode cast|work=IMDb|accessdate=2010-10-20[/tpl]

==Development and reception==

===Conception===

According to cartoonist Bill Wray, John Kricfalusi created the characters Ren and Stimpy around 1978 for "personal amusement" during his time in Sheridan College.[tpl]cite web |url=http://comics122.blogspot.com/2006/11/bill-wray.html |title=Bill Wray, interview |author=Charles S. Novinskie |year=1993 |work=David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview issue 122 |accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl] He was inspired to create Ren by an Elliott Erwitt photograph, printed on a postcard, called "New York City, 1946", showing a sweatered chihuahua at a woman's feet. Stimpy's design was inspired by a Tweety Bird cartoon called A Gruesome Twosome where the cats in the animation had big noses.Ren and Stimpy: In the Beginning featurette, The Ren & Stimpy Show: The Complete First and Second Seasons DVD [tpl]ASIN|B0002NY8XA[/tpl] When Nickelodeon approached Kricfalusi, he presented three shows, among them a variety show titled Our Gang or Your Gang, with a live action host presenting different cartoons, each cartoon parodying a different genre. Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the children in Your Gang, serving as a parody of the "cat and dog genre". Vanessa Coffey, Nickelodeon's Vice President of Animation Production, was dissatisfied by the other projects but did like Ren and Stimpy, singling them out for their own show.

===Spümcø (1991–93)===

The show's pilot began production in 1989, after Kricfalusi pitched and sold The Ren & Stimpy Show to Nickelodeon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/arts/television-ren-and-stimpy-s-triumphant-return.html?pagewanted=2 |title=Ren and Stimpy's Triumphant Return |author=Andy Meisler |date=August 16, 1992 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-12-26[/tpl] The pilot was done by Kricfalusi's own animation company, Spümcø, and screened at film festivals for several months before the show was announced in Nickelodeon's 1991 line-up.[tpl]cite web |url=http://archive.wgnradio.com:8080/ramgen/wgnam/shows/digilio_nick/audio/kricfalusi030819nd.rm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ibioIChV |archivedate=July 28, 2009 |title=John K interview |author=Nick Digilio |work=WGN Radio |accessdate=2010-01-17[/tpl] The first episode of the show premiered on August 11, 1991 alongside Doug and Rugrats. Spümcø continued to produce the show for the next two years while encountering issues with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices. The show was noted for its lack of early merchandising;[tpl]citation|title=Creating Ren and Stimpy (1992)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JWywnr1dNucC|author=Wheeler W. Dixon|year=2001|work=Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema|publisher=SIU Press|pages=82–94[/tpl] Wray cites the initial lack of merchandise as "the unique and radical thing" about The Ren & Stimpy Show, as no toy company planned ahead for any merchandise for the show, and Nickelodeon did not want to use "over-exploitive" merchandising.
Kricfalusi described his early period with Nickelodeon as being "simple", as he got along with Coffey, the sole executive of the program. When another executive was added, he wanted to alter or discard some of the Ren & Stimpy episodes, but Kricfalusi says the episodes stayed intact since he did a "trade" with Coffey: he would have some "really crazy" episodes in exchange for some "heart-warming" episodes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/dvd/features/renandstimpy/interview.asp|title=The Animated Adventures of John K.|author=Troy Rogers|publisher='UGO'|accessdate=February 16, 2009[/tpl] According to Kricfalusi, The Ren & Stimpy Show was the "safest project he ever worked on" while explaining the meaning of "safe" as "spend a third of what they spend now per picture, hire proven creative talent, and let them entertain". He estimated Spümcø's run of The Ren & Stimpy Show cost around $6,000,000 to produce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2007/08/do-all-bland-movies-make-profits.html|title=Do All Bland Movies Make Profits?|author=John Kricfalusi|authorlink=John Kricfalusi[/tpl]
The show received mixed reviews. Terry Thoren, former CEO and president of Klasky Csupo, said that Kricfalusi "tapped into an audience that was a lot hipper than anybody thought. He went where no man wanted to go before – the caca, booger humor".Zimmerman, Kevin. "Not just for kids anymore" Daily Variety. March 23, 1995. The Morning Call called it "high voltage yuks and industrial-strength weirdness".[tpl]citation|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1992-12-18/features/2881277_1_ren-stimpy-comic-book-john-kricfalusi|work=The Morning Call|date=December 18, 1992|author=Jonathan Valania|title=Ren & Stimpy Creator Isn't Laughing At Comic Book[/tpl]  Even as the show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon,[tpl]Cite book | last1 = Lawson | first1 = Tim  | first2 = Alisa | last2 = Persons | title = The magic behind the voices: a who's who of cartoon voice actors | publisher = Univ.

Nickelodeon later asked the new studio to make it lighter and less frightening. Kricfalusi cites his dismissal primarily to the episode Man's Best Friend, which features a violent climax where Ren brutally assaults George Liquor with an oar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mag.awn.com/?ltype=pageone&article_no=2214 |title=Dr. Toon interviews John Kricfalusi | author=Martin Goodman |date=September 1, 2004 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=Animation World Magazine[/tpl]

===Games Animation (1993–95)===

Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi's contract in late September 1992 and offered him the position of consultant for Ren & Stimpy, but he refused to "sell out". Nickelodeon moved production from Spümcø to its newly founded animation department, Games Animation, which later became Nickelodeon Animation Studios.[tpl]cite web |url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=57648 |title=The Ren & Stimpy Show: Season Three and a Half-ish |author=Michael Mackenzie|accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=The Digital Fix[/tpl] Bob Camp replaced Kricfalusi as director, while West, having refused Kricfalusi's request to leave along with him, voiced Ren in addition to Stimpy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/renstimpyseason3.php |title=Seasons Three and a Half-ish review |accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=DVDverdict.com[/tpl] Fans and critics felt this was a turning point in the show, with the new episodes being a considerable step down from the standard of those that preceded them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Ren-Stimpy-Season-3-Half-ish/4771 |title=Ren and Stimpy Show, The – Season 3 and a Half-ish Review|author=Gord Lacey|accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com[/tpl] Ted Drozdowski, resident critic of The Boston Phoenix, stated that "the bloom faded on Ren & Stimpy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|title=Eye pleasers|author=Ted Drozdowski|work=The Boston Phoenix[/tpl] Animation historian Michael Barrier writes that while the creators of the Games episodes used bathroom humor jokes that were similar to those used by Kricfalusi, they did not "find the material particularly funny; they were merely doing what was expected."[tpl]cite book  |last = Barrier  |first = Michael  |title = Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age  |publisher = Oxford University Press US  |year = 2003  |pages=571–572|isbn = 0-19-516729-5 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC&lpg=PA571&pg=PA571#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=2010-01-17[/tpl] The show ended its original run on December 16, 1995 with "A Scooter for Yaksmas", although one episode from the final season, "Sammy and Me/The Last Temptation", remained unaired.[tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.ren-n-stimpy/browse_thread/thread/df2a470cb91e441d#|author=Leigh Michael Wilkes|title=Final R&S episode|date=January 23, 1996|accessdate=2010-12-26[/tpl] Almost a year later, the episode aired on Nickelodeon's sister network, MTV on October 20, 1996.

==Production==

===Production system===

The animation production system used in The Ren & Stimpy Show was similar to those found in Golden Age cartoons, where a director supervised the entire production process from beginning to end.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/Clampett/interview_bob_clampett.htm|title=An Interview with Bob Clampett|year=1970|accessdate=2010-10-15|author=Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|work=Funnyworld No. 12[/tpl][tpl]Cite news  | last = Miller | first = Bob | title = NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity & hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters | periodical = Comic Scene | issue = 15 | pages = 38 | year = 1990 | date =  | url =  | postscript =  |quote = the classic Warner Bros. unit system (rather than the department system of other TV animation studios) in which directors oversee nearly every facet of production.[/tpl] This system is in contrast to cartoon production methods in the 1980s, where there was a different director for voice actors, and cartoons were created with a "top-down" approach to tie in with toy production.[tpl]cite web|url=http://frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/category/blog-history-of-frederator-shorts/|title=Blog History of Frederator shorts (parts 1 to 22)|accessdate=2010-10-15|author=Fred Seibert|work=frederatorblogs.com[/tpl] Animator Vincent Waller compared working on Ren & Stimpy and SpongeBobSquarePants in an interview: "Working on Ren and Stimpy and SpongeBob was very similar. They're both storyboard-driven shows, which means they give us an outline from a premise after the premise has been approved. We take the outline and expand on it, writing the dialogue and gags. That was very familiar.""The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants," Hogan's Alley #17, 2010 According to Kricfalusi, Ren & Stimpy reintroduced the layouts stage, and reemphasized the storyboard stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/artists-finally-win-some-respect-and.html|title=Artists Finally Win Some Respect and Credit|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=2010-10-15|author=John Kricfalusi|work=John K Stuff[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-is-cartoon-director.html|title=What is a cartoon director?|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=2010-10-15|author=John Kricfalusi|work=John K Stuff[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2009/11/tiny-toons-ideal-1.html|title=Tiny Toons ideal 1|date=November 18, 2009|accessdate=2010-10-15|author=John Kricfalusi|work=John K Stuff[/tpl] Eventually, artists drew larger storyboard panels, which allowed for the stories to be easily changed according to reactions from pitch meetings, and for new ideas to be integrated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2008/01/frank-and-ollie-on-natural-cartoon.html|title=Frank and Ollie On Natural Cartoon Story Procedures – part 1|author=John Kricfalusi|work=John K Stuff|date=January 15, 20087|accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl]

===Animation style===

The show's aesthetics draw on Golden Age cartoons,[tpl]cite news|title= Loonier Toon Tales|work= Time|date=April 13, 1992|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975286,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03 | first=Stefan | last=Kanfer[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/574/000044442/ |title=John Kricfalusi profile |accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=NNDB[/tpl] particularly those of Bob Clampett in the way the characters' emotions powerfully distort their bodies. The show's style emphasizes unique expressions, intense and specific acting, and strong character poses. One of the show's most notable visual trademarks is the detailed paintings of gruesome close-ups, along with the blotchy ink stains that on occasion replace the standard backgrounds, "reminiscent of holes in reality or the vision of a person in a deep state of dementia".[tpl]cite web|author=Jessie Eubanks|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/656/656198p1.html|title=Ren & Stimpy: Season Five and Some More of Season Four|work=IGN|date=October 7, 2005|accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl] This style was developed from Clampett's Baby Bottleneck, which features several scenes with color-cards for backgrounds.[tpl]cite web|title=When Cartoons Were Cartoony: John Kricfalusi Presents|work=AWN|author=Martin Goodman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/drtoon/when-cartoons-were-cartoony-john-kricfalusi-presents|page=3[/tpl] The show incorporated norms from "the old system in TV and radio" where the animation would feature sponsored products to tie in with the cartoon, however in lieu of real advertisements, it featured fake commercial breaks advertising nonexistent products, most notably Log."Future of entertainment" (archive), The Hollywood Reporter.

===Music===

The Ren & Stimpy Show features a wide variety of music, spanning rockabilly, folk, pop, jazz, classical music, jingles, and more.

Stimpy's rousing anthem titled "Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy" was composed by Christopher Reccardi and written by Charlie Brissette and John Kricfalusi. A cover of this song, performed by Wax, is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. The line "happy, happy, joy, joy" is first used in episode three of the series; the song is first played in episode six.

===Controversy and censorship===

The creators of Ren & Stimpy did not want to create an "educational" series, a stance which bothered Nickelodeon. Sources for complaint were the toilet humor and harsh language.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/letters/2002archives4.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106201155/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/letters/2002archives4.asp |archivedate=January 6, 2008 |title=Letters to the Editor archive |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=Parents Television Council[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/childrensstudy/childrensstudy.pdf |title=WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING: A Content Analysis of Children's Television |accessdate=2007-05-20 |format=PDF[/tpl] Despite these sentiments by Nickelodeon and parental groups, UK CIC Video home releases of the Spümcø episodes received U (all ages) ratings from the BBFC, while the "lighter" Games episodes received PG ratings. However in later DVD releases, the Spümcø episodes were re-rated PG.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/search?searchwhere=db&q=Stimpy|title=bbfc.co.uk search results for "Stimpy"|work=British Board of Film Classification[/tpl] In the United States, each episode was given the ratings TV-Y7 on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons, TV-G on TeenNick, and TV-PG on Spike.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Some segments of the show were altered to exclude references to religion, politics and alcohol. The episode "Powdered Toast Man" had a cross removed from the Pope's hat and the credits changed to "the man with the pointy hat". The same episode had a segment featuring the burning of the United States constitution and bill of rights which was removed, while in another episode the last name of the character George Liquor was removed. Several episodes had violent, gruesome, or suggestive scenes shortened or removed, including a sequence involving a severed head, a close-up of Ren's face being grated by a man's stubble, and a scene where Ren receives multiple punches to the stomach from an angry baby. One episode, "Man's Best Friend" was shelved by Nickelodeon for its violent content. The show's spin-off, Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon", debuted with this "banned" episode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/ren_stimpy/encycs2.html|title=The Ren And Stimpy Encyclopedia – Season 2|author=Norman Sippel|date=May 15, 1994|accessdate=2010-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/ren_stimpy/FAQ11.html|title=Ren & Stimpy FAQ - Does Nickelodeon censor R&S?|author=Nick Sayer, Norman Sippel|date=May 15, 1994|accessdate=2010-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928131726/http://www.lyris-lite.net/rscuts.html|title=Ren & Stimpy Uncut: Uncut|author=David Mackenzie|date=October 2006|accessdate=2010-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0684946/|title=Man's Best Friend|work=IMDb|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl]

==Episodes==

The series ran for five seasons, spanning 52 episodes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+New+TNN+Signs+With+Animator+John+Kricfalusi+to+Produce+New...-a089143084|title=The New TNN Signs With Animator John Kricfalusi|work=The New TNN press release|date=Jul 17, 2002|accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl] The show was produced by Kricfalusi's animation studio Spümcø for the first two seasons. Beginning with season three (1993–94), the show was produced by Nickelodeon's Games Animation. The episode "Man's Best Friend" was produced for season two, but the episode was shelved and debuted with the show's adult spin-off. Another episode, "Sammy and Me / The Last Temptation", aired on MTV on October 20, 1996, almost a year after the original Nickelodeon run ended.

==Legacy==

The immediate influence of the show was the spawning of two "clones": Hanna-Barbera's 2 Stupid Dogs, in which Spümcø employees including Kricfalusi had some limited involvement after their departure from Ren & Stimpy; and Disney's The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show. However, the show had a wider influence on the future of animation.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VqaAnj88gKYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT71#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Makin' toons: inside the most popular animated TV shows and movies|author=Allan Neuwirth|pages=57–67|year=2003|publisher=Allworth Press[/tpl] Mike Judge places MTV's willingness to commission Beavis and Butt-head on the success of Ren & Stimpy on the network.[tpl]citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-17/entertainment/ca-46556_1_animated-series|title= New Kings of TV's Toon Town|author=Daniel Cerone|date=October 17, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] Writer Larry Brody credits Ren & Stimpy for leading a new golden age of animation, as other networks followed Nickelodeon and invested in new cartoons, opening the way for more adult-oriented satirical shows like Beavis and Butt-head and South Park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/226624/tvs_turning_points_a_new_book_looks_at_pivotal_moments/index.html|author=Ted Cox|work=Daily Herald|date=August 31, 2005|title=TV's Turning Points: A New Book Looks at Pivotal Moments in TV History|accessdate=2011-01-21[/tpl] Writer/animator Allan Neuwirth writes that Ren & Stimpy "broke the mold" and started several trends in TV animation, chiefly the revival of credits at the beginning of each episode, the use of grotesque close-ups, and a shift in cartoon color palettes to richer, more harmonious colors. A direct influence can be seen in the series SpongeBob SquarePants with physically extreme drawings that contrast with the characters' usual appearance, the "grotesque close-ups".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/SpongeBob/SpongeBob.htm|title=SpongeBath|author=Michael Barrier|date=December 11, 2004|accessdate=2011-01-21[/tpl]

==Home releases==

===VHS, LaserDisc, UMD===

Sony Wonder initially distributed collections of episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show on VHS, which were not grouped by air dates or season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&rh=n%3A172346&page=1 |title=Amazon.com collection of The Ren & Stimpy Show on VHS |accessdate=2007-05-22[/tpl] Eventually, the rights for Nickelodeon's programming on home video transferred from Sony to Paramount Home Video. Paramount only released one video of The Ren & Stimpy Show, "Have Yourself a Stinky Little Christmas", which was actually a rerelease of a Sony video from several years earlier. Like all of the other Paramount cassettes of Nickelodeon shows, they were recorded in the EP/SLP format. Tapes released by Sony were recorded in SP format.[tpl]Or|date=November 2010[/tpl]
During the mid and late 1990s, a themed selection of The Ren & Stimpy Show episodes were released in a number of VHS releases in Australia by Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Entertainment. Most of the videos were G-classified due to some scenes that were cut but other certain videos were classified PG. The Ren & Stimpy Show was also released on LaserDisc in the United States by Sony Wonder. There was only one release, "Ren and Stimpy: The Essential Collection", which featured the same episodes as the VHS release.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] On September 25, 2005, a compilation entitled The Ren & Stimpy Show: Volume 1 was released in the U.S. on UMD, the proprietary media for the PlayStation Portable.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

Time–Life released several episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show in a "Best of" set in September 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/8654/best-of-ren-stimpy-the/ |title=The Best of Ren & Stimpy |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=DVDTalk.com[/tpl] This set is now out of print.[tpl]cite web |url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56548 |title=The Ren & Stimpy Show |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=DVDTimes.co.uk |last=Mackenzie |first=Michael |quote=An earlier 3-disc set, by Time Life, featured select episodes from the first two seasons, but suffered from a number of censor cuts.

Although the cover art and press materials claimed the episodes were "uncut", a handful of episodes were, in fact, edited, due to the use of Spike TV masters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Ren-Stimpy-1st-2nd-Seasons/3862 |title=Ren and Stimpy Show, The – The 1st And 2nd Seasons information page |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com[/tpl] One of the episodes from the second season, "Svën Höek", did have footage reinserted from a work in progress VHS tape, but with an editing machine timecode visible on-screen; the scene was later restored by fans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://niblets.blogspot.com/2006/04/ren-stimpy-restoration-project.html |title=Ren & Stimpy Restoration Project |accessdate=2007-05-20[/tpl] A set for Seasons Three and a Half-ish, containing all of season three and the first half of season four up to "It's A Dog's Life/Egg Yolkeo", followed on June 28, 2005.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Ren-Stimpy-Season-3-Half-ish/4771 |title=Ren and Stimpy Show, The – Season 3 and a Half-ish information page |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com[/tpl] Season Five and Some More of Four completed the DVD release of the Nickelodeon series on July 20.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Ren-Stimpy-Season-5-4/4965 |title=Ren and Stimpy Show, The – Season 5 and Some More of 4 information page |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com[/tpl] Like the previous DVDs, some scenes were removed in these releases.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
A two-disc set dubbed The Lost Episodes was released on July 17, 2006, featuring both the aired and unaired episodes from Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon, as well as clips from unfinished cartoons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Ren-Stimpy-Adult-Party-Cartoon-Volume-Release/5805 |title=Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon – The Lost Episodes information page |accessdate=2007-05-20 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com[/tpl]
In October 2006, Paramount UK released The Ren & Stimpy Show – Unleashed: The First and Second Seasons on DVD. The distributors heavily edited some episodes; most notably the episode "Out West" has the entire song "The Lord Loves a Hangin'" removed and cuts directly to the end of the episode after Ren and Stimpy steal Mr. Horse. In addition, all commentaries and the "banned" episode "Man's Best Friend" are completely absent, even though they are mentioned as present on the DVD packaging.
The Australian DVD similarly excised the episode "Man's Best Friend", but also removed all mentions of it from the packaging. Like the UK release, it was also brandished "Unleashed", rather than the American title of "Uncut".
The complete series is set to come out in Germany on October 4, 2013. The Limted Edition 8-disc set includes a 3D card, sticker set, postcards, episode guide and poster, as well as bonus features included on the discs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.de/Die-Stimpy-Show-Uncut-3D-Coverkarte/dp/B00DQJ966G|title=Die Ren & Stimpy Show Uncut|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=2013-09-20[/tpl]

==Adult Party Cartoon (2003–04)==

In 2003, Kricfalusi relaunched the series as Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon". The new version was aired during a late night programming block on Spike TV and was rated TV-MA. The series, as the title implies, explores more adult themes, including an explicitly homosexual relationship between the main characters,[tpl]cite episode |title= Onward and Upward |episode= Onward and Upward |series= Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon |serieslink= Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"| 2003–2004 |credits= Written by: Vincent Waller Directed by: John K. |network=TNN |airdate =2003-06-23 |season=1 |number= 2[/tpl] and an episode filled with female nudity.[tpl]cite episode |title= Naked Beach Frenzy |episode= Naked Beach Frenzy |series= Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon |serieslink= Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"| 2003–2004 |credits= Written by: John K.

The show began with the "banned" Nickelodeon episode "Man's Best Friend" before debuting new episodes. Fans and critics alike were unsettled by the show from the first episode, which featured the consumption of bodily fluids such as nasal mucus, saliva and vomit. Only three of the ordered nine episodes were produced on time. After three episodes, Spike TV's entire animation block was removed from its programming schedule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvweek.com/topstorys/11303spike.html|title=Spike Retooling Its Toon Strategy |author=James Hibberd |date=November 2003|accessdate=2010-12-21|work=TelevisionWeek|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040603133953/http://www.tvweek.com/topstorys/11303spike.html|archivedate=June 3, 2004|quote=One unexpected complication has been a lack of new episodes from Spike's most popular animated title. The network ordered nine episodes (an original order of six, then an additional three-parter) of "Ren & Stimpy's Adult Party Cartoon" from creator John Kricfalusi. The network only received three.[/tpl]

==Other media==

===Video games===

Several Ren & Stimpy-themed games have been produced. Most of the games were produced by THQ.

====Software====

Ren and Stimpy were included in several Nickelodeon-themed activity and crafts software for computers. Ren and Stimpy were also created in full 3D for Microsoft's Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker.

===Comic books===

Marvel Comics optioned the rights to produce comic books based on Nickelodeon properties in 1992. The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the Marvel Absurd imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe Dan Slott. One Ren & Stimpy special #3, Masters of Time and Space, was set up as a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred Spider-Man battling Powdered Toast Man. The editors named the "Letters to the Editor" section "Ask Dr. Stupid", and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer."That's Life," Rocko's Modern Life. Marvel Comics. Volume 1, Issue 5.

===Nick–Fox film deal===

Nickelodeon and Twentieth Century Fox signed a two-year production deal in May 1993 for the development and production of animated and live-action family films, based on new or existing properties. Ren & Stimpy was mentioned as a possible property for development, along with Rugrats and Doug, however the show's "cynical and gross humor" was a poor fit for a conventional, "warm and fuzzy" family film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-19/business/9305190485_1_beece-production-facilities-nick|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 19, 1993|author=Catherine Hinman|title=Nickelodeon Adds Movies To Its Credits|accessdate=2011-01-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/speech/software/tutorials/production/fundamentals/v1.0/appendix/lecture_notes/projects/1998_spring/data/lm_training/wsj93_017.text|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 1993|author=Thomas R King|accessdate=2011-01-18|title=Nickelodeon, Fox Film, chase family viewers[/tpl] The deal expired with no movies produced. Nickelodeon would later start its own film studio after parent company Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures.
