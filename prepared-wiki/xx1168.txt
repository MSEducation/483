[[Teochew cuisine]]

CATEGORIES: Chaozhou, Regional cuisines of China, Chiuchow cuisine

Teochew cuisine, also known as Chiuchow cuisine, Chaozhou cuisine or Chaoshan cuisine, originated from the Chaoshan region in the east of Guangdong province, which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang. Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, to which it shares some dishes, which may be due to Chaoshan and Fujian's cultural and language similarities and geographic proximity.[tpl]citation|title=Food in Chinese culture : anthropological and historical perspectives |first=Kwang-chih |last=Chang |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1977[/tpl] However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.

==Background==

Teochew cuisine is particularly well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes and is commonly regarded [tpl]by whom|date=May 2012[/tpl] as being healthy. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir-frying. Chaozhou cuisine is also known for serving congee ([tpl]zh|c=潮州糜|p=Cháozhōu mí[/tpl]; or mue), in addition to steamed rice or noodles with meals. The Teochew mue is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart. The former being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl, while the latter is more a thin gruel.
Authentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong oolong tea called Tieguanyin in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as Gongfu cha, the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as gam gam ([tpl]zh|c=甘甘|p=gān gān[/tpl]).
A condiment that is popular in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine and commonly associated with cuisine of certain Teochew groups is shacha sauce ([tpl]zh|s=沙茶酱|t=沙茶醬|p=shāchá jiàng[/tpl]). It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chillies, brill fish, and dried shrimp. The paste has a savoury and slightly spicy taste.
As an ingredient, it has multiple uses:
In addition to soy sauce (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), diaspora Teochew cuisine, (mainly Teochews in IndoChina) uses fish sauce. It is used as a flavouring agent in soups and sometimes as a dipping sauce, as in Vietnamese spring rolls. 
Teochew chefs often use a special stock called superior broth ([tpl]zh|s=上汤|t=上湯|p=shàngtāng[/tpl]). This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished. Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same superior broth that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes.
There is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine / banquet called jiat dot ([tpl]zh|c=食桌|p=shízhuō|l=food table[/tpl]). A myriad of dishes are often served, which include shark fin soup, bird's nest, lobster, steamed fish, roasted suckling pig and braised goose.
Teochew chefs take pride in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.
Teochew cuisine is also known for a late night meal known as meh siao ([tpl]zh|c=夜宵|p=yèxiāo[/tpl]) or da lang ([tpl]zh|c=打冷|p=dǎléng[/tpl]) among the Cantonese. Teochew people enjoy eating out close to midnight in restaurants or at roadside food stalls. Some dai pai dong-like restaurants stay open till dawn.
Unlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a dessert section.
Many people of Chaoshan origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in Southeast Asia, especially Singapore, Hong Kong, Cambodia and Thailand; influences they bring can be noted in the cuisine of Singapore and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in Taiwanese cuisine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Other notable Teochew diaspora communities are in Vietnam and France. There is also a large diaspora of Teochew people (most were from Southeast Asia) in the United States - particularly in the state of California. There is a Teochew Chinese Association in Paris called L'Amicale des Teochews en France.
