==The Army Air Force Band 1942–1944==

In 1942, at the peak of his civilian career, Miller decided to join the war effort. At 38, Miller was too old to be drafted, and first volunteered for the Navy but was told that they did not need his services.Simon (1980), pp. 309–310. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He persuaded the United States Army to accept him so he could, in his own words, "be placed in charge of a modernized Army band." After being accepted into the Army, Miller's civilian band played its last concert in Passaic, New Jersey, on September 27, 1942. His patriotic intention of entertaining the Allied Forces with the fusion of virtuosity and dance rhythms in his music earned him the rank of captain and he was soon promoted to major by August 1944.
At first placed in the United States Army, Miller was transferred to the Army Air Force.Simon (1980), p. 324. Captain Glenn Miller served initially as assistant special services officer for the Army Air Forces Southeast Training Center at Maxwell Field, Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1942. He played trombone with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece dance band, in both Montgomery and in service clubs and recreation halls on Maxwell. Miller also appeared on both WAPI (Birmingham, Alabama) and WSFA radio (Montgomery), promoting the activities of civil service women aircraft mechanics employed at Maxwell.
Miller initially formed a large marching band that was to be the core of a network of service orchestras. His attempts at modernizing military music were met with some resistance from tradition-minded career officers. For example, Miller's arrangement of "St. Louis Blues March", combined blues and jazz with the traditional military march."War Two: The Stars Wore Stripes", Ftmeade.army.mil. Retrieved on July 29, 2011. Miller's weekly radio broadcast "I Sustain the Wings", for which he co-wrote the eponymous theme song, moved from New Haven to New York City and was very popular. This led to permission for Miller to form his 50-piece Army Air Force Band and take it to England in the summer of 1944, where he gave 800 performances.They Served Here: Thirty-Three Maxwell Men, "Glenn Miller", pp. 37–38. Benton, Jeffrey C. (1999). Air University Press. While in England, now Major Miller recorded a series of records at EMI owned Abbey Road Studios. EMI at this time was the British and  European distributor for RCA Victor.Donald's Encyclopedia of Popular Music. EMI, expert-level blog by Donald Clarke (writer) The recordings the AAF band made in 1944 at Abbey Road were propaganda broadcasts for the Office of War Information. Many songs are sung in German by Johnny Desmond and Glenn Miller speaks in German about the war effort.Hugh Palmer. Glenn Miller: The Lost Recordings. Tarcl.com (April 30, 1944). Retrieved on July 29, 2011.  Before Miller's disappearance, his music was used by World War II AFN radio broadcasting for entertainment and morale as well as counter-propaganda to denounce fascist oppression in Europe with even Miller once stating on radio:

==Disappearance==

Miller spent the last night before his disappearance at the Hall in Milton Ernest, near Bedford. On December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers there. His plane (a single-engined UC-64 Norseman, USAAF serial 44-70285) departed from RAF Twinwood Farm in Clapham, on the outskirts of Bedford and disappeared while flying over the English Channel.Butcher, pp. 203–205.Since 1944 bits of evidence of Glenn Miller's final aircraft trip continue to emerge.  See "Glenn Miller clue found in Reading plane-spotter's log ", January 11, 2012. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-16517128  No trace of the aircrew, passengers or plane has ever been found. Miller's status is "missing in action".
There are three main theories about what happened to Miller's plane, including the suggestion that he might have been hit by Royal Air Force bombs after an abortive raid on Siegen, Germany. One hundred and thirty-eight Lancaster bombers, short on fuel, jettisoned approximately 100,000 incendiaries in a designated area before landing. The logbooks of Royal Air Force navigator Fred Shaw[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2654822|title=The Mysterious Disappearance of Glenn Miller |publisher=BBC |date=July 20, 2004[/tpl] recorded that he saw a small, single-engined monoplane spiraling out of control and crashing into the water. However, a second source, while acknowledging the possibility, cites other RAF crew members flying the same mission who stated that the drop area was in the North Sea. Further research by British scholars also seems to indicate that this is the most likely probability, making Miller's death a "friendly fire" incident.The Glenn Miller Story[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mboss.force9.co.uk/twinwood/roth/index.htm |title=The Glenn Miller Mystery |last= Roth |first=Howard[/tpl]  In his 2006 self-published book, I Kept My Word: The Personal Promise Between a World War II Army Private and His Captain About What Really Happened to Glenn Miller, Clarence B.

According to the German tabloid Bild, Ulfkotte had been researching American and German intelligence efforts during the war for a book on German intelligence agencies. Ulfkotte claimed that while going over documents he had obtained from the American government under the Freedom of Information Act, he found evidence that Miller had actually arrived safely in Paris on the 14th, but had a heart attack on the 15th while consorting with a French prostitute, and that the American military had covered up the episode.see generous BBC page - The Mysterious Disappearance of Glenn Miller - at
When Miller disappeared, he left behind his wife, the former Helen Burger, originally from Boulder, Colorado, and the two children they adopted in 1943 and 1944, Steven and Jonnie.Simon (1980), pp. 354, 434. Helen Miller accepted the Bronze Star medal for Miller in February 1945.Simon (1980), p. 433.

==Civilian band legacy==

The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller "ghost band" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It had a makeup similar to the Army Air Force Band: it had a large string section.Simon (1980), pp. 437–39. The orchestra's official public début was at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway where it opened for a three-week engagement on January 24, 1946.Butcher, p. 262. Future television and film composer Henry Mancini was the band's pianist and one of the arrangers.Henry Mancini at All About Jazz, Allaboutjazz.com. Retrieved on July 29, 2011.

In the mid-1940s, after Miller's disappearance, the Miller-led Army Air Force band was decommissioned and sent back to the United States. "The chief of the European theater asked Officer Harold Lindsay Lin Arinson to put together another band to take its place, and that's when the 314 was formed."

This band was created in 1950 from smaller groups within the Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. and continues to play jazz music for the Air Force community and the general public.
