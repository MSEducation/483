Alexander Carpenter, Latinized as Fabricius (fl. 1429), was the author of the Destructorium viciorum, a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.Gerald Robert Owst: The Destructiorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter, Church Historical Society, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, 1952, 40 pp.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Alexander |volume=9|page=153[/tpl]George Watson (ed.): The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.  Some published editions of the work bear the author's name as "Alexander Anglus" ("Alexander the Englishman"), but he is further identified in a 1496 edition which states that the work was compiled "a cuiusdam fabri lignarii filio" -- "by a certain son of a worker of wood," i.e., a carpenter's son.Ludwig Hain: Repertorium Bibliographicum in Usum Scholarum Directory for Scholarly Use", J. G. Cottae Stuttgartiae et Jul. Renouard Lutetiae Parisiorum, 1826, Vol. I, Pt. I, p. 72. This identifier also states that the work was begun in 1429, which rules out authorship by Alexander of Hales (ca. 1185-1245) which had by some scholars been considered a possibility. Alexander Carpenter authored other works, termed Homiliae eruditae ("Learned Sermons"), but they are not at present known.
Carpenter is thought by some to have been a follower of the English theologian John Wycliffe (ca. 1328-1384), but that is disputed.John Bale, Scriptorum illustrium maioris Britanniae, quam nunc Angliam et Scotiam vocant, catalogus of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, now called England and Scotland", Basel: 1557-1559, vol.
