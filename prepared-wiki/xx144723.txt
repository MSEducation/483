==History==

===Origins===

Hangad's origins begin with the Days with the Lord (DWTL) retreat/recollection at the all-boys Ateneo de Manila High School. In need of a singing group for their own group, Chad Arcinue and Lance Lazatin recruited classmates and friends. A high school faculty member, Gabby Mallillin, encouraged the then-unnamed group to sing in the next DWTL sessions.
Because of this, the same group of people would often find themselves participating in school activities. As the members were known to be participants of the DWTL seminars, the group has often been mistaken for the DWTL's "official" choir. Hence, on October 1991, the group decided to establish their own identity and adapted the name Hangad. Hangad made its debut concert in 1992.
By the time they were in college, Hangad began to accept female members, initially from high schools and colleges such as College of the Holy Spirit, Miriam College and Stella Maris. The reconstituted Hangad continued with their participation in activities at the Ateneo de Manila University, including masses; the newly-reorganized group also held its first concert in 1994. For their service to the university community, they were awarded the Dean's Award for Service.

===1998 and beyond===

In 1998, Hangad was offered a recording contract by the Jesuit Music Ministry; that same year, the group released its self-titled debut album, Hangad. Hangad later re-released its album in CD format in 2000, with six new songs. In December 2001, they also released their first music video for the song, Pananatili, which enjoyed regular telecasts at TV stations ABS-CBN, PTV, TV5, IBC, and TFC (and continues to this day).
These will be followed soon by three more albums and two additional music videos, all recorded under the auspices of the Jesuit Music Ministry. As of October 21, [tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], Hangad lists 82 persons on its membership register, with 31 members on active status.http://www.hangad.org/pages/aboutus/members.php Accessed 20 December 2006.
