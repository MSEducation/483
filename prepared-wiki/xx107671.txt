He took a total of 11 days to complete the run and as a welcome into Melbourne, ran the final leg into the Channel 9 Footy Show's studio where the panel and crowd awaited his arrival. Hundreds of 'pink ladies' who were affected in some way by breast cancer showed their appreciation and support by making way for Crawford as he ran into the studio. Crawford appeared humbled and initially struggled to come to terms with what he had achieved and the stories that he had heard along the journey from breast cancer sufferers and family/friends of those with breast cancer. His efforts raised $500,000 for the cause.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.bcna.org.au/events/key-fundraising-events/shane-crawford-thats-what-im-walkin-about |title='That's what I'm walkin' about' |author= |year=2010 |website=Breast Cancer Network Australia |publisher=Breast Cancer Network Australia |accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]
