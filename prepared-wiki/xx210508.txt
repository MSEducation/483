==Tracklisting==

==Soundtracks==

Hope 7's version of Breakthrough was featured in the Cheetah Girls Soundtrack in 2003, for which a music video was filmed. The video, which can be viewed on YouTube, has gained over 75,000 views as of July 2009http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEUSEhVRl_s and soon after its release it was often featured on The Disney Channel, increasing the band's popularity.
It is also worth noting that in 2003 Kristi McClave provided this song for the Legally Blonde 2 Soundtrack. This version was recorded without the rest of the band, because at that time the final line-up was incomplete. However, this track was credited as being performed by Hope 7 anyway.

==Music video==

The music video for Breakthrough was filmed for the Cheetah Girls Soundtrack and features the band rehearsing for a performance. At the beginning, it shows McClave saying they have three minutes and that they should rehearse one more time. Then the band starts playing Breakthrough and throughout the video it cuts between scenes from the film and the band having fun, playing their music and dancing, with one point where McClave starts jumping on a sofa that belongs to the Cheetah Girls. At the end, they have to pack up for The Cheetah Girls to play but they haven't finished performing, so they walk out still playing the song.
