Throughout the 1960s, Trejo was in and out of jail and prison in California. There are conflicting accounts of his prison chronology. By one account, his final stint in custody ended in 1972; by another account, he did time in a juvenile offenders' camp and six California prisons between 1959 and 1969.[tpl]Cite news |first=Paul |last=Wright |date=August 2011 |title=Prison Legal News Interviews Former Prisoner and Famous Actor Danny Trejo |newspaper=Prison Legal News |url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/23634_displayArticle.aspx [/tpl][tpl]Cite news |date= |title=article listing for Danny Trejo |newspaper=Prison Legal News |url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/Search.aspx?type=articles&term=trejo [/tpl] He recalled that his last prison term was five years. While serving in San Quentin Prison, he became a champion boxer in lightweight and welterweight divisions within that prison. During this time, Trejo became a member of a twelve-step program, which he credits with his success in overcoming drug addiction. In 2011, he recalled that he had been sober for 42 years. Upon his final release he enrolled in Pitzer College located in Claremont, California but subsequently left after one semester of attendance.

==Career==

While speaking at a recovery meeting in Los Angeles, Trejo met an old man in the movie business. His newfound friend invited him to the set of Runaway Train where Trejo was offered a job as an extra in the film's prison scenes. Edward Bunker, himself a former convict and well-respected crime author who was writing the screenplay for the film, recognized Trejo, with whom he had done time at San Quentin.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/dec/06/danny-trejo-hole-gas-chamber | work=The Guardian | title=Danny Trejo: 'I went to the hole looking at three gas-chamber offences' | first=Lisa| last=Marks | date=6 December 2012[/tpl] Bunker, remembering Trejo's boxing skills, offered him $320 per day to train Eric Roberts, one of the movie's stars, for a boxing scene. Director Andrei Konchalovsky liked Trejo's work and decided to offer him a small role in the film as a boxer. It has been widely misreported that Trejo was actually serving time in the prison during filming, when in fact he had been released over a decade earlier.
Since then, Trejo has become a prolific actor in both films and television, appearing alongside some of Hollywood's most famous actors, including Jean-Claude Van Damme, Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Nicolas Cage, Charles Bronson, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford, Val Kilmer, and Antonio Banderas. Trejo has often appeared in five or more movies per year in various genres.

Trejo is known for his distinctive appearance. In addition to his heavily lined face (usually sporting a long mustache), he has displayed the large tattoo on his chest for many roles (the tattoo depicts a woman wearing a sombrero). He often plays thugs or lowlife characters, although he has also played sympathetic characters in films such as Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids trilogy, Bubble Boy and a guest appearance on the USA Network series Monk where art imitated life in his portrayal of a convict roommate to Tony Shalhoub's undercover detective. He also appeared in a Season 2 episode of Desperate Housewives, where, as another good-guy character, he was sent by Carlos to help Gabrielle deal with her grief of losing her unborn baby. He voiced the character Enrique on King of the Hill, and Octavio's character on that show is based on his appearance. His role on King of the Hill was referred to in the HBO series Unscripted where he had a cameo appearance.  He also is featured in an episode of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! and an episode of Do IT LIVE with actors Anna Bennett and Claudia Pickering, shot in Downtown Los Angeles, by the name of Sebring feat.

Trejo is now portraying the Mexican bartender in the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless. He also voices Raul Tejada, a Ghoul, in Fallout: New Vegas.
Regarding his continued growth as a professional actor, Trejo has stated that he still cannot believe how fortunate he has been: "I'm so blessed. I'm still scared that somebody's going to wake me up and say, 'Hey, we're still in prison. Let's go to chow".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/157270-danny-trejo-the-illustrated-man|title=Danny Trejo: The illustrated man[/tpl]
