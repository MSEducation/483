An American Family is an American television documentary filmed from May 30 through December 31, 1971"An American Family Screenings", Paley Center for Media, 2011, New York. and first aired in the United States on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in early 1973.  After being edited down from about 300 hours of raw footage, the series ran one season of 12 episodes on Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m.  
Originally intended as a chronicle of the daily life of the Louds — an upper-middle-class family in Santa Barbara, California — the groundbreaking program documented the break-up of the family via the separation and subsequent divorce of parents Bill and Pat Loud.Cf. Loud, Pat, Pat Loud: A Woman's Story, 1974 The documentary inspired spoofs such as the Albert Brooks feature film Real Life (1979).
A year after this programme was broadcast, the BBC in 1974 filmed its own similar 12-episode programme, called The Family, focusing on the working-class Wilkins family, of Reading, Berkshire, England.
