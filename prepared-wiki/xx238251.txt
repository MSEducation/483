==K·B Toys==

The Kaufman Brothers' business expanded into retail that included Kaufman Brothers Toys, or Kay Bee Toys, in 1960 and was fully established in 1972 in nearly every state in shopping malls. Donald Kaufman was vice president at this time. Nine years later, the business was sold to Melville Corporation and eventually dissolved in 2008 when the decline in the retail business started affecting the shopping malls.

==Personal life==

Kaufman married Faith Dichter and they had three daughters.  The marriage was eventually dissolved. He then married Sally Golden, who had two children from her previous marriage. Throughout his adult life he spent vacations touring toy fairs in the Northeast and in Europe and amassed a huge collection of antique toy cars and trucks.

==The Collection==

Kaufman's important collection of antique toys included his first item, International Harvester Red Baby truck, purchased for $4 from a collector friend in 1950. The collection also included a working 1912 Märklin live-steam fire engine and he had more than 700 cars and trucks arranged on shelves in a four-level annex to his property. Other larger items included 40 pedal and oversized pressed-steel cars.[tpl]cite web |title=Donald Kaufman collection steps into the spotlight March 19–21 at Bertoia's |publisher=Live Auctioneers |url=http://acn.liveauctioneers.com/index.php/auctions/upcoming-auctions/584-donald-kaufman-collection-steps-into-the-spotlight-march-19-21-at-bertoias |date=13 February 2009[/tpl] The total size of the collection was estimated at 7,000 items, which he amassed with the help of his wife, Sally.  "It was a team effort...It was one of my lifelong pleasures but when she came into my life 20 some years ago she partnered in it and enjoyed what we did just as much as I did. I couldn’t have done this without her."[tpl]cite web |title=King of Toys: Donald Kaufman reflects on a lifetime of collecting |author=Eric Bradley |url=http://www.antiquetrader.com/article/donald_kaufman_toy_collecting_king |date=9 September 2009[/tpl]
