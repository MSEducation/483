==History==

In 1973, Time, Inc. acquired Temple Industries, Inc., merging it with Eastex Pulp and Paper Company to form Temple-Eastex, Inc. In 1978, Inland became part of Time, Inc. and in 1983, the companies were spun off as Temple-Inland, Inc.
In 2002, Inland acquired the Gaylord Container Corporation. 
In 2007 Temple-Inland announced that it planned to separate itself into three stand-alone public companies and sell its timberlands by the end of 2007.  Shareholders in the company would eventually receive stock in all three companies depending on the amount owned on the day the company split-up.
The company spun-off its real estate operations as Forestar Group and its financial services business as Guaranty Bank.  Guaranty Bank failed in 2009; its assets were acquired by BBVA Compass.
