"Rette Mich" ([tpl]lang-en|Rescue Me[/tpl]), the third single by German rock band Tokio Hotel, first appeared on the band's 2005 album Schrei. The single version of "Rette Mich", re-recorded as lead singer Bill Kaulitz's voice began to deepen, formed part of the Schrei - so laut du kannst release. The band later recorded an English-language version of the song, entitled "Rescue Me", for their third studio album  Scream.

==Video==

The video involves the band playing in what looks like a boarded-up, abandoned room. The walls of the room start closing in on the second verse. The main storyline of the video however, is about lead singer Bill Kaulitz singing in a similar room, alone. As he gets up, he finds it hard to keep his balance - he keeps sliding around everywhere. He tries to grab hold of objects numerous times, but in the end gives up and slides; at this moment the rest of the band appears in the room.
