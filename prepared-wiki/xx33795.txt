==Activism==

As an activist, Lumley is best known for her support for Gurkhas, the exiled Tibetan people and government, the Kondha indigenous people of India and the Prospect Burma charity, which offers grants to Burmese students, for whom she broadcast a BBC Radio 4 charity appeal in 2001.Prospect Burma – Joanna Lumley appeals on behalf of Prospect Burma Her father was a decorated Gurkha officer who fought in World War II.

===Gurkha Justice Campaign===

In 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all Nepalese origin Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission, but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. They have served Britain for more than 200 years with over 50,000 dying in service, and 13 have been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all-party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign."About the Gurkha Justice Campaign: Campaign Organisers" Gurkha Justice web site
On 24 April 2009, she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8014265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Fury over Gurkha settlement plan | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8019745.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Lib Dems challenge Gurkha ruling | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm|title=BBC 'Brown defeated over Gurkha rules'|accessdate=29 April 2009 | date=29 April 2009 | publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Following the Government defeat, the Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.
On 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from a senior member of the Royal Family,[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8034131.stm|title= No 10 denies Lumley 'Gurkha snub'|publisher= BBC News|date= 5 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl] and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Mr Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day."[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8036036.stm|title= Lumley 'trusts' Brown on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 6 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl]
However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Ms Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8037181.stm|title= Lumley in public clash on Gurkhas|publisher= BBC News|date= 7 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl]
Following a Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5360033/Gurkhas-in-Britain-a-timeline-of-their-campaign-to-stay.html|title= Gurkhas in Britain: a timeline of their campaign to stay|work= The Daily Telegraph|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | location=London[/tpl] Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm|title= Gurkhas win right to settle in UK|publisher= BBC News|date= 21 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009[/tpl]
