Stick Around for Joy, released in February 1992, was the third and final album released by the Icelandic alternative rock band The Sugarcubes. In terms of quality, fans usually rate the album somewhere between the band's acclaimed debut, Life's Too Good and the widely panned follow-up Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week!. The album provided the band's two hits:  The first, aptly titled "Hit", reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the U.S. and #17 on the UK Singles Chart.   The second was, "Leash Called Love" which went to number one on the US Dance charts.[tpl]cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=248[/tpl]
