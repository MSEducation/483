Constantin Negruzzi ([tpl]IPA-ro|konstanˈtin neˈɡrut͡si[/tpl], first name often Costache [tpl]IPA-ro|kosˈtake|pron[/tpl]; 1808–24 August 1868) was a Romanian poet, novelist, translator, playwright and politician.
Born in Trifeştii Vechi, Moldavia, he studied at home with a Greek teacher. He admitted in a later article that he learnt Romanian by himself, from a book written by Petru Maior. During the 1821 Revolution, his family took refuge in Chişinău, Bessarabia, where he met Alexander Pushkin and became interested in literature. 
Notable among his writings are his memoirs - Amintiri din juneţe ("Memories of youth") - and his historical writings, Fragmente istorice ("Historical fragments"), Negru pe alb ("Black on white"), Aprodul Purice (an aprod was a minor noble title, typically the son of a lord; Purice is a proper name, but literally means "flea"; see Movileşti). He translated some of the ballads of Victor Hugo, some of Thomas Moore's poetry and Antioch Kantemir's poetry. Negruzzi wrote two plays, Muza de la Burdujeni ("The Muse of Burdujeni") and Cârlani ("Lambs"), while translating several other plays.
Negruzzi also held several functions, including finance minister and deputy under Sturdza-Vodă. A supporter of liberal causes, he was twice exiled to his house in Trifeşti for criticism of the government.
