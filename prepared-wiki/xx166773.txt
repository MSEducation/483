Karl (or Carl) Wilhelm Verhoeff (November 25, 1867 – December 6, 1944) was a German zoologist, specialising in millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), as well as woodlice (Isopoda) and to a lesser extent insects.

==Biography==

Karl W. Verhoeff was born on November 25, 1867 in Soest in Westfalia, the son of the apothecary Karl M. Verhoeff and his wife Mathilde (born Rocholl). He completed his Abitur examination in Soest in 1889 and completed his doctoral thesis in zoology in Bonn in 1893. In 1902 he married Marie Kringer, who died in 1937 during surgery. The marriage produced three children, two daughters and a son, the son dying in 1942 on the Russian front.
He was briefly employed (1900–1905) at the [tpl]lang|de|Museum für Naturkunde[/tpl] in Berlin, but for the remainder of his long career, he worked privately.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gbif.de/evertebrata2/GloMyrIS/glomyris_2 |title=The heritage of Karl-Wilhelm Verhoeff |publisher=GBIF Deutschland |date=December 8, 2004[/tpl] Verhoeff undertook a number of collecting trips, including visits to the French Riviera, and Romania and Bulgaria down through Bosnia and into Greece. Some of these trips were financed by the Prussian Academy of Science. He financed himself partly by selling his collections, with Munich and Berlin holding large amounts of his material.
Contemporary taxonomists did not appreciate his early, groundbreaking work on Dermaptera, mainly due to his obscure expression and scarcity of illustrations and explanations, but his achievements in this group – as well as in Diplopoda and Chilognatha – were later recognized.[tpl]cite journal |author=M.B.? |year=1946 |title=Notes |journal=The Entomologist's record and journal of variation |volume=58 |pages=156–157 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30077593[/tpl]
Verhoeff received a number of awards towards the end of his life, including the silver [tpl]lang|de|Leibniz-Medaille[/tpl] of the Prussian Academy of Science (1933), the [tpl]lang|de|Preis & Plakette[/tpl] of the August Forel foundation (1942) and a [tpl]lang|de|Doktor Diplom[/tpl] from the University of Bonn on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his thesis (1943). In 1942, shortly before his 75th birthday, he was elected to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Problems with his sight and the destruction of his home in a bombing raid meant that he could no longer carry out research and he committed suicide on December 6, 1944.

Verhoeff was – alongside Ralph Vary Chamberlin and Carl Attems – one of the most prolific authors of myriapod taxa.[tpl]cite journal |title=Current status of the myriapod class Diplopoda (millipedes): taxonomic diversity and phylogeny |author=Petra Sierwald & Jason E.
