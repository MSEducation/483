Mathews (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played for the All-England Eleven in 1751.

==Career==

Mathews played in two major matches in 1751 for All-England against Kent. On 20 and 21 May, he was a member of the All-England team that defeated Kent by 9 runs at the Artillery Ground.Ashley-Cooper, p.68.Waghorn, pp.47â€“49.  A return match was arranged at the same venue on 22 May and All-England won by an innings and 9 runs, with Mathews again a member of their team.
Mathews is only recorded on those two occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Mathews.
