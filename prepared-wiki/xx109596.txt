[[Tetrazole]]

CATEGORIES: Tetrazoles

Tetrazoles are a class of synthetic organic heterocyclic compound, consisting of a 5-member ring of four nitrogen and one carbon atom (plus hydrogens).  The simplest is tetrazole itself, CN4H2. They are unknown in nature.

==Synthesis==

Tetrazole was first prepared by the reaction of anhydrous hydrazoic acid and hydrogen cyanide under pressure.  Treatment of organic nitriles with NaN3 in the presence of iodine or silica-supported sodium hydrogen sulfate as a heterogeneous catalyst enables an advantageous synthesis of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles.[tpl]cite journal | author = B.Das, C.

==Uses==

There are several pharmaceutical agents which are tetrazoles.  The tetrazole ring can act as a bioisostere for the carboxylate group. Angiotensin II receptor blockers, in particular, such as losartan and candesartan, often contain tetrazoles.
A well-known tetrazole is dimethyl thiazolyl diphenyl tetrazolium salt (MTT).  This tetrazole is used in the MTT assay to quantify the respiratory activity of live cells in cell culture, although it generally kills the cells in the process. Tetrazole's derivatives can also be used in DNA synthesis.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | date = Feb 11, 1989 | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–864 | title = Studies on the role of tetrazole in the activation of phosphoramidites | author = S Berner, K Mühlegger, and H Seliger | pmc = 331708[/tpl]
Some tetrazole derivatives with high energy have been investigated as high performance explosives as a replacement for TNT and also for use in high performance solid rocket propellant formulations.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2008/October/02100801.asp | title = Greener explosives show promise | date = 2 October 2008 | publisher = Chemistry World[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = New Energetic Materials featuring Tetrazoles and Nitramines – Synthesis, Characterization and Properties  | author = Niko Fischer, Konstantin Karaghiosoff, Thomas M.

Other tetrazoles are used for their explosive or combustive properties, such as tetrazole itself and 5-aminotetrazole, which are sometimes used as a component of gas generators in automobile airbags. Tetrazole based energetic materials produce high-temperature, non-toxic reaction products such as water and nitrogen gas,[tpl]cite journal | chapter = Energetic Tetrazole N-oxides | author = Tore Brinck, Thomas M.

The delocalization energy in tetrazole is 209 kJ/mol.
