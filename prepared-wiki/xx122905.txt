==Career==

===Nottingham Forest===

Robertson started his career as a junior in Heart of Midlothian's youth system but moved south of the border to join Nottingham Forest in February 2001.
After progressing through the Red's academy, Robertson made his debut in September 2003 against Tranmere Rovers in the Carling Cup, which Forest won on penalties after a goalless draw.
He made his Championship league debut against local rivals Derby County four days later as a late substitute in a 1-1 draw at the City Ground. His full league debut came the following week against Preston North End in a 1-0 home defeat.
Robertson went on to make a total of 44 appearances for Nottingham Forest.

===Rotherham United===

In June 2005 Robertson signed for League One Rotherham United. He made his debut in a 2-1 home defeat to Walsall in the opening fixture that season.
Robertson spent 2 years at the club making a total of 56 appearances and scoring 1 goal in a 2-0 victory away to Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.

===Chesterfield===

Robertson joined League Two Chesterfield in June 2007. He made his debut in the Spireites opening league fixture of the season, a 0-0 draw away to Chester City. He netted his first goal for the club in a 3-1 win away at local rivals Mansfield Town that season, scoring direct from a corner kick.
In November 2009, Robertson suffered a double leg break in an innocuous tackle in a Johnstone's Paint Trophy tie against Carlisle United. After a year on the sidelines he returned to action in November 2010 in a 2-0 FA Cup 1st round victory away to Harrow Borough.
Robertson went on to make a total of 23 appearances that season in Chesterfield's 2010/11 League Two winning campaign, enjoying a successful spell at centre half for much of it. However, he suffered an achilles tendon rupture away to Hereford United in April, ruling him out for the last few games of the season and much of the next.
Robertson returned to action in League One the next season in a 1-0 Boxing Day defeat away to Huddersfield Town and was part of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy winning squad that season.
Robertson made a total of 133 appearances for Chesterfield, scoring 3 goals.
