==Plot==

Two couples (Robert Reed, June Kenney, Joan Lora, and Eugene Persson) are on a boating trip when they come across an uncharted island.  The four investigate and find themselves in the clutches of Dr. Albert Balleau (Wilton Graff), whose hobby is hunting both animals and humans.
After learning about the terrible secrets of the island from the doctor's wife (Lilyan Chauvin) and her boyfriend (Walter Brooke) as well as an investigation, the group tries to escape only to be thwarted by Dr. Balleau and his henchmen.  Balleau's wife and her lover are slain and stuffed, while the men are forced to participate in a The Most Dangerous Game-style hunt, with their girlfriends soon joining them.  The hunt includes Balleau's sailor henchmen and hidden traps, as well as Balleau's deadly skill. At the end, Balleu becomes the last one to be hunted when killed by his assistant Jondor.
