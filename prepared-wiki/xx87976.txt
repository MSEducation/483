Lalor station, like the suburb in which it is located, was originally pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɔː|l|ər[/tpl] (locally [tpl]IPA|ˈloːlə[/tpl]), as it was named after Peter Lalor, and although some people still pronounce it as such, in recent times the pronunciation [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|l|ɔr[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|-|l|ər[/tpl] (locally [tpl]IPA|-lə[/tpl]) has become predominant.
In addition, the Victorian Railways Newsletter of 1973 and Victorian RailWays of 1974—Victorian Railways in-house newsletters—stated that the correct pronunciation was [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɔː|l|ər[/tpl] (locally [tpl]IPA|ˈloːlə[/tpl]).Victorian Railways News Letter, April 1973, p. 50 and Victorian RailWays, October 1974, p. 155.
