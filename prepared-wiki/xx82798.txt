==Experience==

Upon completing his B.S. degree from Columbia, Massimino worked for IBM as a systems engineer in New York City from 1984 until 1986. In 1986 he entered graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he conducted research on human operator control of space robotics systems in the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department's Human-machine systems Laboratory. His work resulted in the awarding of two patents. While a student at MIT he worked during the Summer of 1987 as a general engineer at NASA Headquarters in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology, during the summers of 1988 and 1989 as a research fellow in the Man-Systems Integration Branch at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and during the summer of 1990 as a visiting research engineer at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. After graduating from MIT in 1992, Massimino worked at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Houston, Texas as a research engineer where he developed laptop computer displays to assist operators of the Space Shuttle remote manipulator system. These displays included the Manipulator Position Display, which was evaluated on STS-69. From 1992 to 1995 he was also an adjunct assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering & Material Sciences Department at Rice University, where he taught feedback control of mechanical systems. In September 1995, Massimino joined the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. At Georgia Tech he taught human-machine systems engineering classes and conducted research on human-machine interfaces for space and aircraft systems in the Center for Human-Machine Systems Research, and is currently an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech. He has published papers in technical journals and in the proceedings of technical conferences.  In 2011, Massimino co-hosted season three of National Geographic Channel's Known Universe documentary series along with Sigrid Close, Andy Howell, David E. Kaplan, and Steve Jacobs.IMDB – Known Universe (TV Series 2009– )

==NASA career==

Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1996, Massimino reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of initial training and evaluation and is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Prior to his first space flight assignment, Massimino served in the Astronaut Office Robotics Branch, and in the Astronaut Office Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Branch. He has served as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in Mission Control and performed other technical tasks in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch. Currently he is on loan from the Johnson Space Center and serves as a visiting professor at Columbia University teaching a course on human spaceflight.

==Spaceflight experience==

STS-109 Columbia (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope leaving it with a new power unit, a new camera (the Advanced Camera for Surveys), and new solar arrays. STS-109 set a record for spacewalk time with 35 hours and 55 minutes during 5 spacewalks. Massimino performed two spacewalks totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 4.5 million statute miles in over 262 hours and 10 minutes.
STS-125 Atlantis (May 11–24, 2009) was the final Hubble servicing mission by the Space Shuttle.  Atlantis landed in California after stormy weather prevented the shuttle from landing at NASA's home base in Florida as previously planned. During the mission Massimino became the first person to use Twitter in space.Hubble astronaut sends first ever Twitter message from space to say he is 'enjoying the view' Rather than using the service directly while on-orbit, however, Massimino composed his messages and shared them with Mission Control which then posted the messages via the Internet to Twitter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/etan_on_tech/2009/05/the-great-debate-over-astro-mikes-tweets-from-space.html|title=The great debate over Astro Mike's 'tweets from space'|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel|date=May 22, 2009|first=Etan|last=Horowitz|accessdate=October 2, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Massimino's public updates about his training for the STS-125 mission began April 3, 2009[tpl]cite web | last=Massimino | first=Mike | title=Astro_Mike | publisher=Twitter | date=2009-04-03 |url=http://twitter.com/Astro_Mike | accessdate = 2009-05-28[/tpl] and he remains active on the service as of July 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://twitter.com/Astro_Mike/status/5009637822|title=October 19, 2009 tweet|publisher=Twitter|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]
