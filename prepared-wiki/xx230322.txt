==History==

The hamlet of Chelsea was originally known as Low Point (to distinguish it from the next hamlet north on the east bank of the river, once known as High Point, now New Hamburg). The hamlet was called Low Point until the completion of the Hudson River Railroad. At that time it was named Carthage. However as mail was being misdirected to another Carthage in Jefferson County, it was renamed Carthage Landing. In 1901, when the railroad built a new station, the name became Chelsea.Carthage Landing
Carthage Landing had at one time a shipyard owned by Cornelius Carman, where sloops and steamboats were launched, but it could not withstand the competition with Fishkill Landing after John Peter DeWint completed the Long Dock about 1815, with facilities for the shipment of produce from the back country.Clapp, Clinton W., "Town of Wappinger" in Hasbrouck's History of Dutchess County p.470 Carman introduce the first centerboard on the sloop Freedom. In 1828 he built the Plow Boy, a steam ferry-boat, for Carpenter and De Windt of Fishkill Landing. It was the first steam ferry to ply between Fishkill Landing and Newburgh. Between 1868 and 1888 Low Point could boast of eight sloops and schooners, including the Fancy, the Henrietta Collyer, the Lydia White, and the Matteawan. Capt. John Pinckney was captain of the schooner Iron Age running from the Manhattan Iron Works.Verplanck, Wm. E. and Collyer, Moses W., The Sloops of the Hudson, G.P.Putnam's Sons, New York, 1908 Captain Charles P. Adriance, Solomon P. Hopkins, and Gilbert S. Hopkins conducted a freighting business from Low Point until 1856.
When the Hudson River Railroad was built, the shipping of goods by water from Low Point fell off.
A post office at Low Point was established about 1840.Smith, James Hadden, History of Dutchess County with Illustrations and Biographical Sketch, Syracuse, D. Mason & Co., 1882
St. Mark's Episcopal Church was founded in 1865 by John A. Taplin and thirteen other residents of Carthage Landing, now known as Chelsea, in the Town of Wappinger.  In June, 1869 the Rt. Rev. Horatio Potter, Bishop of New York dedicated the new church building.  It is in the style of "Carpenter Gothic".  The board and batten construction, according to Dutchess County historians, exemplifies "Upjohn inspired parish churches built from Gothic Revival pattern books."History of St. Mark's
A yacht club was organized in the late 1881 for the purpose of ice yachting.Turner, David Wappingers, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, SC, 2011, ISBN 978-0-7385-7559-9
The Chelsea Fire Company located in the Town of Wappinger was formed on April 1, 1946. The area was considered “no mans land” as far as fire protection since no other community company covered the area. A group of concerned citizens decided to do something about the situation. It was voted to form a “fire company”. Rather than wait to secure a bond to fund an equipment purchase, a group of nineteen men decided to put up $1,800 out of their own pockets for a war surplus fire truck. Thus, the company acquired their first piece of equipment, a 1943 Ford Pumper with a 200 gallon tank. Today, the Chelsea Fire District covers properties in the Town of Wappinger and the Town of Fishkill of about 8 square miles, including a portion of the Hudson River. The fire district includes Stony Kill Farm, an 800 acre state farm and education center, and Dutchess Stadium a minor league baseball stadium home to the Hudson Valley Renegades.The Chelsea Fire Company
Chelsea is currently the home to the Chelsea Yacht Club, two historic churches, a post office, and several national historic register named homes. The town historians of the Town of Wappinger are Brenda Von Burg and Joey Cavaccini

==Historic buildings==

The former Chelsea Grammar School is located on Liberty Street. The first public schoolhouse in the Town of Wappinger, it housed children up until high school. It is an intact one-room schoolhouse from the late 19th century, when the hamlet was a thriving Hudson River port. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its use as a school ended in the mid-20th century when the smaller local school districts of the area were consolidated into the Wappinger Central School District. Since then, the local fire department has used half of it as a community center, and the United States Postal Service has leased the other half for use as the local post office, serving the 12512 ZIP Code.
The Captain Moses W. Collyer House, aka "Driftwood", is located on River Road South in Chelsea, New York, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Moses Collyer was a riverboat captain on the nearby Hudson, from 1899 until his death on September 22, 1942. He cowrote "The Sloops of the Hudson", a memoir and history of the years when sailboats were the primary means of getting up and down the river. An exhaustive and complete work that drew on Collyer's background in a riverfaring family, it is today considered the definitive history of that era and its boats.
