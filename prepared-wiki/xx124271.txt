In 1961, tin mining started in the town, and continued until 1986. The tin mine was reopened in late 2001 but closed in mid-2004 after Marlborough Resources was placed under voluntary administration due to disappointing results at its new processing plant, poor tin price hedging results, and lower-than-expected tin reserves.USGS Minerals - Tin in August 2004 - Retrieved September 2009.
