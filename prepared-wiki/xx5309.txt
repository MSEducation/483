[[Jet stream]]

CATEGORIES: Atmospheric dynamics, Wind

Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth.[tpl]cite web | url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/jet-stream/?ar_a=1 | title =Jet stream | author =National Geographic | publisher =nationalgeographic.com | date =July 7, 2013[/tpl] The main jet streams are located near the tropopause, the transition between the troposphere (where temperature decreases with altitude) and the stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude).[tpl]cite web | author=United States Department of Energy | date=26 June 2002 | url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/wea00/wea00135.htm | title=Ask a Scientist | accessdate=5 May 2008[/tpl] The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape; jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including the opposite direction of most of the jet. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at around [tpl]convert|7|-|12|km|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, and the higher and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at around [tpl]convert|10|-|16|km|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have both a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round.
Jet streams are caused by a combination of a planet's rotation on its axis and atmospheric heating (by solar radiation and, on some planets other than Earth, internal heat). Jet streams form near boundaries of adjacent air masses with significant differences in temperature, such as the polar region and the warmer air towards the equator.[tpl]cite web | author=University of Illinois | url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cyc/upa/jet.rxml | title=Jet Stream | accessdate=4 May 2008[/tpl]
Other jet streams also exist. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically in a region where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States.
Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against the flow of a jet stream. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times.

==Discovery==

After the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years. They labelled the phenomenon the "equatorial smoke stream".[tpl]Cite news| last =Winchester | first =Simon | authorlink = Simon Winchester | title =A Tale of Two Volcanos | newspaper =New York Times | pages = | date =15 April 2010 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/opinion/16winchester.html | postscript =[/tpl][ref]See:
German meteorologist Heinrich Seilkopf is credited with coining a special term, Strahlströmung (literally "jet streaming"), for the phenomenon in 1939.Seilkopf, H., Maritime meteorologie, which is volume II of: R. Habermehl, ed., Handbuch der Fliegenwetterkunde of Aeronautical Meteorology (Berlin, Germany: Gebrüder Radetzke Brothers, 1939); Seilkopf coins the word "Strahlströmung" on page 142 and discusses the jet stream on pages 142-150.Arbeiten zur allgemeinen Klimatologie By Hermann Flohn p. 47 (Modern German usage is "Strahlstrom".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]) Many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight-path traversals during World War II.

==Description==

Polar jet streams are typically located near the 250 hPa pressure level, or [tpl]convert|7|to|12|km|mi[/tpl] above sea level, while the weaker subtropical jet streams are much higher, between [tpl]convert|10|and|16|km|mi[/tpl] above sea level. In each hemisphere, both upper-level jet streams form near breaks in the tropopause, which is at a higher altitude near the equator than it is over the poles, with large changes in its height occurring near the location of the jet stream.David R. Cook Jet Stream Behavior. Retrieved on 8 May 2008.B. Geerts and E. Linacre. The Height of the Tropopause. Retrieved on 8 May 2008. The northern hemisphere polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30°N and 60°N, while the northern subtropical jet stream is located close to latitude 30°N. The upper level jet stream is said to "follow the sun" as it moves northward during the warm season, or late spring and summer, and southward during the cold season, or autumn and winter.National Weather Service JetStream. The Jet Stream. Retrieved on 8 May 2008.McDougal Littell. Paths of Polar and Subtropical Jet Streams. Retrieved on 13 May 2008.
The width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than five kilometres (3 mi).[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/balloon/science/jetstream.html | title=Frequently Asked Questions About The Jet Stream | publisher = NOVA | accessdate=24 October 2008[/tpl]
Jet streams are typically continuous over long distances, but discontinuities are common.Glossary of Meteorology. Jet Stream. Retrieved on 8 May 2008. The path of the jet typically has a meandering shape, and these meanders themselves propagate east, at lower speeds than that of the actual wind within the flow. Each large meander, or wave, within the jet stream is known as a Rossby wave. Rossby waves are caused by changes in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Shortwave troughs are smaller packets of upper level energy, on the scale of [tpl]convert|1000|to-|4000|km|mi[/tpl] long,Glossary of Meteorology. Cyclone wave. Retrieved on 13 May 2008. that move through the flow pattern around large scale, or longwave, ridges and troughs within Rossby waves.Glossary of Meteorology. Short wave. Retrieved on 13 May 2008. Jet streams can split into two due to the formation of an upper-level closed low, that diverts a portion of the jet stream under its base, while the remainder of the jet moves by to its north.
The wind speeds vary according to the temperature gradient, exceeding [tpl]convert|92|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on[/tpl], although speeds of over [tpl]convert|398|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on[/tpl] have been measured.[ref]Robert Roy Britt.

Retrieved on 4 May 2008.[/ref] Meteorologists now understand that the path of jet streams steers cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting. For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer.[tpl]Cite web|title = Why has it been so wet? |publisher = BBC |date = 23 July 2007 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6911918.stm |accessdate =31 July 2007 [/tpl]Blackburn, Mike; Hoskins, Brian; Slingo, Julia: [tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.walker-institute.ac.uk/news/summer_2007.pdf |title = Notes on the Meteorological Context of the UK Flooding in June and July 2007 |publisher = Walker Institute for Climate System Research |date = 25 July 2007 |accessdate =29 August 2007 |format = PDF [/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title = Why, oh why, does it keep raining? |publisher = BBC |date = 10 July 2012 |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18783422 |accessdate =18 July 2012[/tpl]
The polar and subtropical jets merge at some locations and times, while at other times they are well separated.

==Cause==

In general, winds are strongest immediately under the tropopause (except during tornadoes, hurricanes or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference (which causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.John P. Stimac. Air pressure and wind. Retrieved on 8 May 2008.
All these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces on an atmospheric parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the pressure gradient and the force of gravity, a balance referred to as hydrostatic. In the horizontal, the dominant balance outside of the tropics is between the Coriolis effect and the pressure gradient, a balance referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. This means that temperatures decreasing polewards implies that winds develop a larger eastward component as one moves upwards. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the equator is warmer than the north and south poles.

===Polar jet===

The thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized in tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor that contributes to the sharpness of the polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical airmasses by the more dense polar airmasses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.

===Subtropical jet===

A second factor which contributes to jet sharpness is more appropriate for the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, mainly because of thunderstorm systems in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction is slight above the ground. In the Northern Hemisphere motions are deflected to the right by the Coriolis force, which for poleward (northward) moving air implies an increased eastward component of the windsLyndon State College Meteorology. Jet Stream Formation – Subtropical Jet. Retrieved on 8 May 2008. (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere also leads to eastward motion). Around 30 degrees from the equator the jet wind speeds have become strong enough that were the jet to extend further polewards the increased windspeed would be unstable; thus the jet is limited.

===Other planets===

Jupiter's atmosphere has multiple jet streams, caused by the convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating.Robert Roy Britt. et Streams On Earth and Jupiter. Retrieved on 4 May 2008. The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.

==Some effects==

===Precipitation===

===Hurricane protection===

The jet stream is thought to be one of the reasons most of the Hawaiian Islands have been resistant to the long list of Hawaii hurricanes that have approached. For example, when Hurricane Flossie approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall, NOAA cited vertical wind shear as evidenced in the photo.NOAA Overview of Hurricane Flossie

==Uses==

On Earth, the northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies the northern polar jet stream.

===Aviation===

The location of the jet stream is extremely important for aviation. Commercial use of the jet stream began on 18 November 1952, when Pan Am flew from Tokyo to Honolulu at an altitude of [tpl]convert|7600|m|ft[/tpl]. It cut the trip time by over one-third, from 18 to 11.5 hours.[tpl]cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Frank J.|title=The Jet Stream Is The Villain|journal=Popular Mechanics|year=1958|pages=97|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5d0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=1952+tokyo+honolulu|accessdate=13 December 2010[/tpl] Not only does it cut time off the flight, it also nets fuel savings for the airline industry.Ned Rozell. Amazing flying machines allow time travel. Retrieved on 8 May 2008. Within North America, the time needed to fly east across the continent can be decreased by about 30 minutes if an airplane can fly with the jet stream, or increased by more than that amount if it must fly west against it.
Associated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the jet streams.BBC. Jet Streams in the UK.

===Future power generation===

Scientists are investigating ways to harness the wind energy within the jet stream. According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only 1 percent would be needed to meet the world's current energy needs. The required technology would reportedly take 10–20 years to develop.Keay Davidson. Scientists look high in the sky for power. Retrieved on 8 May 2008.

Near the end of World War II the Japanese fire balloon was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.The Fire Balloons

==Changes due to climate cycles==

===Effects of ENSO===

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the average location of upper-level jet streams, and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe.Davide Zanchettin, Stewart W. Franks, Pietro Traverso, and Mario Tomasino.

====La Niña====

Across North America during La Niña, increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track and jet stream.Nathan Mantua.

===Dust Bowl===

Evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partially responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.Weather at About.com. Causes of the Dust Bowl in the United States. Retrieved on 10 June 2008.

==Longer-term climatic changes==

Climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of global warming.  Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe.  This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.[tpl]cite web|first=Bryan|last=Walsh|title=Polar Vortex: Climate Change Might Just Be Driving the Historic Cold Snap|url=http://science.time.com/2014/01/06/climate-change-driving-cold-weather/|publisher=TIME|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Friedlander|first=Blaine|title=Arctic ice loss amplified Superstorm Sandy violence|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/03/arctic-ice-loss-amplified-superstorm-sandy-violence|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Spotts|first=Pete|title=How frigid 'polar vortex' could be result of global warming (+video)|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0106/How-frigid-polar-vortex-could-be-result-of-global-warming-video|accessdate=January 8, 2014|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=January 6, 2014[/tpl][ref]
Since 2007, and particularly in 2012 and early 2013, the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the UK, lying closer to the English Channel, around 50°N rather than its more usual north of Scotland latitude of around 60°N. However, between 1979 and 2001, it has been found that the average position of the jet stream has been moving northward at a rate of [tpl]convert|2.01|km|mi[/tpl] per year across the Northern Hemisphere. Across North America, this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and more frequent and more intense tropical cyclones in the tropics. A similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the Southern Hemisphere jet stream over the same time frame.Associated Press. Jet stream found to be permanently drifting north.

==Other upper-level jets==

===Polar night jet===

The polar-night jet stream forms only during the winter months, i.e., polar nights, of the year in their respective hemispheres at around 60° latitude, but at a greater height than the polar jet, of about [tpl]convert|80000|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web| title=Jet Streams around the World | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/jetstreams_world.shtml | publisher=BBC[/tpl] During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the equator. This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere, which, when combined with the Coriolis effect, create the polar night jets, racing eastward at an altitude of about [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web| title=The Jet Stream | url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF6/640.html |last=Gedney | first=Larry | publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks | year=1983[/tpl] Inside the polar night jet is the polar vortex. The warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex, but not enter it. Within the vortex, the cold polar air becomes cooler and cooler with neither warmer air from lower latitudes nor energy from the sun during the polar night.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.stat.osu.edu/~sses/collab_ozone_split_background.php | title=2002 Ozone-Hole Splitting – Background | publisher=Ohio State University[/tpl]

==Low level jets==

There are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets.

===Barrier jet===

A barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent.J. D. Doyle. The influence of mesoscale orography on a coastal jet and rainband. Retrieved on 25 December 2008.

===Valley exit jet===

A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20 m/s (45 mph) at a height of 40–200 m above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation but are significantly weaker.
They are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.Whiteman, C. David (2000).
