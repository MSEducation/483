The quantum Hall effect (or integer quantum Hall effect) is a quantum-mechanical version of the Hall effect, observed in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, in which the Hall conductance G undergoes certain quantum Hall transitions to take on the quantized values

==Applications==

The quantization of the Hall conductance has the important property of being incredibly precise. Actual measurements of the Hall conductance have been found to be integer or fractional multiples of e2/h to nearly one part in a billion. This phenomenon, referred to as "exact quantization", has been shown to be a subtle manifestation of the principle of gauge invariance.[tpl]cite journal|last=Laughlin|first=R.|title=Quantized Hall conductivity in two dimensions|journal=Physical Review B|year=1981|volume=23|issue=10|pages=5632–5633|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.23.5632|url=http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v23/i10/p5632_1|accessdate=8 May 2012|bibcode = 1981PhRvB..23.5632L [/tpl]  It has allowed for the definition of a new practical standard for electrical resistance, based on the resistance quantum given by the von Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 = 25812.807557(18) Ω.[tpl]cite journal|year = 2010|title = Towards a quantum resistance standard based on epitaxial graphene|journal = Nature Nanotechnology|volume = 5|issue = 3|pages = 186–189|doi = 10.1038/nnano.2009.474 | url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v5/n3/abs/nnano.2009.474.html|pmid = 20081845|bibcode = 2010NatNa...5..186T|last1 = Tzalenchuk|first1 = Alexander|last2 = Lara-Avila|first2 = Samuel|last3 = Kalaboukhov|first3 = Alexei|last4 = Paolillo|first4 = Sara|last5 = Syväjärvi|first5 = Mikael|last6 = Yakimova|first6 = Rositza|last7 = Kazakova|first7 = Olga|last8 = Janssen|first8 = T.

==History==

The integer quantization of the Hall conductance was originally predicted by Ando, Matsumoto, and Uemura in 1975, on the basis of an approximate calculation which they themselves did not believe to be true. Several workers subsequently observed the effect in experiments carried out on the inversion layer of MOSFETs. It was only in 1980 that Klaus von Klitzing, working at the high magnetic field laboratory in Grenoble with silicon-based samples developed by Michael Pepper and Gerhard Dorda, made the unexpected discovery that the Hall conductivity was exactly quantized. For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics. The link between exact quantization and gauge invariance was subsequently found by Robert Laughlin. Most integer quantum Hall experiments are now performed on gallium arsenide heterostructures, although many other semiconductor materials can be used. In 2007, the integer quantum Hall effect was reported in graphene at temperatures as high as room temperature,[tpl]cite journal|year = 2007|title = Room-Temperature Quantum Hall Effect in Graphene|journal = Science|volume = 315|issue = 5817|pages = 1379|doi = 10.1126/science.1137201| pmid = 17303717|arxiv=cond-mat/0702408|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1379N|last1 = Novoselov|first1 = K.

==Integer quantum Hall effect – Landau levels==

==Mathematics==

The integers that appear in the Hall effect are examples of topological quantum numbers. They are known in mathematics as the first Chern numbers and are closely related to Berry's phase. A striking model of much interest in this context is the Azbel-Harper-Hofstadter model whose quantum phase diagram is the Hofstadter butterfly shown in the figure. The vertical axis is the strength of the magnetic field and the horizontal axis is the chemical potential, which fixes the electron density. The colors represent the integer Hall conductances. Warm colors represent positive integers and cold colors negative integers. The phase diagram is fractal and has structure on all scales. In the figure there is an obvious self-similarity.
Concerning physical mechanisms, impurities and/or particular states (e.g., edge currents) are important for both the 'integer' and 'fractional' effects. In addition, Coulomb interaction is also essential in the fractional quantum Hall effect. The observed strong similarity between integer and fractional quantum Hall effects is explained by the tendency of electrons to form bound states with an even number of magnetic flux quanta, called composite fermions.
