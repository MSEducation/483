CATEGORIES: Ukrainian Canadian culture, Canadian comedy songs

Giants of the Prairies is a song by the Canadian polka band, the Kubasonics.  
It tells the story of the numerous "world's biggest" roadside attractions to be found in Western Canada, especially in small towns populated mostly by Ukrainian Canadians.
Brian Cherwick, the leader of the Kubasonics, has a Ph.D. from the Centre for Ukrainian Canadian Studies at the University of Manitoba, titled "Polkas on the Prairies: Ukrainian Music and the Construction of Identity".
