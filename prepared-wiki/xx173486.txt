In art, his portraits conventionally show a crescent moon on the front of his helmet,Baird, Merrily C. (2001). Symbols of Japan: Thematic Motifs in Art and Design, p. 33; excerpt, "The crescent moon, in particular, was believed to have protective powers, and it appeared as a frontispiece element on the helmets of a number of warriors, including Yamanaka Shikanosuke Yukimori" but he was in fact born under a harvest moon.Turnbull, Stephen R. (2008). The Samurai swordsman : master of war, p. 63.  The crescent moon ornament he wore on his helmet was a token of good luck.Walters Art Museum (Baltimore), Tsuki hyakushi by Taiso Yoshitoshi (1839-1892); retrieved 2013-5-6. 

==Warrior career==

Yukimori supported the cause of Amako Katsuhisa (1553-1578), including the Siege of Kōzuki Castle.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] He even tried to get help from the Oda clan. Unfortunately, Oda Nobunaga only used him so the Oda army could march deeper into the Mōri clan's lands. Akechi Mitsuhide and Hashiba Hideyoshi wanted to give him reinforcements, but Nobunaga refused. Therefore, those two generals were forced into concentrating on laying siege to the Mōri and Ukita castles rather than helping Yukimori.
Eventually, Yukimori surrendered and his master Katsuhisa committed suicide. Kikkawa Motoharu awarded him with a small castle in Suo. When on the way to the castle, Yukimori was captured and attacked by the soldiers of Mōri clan.
