==Birth of the ironclads==

When steam propulsion began to be applied to warships, naval constructors renewed their interest in armor for their vessels. Experiments had been tried with armor during the Crimean War, just prior to the American Civil War,Gibbon 1983, p. 13. and the British and French navies had each built armored ships and were planning to build others. In 1860, the French Navy commissioned [tpl]Ship|French battleship|La Gloire||2[/tpl], the world's first ocean-going ironclad warship. Great Britain followed a year later with [tpl]HMS|Warrior|1860|6[/tpl].Gibbon 1983, pp. 28–31.Contemplation of armor was not confined to Europe. The United States had spent a lot of money supporting the development of the Stevens Battery, with nothing to show for it. (Davis, Duel between the first two ironclads, p. 5.) Also, a river boatman at New Orleans, John A. Stevenson, early in the war had converted a tugboat into an armored vessel. As CSS Manassas, she was actually the first armored vessel to go into combat in the war. (Still, Iron afloat, pp. 46–51.) The  use of armor remained controversial, however, and the United States Navy was generally reluctant to embrace the new technology.Anderson 1962, p. 67.
