Robert Hiltzik is best known for being the director of the 1983 summer camp slasher film Sleepaway Camp, which garnered a cult following.  
Hiltzik graduated from Williams College and continued to NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for film and then attended Hofstra University Law School. He now works as a partner in a New York City law firm. 
Hiltzik had no idea that his Sleepaway Camp had gained such a devoted following over the years until he was contacted in March 2000 by Sleepawaycampmovies.com's Jeff Hayes who then arranged for him to record a commentary for the Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD. After a number of sequels directed and written by others, Hiltzik returned in 2004 to write and direct the sequel, Return to Sleepaway Camp. He decided that this newest chapter would ignore the storylines of the other sequels, stating that he wanted to pick up from where the original film had ended. The production was halted for quite some time (according to Fangoria.com, the digital effects were being redone) before finally being released in 2008 as a direct-to-video sequel. As of September 2011, Hiltzik has directed only these two films; he is currently directing another sequel, Sleepaway Camp Reunion.The Internet Movie Database entry for Sleepaway Camp Reunion
