[[Three-check chess]]

CATEGORIES: Chess variants

Three-check chess is a variation of chess, in which a player wins if he checks his opponent three times.  Anatoly Karpov is said to excel in this chess variant [tpl]harvcol|Pritchard|2007|p=83[/tpl]. 
This chess variant is much more tactical than standard chess, sacrifices are very common, there are a lot of traps in the opening.  Two checks is already a big advantage and may be worth more than one piece. The game rarely reaches endgame â€“ usually it is decided before queens are traded.
