CATEGORIES: Poetry movements

Infrarrealismo is a poetic movement founded in Mexico City in 1975 by a group of twenty young poets including Roberto Bolaño, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro, José Vicente Anaya, Rubén Medina and José Rosas Ribeyro. After fleeing from the 1973 events in Chile which saw Augusto Pinochet take power from Salvador Allende in a coup, Bolaño (a Chilean who had previously spent 5 years living in Mexico) met Santiago Papasquiaro in the Café La Habana in Mexico City, beginning a long friendship between the two which marked the beginning of infrarrealismo.Madariaga, 2011, op. cit. pp. 125-134; chap. 8: «Después de la aventura». The movement was formally founded in Bruno Montané Krebs's house.[tpl]cite web |author=Roberto Careaga: La Tercera |title=Libro recrea la guerrilla mexicana de Bolaño |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/cultura/2012/11/1453-495719-9-libro-recrea-la-guerrilla-mexicana-de-bolano.shtml |date=28 November 2012[/tpl] There were forty people at the meeting, which was led by Bolaño.
