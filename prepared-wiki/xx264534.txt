==Training style==

Standing in direct contrast to sporting opinion at the time, Sarul believed that outright strength was not the most important factor in shot putting and that correct, natural technique was the key to good performances. He also used varying loads in weight training and recommended against repeatedly using heavy loads: "I believe that the strength required in the shot put is slightly different from that achieved with the barbell".Edward Sarul's Views of the Shot Put. Spordileht, Estonian SSR, No. 74, July 1985. Retrieved on 2011-01-02.
In training, he frequently used lighter shots than the typical 7 kg required for competition. He suggested that more generalised fitness training would be beneficial for younger throwing athletes, leaving strength training until their twenties, although he advocated perfecting technique from an early age. He demonstrated his superior lifting speed in trials for Dr. Bogdan Poprawski's paper Strength, Power and Speed in Shot Put Training at the Poznan Sport Institute.Strength, Power and Speed in Shot Put Training.
