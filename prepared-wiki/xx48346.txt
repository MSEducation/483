C. immitis resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, most notably in California and Arizona. It is also prevalent in northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/valley-fever/DS00695/DSECTION=all&METHOD=print | title=Valley fever | publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) | date=July 6, 2012 | accessdate=12 July 2013 | author=By Mayo Clinic staff[/tpl] It is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when the rains come. The spores, known as arthroconidia, are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake.[tpl]Cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.904 |title=A coccidioidomycosis outbreak following the Northridge, Calif, earthquake |author=Schneider E, Hajjeh RA, Spiegel RA, et al. |journal=JAMA |year=1997 |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=904–8 |pmid=9062329 |postscript=[/tpl]
Infection is caused by inhalation of the particles. The disease is not transmitted from person to person. The infection ordinarily resolves leaving the patient with a specific immunity to re-infection.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Mycoses/Dimorphic_systemic/Coccidioidomycosis/ | title=Coccidioidomycosis | publisher=The University of Adelaide | work=Mycology Online | accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] However, in some cases the infection may manifest itself repeatedly or permanently over the life of the host.  C. immitis is a dimorphic saprophytic organism that grows as a mycelium in the soil and produces a spherule form in the host organism.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptomatic infection (40% of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain).[tpl]cite news |title=Cases Of Mysterious Valley Fever Rise In American Southwest|author=Rebecca Plevin|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/05/13/181880987/cases-of-mysterious-valley-fever-rise-in-american-southwest|newspaper=NPR|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition = 4th | pages = 680–83 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 [/tpl] The rash is maculopapular. Erythema nodosum on lower extremities, and erythema multiforme in necklace-like fashion can occur predominantly in women.
Some patients fail to recover and develop chronic pulmonary infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting meninges, soft tissues, joints, and bone). Severe pulmonary disease may develop in HIV-infected persons.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ampel N | title = Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1174–8 | year = 2005 |pmid = 16163637 | doi = 10.1086/444502[/tpl]
In order of decreasing risk, people of Filipino, African, Native American, Hispanic, and Asian descent are more susceptible to the disseminated form of the disease than other ethnic backgrounds.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious_diseases/fungi/coccidioidomycosis.html?qt=&sc=&alt= | title=Coccidioidomycosis (San Joaquin Fever; Valley Fever) | publisher=Merck & Co. | work=The Merck Manual | accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to the disease.

===Types===

After  Coccidioides infection, Coccidioidomycosis begins with Valley fever, which is its initial acute form. If left untreated, it can progress to chronic and then to disseminated Coccidioidomycosis. Therefore, Coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types:[tpl]cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al.|title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi=|accessdate=|pages=[/tpl]

===Complications===

Most of the infected humans don't experience any symptoms or consequences. Serious complications may occur in patients with weakened immune systems, including severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and possible disseminated form, where the infection spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of Coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, swollen joints with severe pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, and meningitis, which can lead to death.Galgiani J. N. Coccidioidomycosis. In: Cecil, Russell L., Lee Goldman, and D. A. Ausiello. Cecil Medicine. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier, 2007.

==Cause==

In soil (and also in agar media), coccidioides  exists in filament form. It forms hyphae in both horizontal and vertical directions. With time, cells within hyphae degenerate to form alternating barrel-shaped cells (arthroconidia). Arthroconidia are light-weight and carried by air currents. They can be easily inhaled without the person knowing. On arriving in alveoli, they enlarge in size and internal septations are developed. This structure is called a spherule. Septations develop and form endospores. Rupture of spherules release these endospores, which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection locally. Nodules can form in lungs surrounding these spherules. When they rupture, they release their contents into bronchi, forming thin-walled cavities. These cavities can result in symptoms like characteristic chest pain, hemoptysis and persistent cough. In immunocompromised individuals, infection spreads through blood.

==Diagnosis==

The fungal infection can be demonstrated by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids, exudates, sputum and biopsy-tissue by methods of Papanicolaou or Gomori's methenamine silver staining. These stains can demonstrate spherules and surrounding inflammation.
With specific nucleotide primers C.immitis DNA can be amplified by PCR. It can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with C.immitis RNA. C. immitis and C. posadasii cannot be distinguished on cytology or by symptoms; but only by DNA PCR.
An indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal antigen or host IgM or IgG antibody produced against the fungus. The available tests include the tube-precipitin (TP) assays, complement fixation assays, and enzyme immunoassays. TP antibody is not found in CSF. TP antibody is specific and is used as confirmatory test, while ELISA is sensitive and thus used for screening.
Chest X-Ray usually shows nodules in upper lobes of the lung, usually less than 4 cm in diameter. They rarely calcify.
If meninges are affected, CSF will show hypoglycorrhachia (abnormally low glucose levels in CSF), decreased proteins and lymphatic pleocytosis. Rarely, CSF eosinophilia is present.
The disease is commonly misdiagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia and sometimes as cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chen, Karl T.

==Treatment==

Less than 5% of infected,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23068145 | title=Coccidioidomycosis | author=Welsh O., Vera-Cabrera L., Rendon A. | journal=Clinics in dermatology |date=November–December 2012 | volume=30 | issue=6 | pages=573–591 | doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2012.01.003 | pmid=23068145[/tpl] usually immunocompromised, humans develop a disease, and some mild asymptomatic cases often do not require any treatment. Some patients with severe symptoms may warrant anti-fungal therapy.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/Coccidioidomycosis.pdf | title=Coccidioidomycosis | publisher=Infectious Diseases Society of America | work=Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Coccidioidomycosis |accessdate=10 July 2013 | author=Galgiani, John N.,  Ampel, Neil M. ,  Blair, Janis E., et al[/tpl] There is a lack of prospective studies that examine optimal anti-fungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis.
On the whole, oral fluconazole and intravenous amphotericin B are used in progressive or disseminated disease, or in which patients are immunocompromised. Alternatively, itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barron MA and Madinger NE |title=Opportunistic Fungal Infections, Part 3: Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, and Emerging Mould Infections|journal=Infections in Medicine |date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1404367[/tpl] Fluconazole is preferred drug for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected patient's bones and joints. Posaconazole and voriconazole have also been employed.

==Prevention==

There is currently no completely effective preventative measures available for people who live or travel through Valley fever endemic areas. It is recommended to avoid airborne dust or dirt, though this is not a guaranteed manner of prevention. People in certain occupations may be advised to wear face masks.[tpl]cite web|title=Risk factors|url=http://www.vfce.arizona.edu/ValleyFeverInPeople/RiskFactors.aspx|publisher=Valley Fever Center for Excellence[/tpl]
In 1998-2011, there were 111,117 cases of Coccidioidomycosis in the U.S. that were logged into the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6212a1.htm?s_cid=mm6212a1_e | title=Increase in Reported Coccidioidomycosis — United States, 1998–2011 | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) | accessdate=6 July 2013[/tpl] Since in many states Coccidioidomycosis reporting is not mandatory, the actual numbers can be higher. The U.S. national public health institute Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called the disease a "silent epidemic" and acknowledged that there is no proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/Features/ValleyFever/ | title=Valley Fever: Awareness is Key | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | work=CDC Features | accessdate=6 July 2013[/tpl]
Raising both surveillance and awareness of the disease while medical researchers are developing a human vaccine can positively contribute towards prevention efforts.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15283234 | title=A vaccine against coccidioidomycosis is justified and attainable | author=Cole G.T., Xue J.M., Okeke C.N., at al. | journal=Medical mycology |date=June 2004 | volume=42 | issue=3 | pages=189–216 | doi=10.1080/13693780410001687349 | pmid=15283234[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://valleyfever.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/summary-fact-sheet-May-2010.pdf | title=Valley Fever Vaccine Project | accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] Research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for Coccidioidomycosis.[tpl]cite journal | title=Enhanced surveillance of coccidioidomycosis, Arizona, USA, 2007–2008 | author=Tsang C.A., Anderson S.M., Imholte S.B., et al | journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases | year=2010 | volume=16 | pages=1738–44 | doi=10.3201/eid1611.100475 | issue=11[/tpl] Presently, Meridian Bioscience manufactures the so-called EIA test to diagnose the Valley fever, which however is known for producing a fair quantity of false positives. There were reports that Nielsen Biosciences created a skin test to diagnose this systemic disease that on the onset masquerades itself with respiratory illness symptoms. Currently, recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture, construction and others working outside in the endemic areas.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504958 | title=Occupational coccidioidomycosis in California: outbreak investigation, respirator recommendations, and surveillance findings | author=Das R., McNary J., Fitzsimmons K., et al | journal=Journal of occupational and environmental medicine |date=May 2012 | volume=54 | issue=5 | pages=564–571 | doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182480556 | pmid=22504958[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/discond/Pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx | title=Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) | publisher=California Department of Public Health | work=Health Information: Diseases & Conditions | accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] Dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil, and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions.[tpl]cite web | url=http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Cocci.pdf | title=Coccidioidomycosis: Prevention | work=Acute Communicable Disease Control Annual Morbidity Reports, Los Angeles County, 2002-2010. |  accessdate=12 July 2013[/tpl]

==Epidemiology==

Coccidioidomycosis is confined to the western hemisphere between 40° N and 40° S.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pappagianis|first=D|title=Epidemiology of coccidioidomycosis.|journal=Current topics in medical mycology|year=1988|volume=2|pages=199–238|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-3730-3_6|pmid=3288356[/tpl] Dry soil, especially in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, is supportive of the pathogenic fungi growth. In harmony with mycelium life cycle, incidence increases with periods of dryness after a rainy season; this phenomenon, termed "grow and blow", refers to growth of the fungus in wet weather, producing spores which are spread by the wind during succeeding dry weather.[tpl]cite news|title=Valley Fever throws baseball a curve ball: Fifteen Major League Baseball teams bring players to Arizona for spring training every year.

Besides humans, dogs, and cats, the fungus can be shown to infect most mammals, even if they do not get sick from it very often. Species in which Valley fever has been found include livestock such as cattle and horses; llamas; marine mammals, including sea otter; zoo animals such as monkeys and apes, kangaroos, tigers, etc.; and wildlife endemic to the geographic area such as cougar, skunk, and javelina.[tpl]cite web|title=Valley Fever Center for Excellence: Valley Fever in Other Animal Species|publisher=University of Arizona|url =http://www.vfce.arizona.edu/ValleyFeverInPets/VFID-other.aspx[/tpl]

===North America===

California state prisons, beginning in 1919, have been particularly affected by Coccidioidomycosis. In 2005 and 2006, the Pleasant Valley State Prison near Coalinga and Avenal State Prison near Avenal on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley had the highest incidence in 2005, of at least 3,000 per 100,000.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1406.011/abstract;jsessionid=ED8179D9DC0C01F2D507934DF7022BB0.d03t02 | title=Coccidioidomycosis in California State Correctional Institutions | author=Pappagianis, Demosthenes | journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=September 2007 | volume=1111 | doi=10.1196/annals.1406.011 | pages=103–11 | pmid=17332089 | author2=Coccidioidomycosis Serology Laboratory[/tpl] The receiver appointed in Plata v.

Incidence varies widely across the west and southwest. In Arizona, for instance, in 2007, there were 3,450 cases in Maricopa County, which in 2007 had an estimated population of 3,880,181U.S. Census Bureau, State & County QuickFacts for an incidence of approximately 1 in 1,125.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/pdf/countycases2007.pdf | title=Number of Reported Cases of Selected Notifiable Diseases by Category for each County, Arizona, 2007 | publisher=Arizona Department of Health Services | accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] In contrast, though southern New Mexico is considered an endemic region, there were 35 cases in the entire state in 2008, and 23 in 2007, in a region that had an estimated 2008 population of 1,984,356New Mexico Intercensal Population Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau http://bber.unm.edu/demo/nm2000s.htm for an incidence of approximately 1 in 56,695.
There was an outbreak in the summer of 2001 in Colorado, away from where the disease was considered endemic. A group of archeologists visited Dinosaur National Monument, and eight members of the crew, along with two National Park Service workers were diagnosed with Valley fever.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5045a1.htm | title=Coccidioidomycosis in Workers at an Archeologic Site ---Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, June--July 2001 | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), 50(45), p. 1005-1008 | date=November 16, 2001 | accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]
Infection rates vary greatly by county, and although population density is important, so are other factors that have not been proven yet. Greater construction activity may disturb spores in the soil. In addition, the effect of altitude on fungi growth and morphology has not been studied, and altitude can range from sea level to 10,000 feet or higher across California, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico.
In California from 2000 to 2007, there were 16,970 reported cases (5.9 per 100,000 people) and 752 deaths (0.26 per 100,000 people) with the highest incidence in the San Joaquin Valley (44.1 per 100,000).[tpl]cite journal|title=Increase in Coccidioidomycosis: California, 2000-2007|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)|date=February 13, 2009|volume=58|issue=5|pages=105–109|url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm[/tpl] Following the Northridge Earthquake, there was a sudden increase of cases in the areas affected by the quake, at a pace of over 10 times baseline.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The CDC reported 22,401 new cases of Coccidioidomycosis infections across the U.S. in 2011.

==History==

The first case of what was later named Coccidioidomycosis was described in 1892 in Buenos Aires by Alejandro Posadas, a medical intern at the Hospital de Clínicas "José de San Martín".Posadas A. Un nuevo caso de micosis fungoidea con posrospemias. Annales Cir. Med. Argent. (1892), Volume 15, p. 585-597. Posados established an infectious character of the disease after being able to transfer it in laboratory conditions to lab animals.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/9/1202.full | title=The Early History of Coccidioidomycosis: 1892–1945 | author=Hirschmann, Jan V. | journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases | year=2007 | volume=44 | issue=9 | pages=1202–1207 | doi=10.1086/513202 | pmid=17407039[/tpl] In the U.S., E. Rixford, a physician from a San Francisco hospital, and T. C. Gilchrist, a pathologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, became early pioneers of clinical studies of the infection.Rixford E., Gilchrist T. C. Two cases of protozoan (coccidioidal) infection of the skin and other organs. Johns Hopkins Hosp Rep 1896; 10:209-268. They decided that the causative organism was a Coccidia-type protozoan and named it Coccidioides immitis (resembling Coccidia, not mild).
During the next several decades it became clear that the etiological agent of the disease that was at first called Coccidioides infection and later Coccidioidomycosis[tpl]cite journal|last=Dickson|first=EC|last2=Gifford|first2=MA|title=Coccidioides infection (coccidioidomycosis). ii. The primary type of infection|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=1 November 1938|volume=62|issue=5|pages=853–71|doi=10.1001/archinte.1938.00180160132011[/tpl] was a fungal pathogen, and Coccidioidomycosis was also distinguished from Histoplasmosis and Blastomycosis. Further, C. immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called San Joaquin fever, Desert fever, and Valley fever, and a serum precipitin test was developed by Charles E. Smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection. In retrospect, Smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about Coccidioidomycosis,[tpl]cite journal|last=Smith|first=CE|title=Epidemiology of Acute Coccidioidomycosis with Erythema Nodosum ("San Joaquin" or "Valley Fever").|journal=American journal of public health and the nation's health|date=Jun 1940|volume=30|issue=6|pages=600–11|doi=10.2105/AJPH.30.6.600|pmid=18015234|pmc=1530901[/tpl] especially when he became dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951.
C. immitis was considered by the United States during the 1950s and 1960s as a potential biological weapon.Ciottone, Gregory R. Disaster Medicine. Philadelphia, PA: Mosby Elsevier, 2006, pp. 726-128.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] The explored strain was designated with the military symbol OC, and initial expectations were for its employment as a human incapacitant. Medical research suggested that OC might have had some lethal effects on the populace, and C. immitis started to be classified by the authorities as a threat to public health. However, C. immitis was never weaponized, and most of the military research in the mid-1960s was concentrated on developing a human vaccine.[tpl]cite web | url=http://-biology-.piczo.com/coccidioidomycosisinfection?cr=6 | title=Coccidioidomycosis | publisher=Piczo | accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] Currently, it is not on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.selectagents.gov/resources/42%20CFR%2073.pdf | title=HHS select agents and toxins | publisher=Office of the Federal Register | work=Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 42 - Public Health | accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] or  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.selectagents.gov/resources/List_of_Select_Agents_and_Toxins_2012-12-4-English.pdf | title=Select Agents and Toxins List | publisher=CDC | date=December 4, 2012 | accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] list of select agents and toxins.
