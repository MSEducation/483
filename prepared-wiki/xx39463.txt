==Assyrian invasion==

The country “inherited” from Nabû-šuma-iškun was one riven by internal divisions and conflicts with the Aramean and Chaldean tribes, where the central authority was greatly diminished. In Nabû-nāṣir's third year, the Assyrian general Tukultī-apil-Ešarra, better known under the Hebraic rendition "Tiglath-Pileser III", came to power[tpl]rp|1–2[/tpl] overthrowing the existing regime and in the first of two campaigns to secure his southern and eastern frontiers invaded Babylonia.
