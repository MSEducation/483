[[Search and rescue]]

CATEGORIES: Rescue

Search and rescue (SAR or S&R) is the search for and provision of aid to people who are in distress or imminent danger.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.casaraontario.ca/~webmaster1/Manuals/NationalSARmanual_full_english.pdf|format = PDF|title = B–GA–209–001/FP–001 DFO 5449 NATIONAL SAR MANUAL|accessdate = 2008-07-12|last = Canadian Forces|authorlink = |date=May 1998 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803015913/http://www.casaraontario.ca/~webmaster1/Manuals/NationalSARmanual_full_english.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-08-03[/tpl]
The general field of search and rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain the search is conducted over. These include mountain rescue; ground search and rescue, including the use of search and rescue dogs; urban search and rescue in cities; combat search and rescue on the battlefield and air-sea rescue over water.

==Definitions==

There are many different definitions of search and rescue, depending on the agency involved.

==History==

One of the world's earliest well documented SAR efforts ensued following the 1656 wreck of the Dutch merchant ship Vergulde Draeck off the west coast of Australia.  Survivors sent for help, and in response three separate SAR missions were conducted, without success.Major, R. H. (editor) (1859) Early Voyages to Terra Australis, Now Called Australia, The Hakluyt Society, London (2001 facsimile edition on Google Books)
In 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007 with 269 occupants was shot down by a Soviet aircraft near Sakhalin. The Soviets sent SAR helicopters and boats to Soviet waters, while a search and rescue operation was initiated by U.S., South Korean, and Japanese ships and aircraft in international waters, but no survivors were found.[ref]
Rear Admiral Walter T. Piotti (Photo 7), Commander of Task Force 71 of U.S. 7th Fleet, stated in his After Action Report (Department of the Navy, Commander, Surface Combat Force Seventh Fleet. CTF75/N32:kpm,4730,Ser 011, 15 November 1983)[/ref]

==Types of search and rescue==

===Mountain rescue===

Mountain rescue relates to search and rescue operations specifically in rugged and mountainous terrain.

===Ground search and rescue===

Ground search and rescue is the search for persons who are lost or in distress on land or inland waterways. Traditionally associated with wilderness zones, ground search and rescue services are increasingly required in urban and suburban areas to locate persons with Alzheimer's disease, autism, dementia, or other conditions that lead to wandering behaviour.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.dbs-sar.com/SAR_Research/Barry.htm|title = Alzheimer's Wanders Stir Concerns|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = Barry|first = Ellen|authorlink = |date=December 1999[/tpl] Ground search and rescue missions that occur in urban areas should not be confused with "Urban SAR", which in many jurisdictions refers to the location and extraction of people from collapsed buildings or other entrapments.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/|title = Urban Search and Rescue (US&R)|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = U.S. Department of Homeland Security|authorlink = |date=May 2009[/tpl]
Some ground search teams also employ search and rescue dogs.

===Urban search and rescue===

Urban search and rescue (US&R or USAR), also referred to as Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR), is the location and rescue of persons from collapsed buildings or other urban and industrial entrapments. Due to the specialized nature of the work, most teams are multi-disciplinary and include personnel from police, fire and emergency medical services. Unlike traditional ground search and rescue workers, most US&R responders also have basic training in structural collapse and the dangers associated with live electrical wires, broken natural gas lines and other hazards. While earthquakes have traditionally been the cause of US&R operations, terrorist attacks and extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes have also resulted in the deployment of these resources.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/about.shtm|title = About US&R|accessdate = 2010-01-11|last = U.S. Department of Homeland Security|authorlink = |date=May 2009[/tpl]

===Combat search and rescue===

Combat search and rescue (CSAR) is search and rescue operations that are carried out during war that are within or near combat zones.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.army-technology.com/glossary/combat-search-and-rescue.html|title = Term: Combat Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2009-06-03|last = SPG Media Limited/Army-Technology.com|authorlink = |year = 2009[/tpl]

===Air-sea rescue===

Air-sea rescue (ASR) refers to the combined use of aircraft (such as flying boats, floatplanes, amphibious helicopters and non-amphibious helicopters equipped with hoists) and surface vessels to search for and recover survivors of aircraft downed at sea as well as sailors and passengers of sea vessels in distress.Algeo, John. Fifty years among the new words: a dictionary of neologisms, 1941–1991, pp. 39, 106–107. Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN 0-521-44971-5

==International divisions of search and rescue responsibility==

===International waters===

International waters are divided into various regions according to the SOLAS convention.See the map provided by the IMO ocean atlas In the Arctic, SAR responsibilities are since May 2011 governed by the Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement.

===United Nations===

International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) is a UN Organization that promotes the exchange of information between national Urban Search and Rescue Organizations.

==SAR by nation==

===Australia===

The Australian search and rescue service is provided by AusSAR, which is part of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.amsa.gov.au/Search_and_Rescue/|title = Search & Rescue|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Australian Maritime Safety Authority|authorlink = |date=June 2009[/tpl] AusSAR operates a 24 hour Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Canberra and is responsible for the national coordination of both maritime and aviation search and rescue. AusSAR is also responsible for the management and operation of the Australian ground segment of the Cospas-Sarsat distress beacon detection system. AusSAR's jurisdiction spans Australia and as well as covering 52.8 million square kilometres of the Indian, Pacific and Southern Oceans constituting about 12% of the Earth's surface.Woolner, Derek (June 2008), Policing our ocean domain: establishing an Australian coast guard, Australian Strategic Policy Institute Limited, retrieved 31 March 2014
AusSAR's RCC is staffed by SAR specialists who have a naval, merchant marine, air force, civil aviation or police service background. The RCC also coordinates medical evacuations, broadcasts maritime safety information and operates the Australian Ship Reporting System (AUSREP). In coordinating search and rescue missions, AusSAR will call on assistance from organisations as appropriate,The first suggestion made to use helicopters in Australian searches for missing people, sea rescues, and general support during bush-fires, floods, etc. was made in a letter to the editor, written from the Brisbane suburb of Balmoral, and published in the Brisbane Courier-Mail at the end of 1953 (Value of Helicopter, (Letter to the Editor, from "Wake Up, Australia"), Courier Mail, (Thursday, 31 December 1953), p.2.) such as the Defence forces, Border Protection Command, trained aviation organisations (Civil SAR Units), emergency medical helicopters, state Police services and trained Air Observers from the State Emergency Service.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ses.sa.gov.au/site/about_us/what_ses_does/air_search_observation.jsp|title = Air Search Observation[/tpl] There are also other organisations, such as the non-profit Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service that is based at a number of sites around Australia and contracted by various authorities to deliver search and rescue services.
State Police in many states operate state-based search and rescue squads, such as the Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad, which provides specialist expertise, advice and practical assistance in land search and rescue on most terrain including snow and vertical cliff search and rescue.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=174|title= Victoria Police Search and Rescue Squad| accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = State of Victoria|authorlink = |date=June 2007[/tpl] There are also state-based volunteer search and rescue groups such as the Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.bwrs.org.au/|title = A remote area search & rescue service for NSW|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Bushwalkers Wilderness Rescue Squad Inc|authorlink = |date=November 2009[/tpl] in New South Wales and Bush Search and Rescue Victoria[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.bsar.org|title = Bush Search and Rescue Victoria|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Bush Search and Rescue Victoria|authorlink = |date=October 2009[/tpl] in Victoria. These state-based groups draw searchers from bushwalking, mountaineering and specialist rescue clubs within their State.  A few groups respond on horseback as mounted search and rescue. The State Emergency Service is a collection of volunteer-based emergency organisations established in each state or territory which are responsible for many rescue efforts in urban and rural areas and in any rescue that results from flood or storm activity. In rural areas the SES conducts most bush search, vertical and road traffic rescues. In urban areas they assist the police and fire services with USAR.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ses.nsw.gov.au/about/|title = About the SES|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = State of New South Wales|authorlink = |date=December 2008[/tpl]

===Azerbaijan===

Search and rescue operations in Azerbaijan are managed by the Ministry of Emergency Situations onshore in cooperation with the State Civil Aviation Administration in air and the State Maritime Administration offshore.[tpl]cite news |url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=109991 |title=Azerbaijan State Maritime Administration issues statement on rescuing Russia’s cargo ship |publisher=Azeri Press Agency |author= Rashad Suleymanov |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-12-28[/tpl]

===Belgium===

Search and rescue duties along the Belgian part of the North Sea are executed by the Belgian Air Component. From its Koksijde Air Base it operates 5 Westland Sea King Mk.48 helicopters.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mil.be/aircomp/units/index.asp?LAN=nl&FILE=&ID=628&MENU=287&PAGE=1|title = Vliegbasis Koksijde (Dutch language)|accessdate = 2009-11-04|last = Belgische Defensie|authorlink = |year = 2009[/tpl]

===Brazil===

Search and rescue duties in Brazil are the responsibility of the Divisão de Busca e Salvamento (D-SAR) (English: Search and Rescue Division), of the Brazilian Air Force.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.decea.gov.br/espaco-aereo/busca-e-salvamento/|title = Busca e Salvamento (in Portuguese)[/tpl]

===Canada===

Search and rescue duties in Canada are the responsibility of the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard in conjunction with provincial and municipal governments and private organizations. The Department of National Defence (DND) has overall responsibility for the coordinated search and rescue system. SAR operations are organized by Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCC). The JRCC are manned 24 hours a day by SAR Co-ordinators from the Canadian Coast Guard and Canadian Forces. Authority for the provision of maritime SAR  is assigned to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans by the Canada Shipping Act and the Canada Oceans Act. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and other police forces also coordinate ground search and rescue (GSAR) operations, often using volunteer GSAR teams operating in specific districts under provincial coordinating bodies.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ccaps-spcca/rs-eng.htm|title = RCMP Search and Rescue|accessdate = 27 October 2010|last = Royal Canadian Mounted Police|authorlink = |date=December 2006[/tpl]
The Canadian Forces has five assigned SAR squadrons:
Plus three Combat Support Squadrons with SAR roles:
Some municipalities and provinces have their own SAR units:
There are also volunteer non-profit associations that conduct SAR in Canada:

===Cyprus===

The Cyprus Republic Search and Rescue (SAR) system is organized by the Cyprus Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC Larnaca).
The JRCC (Greek: Κέντρο Συντονισμού Έρευνας και Διάσωσης) is an independent agency of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Cyprus that started its operations on a 24h basis on 7 August 1995 as a unit of the Cyprus Air Force Command."JRCC Larnaca History" Retrieved on 2013-07-02
On 1 March 2002, the JRCC took full responsibility for investigating, organizing, coordinating and executing every SAR incident-operation in the Republic of Cyprus Search & Rescue Region (SRR). JRCC Larnaca operated as a military unit until 26 July 2010, when JRCC was transformed to an independent agency under the Ministry of Defence with the Minister being responsible for its operational aspects. Logistic and technical support is the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications & Works."JRCC Larnaca Subordination-Base" Retrieved on 2013-07-02 Its primary mission is to organize the Cyprus Republic Search And Rescue system, to co-ordinate, control and direct SAR operations in its area of responsibility (which is identical to the Nicosia FIR), in order to find and rescue people whose lives are at risk, as a result of an air or naval accident, in the least possible time."JRCC Larnaca Mission" Retrieved on 2013-07-02 This is achieved by coordinating all the different agencies involved such as the Cyprus Police Aviation Unit, the Cyprus Port and Naval Police, the Cyprus National Guard Naval Command, the Cyprus National Guard Air Force Command, the Cyprus Civil Defence and other secondary units."JRCC Larnaca Secondary Units" Retrieved on 2013-07-02
The JRCC reports directly to the operational control of the Minister of Defence and it is staffed by qualified personnel of the Cyprus National Guard, mainly from the branches of the Navy and the Air Force.

===Denmark===

Search and Rescue operators in Denmark are primarily: Danish air force Squadron 722, Danish navy air squadron, naval home guard and the Danish Maritime Safety Administration, coordinated by the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, operated by the navy and air force in the Danish Naval Commands facilities near Aarhus. Internationally the Danish works mainly with Germany, Norway and Sweden. With the two latter, the annual exercises Baltic SAREX[tpl]cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/BHM/Nyt+og+Presse/Sarex.htm|title = Bornholms Marinedistrikt: SAREX '07|accessdate = 2008-07-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl] and

SAR services in Denmark started in 1957 with seven Sikorsky S-55s. Their piston engines produced only [tpl]convert|550|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and they had limited fuel capacity, so their operational range was short. To increase the operational area, Pembroke twin-engined fixed-wing aircraft were employed for search. These aircraft would localize the distressed person(s) and the S-55s would then rescue them. The SAR service was started for respond to fighter-plane crashes as 79 aircraft crashed, with 62 dead, in the period 1950-1955.,[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.flv.dk/flyvevaabnet/historie_flyvevaabnet.htm|title = Flyvevåbnets historie|accessdate = 2008-07-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl] but civilian SAR duties are also conducted.
In 1962 eight ship-based Aérospatiale Alouette IIIs were received. These were primarily meant for the ships patrolling the North Atlantic, but also supported the S-55s. In 1964 - 1965 the seven S-55s were replaced with eight Sikorsky S-61A helicopters.[tpl]cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C605235C-4851-457B-BFDA-75C3473573CF/0/HS61ASEAKING.pdf|format = PDF|title = Danish air force S-61A fact sheet|accessdate = 2008-07-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803015913/http://forsvaret.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C605235C-4851-457B-BFDA-75C3473573CF/0/HS61ASEAKING.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-08-03[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl] This helicopter was originally designed for anti-submarine warfare, but the Danish variant had the heavy dipping sonar equipment removed and extra fuel tanks added, giving the helicopters longer range. In 1977 radar was installed and in 1990 FLIR was added. Further avionics and navigation systems, including GPS, have also been added over time.
In 1977 the naval air squadron was re-established as an independent squadron in the navy and had their Alouette IIIs replaced with Westland Lynx helicopters. Their primary operational area was still the North Atlantic, but they continued their support role, although this was reduced with the introduction of the S-61s. In 2006, the first of the S-61s was replaced by one of 14 new AgustaWestland EH101 Merlin helicopters.
In 2007 the Danish Defence held a public display in Horsens, to raise awareness about rescue services and maritime safety. Maritime SAR is important because Denmark has a relative long coast line to its land mass.[tpl]cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/SOK/Nyt+og+Presse/2007-07-04.htm|title = Temadag om søredning og badesikkerhed|accessdate = 2008-07-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://forsvaret.dk/FTK/Nyt+og+Presse/Billeder+fra+s%C3%B8redningsdagen+2007.htm|title = Pictures from the public display|accessdate = 2008-07-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 2008 the SAR forces in Denmark were equipped with eight EH-101, one or two Lynx, 34 naval home guard vessels and 21 rescue vessels[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.fomfrv.dk/om_frv/hovedopgaver/kystredning.htm|title = Kystredning i Danmark|accessdate = 2008-07-09[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl] as well as the naval vessels at sea. The EH-101s operate from bases in Aalborg, Skrydstrup and Roskilde. When the sea water temperatures are low a helicopter is also deployed to the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The Lynx operates from Karup. Maritime vessels are spread out through the entire coastline and on islands. The S-61s and EH-101s have a crew of six: Two pilots, a navigator, a flight engineer, a physician and a rescue swimmer.

===Estonia===

The Estonian Border Guard (Piirivalve) is the Estonian security authority responsible for the border security. It is the main support organisation for search and rescue missions in Estonia, and operates a small fleet of SAR vessels and helicopters.

===Netherlands===

SAR responsibility in the Netherlands is held by the Royal Netherlands Coast Guard, carried out by vessels and aircraft from various organisations among which mostly the Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij with 40 fast rescue vessels and between 1824 til 2006 answered 36358 distress calls and rescued in that same periode about 79887 people out of distress situations, the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management and the Navy and Air Force.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.marine.nl/nlmarfor/helikopters/marheli/vsq7/nieuws/|title = VGSQ 7 (Dutch language article)|accessdate = 2008-05-30|last = NLMARFOR|authorlink = |date=May 2008[/tpl]

===New Zealand===

New Zealand's Search and Rescue Region extends from the South Pole to the southern border of the Honolulu region, including Norfolk, Tonga, Samoa, and Cook Islands.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.aip.net.nz/|title = AIPA New Zealand GEN 3.6 Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = Civil Aviation Auithority of New Zealand|authorlink = |year = undated[/tpl]
Smaller searches are controlled by the local police, who call on LandSAR for land-based operations, such as for lost hikers, and the Royal New Zealand Coastguard for coastal maritime incidents. Larger maritime search and rescue events, as well as reports of overdue aircraft, fall under the control of the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ), based in Avalon, which coordinates response from local coastguard, helicopter operators, merchant marine, air force and naval resources.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/About-us/RCCNZ-profile.asp|title=About our Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ)| year=undated|publisher=Maritime New Zealand|accessdate=30 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Commercial/Shipping-safety/Search-and-rescue/Contact-RCCNZ.asp|title = Contact RCCNZ|accessdate = 30 May 2010|last = Maritime New Zealand|authorlink = |year = undated[/tpl]
Urban Search and Rescue falls primarily within the domain of the New Zealand Fire Service, particularly the three USAR Taskforce groups based in Palmerston North, Christchurch, and Auckland. These teams draw together numerous specialists and organisations to achieve an integrated multi-agency response.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fire.org.nz/About-Us/Our-Organisation/Pages/UrbanSearchandRescue.aspx |title=New Zealand Fire Service - Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) |publisher=Fire.org.nz |accessdate=2012-04-08[/tpl]
Among those organisations that act in a support capacity for NZFS are Response Teams (NZRTs). These are regional rescue groups of professional volunteers that train to a minimum industry standard of USAR Category 1R (USAR Responder), which is also standard for NZFS firefighters. Response Teams are registered with the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM), and assist their local MCDEM Groups and communities in emergencies to supplement full-time emergency services. Their additional capabilities, which vary among different teams, include: high angle rope rescue, storm response, swift water response, medics, welfare, and rural fire support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/memwebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/For-the-CDEM-Sector-NZ-Response-Teams-Index |title=The Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management: NZ Response Teams |publisher=Civildefence.govt.nz |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2012-04-08[/tpl] Many Response Teams deployed to assist in the rescue and recovery effort of the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake.

It maintains rescue services along the Norwegian coast, and neighbouring sea areas where such services may be necessary. The NSSR also runs an information service and educational programs designed to improve safety for boaters. The first rescue boats, the Colin Archer-class, were introduced in 1893. They were powered by only by sails and oars. NSSR’s boats and crew have saved the lives of over 6,200 people. More than 500,000 people have received assistance.
The search and rescue helicopters are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), who fly 12 Westland Sea Kings. The Norwegian Sea Kings are due to be replacedThe NAWSARH Project by 2020 by 16 AW101.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

===Portugal===

The Portuguese area of responsibility comprises the Lisbon and Santa Maria Flight Information Regions (FIR).The Santa Maria FIR

===Poland===

In Poland most search and rescue operations are undertaken by the airborne units of the Polish Armed Forces. The Navy currently has the largest SAR fleet of helicopters and also operates a number of small vessels for the purpose of rescuing crewmen of stricken ships. There is also, however a semi-governmental organisation known as the 'Morska Służba Poszukiwania i Ratownictwa' (Maritime Search and Rescue Service)Polish Maritime Search and Rescue Service which provides the vast majority of seaborne services to vessels in distress; the service is currently (as of 2010) in the process of overhauling and replacing a large portion of its fleet of lifeboats.
Other civilian search and rescue units in Poland include:

===South Africa===

Search and Rescue services are offered by various government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations organisations in South Africa. There is no single organisation responsible for urban, wilderness, swift water, aviation or maritime/sea rescue.
Aviation and maritime incidents are the responsibility of the South African Search and Rescue Organization (SASAR). SASAR is a voluntary organization that functions under the auspices of the Department of Transport. Its main role is to search for, assist and carry out rescue operations for the survivors of aircraft or vessel accidents. Depending on the nature of the accident, the RCC's (ARCC or MRCC) coordinate the search and rescue missions. These operations are carried out by other government departments, non governmental organizations, commercial/private organizations and voluntary organizations.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.sasar.gov.za/|title = Who are we?|accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = SASAR|authorlink = |year = undated[/tpl]

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, maritime search and rescue is coordinated by the Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) while aeronautical rescue is delegated through the UK Ministry of Defence to the Royal Air Force, and land-based operations are usually coordinated by the local Police force. The operation itself is carried out with aircraft from the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force or Coastguard, RNLI lifeboats and police, military or volunteer mountain rescue or ALSAR (Association of Lowland Search and Rescue) teams. Aeronautical rescue and associated aircraft coordination is carried out by the UK Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) based at RAF Kinloss in the north of Scotland. The centre is responsible for tasking and coordinating all of the UK's search and rescue helicopter and RAF mountain rescue teams.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.kinlossrescue.com|title = Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = ARCC Kinloss |authorlink = |year = 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.rnli.org.uk/|title = Royal National Lifeboat Institution|accessdate = 2009-11-06|last = Royal National Lifeboat Institution|authorlink = |year = 2009[/tpl]

===United States===

In the United States there are many organizations with SAR responsibilities at the national, state and local level.
In January 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the National Response Framework which serves as the guiding document for a federal response during a national emergency.  Search and Rescue is divided into 4 primary elements, while assigning a federal agency with the lead role for each of the 4 elements.Section ESF #9-1[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
In the U.S., SAR standards are developed primarily by ASTM International and the U.S. NFPA which are then used by organizations such as the Mountain Rescue Association (MRA), the U.S. National Association of Search and Rescue (NASAR), and the NFPA to develop training that will meet or exceed those standards.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/COMMIT/COMMITTEE/F32.htm?L+memberstore+ooef3203+1171348303|title = Committee F32 on Search and Rescue|accessdate = 2008-02-24|last = O'Toole|first = Thomas F.|authorlink = |year = undated[/tpl] Within ASTM International, most standards of relevance to SAR are developed by Committee F32 on Search and Rescue. Formed in 1988, the committee had 85 current members and jurisdiction of 38 approved standards.
