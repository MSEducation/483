Kyle Broflovski (sometimes spelled Broslovski, Broslofski, Brovlofski or Broflofski) is a main character in the Comedy Central series South Park. He is voiced by and loosely based on co-creator Matt Stone. Kyle is one of the show's four central characters, along with his friends Stan Marsh, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).
Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Kyle is distinctive as one of the few Jewish children on the show, and because of this, he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters. His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.
Kyle is animated by computer in a way to emulate the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been frequently cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.

==Role in South Park==

Kyle attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison's class. During the show's first 58 episodes, Kyle and the other main child characters were in the third grade following which they have been in the fourth grade. He lives in South Park with his father Gerald, a lawyer, and his overprotective mother Sheila, a housewife who fits the mold of a Jewish mother stereotype.[tpl]cite news | author = Stephen Holden | title = Making A Point With Smut And Laughs | work = The New York Times | date = 1999-06-30| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/30/movies/film-review-making-a-point-with-smut-and-laughs.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | accessdate = 2009-05-05[/tpl] Gerald and Sheila have been referred to as Polish Jews,[tpl]cite episode |title=Butt Out |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=2003-12-03 |season=7 |number=713[/tpl] and they mutually share a strong devotion to their Jewish religion, while expressing deep concern during the multiple times Kyle's faith in Judaism becomes enervated. Kyle has a younger brother named Ike, who Kyle learns was adopted and originally from Canada in the episode Ike's Wee Wee.
Gerald often attempts to teach Kyle important morals. Although his mother's outspoken, manipulative nature usually overwhelms Kyle, he tends to show that he truly loves her, and takes offense to any insult Cartman may offer about her.[tpl]cite news | author = Virginia Heffernan| title = What?

He was initially reluctant to embrace Ike as his brother upon learning that Ike was adopted, but Ike's genuine affection for his older brother persuaded Kyle to love him in return, and regard him as "true family".Arp and Devlin, pp. 87-94
Kyle is modeled after Stone, while Stan is modeled after Parker. Kyle and Stan are best friends, and their relationship, which is intended to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone,[tpl]cite news | author = Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins| title = Gross And Grosser | work = Time | date = 1998-03-23 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028,00.html | accessdate = 2009-04-28[/tpl] is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. The show's official website defines Kyle's role amongst his friends as "the smart one".[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/characters/2| title=Kyle Broflovski| publisher=South Park Studios| accessdate=2009-01-24[/tpl] He often provides a sober thought to plans or ideas made by the other boys, and explains a moral outlook while drawing upon his vast knowledge and intelligence.[tpl]cite news| author = Alex Strachan| title = Life in South Park never changes| publisher = Canwest Publishing, Inc. | date = 2008-11-07| url = http://www2.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=d6011d6b-af1c-42f5-a7c4-256391a1df73&k=10413 | accessdate = 2009-05-03[/tpl] He tends to offer reasonable or scientific explanations both to situations most others view as supernatural in nature, and in opposition of propaganda dispensed by Cartman.
Several episodes focus on Kyle and his religion, and being the lone Jew has resulted in an enmity with the Antisemitic Cartman that has become significantly more pronounced as the series progresses. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle makes cracks at Cartman's weight and is horrified and disgusted with Cartman's immorality, cruelty, bigotry, and greed. Their rivalry often elevates to the point where Kyle becomes so obsessed with beating Cartman at whatever he does, he sometimes neglects Stan and Kenny in the process. He has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, often losing these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Though he has claimed Kenny was not his friend, in order to avoid having to spend the night at his poverty-stricken household,[tpl]cite episode |title=Chickenpox |url= |series=South Park |credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1998-08-26 |season=2 |number=210[/tpl] Kyle has professed a friendship with Kenny and shown genuine concern for Kenny's health and safety. Kyle normally has the angrier reaction of yelling, "You bastards!" following Stan's exclamation of the popular catchphrase, "Oh my God, they killed Kenny" after one of Kenny's trademark deaths.
Near the end of the production run of the show's fifth season (2001), Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kyle was killed off.[tpl]cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title="South Park" - The Complete Fifth Season |medium=DVD|publisher=Comedy Central[/tpl] Mini-commentary for episode "Kenny Dies" The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. Parker and Stone initially chose Kyle because they deemed him as being too similar to Stan, in terms of personality. Instead, the character of Kenny was chosen, and he was seemingly killed off for good in the episode "Kenny Dies". The duo claimed they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode, and regarded the character as a "prop". Nevertheless, Kenny returned from a year-long absence in the season six (2002) finale "Red Sleigh Down", and has remained a recurring character ever since.
In many episodes, Kyle draws upon his sense of social purpose and moral outrage, and reflects on the lessons he has learned during the course of an episode, with a speech that often begins "You know, I learned something today...". Kyle acknowledged this trend in the season five (2001) episode "Cartmanland" when he states that he often gives the speech each week in an attempt to "try and better myself", and again in the season seven (2003) episode "Butt Out" where he repeatedly reminds his friends that they continuously allow potentially riotous events to occur, and are only able to defuse the situation by giving such a speech to the gathered townsfolk.
Kyle's mother reveals in the episode Cherokee Hair Tampons that Kyle is diabetic- although whether this 'goes away' once Kyle gets a kidney transplant is unexplained and has seemingly not been brought up since. There have been numerous occasions when Kyle has been ill or sick more often than his classmates, and there has been speculation that he may have a poor immune system.

==Character==

===Creation and design===

An unnamed precursor to Kyle first appeared in the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of construction paper cutouts and animated using stop motion.[tpl]cite news | author = Matt Cheplic | title = 'As Crappy As Possible': The Method Behind the Madness of South Park | publisher = Penton Media | date = 1998-05-01 | url = http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/ | accessdate = 2009-04-28 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090329014416/http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/  | archivedate = 2009-03-29[/tpl] When asked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/press/bios/brian_graden.jhtml|title=Brian Graden's Bio|publisher=VH1.com|accessdate=2008-01-10[/tpl] In this short, which was the first appearance of Kyle styled as he is in the series, he is given his first name. When developing the character, Parker recalled there being only one Jewish student in his entire hometown of Conifer, Colorado, and described her as being "the token Jewish person".[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title = Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate = 2009-02-04 |author = Raphael, Rebecca | date= 1998-05-22| work = New Voices [/tpl] Stone, himself Jewish, also recalled his own experiences as a youth in a predominantly Christian neighborhood, and both he and Parker decided to incorporate these aspects into the character. Kyle next appeared on August 13, 1997, when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".
From the show's second episode, "Weight Gain 4000" (season one, 1997), Kyle, like all other characters on the show, has been animated using computer software, though he is presented to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique. In keeping with the show's animation style, Kyle is composed of simple geometrical shapes.[tpl]cite news | author = Abbie Bernstein| title = South Park - Volume 2 | publisher = AVRev.com| date = 1998-10-27| url = http://www.avrev.com/dvd-movie-disc-reviews/tv-shows/south-park-volume-2.html| accessdate = 2008-04-30[/tpl] He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is generally shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.[tpl]cite news | author = Jaime J.

Kyle is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a bright green ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances in which he is shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical.http://www.cannibalthemusical.net While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.[tpl]cite web | title = South Park FAQ |url = http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=2&year=2009| date = 2009-02-10 | publisher = South Park Studios | accessdate = 2009-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = 40 Questions| url = http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm| date = 2001-10-04| publisher = South Park Studios | accessdate = 2009-01-30 [/tpl]

===Personality and traits===

thumb|200px|Kyle is modeled after his voice actor, series co-creator Matt Stone.Like his friends, Kyle is foul-mouthed as a means for Parker and Stone to display how they claim young boys really talk when they are alone.[tpl]cite web| author=Jake Trapper and Dan Morris| title=Secrets of 'South Park'| publisher=ABC News| date=2006-09-22| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&page=4| accessdate=2009-04-18[/tpl]  Parker notes that while Kyle is sometimes cynical and profane, there is an "underlying sweetness" to the character,[tpl]cite news | author = Frazier Moore | title = Loud and lewd but sweet underneath | work = The Age | date = 2006-12-14 | url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/loud-and-lewd-but-sweet-underneath/2006/12/13/1165685687176.html?page=2 | accessdate = 2009-05-09[/tpl] and Time described Kyle and his friends as "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.
Kyle often displays the highest moral standard of all the boys and is usually depicted as the most intelligent. When describing Kyle, Stone states that both he and the character are "reactionary", and susceptible to irritability and impatience. In some instances, Kyle is the only child in his class to not initially indulge in a fad or fall victim to a ploy. This has resulted in both his eagerness to fit in, and his resentment and frustration.Rennie, James and Weinstock, pp. 195-208
As a Jew, Kyle often defends and shows pride in his religion and ancestry. He is nevertheless lonely in this regard, particularly around Christmas time, though he takes solace in anticipating the annual appearance of Mr. Hankey, an anthropomorphic piece of feces who emerges from the sewer to spread Christmas cheer.[tpl]cite news | author = Anthony C.

A recurring plot element is the depiction of Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs.[tpl]cite news| author = Melanie McFarland | title =Social satire keeps 'South Park' fans coming back for a gasp, and a laugh | work = Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date = 2006-10-02| url= http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287050_tv02.html| accessdate = 2009-05-12[/tpl] Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job.Arp and Jacoby, pp. 58-65 He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic.Arp and Murtaugh, pp. 29-39 During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring at the end of an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/up_front/article/jesus_vs_kyle_20040910/ |title = Jesus vs. Kyle |accessdate = 2009-05-02 |author = Wills, Adam | date = 2004-09-10| work = The Jewish Journal [/tpl] Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.
Kyle has a first cousin also named Kyle, whom he resents for being the embodiment of Jewish stereotypes and causing Kyle to question whether or not he was a self-hating Jew.[tpl]cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title="South Park" - The Complete Fifth Season|medium=DVD|publisher=Comedy Central[/tpl] Mini-commentary for episode "The Entity" Kyle is hopelessly inept at choreographed dancing; in the eyes of Cartman, he perpetuated the stereotype that "Jews have no rhythm".[tpl]cite episode |title=Rainforest Shmainforest |url= |series=South Park|credits=Trey Parker and Matt Stone |network=Comedy Central |airdate=1999-04-07 |season=3 |number=301[/tpl]

==Cultural impact==

Kyle's depiction on the show has drawn both praise and criticism from the Jewish community.[tpl]cite news | author = Robert Bolton | title = The Media Report: South Park | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 1998-07-23 | url= http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/mediarpt/mstories/mr980723.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Detractors of the character cite his own habit of eschewing common Jewish practices and reiterating negative stereotypes for comedic purposes. Supportive Jewish viewers commend the show for using Kyle to accurately portray what it is like for a young Jew to have to endure loneliness and bigotry as an ethnic and religious minority. One of the show's more popular episodes, "The Passion of the Jew" (season eight, 2004), deals largely with Kyle's religious anxiety. The episode was independently released on DVD along with two other religion-themed episodes from the series.
Over the seasons Kyle has addressed topics such as brotherhood, excessive litigation,[tpl]cite news| author = William Cohen| title = Respect Its Authoritah!| work = The Cornell American| date = 2005-11-04| url = http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/| accessdate = 2009-05-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] hate crime legislation,[tpl]cite news | author = Frank Rich | title = Conservatives 'South Park' | work = The New York Times | date= 2005-05-01 | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/opinion/01rich.html | accessdate = 2009-05-03[/tpl] civil liberties,[tpl]cite news| author = Brian C.

Kyle's opinions have been the subject of much critical analysis in the media and literary world. The book South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today includes an essay in which Bridgewater State College philosophy professor William J. Devlin references the teachings of Socrates and Friedrich Nietzsche when describing Kyle's role in the show.South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today, Blackwell Publishing, Series: The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture Series, Retrieved 2008-01-21.
