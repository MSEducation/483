The Gulf of Aden ([tpl]lang-ar|خليج عدن[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|Ḫalīǧ ʻAdan[/tpl], [tpl]lang-so|Gacanka Cadmeed[/tpl]) is a gulf located in the Arabian Sea between Yemen, on the south coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. In the northwest, it connects with the Red Sea through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, which is about 20 miles wide. It shares its name with the port city of Aden in Yemen, which forms the northern shore of the gulf. Historically the Gulf of Aden was known as "The Gulf of Berbera", named after the ancient Somali port city of Berbera on the south side of the gulf.[tpl]cite book|last=Dumper, Stanley|first=Michael,  Bruce E.|title=Cities of The Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC CLIO, Google Books|pages=90|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA89&dq=gulf+of+berbera+cities&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T1brT42mAsvE8QOst9ziBQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=gulf%20of%20berbera%20cities&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M.

The waterway is part of the important Suez canal shipping route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea in the Indian Ocean with 21,000 ships crossing the gulf annually.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081202/ap_on_re_af/piracy |title=Pirates fire on US cruise ship in hijack attempt: Yahoo!

==Geography==

===Limits===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Gulf of Aden as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]

===Hydrography===

The temperature of the Gulf of Aden varies between [tpl]convert|15|C|F[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|28|C|F[/tpl], depending on the season and the appearance of monsoons. The salinity of the gulf at [tpl]convert|10|m|ft[/tpl] depth varies from 35.3 ‰ along the eastern Somali coast to as high as 37.3 ‰ in the gulf's center,[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/FNS/FN023E/begin.htm#Contents| chapterurl=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/FNS/FN023E/ch2.htm| title=Report on Cruise No. 3 of R/V "Dr. Fridtjof Nansen." - Indian Ocean Fishery and Development Programme - Pelagic Fish Assessment Survey North Arabian Sea| chapter=Hydrographic Survey Results|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|year=1975|accessdate=2011-04-23[/tpl] while the oxygen content in the Gulf of Aden at the same depth is typically between 4.0 and 5.0 mg/L.

==Commerce and trade==

The Gulf of Aden is a vital waterway for shipping, especially for Persian Gulf oil, making it an integral waterway in the world economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMWOXNFGLE_index_0.html|title=Earth from Space: The Gulf of Aden – the gateway to Persian oil|publisher=European Space Agency|date=2005-03-01|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl]  Approximately 11 percent of the world's seaborne petroleum passes through the Gulf of Aden on its way to the Suez Canal or to regional refineries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itopf.com/information-services/country-profiles/documents/redsea.pdf|title=Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden|publisher=International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF)|year=2003|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl] The main ports along the gulf are Aden in Yemen, Djibouti City in Djibouti, and Zeila, Berbera and Bosaso in Somalia.
In earlier history, the city of Crater, located just south of the modern city of Aden, was an important port in regional trade. Crater was the principal harbor of the pre-Islamic kingdom of Awsan, and after its annexation by the kingdom of Saba at the end of the 5th century, played a significant role in connecting Africa with Arabia.
India receives USD 50 billion in imports and sends USD 60 billion in exports through this area annually. Because of this and for the sake of protecting the trade of other countries, India keeps a warship escort in this area.[tpl]cite web |url= http://the-diplomat.com/2011/04/19/india-takes-fight-to-pirates/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+the-diplomat+%28The+Diplomat+RSS%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher |title=India Takes Fight to Pirates |first=Nitin |last=Gokhale |work=the-diplomat.com |publisher= The Diplomat |year=2011 |quote=|accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl]
In the late 2000s, the gulf evolved into a hub of pirate activity. By 2013, attacks in the waters had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols.[tpl]cite news|last=Arnsdorf|first=Isaac|title=West Africa Pirates Seen Threatening Oil and Shipping|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-22/west-africa-pirates-seen-threatening-oil-and-shipping.html|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=22 July 2013[/tpl]

==Ecology==

A geologically young body of water, the Gulf of Aden has a unique biodiversity that contains many varieties of fish, coral, seabirds and invertebrates. This rich ecological diversity has benefited from a relative lack of pollution during the history of human habitation around the gulf. However, environmental groups fear that the lack of a coordinated effort to control pollution may jeopardize the gulf's ecosphere.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/Programmes/Non-UNEP_administered_Programmes/Red_Sea_and_Gulf_of_Eden/default.asp|title=Red Sea & Gulf of Aden|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|year=2005|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl]
