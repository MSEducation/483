[[Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus]]

CATEGORIES: Military of Turkey, Military of Cyprus, Turkish Army

The Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus officially the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force (Turkish: Kıbrıs Türk Barış Kuvvetleri or KTBK) is the Turkish military garrison on Cyprus. In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus following a Greek Cypriot coup (organized and supported by the Greek government, which was still in the hands of a military junta) which wanted to enforce union with Greece, occupying the northern third of the island. The invasion force, which consisted of about 40,000 soldiers and 200 tanks, subsequently was reduced to a garrison of 17,000 troops. It outnumbers the Greek military contingent on the island, which is supplemented by the Greek Cypriot National Guard of 12,000 active and 75,000 reserves. Air reinforcement of the Turkish troops can be effected, if necessary, within hours.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+tr0103%29 Nevertheless, the unresolved dispute over Cyprus complicates Turkish participation in NATO and remains an obstacle to NATO's effectiveness in the region.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+tr0103%29

Recently moreover there have been indications that the total numbers of Turkish forces on the island may have increased” S994/680 7.6.1994.par.28.

However, the commander of the Turkish troops reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in the capital, Ankara. The force is responsible for all security and is not directly involved in political matters of northern Cyprus.Cyprus PIO: Turkish Cypriot Press and Other Media, 98-11-19
