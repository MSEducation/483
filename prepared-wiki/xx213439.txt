Blonanserin (Lonasen) is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic (approved by PMDA in January 2008)http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/service/pdf/list/NewdrugsFY2007.pdf commercialized by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in Japan and Korea for the treatment of schizophrenia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Blonanserin A Review of its Use in the Management of Schizophrenia|journal=CNS Drugs|date=January 2010|author=Deeks, ED; Keating, GM|volume=24|issue=1|pages=65–84|pmid=20030420|doi=10.2165/11202620-000000000-00000[/tpl] Relative to many other antipsychotics, blonanserin has an improved tolerability profile, lacking side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension.[tpl]cite journal | author = Heading CE | title = AD-5423 (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co Ltd) | journal = IDrugs : the Investigational Drugs Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 7 | pages = 813–7 |date=November 1998 | pmid = 18465651 | doi = | url = [/tpl] As with many second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics it is significantly more efficacious in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics such as haloperidol.Kishi T, Matsuda Y, Nakamura H, Iwata N.

Blonanserin acts as a mixed 5-HT2A (Ki = 0.812 nM) and D2 receptor (Ki = 0.142 nM) antagonist and also exerts some blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 26.7 nM).[tpl]cite journal|title=Profile of blonanserin for the treatment of schizophrenia|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|year=2013|volume=9|pages=587–594|doi=10.2147/NDT.S34433|pmid=23766647|author=Tenjin, T; Miyamoto, S; Ninomiya, Y; Kitajima, R; Ogino, S; Miyake, N; Yamaguchi, N[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Oka M, Noda Y, Ochi Y, et al. | title = Pharmacological profile of AD-5423, a novel antipsychotic with both potent dopamine-D2 and serotonin-S2 antagonist properties | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 264 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–65 |date=January 1993 | pmid = 8093723 | doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8093723[/tpl] It lacks significant affinity for numerous other sites including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3, D1, α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptors and the monoamine transporters,[tpl]cite journal | author = Oka M, Noda Y, Ochi Y, et al. | title = Pharmacological profile of AD-5423, a novel antipsychotic with both potent dopamine-D2 and serotonin-S2 antagonist properties | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 264 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–65 |date=January 1993 | pmid = 8093723 | doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8093723[/tpl] though it does possess low affinity for the sigma receptor (IC50 = 286 nM).[tpl]cite journal | author = Oka, M; Noda, Y; Ochi, Y; et al. | title = Pharmacological profile of AD-5423, a novel antipsychotic with both potent dopamine-D2 and serotonin-S2 antagonist properties | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 264 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–65 |date=January 1993 | pmid = 8093723 | doi = | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8093723[/tpl]
It has a relatively high affinity towards the 5-HT6 receptor perhaps underpinning its recently unveiled efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Effect of blonanserin on cognitive function in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia|journal=Human Psychopharmacology|date=January 2012|volume=27|issue=1|pages=90–100|doi=10.1002/hup.1276|pmid=22278973|author=Tenjin, T; Miyamoto, S; Miyake, N; Ogino, S; Kitajima, R; Ojima, K; Arai, J; Teramoto, H; Tsukahara, S; Ito, Y; Tadokoro, M; Anai, K; Funamoto, Y; Kaneda, Y; Sumiyoshi, T; Yamaguchi, N[/tpl]
