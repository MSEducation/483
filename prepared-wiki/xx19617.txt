In 2004, a smaller study of 23 absorption systems by Chand et al., using the Very Large Telescope, found no measureable variation:[ref]

However, in 2007 simple flaws were identified in the analysis method of Chand et al., discrediting those results.[ref]

Lamoreaux and Torgerson analyzed data from the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor in 2004, and concluded that α has changed in the past 2 billion years by 4.5 parts in [tpl]val|e=8[/tpl]. They claimed that this finding was "probably accurate to within 20%." Accuracy is dependent on estimates of impurities and temperature in the natural reactor. These conclusions have to be verified.[ref]

In 2007, Khatri and Wandelt of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign realized that the 21 cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen of the early Universe leaves a unique absorption line imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation. They proposed using this effect to measure the value of α during the epoch before the formation of the first stars. In principle, this technique provides enough information to measure a variation of 1 part in [tpl]val|e=9[/tpl] (4 orders of magnitude better than the current quasar constraints). However, the constraint which can be placed on α is strongly dependent upon effective integration time, going as t−1/2. The European LOFAR radio telescope would only be able to constrain Δα/α to about 0.3%. The collecting area required to constrain Δα/α to the current level of quasar constraints is on the order of 100 square kilometers, which is economically impracticable at the present time.
In 2008, Rosenband et al. used the frequency ratio of [tpl]element|aluminium|charge=+[/tpl] and [tpl]element|mercury|charge=+[/tpl] in single-ion optical atomic clocks to place a very stringent constraint on the present time variation of α, namely [tpl]nowrap begin[/tpl]Δα̇/α = [tpl]val|-1.6|2.3|e=-17[/tpl][tpl]nowrap end[/tpl] per year. Note that any present day null constraint on the time variation of alpha does not necessarily rule out time variation in the past. Indeed, some theories[ref]
