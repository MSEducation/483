Healaugh (pronounced "hee-law")[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herriotway.co.uk/place.php3?place=Healaugh&p=7&walk=herriotway|title=Herriot Way|work=Sherpa Expeditions Limited|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-29[/tpl] is a small village and civil parish in Swaledale in the Yorkshire Dales. It is in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England and lies about 1 mile west of Reeth.
The name Healaugh is derived from a Saxon word (Heah) meaning a high-level forest clearing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dalesman.co.uk/walks/healaugh.htm|title=Healaugh and the River Swale from Reeth|work=Dalesman magazine|date=2002-04-09|author=Dalesman Publishing Ltd|accessdate=2007-06-29[/tpl]
The village is small, with no amenities except a stone trough fed by a hillside stream, and the village telephone box. The latter is unusually well endowed, with a carpet, waste paper bin, ash tray, directories and fresh flowers. Visitors may leave a donation.
