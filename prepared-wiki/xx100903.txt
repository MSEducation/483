Peter Graham Waterfield (born 12 March 1981, Waltham Forest, London, United Kingdomfind my past) is a British diver and Olympic silver medalist.

==Diving career==

Waterfield's specialism is the 10-metre platform event, both as solo competitor and in the synchronised event with his former partner Leon Taylor.  Despite their noticeable height difference (Peter is only 5' 6", Leon is almost 5' 11") in a discipline normally requiring as much uniformity as possible, they turned in strong synchronised performances. Waterfield and Taylor came in fourth at the men's synchronised 10-metre platform in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In the diving events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, they won the silver medal in the men's synchronised 10-metre platform - Britain's first Olympic diving medal since Brian Phelps in 1960.
In the 2002 Commonwealth Games held in Manchester, Waterfield's best solo showing to date came when he won the 10-metre gold medal.  In the 2006 Commonwealth Games he won a silver medal.
For the 2011 season, Waterfield was paired in the synchronised competitions teenager Tom Daley; Daley had finished 7th in the individual competition at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and was also a British and European champion. During the 2012 London Olympics, Waterfield and Daley achieved an agonising 4th placed finish in the 10m synchro diving competition after dropping their 4th dive.
Born in London, he lives in Southampton where he is a member of the diving club and is coached by Lindsey Fraser.
