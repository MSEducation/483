The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) (Persian:جمعیت انقلابی زنان افغانستان, Jamiyat-e Enqelābi-ye Zanān-e Afghānestān, Pashto:د افغانستان د ښڅو انقلابی جمعیت) is a women's organization based in Quetta, Pakistan, that promotes women's rights and secular democracy. It was founded in 1977 by Meena Keshwar Kamal, an Afghan student activist who was assassinated in February 1987 for her political activities.[tpl]cite news |first=Polly |last=Toynbee |authorlink=Polly Toynbee |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4266035,00.html |title=Behind the burka |newspaper=The Guardian |date= September 28, 2001 [/tpl] The group, which supports non-violent strategies, had its initial office in Kabul, Afghanistan, but then moved to Pakistan in the early 1980s.
The organization aims to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities aimed at acquiring human rights for women and continuing the struggle against the government of Afghanistan based on democratic and secular, not fundamentalist principles, in which women can participate fully.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/Fahima+Vorgetts.htm |title=RAWA testimony to the Congressional Human Rights Caucus Briefing |publisher= U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus |date=December 18, 2001 [/tpl] RAWA also strives for multilateral disarmament.
The group opposed the Soviet-supported government, the following Mujahideen and Islamist governments, and the present United States-supported Islamic Republican form of government.

==Background==

The RAWA was first initiated in Kabul in 1977 as an independent social and political organization of Afghan women fighting for human rights and social justice. The organization then moved parts of its work out of Afghanistan into Pakistan and established their main base there to work for Afghan women.

==Founder==

RAWA was founded by a group of Afghan women led by Meena Keshwar Kamal. At age 21, she laid the foundations of RAWA through her work educating women. In 1979, Kamal began a campaign against Soviet forces and the Soviet-supported government of Afghanistan. In 1981, she launched a bilingual magazine called Payam-e-Zan (Women’s Message). In the same year, she visited France for the French Socialist Party Congress. She also established schools for Afghan refugee children, hospitals and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan. Her activities and views, as well as her work against the government and religious fundamentalists led to her assassination on February 4, 1987.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1973184.stm |title=Afghan activist's killers hanged |first=Susannah |last=Price |date=7 May 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 December 2010[/tpl]

==Early activities==

Much of RAWA's efforts in the 1990s involved holding seminars and press conferences and other fund-raising activities in Pakistan. RAWA also created secret schools, orphanages, nursing courses, and handicraft centers for women and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They secretly filmed women being beaten in the street in Afghanistan by the religious police, and being executed. RAWA activities were forbidden by both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, but they persisted, and even publicised their work in publications like Payam-e-Zan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/28against.htm |title=The Taliban show their fangs to RAWA |work=Excerpts from Wahdat daily, published in Peshawar (April 30, 1998) |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=7 December 2010 [/tpl]

==RAWA after the 2001 invasion==

RAWA is highly critical of the NATO war that began in 2001, because of the high rate of casualties among the civilian population. The organization went so far as to threaten to sue United States government for unauthorized use of four photos from their website that were used in propaganda handbills dropped on various cities in Afghanistan during the 2001 invasion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/us_flyer.htm |title=RAWA to sue US authorities - Bureau Report  |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=7 December 2010 [/tpl]
After the defeat of the Taliban government by US and Afghan Northern Alliance forces, RAWA warned that the Northern Alliance were just as fundamentalist and dangerous as the Taliban. They continue to charge that the current government led by President Hamid Karzai lacks support in most areas of Afghanistan, and that fundamentalists are enforcing laws unfairly treating women as they were under the Taliban. These claims are supported by media reports about the Herat government of Ismail Khan, who has created a religious police that forces women to obey strict dress and behavior codes, as well as many reports by Human Rights Watch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hrw.org/doc?t=asia&c=afghan |title=Human Rights Watch homepage |accessdate=7 December 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews |title=RAWA news homepage |accessdate=7 December 2010 [/tpl]
One recent report [tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17533816 |title=Hundreds of Afghan women jailed for 'moral crimes'  |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 March 2012 |date=28 March 2012[/tpl]  released by Human Rights Watch in 2012 describes a situation where women are punished by the judicial system for attempting to escape from domestic abuse and also occasionally for being victims of rape. It says that Karzai is "unwilling or unable to take a consistent line against conservative forces within the country," and that the lack of improvement in the plight of women in Afghanistan after ten years is "shocking."

==Recent activities==

RAWA collects funds to support hospitals, schools and orphanages and still run many projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including a project in conjunction with CharityHelp.org for orphan sponsorships.
Recently RAWA restarted its mission inside Afghanistan and organized some of its events in Kabul. They've held events annually on International Women's Day since 2006.
On September 27, 2006, a RAWA member for the first time (perhaps in the whole history of RAWA) appeared on a round table debate on a local Afghan TV channel, TOLO TV. She had a debate with a representative of a hard line Islamic fundamentalist group. She named the top leaders of the Islamist groups and termed them "war criminal and responsible for the ongoing tragedy in Afghanistan". Tolo TV censored the audio of any sections where names were called.
On October 7, the Afghan Women's Mission (AWM) organized a fund raising event for RAWA in Los Angeles, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://afghanwomensmission.org/awmnews/index.php?articleID=62 |title=The Afghan Women's Mission |publisher=- AWM News [/tpl] Eve Ensler was the chief guest and Sonali Kolhatkar and Zoya, a member of RAWA, were among the speakers. "Zoya" is a pseudonym for an active member of RAWA's Foreign Committee who has traveled to many countries, including the U.S. and Spain as well as Germany. In 2003, she received international acclaim for her biography Zoya’s Story - An Afghan Woman’s Battle for Freedom.
In June 2008 Zoya testified to the Human Rights Commission of the German Parliament (Bundestag) to persuade the German government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zcommunications.org/the-u-s-government-has-never-supported-democratic-organizations-by-zoya |title=The U.S. government has never supported democratic organizations... |publisher=zcommunications.org [/tpl]
In 2009, RAWA and other women's rights groups strongly condemned a "Shia Family Code" which is claimed to legalise spousal rape within Northern Afghan Shia Muslim communities, as well as endorsing child marriage, purdah (seclusion) for married women, which was passed by President Hamid Karzai to garner support for his coalition government from hardline elements within the aforesaid communities, as well as the neighbouring Shia-dominated Islamic Republic of Iran. In addition to the above, the new "Family Code" also enshrines discriminatory legal status in the context of inheritance and divorce against women.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-leader-accused-of-bid-to-legalise-rape-1658049.html |title=Afghan leader accused of bid to 'legalise rape'.
