A lady police inspector (Ankitha) keeps on following Kali and tries to seduce him to make him fall in her love. Kali is also a threat for many in his area as he answers only with muscle power if things work against him.

Jyothy wishes to remain unmarried throughout her life assuming deceased Surya as her soul mate and husband.
What happens after Jyothy tells her flash back to Kali is rest of the film. Will Kali marry Jyothy? Or will he marry the police inspector who falls behind him.
