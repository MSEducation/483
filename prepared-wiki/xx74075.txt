==History==

===Early years===

On December 16, 1861, Lord Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley arrived in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i by request of Kamehameha IV and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.  The following year Kamehameha IV, a devout member of the Church of England, established the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, also known as the Anglican Church of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. The school was originally named for Saint Alban.
In 1863, Staley's companion Father Scott purchased land in Lāhaina and established Lua[tpl]okina[/tpl]ehu School, a school for boys.  When Father Scott fell ill and returned to Britain, Father George Mason was summoned by Staley to administer the school.  When Staley, too, left the islands for Britain in 1870, Father Mason moved the school to the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in downtown Honolulu.  It was there that the widowed Queen Emma gave the school its current name.
With the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and annexation to the United States in 1898, the Anglican Church of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i became part of the Episcopal Church United States (ECUSA).  [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani School was moved to Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu, transferred back to downtown Honolulu and then moved to Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu a second time.  It remained in Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu from 1927 to 1953, when it was moved to the present Ala Wai site.
In 1979, the school officially became co-educational, ending its all-male enrollment policy.

[tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani School uses a form of grammar correction introduced by Keables in 1965. Dr. Michael LaGory authored a grammar reference called, "The Keables Guide," that codifies grammar rules in the spirit of Mr. Keables's grammar usage.
