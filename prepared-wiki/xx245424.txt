Themed Attraction Association (TAA) is a Canadian-based organization of companies and individuals working in the themed attractions industry. It was formed in 1986 by  many of the companies and individuals who worked together on developing the exhibits and attractions at Vancouver's Expo 86.  They founded the organization to promote British Columbia and Canada as a center of excellence in the industry and provide networking opportunities for members. The TAA includes many disciplines ranging from consultants to fabricators, designers, architects and planners. Its members work on projects around the world including theme parks, museums, science centers, zoos, world expositions, Olympics, planetariums, heritage sites, traveling exhibits, cultural events and trade shows. There are currently over 40 members of the TAA.
