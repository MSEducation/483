==History==

===2002–04: Formation and Room on the 3rd Floor===

In 2001, Tom Fletcher auditioned for Busted,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebeatsbar.co.uk/ccinterviews/mcfly.html|title=McFly Interview by CMU's Chris Cooke|date=December 2005|accessdate=23 November 2007|work=CMU Beats Bar[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson. Fletcher was originally accepted as part of Busted's line-up, but Island Records went on to reassess the situation and eventually decided to have the band as a three-piece rather than a four-piece. Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his songwriting talents and later offered him a place on the Busted's songwriting 'team', alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) James Bourne; Fletcher has since stated that it was Bourne who taught him how to "properly" structure songs and how to "come up with good, poppy melodies".[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] 
While writing Busted's second album, A Present for Everyone, Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Danny Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended.[tpl]cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1266615,00.html|title=Mad about the boys|author=Alexis Petridis|accessdate=23 November 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London[/tpl] Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=310|title=Debut McFly album track by track|accessdate=23 November 2007|work=McFlyOfficial.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224051039/http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=310 |archivedate=24 December 2007[/tpl] to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the NME magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's t shirt. The name McFly was eventually decided upon as the band name. Fletcher proposed the idea, based on his love for the American science-fiction comedy Back to the Future and Michael J. Fox's character Marty McFly. At first, Jones didn't agree with the name, but after watching the movie, he changed his mind. Especially after he saw that the side of the manure truck says "D. Jones" on it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ilikemusic.com/interviews/-684|title=McFly - Harry chats to ilikemusic.com|work=ilikemusic.com|accessdate=23 November 2007|date=September 2004[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
McFly's early sound was surf/pop rock. Their debut single, "5 Colours in Her Hair", released 29 March 2004, entered the UK Singles Chart at number 1 in April 2004 and stayed there the following week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/1509|title=McFly 5 Colours in Her Hair Music charts|accessdate=11 December 2008[/tpl] In July 2004 their second single, "Obviously", also topped the charts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/1617|title=McFly Obviously Music charts|accessdate=11 December 2007[/tpl] This was followed by the album Room on the 3rd Floor debuting at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. It would go on to be certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album broke records, as McFly earned an award from Guinness World Records for being the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the top position, a distinction previously held by The Beatles. The idea for the album name came from where Jones and Fletcher wrote most of the songs for the album: room 363 in the InterContinental Hotel in London. The third single, "That Girl", was released on 6 September 2004, placing at number 3.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=331|title=Chart Stats – McFly – That Girl|work=McFly – That Girl|accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] The fourth single, Room on the 3rd Floor, the album's title track, was released on 15 November 2004 and reached number 5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=542|title=No.5 – Thanks|work=McFlyOfficial.com|date=21 December 2004|accessdate=23 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224051059/http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=542 |archivedate=24 December 2007[/tpl] McFly supported Busted on their nationwide arena tour along with V in February 2004 and then had their first headlining tour in September 2004.
