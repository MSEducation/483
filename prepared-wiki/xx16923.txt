==Overview==

===History===

During the period of Chairman Mao's leadership in the People's Republic of China, the crude birth rate fell from 37 to 20 per thousand,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.globalgeografia.it/temi/Population%20Growth%20in%20China.pdf |title=Population Growth in China: The Basic Characteristics of China's Demographic Transition |author=Bergaglio, Maristella[/tpl] infant mortality declined from 227/1000 births in 1949 to 53/1000 in 1981, and life expectancy dramatically increased from around 35 years in 1949 to 66 years in 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.co.nz/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:CHN&dl=en&hl=en&q=life+expectancy+china#ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=country&idim=country:CHN&ifdim=country&tstart=-284745600000&tend=220176000000&hl=en&dl=en |title=World Development Indicators|publisher=Google Public Data Explorer |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl] Data from the World Bank Until the 1960s, the government encouraged families to have as many children as possible[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1992-06-07/magazine/tm-411_1_lu-gang | title=The Physics of Revenge: When Dr. Lu Gang's American Dream Died, Six People Died With It | work=Los Angeles Times Magazine | date=1992-06-07 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Mann, Jim[/tpl] because of Mao's belief that population growth empowered the country, preventing the emergence of family planning programs earlier in China's development.[tpl]cite journal|last=Potts|first=M.|title=China's one child policy|journal=BMJ|date=19 August 2006|volume=333|issue=7564|pages=361–362|doi=10.1136/bmj.38938.412593.80|pmc=1550444|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1550444/|pmid=16916810[/tpl] The population grew from around 540 million in 1949 to 940 million in 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010census/2010-08/20/content_11182379.htm |title=Total population, CBR, CDR, NIR and TFR of China (1949–2000) |work=China Daily |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl] Beginning in 1970, citizens were encouraged to marry at later ages and have only two children. Although the fertility rate began to decline significantly, future population growth proved overwhelming and the one-child policy was announced by Chinese leaders. The one child policy had been planned as early as 1977, although it was not mandated nationwide until 1979.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zhu|first=W X|title=The One Child Family Policy|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=1 June 2003|volume=88|issue=6|pages=463–464|doi=10.1136/adc.88.6.463|pmid=12765905|pmc=1763112[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title=East and Southeast Asia: China|work=CIA World Factbook[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|authorlink=Ansley J.

The system of the work unit (Danwei) was crucial to implementing the one-child policy, as workers' reproductive behaviors could be monitored. As part of China's planned-birth policy, unit supervisors monitor the fertility of married women and may decide whose turn it is to have a baby. In 2003, it became possible to marry or divorce someone without needing authorization from the work unit."Work Units". in A Country Study: China. Library of Congress Country Studies

===Administration===

The policy was managed by the National Population and Family Planning Commission under the central government since 1981. The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China and the National Health and Family Planning Commission were made defunct and a new single agency National Health and Family Planning Commission took over national health and family planning policies in 2013. The agency reports to the State Council.

===Current status===

The limit has been strongly enforced in urban towns, but the actual implementation varies from location to location.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific |url=http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/intro.htm|title=Status of Population and Family Planning Program in China by Province |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330215041/http://www.unescap.org/esid/psis/population/database/chinadata/intro.htm |archivedate=30 March 2012[/tpl] In most rural areas, families are allowed to apply to have a second child if their first-born is a daughter[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2002/Oct/46138.htm | title=Family Planning Law and China's Birth Control Situation | newspaper=China Daily | author=Hu, Huiting | date=18 October 2002 | accessdate=2 March 2009[/tpl] or suffers from physical disability, mental illness, or intellectual disability.[tpl]cite episode | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/11.html | title=China's Only Child | series=NOVA | serieslink=Nova (TV series) | network=PBS | date=14 February 1984 | accessdate=13 October 2009[/tpl] Second children are subject to birth spacing (usually 3 or 4 years).

As of 2007, 35.9% of the population were subject to a strict one-child limit. 52.9% were permitted to have a second child if their first was a daughter; 9.6% of Chinese couples were permitted two children regardless of their sex; and 1.6%—mainly Tibetans—had no limit at all.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/china-relaxes-its-one-child-policy/story-e6frg6so-1111112880730 | first=Rowan | last=Callick | title=China relaxes its one-child policy | date=24 January 2007 | work=The Australian[/tpl]
The social fostering or maintenance fee ([tpl]zh|s=社会抚养费|t=社會撫養費|p=shèhuì fǔyǎngfèi|links=no[/tpl]), sometimes called a "family planning fine" in the West, is collected as a fraction of either the annual disposable income of city dwellers or of the annual cash income of peasants, in the year of the child's birth.Summary of Family Planning notice on how FP fines are collected In 2007, the formula for figuring the amount of the fine for a "private enterprise boss" was as follows: For an income of 200,000 yuan per year, the maximum social child-raising fee would be 20,000 × 6 + (200,000 – 20,000) × 2 = 480,000 yuan (about US$63,763) and a minimum 20,000 × 3 + (200,000 – 20,000) × 1 = 240,000 yuan (US$31,884). Both members of the couple would need to pay a fine, although it was left unclear whether they both would pay the same amount.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/224913.htm |title=Heavy Fine for Violators of One-Child Policy |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl] The parents also have to pay for both the children to go to school and all the family's health care.

==Effects==

After the introduction of the one-child policy, the fertility rate in China fell from 2.63 births per woman in 1980 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to 1.61 in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&idim=country:CHN&dl=en&hl=en&q=total+fertility+rate+china |title=World Development Indicators|publisher=Google Public Data Explorer |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl] Data from the World Bank. However, the policy itself is probably only partially responsible for the reduction in the total fertility rate.
China, like many other Asian countries, has a long tradition of son preference.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1432717.htm |title=China – One Child Policy |accessdate=2008-07-01 |author=Taylor, John |date=2005-02-08 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation[/tpl] The commonly accepted explanation for son preference is that sons in rural families are more helpful in farm work. Both rural and urban populations have economic and traditional incentives, including widespread remnants of Confucianism, to prefer sons over daughters. Sons are preferred as they provide the primary financial support for the parents in their retirement, and a son's parents typically are better cared for than his wife's. In addition, Chinese tradition holds that daughters, on their marriage, become primarily part of the groom's family. Male-to-female sex ratios in the current Chinese population are high in both rural and urban areas.[tpl]cite journal|first=Therese|last=Hasketh|author2=Lu, Li|author3=Xing, Zhu Wei|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/11/1171|title=The effects of China's One-Child Family Policy after 25 Years|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=353|issue=11|date=September 15, 2005|pages=1171–1176|doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr051833|pmid=16162890[/tpl]

===Sex-based birth rate disparity===

The sex ratio at birth (between male and female births) in mainland China reached 117:100 and remained steady between 2000 and 2013, substantially higher than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/papers/18_ChenWei.pdf | author=Wei, Chen | title=Sex Ratios at Birth in China | year=2005 | accessdate=2 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=March 2009[/tpl] According to a report by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, there will be 30 million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated emigration.[tpl]cite news| title = Chinese facing shortage of wives| publisher = BBC| date = 2007-01-12| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6254763.stm| accessdate = 2007-01-12[/tpl] The correlation between the increase of sex disparity on birth and the deployment of one child policy would appear to have been caused by the one-child policy.
Other Asian regions also have higher than average ratios, including Taiwan (110:100) and South Korea (108:100), which do not have a family planning policy[tpl]cite web|publisher=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html|title=Sex ratio|work=The World Factbook[/tpl] and the ratio in South Korea was as high as 116:100 in the early 1990s but since then has moved substantially back toward a normal range, with a ratio of 107:100 in 2005.[tpl]cite news|title=Where Boys Were Kings, a Shift Toward Baby Girls|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/world/asia/23skorea.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2007[/tpl] Many studies have explored the reason for the sex-based birth rate disparity in China as well as other countries. A study in 1990 attributed the high preponderance of reported male births in mainland China to four main causes: diseases which affect females more severely than males; the result of widespread underreporting of female births; the illegal practice of sex-selective abortion made possible by the widespread availability of ultrasound; and finally, acts of child abandonment and infanticide. The number of bachelors in China had already increased between 1990 and 2005, implying that China's lack of brides is not solely linked to the one-child policy, as single-child families were only enforced from 1979.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15636231|title=The worldwide war on baby girls|newspaper=The Economist|date=March 8, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, economist Emily Oster proposed a biological explanation for the sex imbalance in Asian countries, including China. Using data on viral prevalence by country as well as estimates of the effect of hepatitis on sex ratio, Oster claimed that Hepatitis B could account for up to 75% of the sex-ratio disparity in China.[tpl]cite journal| first = Emily| last = Oster|date=December 2005| url = http://home.uchicago.edu/eoster/hepb.pdf| title = Hepatitis B and the case of the missing women| journal = Journal of Political Economy| volume = 113| issue = 5| pages =1163–1216| doi = 10.1086/498588[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl]

The same year, Monica Das Gupta showed that whether or not females "go missing" is determined by the existing sex composition of the family into which they are conceived. Girls with no older sisters have similar chances of survival as boys. Girls conceived in families that already have a daughter, experience steeply higher probabilities of being aborted or of dying in early childhood. Gupta claims that cultural factors provide the overwhelming explanation for the "missing" females."[tpl]cite journal|author=Das Gupta, Monica|url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/gupta.pdf|title=Explaining Asia's 'Missing Women'|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=31|date=September 2005|pages=529–535|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00082.x|issue=3[/tpl]
The disparity in the sex ratio at birth increases dramatically after the first birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, a large majority of couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is a boy or a girl. If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction.This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was also noted by Coale, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much more likely to engage in "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children. See [tpl]cite journal|author=Coale, Ansley J.|authorlink=Ansley J.

This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. For example, a study based on the 1990 census found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys.[tpl]cite journal|author=Yi, Zeng Yi|author2=Ping, Tu|author3=Baochang, Gu|author4=Yi, Xu|author5=Bohua, Li|author6=Yongpiing, Li|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=19|date=June 1993|pages=283–302|jstor=2938438|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2938438|title=Causes and Implications of the Recent Increase in the Reported Sex Ratio at Birth in China[/tpl] Another study found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys.[tpl]cite journal|author=Anderson, Barbara A.|coauthor=Silver, Brian D.|year=1995|jstor=2175153|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/ckshih/ANG6366/1123/Anderson%20and%20Silver%201995.pdf|title=Ethnic Differences in Fertility and Sex Ratios at Birth in China: Evidence from Xinjiang|journal=Population Studies|volume=49|issue=July|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/0032472031000148476[/tpl] This evidence is consistent with the observation by another researcher that for a majority of rural families "their ideal family size is one boy and one girl, at most two boys and one girl".[tpl]cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Weiguo|title=Child Adoption in Contemporary Rural China|journal=Journal of Family Issues|date=1 March 2006|volume=27|issue=3|pages=301–340|doi=10.1177/0192513X05283096|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3zhang/Zhang%20JFI%20adoption.pdf[/tpl][tpl]rp|306[/tpl]
A 2006 review article by the editorial board of Population Research ([tpl]zh|s=人口研究|p=Rénkǒu Yánjiū|links=no[/tpl]), one of China's leading demography journals,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] argued that only an approach that makes the rights of women central can succeed in bringing down China's high male sex ratio at birth and improve the survival rate of female infants and girls. A section written by East China Normal University demography professor Ci Qinying argued that researchers must pay closer attention to gender issues and human rights issues in demographic research:
[tpl]quote|How a researcher approaches the question of the sex ratio at birth – from what point for view, considering whose rights – is critical. This depends upon the values of the researcher, the humanistic orientation of the researcher and the consciousness the researcher has about gender and gender discrimination.

The authors of another review article, which was presented at a 2005 conference supported by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, concluded that:

===Abandonment and adoption===

thumb|Rural Sichuan roadside sign: "It is forbidden to discriminate against, mistreat or abandon baby girls." Social pressure exerted by the one-child policy has affected the rate at which parents abandon unwanted children. Many unwanted children live in state-sponsored orphanages, and thousands are adopted from these institutions each year, either by international or Chinese parents. However, in the 1980s and early 1990s, poor care and high mortality rates in some state institutions generated intense international pressure for reform.[tpl]cite book|title=Death by Default:A Policy of Fatal Neglect in China's State Orphanages|year=1996|author=Human Rights Watch/Asia|location=New York|isbn=1-56432-163-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/china96.pdf|title=Chinese Orphanages: A Follow-up|author=Human Rights Watch/Asia|date=March 1996[/tpl]
It is commonly assumed that children offered for adoption have better lives than if they had stayed with their biological parents. Parents may believe that putting unwanted children in orphanages or foster homes is a safe and beneficial step toward moving the children into permanent adoptive homes. On the contrary, many orphanages in China are overcrowded and can have difficulty meeting children's basic needs.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thurston|first=Anne|title=In a Chinese Orphanage|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96apr/orphan/orphan.htm|accessdate=January 24, 2013|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=April 1996|volume=277|pages=28–41|issue=4[/tpl]
In the 1980s, adoptions accounted for half of the so-called "missing girls".[tpl]cite journal | title=The missing girls of China: a new demographic account | last=Johansson | first=Sten | last2=Nygren | first2=Olga | year=1991 | volume=17 | issue=1 | journal = Population and Development Review | pages=35–51 | doi=10.2307/1972351 | publisher=Population Council | jstor=1972351[/tpl] Through the 1980s, as the one-child policy came into force, parents who desired a son but had a daughter often failed to report or delayed reporting female births to the authorities. Some parents may have offered up their daughters for formal or informal adoption. A majority of children who went through formal adoption in China in the later 1980s were girls, and the proportion who were girls increased over time.
The practice of placing daughters for adoption is consistent with the preference of many Chinese couples for sons. At the same time, the relative availability of female children for adoption may be satisfying the wishes of many other Chinese couples, such as those who already have one or more sons, or those who have been unable to have biological children.
According to the Los Angeles Times, many babies put up for adoption had not been abandoned by their parents, but confiscated by family planning officials.[tpl]cite news|author=Demick, Barbara|title=Chinese Babies Stolen by Officials for Foreign Adoptions|work=Los Angeles Times|date=20 September 2009|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-china-adopt20-2009sep20,0,491086.story[/tpl] The prevalence of such activity is unknown.

===Twins sought===

Since there are no penalties for multiple births, it is believed that an increasing number of couples are turning to fertility medicines to induce the conception of twins. According to a 2006 China Daily report, the number of twins born per year in China had doubled.[tpl]clarify timeframe|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-02/14/content_520025.htm | title=China: Drug bid to beat child ban | work=China Daily | accessdate=11 November 2008 | date=14 February 2006 | agency=Associated Press[/tpl]

==Benefits==

===Impact on health care===

It is reported that the focus of China on population control helps provide a better health service for women and a reduction in the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy. At family planning offices, women receive free contraception and pre-natal classes that contributed to the policy's success in two respects. First, the average Chinese household expends fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, which gives many Chinese more money with which to invest. Second, since young Chinese can no longer rely on children to care for them in their old age, there is an impetus to save money for the future.[tpl]cite book|last=Naughton|first=Barry|title=The Chinese Economy: Transitions and Growth|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262640640[/tpl]
Chinese authorities thus consider the policy a great success in helping to implement China's current economic growth. The reduction in the fertility rate and thus population growth has reduced the severity of problems that come with overpopulation, like epidemics, slums, overwhelmed social services (such as health, education, law enforcement), and strain on the ecosystem from abuse of fertile land and production of high volumes of waste. [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Criticism==

By 2012, fueled partly by public disgust with instances of forced abortion, but also other considerations, repeal of the policy was being discussed in some quarters. One thought, backed by demographic research, is that Chinese would not have many more children without the policy than is allowed under the policy.[tpl]cite news|title=Reports of Forced Abortions Fuel Push to End Chinese Law|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/world/asia/pressure-to-repeal-chinas-one-child-law-is-growing.html|accessdate=July 23, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2012|author=Wong, Edward[/tpl]

===Alternatives===

One type of criticism has come from those who acknowledge the challenges stemming from China's high population growth but believe that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that some of these alternatives were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.[tpl]cite journal|author=Greenhalgh, Susan|year=2003|title=Science, Modernity, and the Making of China's One-Child Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=29|issue=June|pages=163–196|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/cmm2436/china%27s_one-child_policy.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2003.00163.x[/tpl]

===Benefits===

The Chinese government states that 400 million births were prevented by the one-child policy as of 2011; this claim is disputed by Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy, and Cai Yong from the Carolina Population Center at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, who put the number of prevented births from 1979 to 2009 at 200 million. In response, Zhai, the professor quoted by official sources for the 400 million claim, clarified that it referred not just to the one-child policy, but includes births prevented by predecessor policies implemented one decade before.
Studies by Chinese demographers, funded in part by the UN Fund for Population Activities, showed that combining poverty alleviation and health care with relaxed targets for family planning was more effective at reducing fertility than vigorous enforcement of very ambitious fertility reduction targets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beijing.usembassy-china.org.cn/report0698family.html|publisher=U.S. Embassy in Beijing|date=June 1988|title=PRC Family Planning: The Market Weakens Controls But Encourages Voluntary Limits[/tpl] In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of Yale University discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the contract responsibility system in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period.PRC journal Social Sciences in China , January 1988[tpl]full citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Zeng contended that the "big cooking pot" system of the People's Communes had insulated people from the costs of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.
As Hasketh, Lu, and Xing observe:
These researchers note further that China could have expected a continued reduction in its fertility rate just from continued economic development, had it kept to the previous policy.

===Human rights violations===

The one-child policy has been challenged in principle and in practice for violating a human right to determine the size of one's own family. According to a 1968 proclamation of the International Conference on Human Rights, "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."[tpl]cite journal|last1= Freedman|first1= Lynn P.|first2= Stephen L.|last2= Isaacs|date=Jan–Feb 1993|title= Human Rights and Reproductive Choice|journal= Studies in Family Planning|volume= 24|issue= 1|pages= 18–30|accessdate= 2007-12-08|doi= 10.2307/2939211|jstor= 2939211|publisher= Population Council|pmid=8475521|url=http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/diana/fulltext/free3.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title= Proclamation of Teheran|publisher= International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968|url= http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|accessdate= 2007-11-08|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|archivedate= 2007-10-17[/tpl]
A 2001 report exposed that a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for Huaiji County in Guangdong Province in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy.

=="Four-two-one" problem==

As the first generation of law-enforced only-children came of age for becoming parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite news | title="四二一"家庭，路在何方？|trans_title='Four-two-one families', where is the road going? | date=5 April 2008 | accessdate=31 January 2011 | author=李雯 Wen | url=http://www.yndaily.com/html/20080405/news_99_16443.html | publisher=云南日报网 Daily Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718142403/http://www.yndaily.com/html/20080405/news_99_16443.html|archivedate=18 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | title=四二一"家庭真的是问题吗？|trans_title=Are 'four-two-one' families really a problem?| url=http://cpachn.org.cn/ShowNews.asp?ID=1021 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110707050058/http://cpachn.org.cn/ShowNews.asp?ID=1021 | archivedate=2011-07-07 | publisher=中国人口学会网 Population Association Online | date=10 October 2010 | accessdate=31 January 2011[/tpl] Called the "4-2-1 Problem", this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If personal savings, pensions, or state welfare fail, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, all provinces have decided that couples are allowed to have two children if both parents were only children themselves: By 2007, all provinces in the nation except Henan had adopted this new policy;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/28/f-rfa-germain.html|title=Rethinking China's one-child policy|publisher=CBC|date=October 28, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=Sina | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子|trans_title=Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children[/tpl] Henan followed in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90882/7657026.html |title=China's most populous province amends family-planning policy |work=People's Daily Online |date=2011-11-25[/tpl]

===Potential social problems===

Some parents may over-indulge their only child. The media referred to the indulged children in one-child families as "little emperors". Since the 1990s, some people have worried that this will result in a higher tendency toward poor social communication and cooperation skills among the new generation, as they have no siblings at home. No social studies have investigated the ratio of these over-indulged children and to what extent they are indulged. With the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced.[tpl]Cite news|title=The Little Emperors|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Deane, Daniela|date=July 26, 1992|page=16|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/magazine/tm-5347_1_one-child-policy[/tpl] However, the "little emperor syndrome" and additional expressions, describing the generation of Chinese singletons are very abundant in the Chinese media, Chinese academy and popular discussions. Being over-indulged, lacking self-discipline and having no adaptive capabilities are adjectives which are highly associated with Chinese singletons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117%20|title=Chinese Singletons – Basic 'Spoiled' Related Vocabulary|work=Thinking Chinese|date=November 11, 2010[/tpl]
Some 30 delegates called on the government in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2007 to abolish the one-child rule, attributing their beliefs to "social problems and personality disorders in young people". One statement read, "It is not healthy for children to play only with their parents and be spoiled by them: it is not right to limit the number to two children per family, either." The proposal was prepared by Ye Tingfang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who suggested that the government at least restore the previous rule that allowed couples to have up to two children. According to a scholar, "The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature's law. And in the long run, this will lead to mother nature's revenge."[tpl]cite news| title = Consultative Conference: 'The government must end the one-child rule' | publisher = AsiaNews.it |date=2007-03-16 | url =http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=8757&size=A[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Advisors say it's time to change one-child policy | publisher = Shanghai Daily |date=2007-03-15 | url = http://english.sina.com/china/1/2007/0315/106515.html[/tpl]

===Unequal enforcement===

Government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines. For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in central China's Hunan province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals.[tpl]cite web | work=Xinhua | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/08/content_912620.htm | title=Over 1,900 officials breach birth policy in C.

Also, people who lived in the rural areas of China were allowed to have two children without punishment. But, the family must wait a couple of years before having another child.

===Birth tourism===

Reports surfaced of Chinese women giving birth to their second child overseas, a practice known as birth tourism. Many went to Hong Kong, which is exempt from the one-child policy. Likewise, a Hong Kong passport differs from China mainland passport by providing additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals. As a result fees for delivering babies there have surged. As further admission cuts or a total ban on non-local births in Hong Kong are being considered, mainland agencies that arrange for expectant mothers to give birth overseas are predicting a surge in those going to North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.review33.com/m/forum_msg.php?db=3&tstart=0&s=&topic=90120131205753&number=5 |title=談天說地 |publisher=review33 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] As the United States practises birthright citizenship, children born in the US will be US citizens. The closest option (from China) is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. The island is currently experiencing an upswing in Chinese births. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children to be able to leave mainland China when they grow older or bring their parents to the US. Canada is less achievable as Ottawa denies many visa requests.[tpl]cite web|title=Birth tourism on the upswing|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=116516|author=Eugenio, Haidee V.|work=Saipan Tribune[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Many Chinese giving birth in CNMI trying to get around one child policy|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=116544|author=Eugenio, Haidee V.|work=Saipan Tribune[/tpl]

===Economic growth===

The original intent of the one-child policy was economic, to reduce the demand of natural resources, maintaining a steady labour rate, reducing unemployment caused from surplus labor, and reducing the rate of exploitation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lpspop.gzlps.gov.cn/art/2008/3/13/art_2338_24378.html |title=全慰天:社会主义经济规律与中国人口问题 |trans_title=Days of full-comfort: the law of the socialist economy with Chinese population |language=Chinese[/tpl] The CPC's justification for this policy was based on their support of Mao Zedong's supposedly Marxist theory of population growth, though Marx was actually witheringly critical of Malthusianism.[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal |author=Tian Z.|url= |title=Marxist theory on population and initiating a new situation in demographic research|journal=Renkou Yanjiu |volume= |issue=2 |pages=13–4 |date=March 1983 |pmid=12313010 |doi= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Wen TZ |title=Comrade Mao Ze-dong's contribution to Marxist theory on population—in commemoration, of the 60th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party |journal=Renkou Yanjiu |volume= |issue=3 |pages=8–11 |date=July 1981 |pmid=12264239 |doi= |url= |language=Chinese[/tpl]

==Relaxation of policy==

In November 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, China announced the decision to relax the one-child policy. Under the new policy, families can have two children if one parent is an only child.China reforms: One-child policy to be relaxed. Bbc.co.uk (2013-11-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-05.
The coastal province of Zhejiang, one of China's most affluent, became the first area to implement this "relaxed policy" in January 2014.[tpl]cite news|title=Eastern Chinese province first to ease one-child policy|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/17/us-china-onechild-idUSBREA0G0J220140117|newspaper=Reuters|date=17 January 2014[/tpl]
Nevertheless, Deputy Director Wang Peian of the National Health and Family Planning Commission said that "China's population will not grow substantially in the short term".Burkitt, Laurie.
