Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released in June 1967, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 22 weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart and 15 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour.
Regarded as an early concept album, Sgt. Pepper continued the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases while advancing the use of extended form in popular music. It is often described as one of the first art rock albums, aiding the development of progressive rock. An important work of British psychedelia, the multigenre album incorporates diverse stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, Western and Indian classical music. Following the Beatles' August 1966 retirement from touring and the ensuing three-month break from Abbey Road Studios, they endeavored to improve upon the production quality of their prior releases. The group adopted an experimental approach to composition and the producer George Martin's innovative recording of the album's tracks, such as "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "A Day in the Life", included the liberal application of signal processing and the use of a forty-piece orchestra. The album cover was designed by the English pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth from a sketch by Paul McCartney that depicted the band posing in front of a collage of celebrities and historical figures.
In 2003 the Library of Congress placed Sgt. Pepper in the National Recording Registry, preserving the work as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". In 2005 Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number one in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. As of 2014 it has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time. The music scholar David Scott Kastan described it as "the most important and influential rock and roll album ever recorded".[tpl]sfn|Kastan|2006|p=139[/tpl]

==Background==

[tpl]quote box|quote= "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys, we were men ... and thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers."[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|p=303[/tpl] |source=—Paul McCartney|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;[/tpl]
By 1966 the Beatles had grown weary of live performance.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=210[/tpl] In June, just two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212[/tpl] When it progressed to Japan the polite and restrained audience shocked the group – as the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=212–213[/tpl] When, having returned to London, George Harrison was asked about their long-term plans, he replied: "We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans."[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213[/tpl] His comments would prove to be surprisingly accurate, as soon afterward John Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being "more popular than Jesus" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213[/tpl] A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadia and subpar performances proved to be the group's last.[tpl]harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=210: the Beatles grew tired of touring, 230: the Beatles final commercial performance[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=213[/tpl]: a public apology eased tensions, but the 1966 US tour was miserable.[tpl]refn|group=nb|According to the Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, "To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup anyway."[tpl]sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=58–59[/tpl][/tpl]
Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break-up.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=1[/tpl] Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213[/tpl] In Lennon's opinion they could "send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites."[tpl]sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=229[/tpl] The band subsequently took a seven-week holiday, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to develop his sitar playing at the instruction of Ravi Shankar.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=2[/tpl] Paul McCartney and producer George Martin collaborated on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way.[tpl]sfn|Blaney|2007|p=8[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Martin used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations for The Family Way soundtrack, which failed to chart, but won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.[tpl]sfn|Blaney|2007|p=8[/tpl][/tpl] Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=158, 160–161[/tpl] Ringo Starr used the break to spend more time with his wife and first child.[tpl]harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=323, 333[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008b|p=2[/tpl].

==Concept and inspiration==

In November 1966, during a return flight to London from Kenya, where he had been on holiday with Beatles' tour manager Mal Evans, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the Sgt Pepper concept.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=2[/tpl] His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band that Evans invented a name for in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=168[/tpl] In February 1967 McCartney suggested that the Beatles should record an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional band.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|pp=20–21[/tpl] This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. He explained: "I thought, let's not be ourselves. Let's develop alter egos."[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|pp=303–304[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|In the opinion of the musicologist Walter Everett, the alter egos "allowed the Beatles to remove themselves from the public by an extra layer – they were now giving a performance of a performance".[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=99[/tpl][/tpl] Martin remembered:
[tpl]Quote|"'Sergeant Pepper' itself didn't appear until halfway through making the album. It was Paul's song, just an ordinary rock number ... but when we had finished it, Paul said, 'Why don't we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed, as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record? We'll dub in effects and things.' I loved the idea, and from that moment on it was as though Pepper had a life of its own".[tpl]sfn|Martin|1994|p=202[/tpl][/tpl]
During the early and mid-1960s, the American group the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication. Led by their principal songwriter, bassist and producer Brian Wilson, they combined jazz-inspired vocal harmony with surf music, creating their unique sound.[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=36[/tpl] In 1966 Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for the Beatles' album Rubber Soul resulted in the Pet Sounds LP, which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement.[tpl]harvnb|MacFarlane|2008|pp=36–37[/tpl]: Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording; [tpl]harvnb|Kimsey|2009|p=235[/tpl]: Wilson's admiration for the Beatles' Rubber Soul. According to the musicologist Thomas MacFarlane, the release was widely influential among musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to "expand the focus of the Beatles' work with sound and textures not usually associated with popular music."[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=36–37[/tpl] It also led him to develop a melodically-focused style of bass guitar playing that would become prevalent on many of his recordings.[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|p=281[/tpl] McCartney wanted to model portions of an album after the Beach Boys' approach to production and songwriting, which he considered "a really clean American sound".[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=141, 171[/tpl] He elaborated: "I love the orchestra, the arrangements ... the instrumentation ... the way he uses harmonicas ... the way he uses harpsichords ... the way he uses timpanis and snare drums, and they're often on odd little patterns ... The writing for the harmonies is brilliant. I love the melodies."[tpl]cite AV media|people = Lead, David|year=1993|title=Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys|medium =Booklet|format =Liner notes| publisher=Capitol[/tpl] McCartney later claimed that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to "escape the influence", and added: "It's very cleverly done ... so Beatles were inspired by it and nicked a few ideas."[tpl]harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=204[/tpl]: "It's very cleverly done"; [tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008c|p=158[/tpl]: "escape the influence". Martin stated: "Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds."[tpl]cite news|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|title='Pet Sounds Sessions': Body of Influence Put in a Box|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/01/entertainment/ca-48891|date=1 November 1997|accessdate=9 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention is often cited as having influenced Sgt.

==Recording and production==

According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=99[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Emerick the recording of Sgt. Pepper marks the emergence of McCartney as the Beatles' de facto producer, as Martin was increasingly absent near the end of late-night sessions that often lasted until dawn.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=163[/tpl] Emerick asserts that – by the time of the Sgt. Pepper sessions – "it was evident that John's personality was changing. Instead of being opinionated about everything, he was becoming complacent; in fact, he seemed quite content to have someone else do his thinking for him."[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=174[/tpl][/tpl] Sessions began on 24 November 1966 at Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=87[/tpl] Afforded the luxury of a limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|EMI owned the Beatles' recordings and Abbey Road Studios, so they did not deduct fees for studio time from the band's royalty payments during the recording and production of Sgt. Pepper.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215[/tpl][/tpl] They began with three songs that were written with the intention to record an entire album of material that would be thematically linked to their childhoods: "Strawberry Fields Forever", "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "Penny Lane".[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|p=99[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=212–223[/tpl]. The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron. Acquired by Lennon, the Mellotron's keys triggered one of three tape loops for flutes, strings or choirs, enabling its user to play in those three voices. McCartney performed the introduction to "Strawberry Fields Forever" using the flute setting.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=135–136[/tpl] The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=217–220[/tpl] Martin's chief engineer, Geoff Emerick, remembers: "Since the days of Revolver, we had gotten used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary."[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=139[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to the Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, "the really serious experimentation" started in April 1966, with the closing track from Revolver – "Tomorrow Never Knows".[tpl]harvnb|Davies|2009|p=261[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=185–193[/tpl] In Emerick's opinion the "major difference" between Revolver and Sgt. Pepper is that with the latter there was no absolute deadline for completion. He also notes that recording sessions for Revolver were primarily booked during the afternoon and early evening, whereas sessions for Sgt. Pepper typically started after 7 pm.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=142[/tpl][/tpl]
"Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were subsequently released as a double A-sided single in February 1967 after EMI and Epstein pressured Martin for a single.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|pp=19–20[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|"Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were later included as part of the American LP version of Magical Mystery Tour, which was issued as a six-track double EP in the UK.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351[/tpl][/tpl] With the release the childhood concept was abandoned in favour of Sgt. Pepper, and at Epstein's insistence the single tracks were not included on the LP.[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|p=99[/tpl]: the childhood concept was abandoned in favour of Sgt. Pepper; [tpl]harvnb|Miles|1997|p=306[/tpl]: at Epstein's insistence the single tracks were not included on the LP. When the single failed to reach number one in the UK, British press agencies speculated that the group's run of success might have ended, with headlines such as "Beatles Fail to Reach the Top", "First Time in Four Years" and "Has the Bubble Burst?"[tpl]sfn|Harry|2002|p=714[/tpl] Martin later described the decision to drop these two songs as "the biggest mistake of my professional life."[tpl]sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=26[/tpl] Nonetheless, in his opinion "Strawberry Fields Forever", which he and the band spent an unprecedented 55 hours of studio time recording, "set the agenda for the whole album."[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=219[/tpl]: 55 hours of studio time; [tpl]harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=13[/tpl]: "set the agenda for the whole album."[tpl]refn|group=nb|After three weeks they had completed only two songs, which according to Emerick drew criticism from his colleagues at EMI that he responded to with "just wait".[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=141[/tpl][/tpl] He explained: "It was going to be a record ... songs that couldn't be performed live: they were designed to be studio productions and that was the difference."[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=6[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|The recording of "Strawberry Fields Forever" was the first time that the Beatles could work without the burden of a deadline. It marks the beginning of their studio years.[tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008c|p=156[/tpl]: the beginning of the studio years; [tpl]harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=233[/tpl]: no deadline.[/tpl] McCartney's goal was to make the best Beatles album yet, declaring: "Now our performance is that record."[tpl]harvnb|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=132[/tpl]: McCartney's goal; [tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008b|p=6[/tpl]: "Now our performance is that record." Emerick recalls: "Because we knew that the Beatles wouldn't ever have to play the songs live, there were no creative boundaries."[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190[/tpl] On 6 December the group began work on "When I'm Sixty-Four", the first track that would be included on Sgt. Pepper.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=220–221[/tpl]
Sgt. Pepper was recorded using four-track equipment.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=176[/tpl] Although eight-track tape recorders were available in the US, the first units were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=96[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Eight-track recorders were first used on a Beatles album in 1968, during sessions for the White Album.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=176[/tpl][/tpl] As with previous Beatles albums, the Sgt. Pepper recordings made extensive use of the technique known as reduction mixing, in which a number of tracks were recorded across the four tracks of one recorder, which were then mixed and dubbed down onto one or several tracks of the master four-track machine. This enabled the Abbey Road engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|2009|p=29[/tpl] McCartney tended to play other instruments than his usual bass when recording the backing track, preferring to overdub it later, and "Fixing a Hole" was the only track released on Sgt. Pepper where it was cut live.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=235–235[/tpl] To record the orchestra for "A Day In The Life", Martin had to synchronise a four track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub, which the engineer Ken Townsend achieved by using a 50 Hz control signal between the two machines.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=96[/tpl]
A key feature of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and his engineer's liberal use of signal processing to shape the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting.[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=133[/tpl] Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics.[tpl]sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62[/tpl] Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. During the recording sessions for Revolver in 1966, ADT was invented especially for the Beatles by Townsend, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. ADT quickly became a near-universal recording practice in popular music.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=70[/tpl] Martin, having fun at Lennon's expense, described the technique: "We take the original image and we split it through a double vibrocated sploshing flange with double negative feedback", to which Lennon responded: "You're pulling my leg aren't you?"[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=70[/tpl] Martin replied: "Well, let's flange it again and see", thus originating the term flanging.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=70[/tpl] Another important effect was varispeeding, the technique of recording various tracks on a multi-track tape at slightly different tape speeds, which was used extensively on their vocals in this period. The speeding up of vocals became a widespread technique in pop production. The band also used the effect on portions of their backing tracks – as on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" – where the tape speed dropped from 49 cycles per second to 45, giving them a thicker and more diffuse sound.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=101[/tpl] Varispeeding was also used on "When I'm Sixty-Four", raising the music's pitch by a semitone in an attempt to make McCartney sound younger.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=137[/tpl] Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190[/tpl]
[tpl]quote box|quote= "Listening to each stage of their recording, once they've done the first couple of tracks, it's often hard to see what they're still looking for, it sounds so complete. Often the final complicated, well-layered version seems to have drowned the initial simple melody. But they know it's not right, even if they can't put it into words. Their dedication is impressive, gnawing away at the same song for stretches of ten hours each."[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|pp=273–274[/tpl]|source=—Hunter Davies, 1968|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;[/tpl]
In an effort to get the right sound, the Beatles attempted numerous re-takes of "Getting Better". When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called-off soon afterward as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking.[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|p=270[/tpl] Starr, who after the completion of his basic drum parts saw his participation limited to minor percussion overdubs, later lamented: "The biggest memory I have of Sgt. Pepper ... is I learned to play chess".[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=100[/tpl] For the album's title track, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of damping and close-miking, which at the time were new recording techniques that MacDonald credits with creating a "three-dimensional" sound that – along with other Beatles innovations – engineers in the US would soon adopt as standard practice.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=233–234[/tpl] The album makes use of several keyboard instruments. McCartney plays a grand piano on "A Day in the Life"[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=120[/tpl] and a Lowrey organ on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds",[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=104[/tpl] while Martin played a Hohner Pianet on "Getting Better",[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=106[/tpl] a harpsichord on "Fixing a Hole",[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=107[/tpl] and a harmonium on "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!"[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=110[/tpl] Harrison used a tamboura on several tracks, including "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "Getting Better".[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|pp=104, 106[/tpl]
The UK pressing of Sgt. Pepper was the first pop album to be mastered without rills, the momentary gaps that are typically placed between tracks as a point of demarcation.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=170[/tpl] It made use of two crossfades so that songs blended together, giving the impression of a continuous live performance.[tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008c|p=162[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=251[/tpl].[tpl]refn|group=nb|"Sgt. Pepper" was crossfaded into "With a Little Help from My Friends" and the "Sgt. Pepper" reprise was crossfaded into "A Day in the Life".[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=251[/tpl][/tpl] Although both stereo and monaural mixes of the album were prepared, the Beatles were minimally involved in what they regarded as the less important stereo mix sessions, leaving the task to Martin and Emerick.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=252[/tpl] The recording and production of Sgt. Pepper was completed on 21 April 1967. Emerick estimates that they spent 700 hours on the LP, more than 30 times that of the first Beatles album, Please Please Me, which cost £400.[tpl]harvnb|Davies|2009|p=262[/tpl]: the recording of Please Please Me cost £400 – equivalent to £[tpl]Formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|400|1967[/tpl][/tpl] today; [tpl]harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=253[/tpl]: they spent 700 hours recording Sgt.

==Music and lyrics==

Sgt. Pepper is a multigenre album that is a work of rock and pop.[tpl]harvnb|Hannan|2008|p=61[/tpl]: "The album is made up of a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres"; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|pp=18, 70–79[/tpl]: rock and pop; [tpl]harvnb|Wagner|2008|p=76[/tpl]: the "multigenre nature of Sgt. Pepper". It incorporates the diverse stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, Western and Indian classical music.[tpl]harvnb|Hannan|2008|pp=61–62[/tpl]: music hall and blues; [tpl]harvnb|Wagner|2008|p=76[/tpl]; rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, chamber, circus, avant-garde, Western and Indian classical music. In the opinion of the author Naphtali Wagner, its music reconciles the "diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals" of classical and psychedelia, achieving a "psycheclassical synthesis" of the two forms.[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2008|pp=76, 89–90[/tpl]
[tpl]quote box|quote= "When Martin was doing his TV programme on Pepper ... he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album."[tpl]cite web|title=1 – 'A Day in the Life'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/a-day-in-the-life-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl] |source=—Paul McCartney|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;[/tpl]
Concerns that some of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to recreational drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from the radio, such as "A Day in the Life" because of the phrase "I'd love to turn you on", with the BBC claiming that it could "encourage a permissive attitude toward drug-taking."[tpl]cite book|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|title= El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency |year=2011|publisher= Bloomsbury Press|isbn=978-1-60819-401-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1G4FlXMOgfkC&pg=PT28&dq |page=38[/tpl] Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity.For Lennon and McCartney's contemporary denial of an intentional reference to illicit drugs in the lyrics to "A Day in the Life" see: [tpl]cite book|last=Glausser |first=Wayne |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of LSD |publisher=MacFarland|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7864-4785-5|page=29[/tpl]; For McCartney's immediate denial in Melody Maker see: [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=60[/tpl]; for McCartney later suggesting that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity, see: [tpl]harvnb|Miles|1997|p=325[/tpl]. The meaning of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=240[/tpl] The BBC used this as justification for banning the track from British radio.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=174[/tpl] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" was also banned by the BBC because of the lyric that mentions "Henry the Horse", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin.[tpl]sfn|Whiteley|2008|pp=18–19[/tpl] Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and that "Fixing a Hole" was a reference to heroin use.[tpl]sfn|Spitz|2005|p=697[/tpl] Others noted lyrics such as "I get high" from "With a Little Help from My Friends", "take some tea" – slang for cannabis use – from "Lovely Rita" and "digging the weeds" from "When I'm Sixty-Four".[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=60[/tpl] 
In the opinion of the author Sheila Whiteley, Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] underlying philosophy relates not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement.[tpl]sfn|Whiteley|2008|pp=15, 22[/tpl] According to the musicologist Oliver Julien, the album "embodied the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s."[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008c|p=166[/tpl] The professor Alan F. Moore asserts that its primary value "is that it manages to capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place."[tpl]sfn|Moore|2008|p=140[/tpl] Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with "providing a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love".[tpl]sfn|Whiteley|2008|p=22[/tpl] The American psychologist Timothy Leary asserts that the LP "gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over ... it came along at the right time" and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda.[tpl]sfn|Whiteley|2008|p=22[/tpl] Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt.

Sgt. Pepper opens with the title track, starting with 10 seconds of the combined sounds of a pit orchestra warming-up and an audience waiting for a concert, which introduces the illusion of the album as a live performance.[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|p=101[/tpl]: pit orchestra and audience; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=23[/tpl]: the illusion of a live performance; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=27[/tpl]: 10 seconds of introductory ambiance.[tpl]refn|group=nb|The crowd noises on "Sgt. Pepper" were gleaned from the Abbey Road archive, including "Volume 28: Audience Applause and Atmosphere, Royal Albert Hall and Queen Elizabeth Hall" for the murmuring, and Martin's recording of a 1961 comedy show, Beyond the Fringe, for the laughter. The screaming that is heard as the song segues into "With a Little Help from My Friends" was overdubbed from one of Martin's recordings of the Beatles performing at the Hollywood Bowl.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=248[/tpl] According to MacDonald they also used recordings of ambient sounds captured during the 10 February orchestral session for "A Day in the Life".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=233[/tpl][/tpl] The musicologist Kevin Womack describes the lyrics as "a revolutionary moment in the creative life of the Beatles" that bridges the gap – sometimes referred to as the Fourth wall – between the audience and the artist.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=169[/tpl] He argues that, paradoxically, the lyrics "exemplify the mindless rhetoric of rock concert banter" while "mocking the very notion of a pop album's capacity for engendering authentic interconnection between artist and audience".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=169[/tpl] In his opinion the mixed message ironically serves to distance the group from their fans while simultaneously "gesturing toward" them as alter egos, an authorial quality that he considers to be "the song's most salient feature."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=169[/tpl] He credits the recording's use of a brass ensemble with distorted electric guitars as an early example of rock fusion.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=169[/tpl] The musicologist Ian MacDonald agrees, describing the track as an overture rather than a song, and a "shrewd fusion of Edwardian variety orchestra" and contemporary hard rock.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=233[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Moore identifies the middle section of "Sgt. Pepper" as the moment when the juxtaposition becomes fusion.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=28[/tpl][/tpl] It utilises a rock and roll orientated Lydian mode chord progression during the introduction and verses that is built on parallel sevenths, which Everett describes as "the song's strength".[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=101[/tpl] The five-bar bridge is filled by an Edwardian horn quartet that Martin arranged from a McCartney vocal melody.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=233[/tpl] The track turns to the pentatonic scale for the chorus, where its blues rock progression is augmented by the use of electric guitar power chords played in consecutive fifths.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=101[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|The song's lead guitar part was played by McCartney, who replaced an effort by Harrison that he had spent seven hours recording. MacDonald speculates that this might have contributed to Harrison's minimised role on the album.[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=233[/tpl]: (secondary source); [tpl]harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|pp=66–67[/tpl]: (primary source).[/tpl]
McCartney acts as the master of ceremonies near the end of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", introducing Starr as an alter ego named Billy Shears.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=170[/tpl] The song then segues into "With a Little Help from My Friends" amidst a moment of crowd cheer that Martin had recorded during a Beatles concert at the Hollywood Bowl.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|pp=170–171[/tpl] Womack describes Starr's baritone lead vocals as "charmingly sincere" and he credits them with imparting an element of "earnestness in sharp contrast with the ironic distance of the title track."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|pp=170–171[/tpl] Lennon and McCartney's call and response backing vocals ask Starr questions about the meaning of friendship and true love.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=171[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|In mid-March 1967, during a songwriting session at McCartney's home in St John's Wood, he and Lennon wrote "With a Little Help from My Friends" as a song for Starr. With Lennon on guitar and McCartney on piano, they traded lines back and forth, eventually settling on the call-and-response format of questions and answers.[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|pp=263–268[/tpl] According to Emerick, it was "one of the very few songs" that Lennon and McCartney had "co-written in recent years".[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=181[/tpl][/tpl] In MacDonald's opinion, the track is "at once communal and personal ... its touchingly rendered by Starr and meant as a gesture of inclusivity; everyone could join in."[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=247[/tpl] Womack agrees, identifying "necessity of community" as the song's "central ethical tenet", a theme that he ascribes to the album as a whole.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=171[/tpl] Everett notes the track's use of a major key double-plagal cadence that would become commonplace in pop music following the release of Sgt. Pepper. He characterises the arrangement as clever, particularly its reversal of the question and answer relationship in the final verse, in which the backing singers ask leading questions and Starr provides unequivocal answers.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=103[/tpl] The song ends on a vocal high note that McCartney, Harrison and Lennon encouraged Starr to achieve despite his lack of confidence as a singer.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=182–183[/tpl]
[tpl]listen|filename= The first 18 seconds of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" by the Beatles 1967.ogg|title= The beginning of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"|description= According to Womack "the Beatles achieve their most vivid instance of musical timbre by merging the nonsensicality and visual imagery of John's lyrics with the ADT-treated sounds of Paul's unforgettable Lowrey organ introduction".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=171–172[/tpl] [/tpl]
Despite widespread suspicion that the title of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" contained a hidden reference to LSD, Lennon insisted that it was derived from a pastel drawing by his four-year-old son Julian. A hallucinatory chapter from Lewis Carroll[tpl]'s[/tpl] 1871 novel, Through the Looking-Glass, inspired the song's atmosphere.[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=240[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Womack|2007|p=172[/tpl] The lyric begins with what Womack characterises as "an invitation in the form of an imperative" through the line: "Picture yourself in a boat on a river", and continues with imaginative imagery, including "tangerine trees", "rocking horse people" and "newspaper taxis".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=172[/tpl] In MacDonald's opinion, "the lyric explicitly recreates the psychedelic experience".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=240[/tpl] According to Lennon: "It was Alice in the boat. She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty. The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are ... in a rowing boat and I was visualizing that. There was also the image of the female who would someday come to save me – a 'girl with kaleidoscope eyes' who would come out of the sky. It turned out to be Yoko ... so maybe it should be 'Yoko in the Sky with Diamonds'."[tpl]sfn|Sheff|1981|p=181[/tpl]
MacDonald considers "Getting Better" to contain "the most ebullient performance" on Sgt. Pepper.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=241[/tpl] In Womack's opinion the track's "driving rock sound" distinguishes it from the album's overtly psychedelic material with lyrics that enliven the listener "to usurp the past by living well and flourishing in the present."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=172[/tpl] He cites it as a strong example of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, particularly Lennon's addition of the lyric: "couldn't get much worse", which serves as a "sarcastic rejoinder" to McCartney's chorus: "It's getting better all the time".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=173[/tpl] McCartney describes Lennon's lyric as "sardonic" and "against the spirit of the song", which he characterises as "typical John."[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=106[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Lennon's contribution to the lyric includes a confessional regarding his having been violent with female companions: "I used to be cruel to my woman".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=173[/tpl] He explained: "I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=173[/tpl] In Womack's opinion, the song encourages the listener to follow the speaker's example and "alter their own angst-ridden ways": "Man I was mean, but I'm changing my scene and I'm doing the best that I can."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=173[/tpl][/tpl] MacDonald describes the beginning of the track as "blithely unorthodox", with two staccato guitars – one panned left and one right – playing the dominant against the subdominant of an F major ninth chord, with the tonic C resolving as the verse begins. The dominant, which acts as a drone, is reinforced through the use of octaves played on a bass guitar and plucked on piano strings.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=242[/tpl] Everett notes McCartney's "adventurous" bass line, which accents non-roots on the recording's downbeat.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=106[/tpl]
In Womack's opinion, the lyrics to "Fixing a Hole" focus on "the speaker's search for identity among the crowd", in particular the "quests for consciousness and connection" that differentiate individuals from society as a whole.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=173[/tpl] MacDonald characterises it as a "distracted and introverted track", during which McCartney forgoes his "usual smooth design" in favour of "something more preoccupied".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=236[/tpl] He cites Harrison's electric guitar solo as serving the track well, capturing its mood by conveying detachment.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=236[/tpl] McCartney drew inspiration for the song in part from his work restoring a Scottish farmhouse.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|pp=106–107[/tpl] Womack notes his adaptation of the lyric: "a hole in the roof where the rain leaks in" from Elvis Presley's "We're Gonna Move".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|pp=106–107[/tpl] The song deals with McCartney's desire to let his mind wander freely and to express his creativity without the burden of self-conscious insecurities.[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|pp=314–315[/tpl]
In Everett's opinion the lyrics to "She's Leaving Home" address the problem of alienation "between disagreeing peoples", particularly those distanced from each other by the generation gap.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=107[/tpl] McCartney's "descriptive narration", which details the plight of a "lonely girl" who escapes the control of her "selfish yet well-meaning parents", was inspired by a piece about teenage runaways published by the Daily Mail.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=108[/tpl] Womack describes the song as "a quaint study of a young woman's need to discover a sense of identity and become a conscious participant in the world."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=174[/tpl] It is the first track on the album to eschew the use of guitars and drums, featuring a string nonet with a harp and drawing comparison with "Yesterday" and "Eleanor Rigby", which utilise a string quartet and octet respectively.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=37[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|For the 17 March recording of "She's Leaving Home", McCartney hired Mike Leander to arrange the string section as Martin was occupied producing one of his other artists, Cilla Black.[tpl]Harvnb|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=180–181[/tpl]: (primary source) and Martin recording with Cilla Black; [tpl]Harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=249[/tpl]: (secondary source). Martin was upset to discover that Leander had written the arrangement in his absence, but conducted the musicians using the score more or less as written.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=245[/tpl][/tpl] While Richard Goldstein's 1967 review in the The New York Times characterises the song as uninspired, MacDonald identifies the track as one of the two best on Sgt. Pepper. In Moore's opinion, the writers judge the work from "opposing criteria", with Goldstein opining during the dawn of the counterculture of the 1960s whereas MacDonald – writing in 1995 – is "intensely aware of movement's failings."[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=37[/tpl]
Lennon adapted the lyric for "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he purchased at an antique shop in Kent on the day of filming the promotional film for "Strawberry Fields Forever".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=237–238[/tpl] Womack praises the track's successful blending of a print source and music: "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=175[/tpl] According to MacDonald, Lennon requested a "fairground production wherein one could smell the sawdust"; Martin and Emerick created the resulting atmospheric sound collage by collecting recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and calliopes, which were then cut into strips of various lengths, thrown into a box, mixed up and edited together in random order, creating a loop that was mixed-in during final production.[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=237–238[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=40[/tpl].[tpl]refn|group=nb|Emerick first employed this method in 1966, while creating the ambiance for "Yellow Submarine" from Revolver.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=168[/tpl][/tpl] In MacDonald's opinion, the song represents "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238[/tpl] According to Everett, the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=110[/tpl]

After it was decided that "Only a Northern Song" was not good enough for inclusion on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison wrote the Hindustani classical music-inspired "Within You Without You".[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=111–112[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Womack|2007|p=176[/tpl].[tpl]refn|group=nb|In January 1969, "Only a Northern Song" was released on the soundtrack album for the animated film Yellow Submarine.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=97[/tpl][/tpl] According to MacDonald, the track is an "ambitious essay in cross-cultural fusion and meditative philosophy" that most commentators dismiss as boring, with critics characterising the music as lacking "harmonic interest" and the lyric as "sanctimonious ... didactic and dated".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=243[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|In Riley's opinion "Within You Without You", which he describes as monotonous, dull and "directionless", is "the most dated piece on the record ... it could easily have been left off with little to no effect" on the album.[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|pp=220–221[/tpl][/tpl] In Moore's opinion, the recording's reliance on melody in favour of harmony is entirely appropriate for the genre. He characterises the critical response as "extremely varied", with Goldstein including the track as one of the album's highlights. Others see it as an apt summary of the material from the first side.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=45[/tpl] MacDonald describes the song as a "distant departure" from the Beatles' sound and a "remarkable achievement" that represents the "conscience" of the LP.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=243–244[/tpl] Womack agrees, calling it "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=176[/tpl] Maximising the recording's "capacity for expressiveness", the track features a tempo rubato that is without precedent in the Beatles' catalogue.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=176[/tpl] The pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=112[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|"Within You Without You" was recorded on 15 March with Harrison on vocals, sitar and tambura; the other instruments, including tabla, dilruba, swarmandel and an additional tambura, were played by four London-based Indian musicians. None of the other Beatles participated in the recording.[tpl]Harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=248[/tpl]: London-based Indian musicians and non-participation of the other Beatles; [tpl]Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=243–244[/tpl]: Harrison singing and playing sitar and tambura on "Within You Without You".[/tpl] The track ends with a burst of laughter that some have interpreted as a mockery of Harrison's song, but he explains: "Well, after all that long Indian stuff you want some light relief. It's a release after five minutes of sad music. You haven't got to take it all that seriously, you know. You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as they listen to Sergeant Pepper's Show. That was the style of the album."[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|p=321[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Martin and Emerick advised against the inclusion of the laughter, which was gleaned from the Abbey Road effects tape "Volume 6: Applause and Laughter", but Harrison insisted.[tpl]harvnb|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=187[/tpl]: Martin and Emerick advised against the inclusion of the laughter; [tpl]harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=251[/tpl]: gleaned from Abbey Road effects tape.[/tpl]
MacDonald cites "When I'm Sixty-Four" as an example of the Beatles' versatility. In his opinion the track is "aimed chiefly at parents", borrowing heavily from the English music hall style of George Formby and Donald McGill, with a sparse arrangement that includes clarinet, drums, guitar and bass.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=220–221[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to MacDonald, the song receives a "cool reception" from most younger listeners and Everett singles it out as a case of McCartney's "penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville ... that Lennon detested".[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|p=113[/tpl]: McCartney's "penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville"; [tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=221[/tpl]: a "cool reception"[/tpl]  McCartney wrote the tune in the late 1950s as an instrumental piece, revisiting the composition in 1966 around the time of his father's sixty-fourth birthday.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=112[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|A version of "When I'm Sixty-Four" was performed by the Beatles during their time in Hamburg.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=177[/tpl][/tpl] Moore credits Martin's clarinet arrangement and Starr's use of brushes with establishing the music hall atmosphere, which is reinforced by McCartney's vocal delivery and the recording's use of chromaticism, a harmonic pattern that can be traced to Scott Joplin's "The Ragtime Dance" and The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=46[/tpl] He characterises the song as a synthesis of ragtime and pop, noting that its position following "Within You Without You" – a blend of Indian classical music and pop – demonstrates the diversity of the Beatles' material, which he identifies as an important factor in their success.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=47[/tpl] Everett notes that the lyric's protagonist is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to the others on the album.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=113[/tpl]
Womack characterises "Lovely Rita" as a work of "full-tilt psychedelia" that contrasts sharply with the preceding track.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=177[/tpl] He identifies the song as an example of McCartney's talent for "creating imagistic musical portraiture", but considers it to be among the album's weakest offerings, presaging what he describes as the "less effectual compositions" that the Beatles would record post-Sgt. Pepper.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=177[/tpl] Inspired by the traffic warden Meta Davis, who had recently given McCartney a parking ticket, in Womack's opinion "the song accomplishes little in the way of advancing the album's journey toward a more expansive human consciousness".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=177[/tpl] Despite his reservations, he considers the track to be "irresistibly charming".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=177[/tpl] Moore agrees, describing the composition as a "throwaway" while praising what he characterises as its "strong sense of harmonic direction".[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=48[/tpl] According to MacDonald, the song is a "satire on authority" that is "imbued with an exuberant interest in life that lifts the spirits, dispersing self-absorption".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=239[/tpl]
Inspired by a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes, from which Lennon adapted a jingle as the song's refrain, "Good Morning, Good Morning" utilises the bluesy mixolydian mode in A that in Everett's opinion "perfectly expresses Lennon's grievance against complacency."[tpl]harvnb|Everett|1999|p=116[/tpl]: "grievance against complacency"; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=50[/tpl]: the bluesy mixolydian mode in A. Lennon considered the song "a throwaway piece of garbage" and McCartney viewed it as Lennon's reaction to the frustrations of domestic life.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=234[/tpl] Womack praises the song's varied time signatures, including 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, calling it a "masterpiece of electrical energy".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|pp=177–178[/tpl] MacDonald notes Starr's "fine performance" and McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo", which he credits with delivering the track's climax.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=235[/tpl] A series of animal noises are heard during the fade-out that are sequenced – at Lennon's request – so that each successive animal is large enough to devour the preceding one.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=235[/tpl]
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" serves as a bookend for the album and a segue to its finale. The hard-rocking song was written after the Beatles' assistant, Neil Aspinall, suggested that since "Sgt. Pepper" opened the album the fictional band should make an appearance near the end.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248[/tpl] The reprise omits the brass section from the title track and features a faster tempo.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=178[/tpl] MacDonald notes the Beatles' apparent excitement, which is tangibly translated during the recording.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248[/tpl]
[tpl]listen|filename=The "Dream Sequence" from "A Day in the Life" by the Beatles 1967.ogg|title= The "dream sequence" from "A Day in the Life"|description= In addition to being treated with heavy tape echo, Lennon's vocalisations during the sequence are slowly panned right to left and back again before ending in the left field.[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|pp=227–228[/tpl][/tpl]
As the last chord of the "Sgt. Pepper" reprise plays an acoustic guitar strumming offbeat quavers begins, introducing what Moore describes as "one of the most harrowing songs ever written."[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=52[/tpl] "A Day in the Life" consists of four verses by Lennon, a bridge, two aleatoric orchestral crescendos and an interpolated middle part written and sung by McCartney. The first crescendo serves as a segue between the third verse and the middle part, leading to a bridge known as the "dream sequence", which features Lennon's vocalisations.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=52[/tpl] The accompanying brass section loudly indicates the end of the sequence and the start of the fourth and final verse, after which the song enters the last crescendo before finishing with a piano chord that is allowed to fade-out for nearly a minute.[tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=54[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Riley|1988|p=228[/tpl]: an aggressive brass section. The idea to use an orchestra was McCartney's; he drew inspiration from the avant-garde composers John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen.[tpl]sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=56[/tpl] The 24-bar crescendos feature forty musicians selected from the London and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras and tasked with filling the space with what Womack describes as "the sound of pure apocalypse."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=179[/tpl] Martin notes Lennon's request for "a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world."[tpl]sfn|Martin|1994|p=209[/tpl] Lennon recalled drawing inspiration for the lyrics from a newspaper: "I was writing the song with the Daily Mail propped up in front of me at the piano ... there was a paragraph about 4000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire".[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|p=275[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|The "lucky man who made the grade" was inspired by – but not directly based on – the recent accidental automobile death of Beatles friend and Guinness heir Tara Brown. Lennon noted he "didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse."[tpl]sfn|Davies|2009|p=276[/tpl] According to Martin the line: "he blew his mind out in a car" is a drug reference.[tpl]sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=50[/tpl][/tpl] He strongly disliked the sound of his own voice and often asked for generous amounts of tape echo to be added to his vocal in an effort to bury it deep in the mix. For "A Day in the Life", he wanted his voice to sound like Elvis Presley on "Heartbreak Hotel". Martin and Emerick obliged by adding 90 milliseconds of echo.[tpl]sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|pp=52–53[/tpl] In Womack's opinion, Starr delivers "one of his most inventive drum parts on record", a part that McCartney encouraged him to attempt despite his protests against "flashy drumming".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=179[/tpl] The thunderous piano chord that concludes the track and the album was produced by recording three pianos simultaneously sounding an E major chord; Martin then augmented the sound with a harmonium. On cue, Lennon, Starr, McCartney and Evans simultaneously hammered the keys and sustained the chord, which faded-out for 53 seconds.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=180[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Recordings of "A Day in the Life" began on 19 January 1967 with Lennon counting-in the first take by mumbling, "sugar plum fairy, sugar plum fairy".[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=179[/tpl] McCartney's lead vocal in the middle of the track was recorded the next day and the orchestral overdub session occurred on 10 February.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=94, 96-97[/tpl] Martin recorded five tracks of the orchestral musicians and layered them into a composite track.[tpl]sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=59[/tpl] The final piano chord was recorded twelve days later.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=94, 96-97[/tpl][/tpl] MacDonald describes the track as "a song not of disillusionment with life itself, but of disenchantment with the limits of mundane perception".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=229[/tpl] According to him, it "remains among the most penetrating and innovative artistic reflections of its era", representing the Beatles' "finest single achievement".[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=228[/tpl]: "finest single achievement"; [tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=232[/tpl]: "among the most penetrating and innovative artistic reflections".
As "A Day in the Life" ends a 15-kilohertz high-frequency tone is heard; it was added at Lennon's suggestion with the intention that it would annoy dogs.[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=182[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Lennon was unaware that most record players and speakers of the time were incapable of reproducing the tone, which many listeners would not hear until the release of the CD version in 1987.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=188[/tpl][/tpl] This is followed by the sounds of backwards laughter and random gibberish that was pressed into the record's concentric run-out groove, which loops back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic needle return. Lennon can be heard saying: "been so high", followed by McCartney's response: "never could be any other way".[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=122[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|When the audio contained in the run-out groove is played in reverse and slowed-down, McCartney can be heard shouting: "I will fuck you like Superman", with Starr and Harrison giggling in the background.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008c|p=164[/tpl][/tpl] When the album was re-pressed for LP release in 2012, it took several attempts to successfully reproduce the run-out groove effect.[tpl]cite web|last=Knopper |first=Steve |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-beatles-vinyl-album-remasters-20121112 |title=Inside the Beatles' Vinyl Album Remasters |work=Rolling Stone |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl]

According to Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould, the heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends, while their clothing "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions".[tpl]harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=236[/tpl]: The growing influence of hippie style on the Beatles; [tpl]harvnb|Gould|2007|p=385[/tpl]: "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions". The centre of the cover depicts the Beatles standing behind a drum skin, on which the fairground artist Joe Ephgrave painted the words of the album's title. In front of the drum skin is a series of flowers that spell out "Beatles".[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=95[/tpl] The group were dressed in satin day-glo-coloured military-style uniforms that were manufactured by the theatrical costumer M.

The 30 March 1967 photo session with Cooper also produced the back cover and the inside gatefold, which according to the musicologist Ian Inglis conveys "an obvious and immediate warmth ... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images."[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=95[/tpl] McCartney explained: "One of the things we were very much into in those days was eye messages ... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, if you look at it you'll see the big effort from the eyes."[tpl]sfn|Miles|1997|pp=344–345[/tpl] The album's inner sleeve featured a design by the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white.[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=95[/tpl] Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on the statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms.[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=96[/tpl] Moore suggested that the inclusion of these items helped fans "pretend to be in the band."[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=57[/tpl]
The collage includes 57 photographs and 9 waxworks that depict a diversity of famous people, including writers, musicians, actors and – at Harrison's request – the Self-Realization Fellowship gurus Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar and Paramahansa Yogananda.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|2008|p=93[/tpl]: 57 photographs and 9 waxworks; [tpl]harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=81[/tpl]: the Self-Realization Fellowship gurus. According to Inglis, the "tableau acted as a guidebook to the cultural topography of the decade", demonstrating the increasing democratization of society whereby "traditional barriers between 'high' and 'low' culture were being eroded."[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=93[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Inglis is paraphrasing George Melly, who in 1970 described the Sgt.

==Release==

After having finished Sgt. Pepper, but prior to its commercial release, the Beatles brought an acetate disc to the American singer Cass Elliot's flat off King's Road in Chelsea, where at six in the morning they played the album at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. Beatles' press agent Derek Taylor remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be an unreleased Beatles album.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=249[/tpl] The LP was released on 1 June 1967 in the United Kingdom and on 2 June in the United States.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350, 351[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Sgt.

Epstein owned the Saville at the time and both Harrison and McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: "The curtains flew back and Hendrix came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career."[tpl]cite book|last=McDermott|first=John|title=Ultimate Hendrix: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Live Concerts and Sessions|year=2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0-87930-938-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o6ty_6SqPE4C&dq|page=52[/tpl] Rolling Stone magazine's Langdon Winner recalls:
[tpl]Quote|"The closest Western Civilization has come to unity since the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was the week the Sgt. Pepper album was released.

For a brief while the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young."[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=205[/tpl][/tpl]
In the opinion of the musicologist Tim Riley, Sgt. Pepper "drew people together through the common experience of pop on a larger scale than ever before."[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|pp=205–206[/tpl] American radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling, playing the album virtually non-stop – often from start to finish.[tpl]harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=249[/tpl]: radio stations interrupted their regular scheduling; [tpl]harvnb|Riley|1988|p=205[/tpl]: some played the album from start to finish.

==Reception==

Most contemporary reviews were positive, with Sgt.

The Times[tpl]'[/tpl] Kenneth Tynan described it as "a decisive moment in the history of Western civilisation".[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=249[/tpl] Richard Poirier wrote: "listening to the Sgt.

Time magazine declared it "a historic departure in the progress of music – any music".[tpl]sfn|Spitz|2005|p=697[/tpl] Newsweek[tpl]'s[/tpl] Jack Kroll called it a "masterpiece", comparing the lyrics with literary works by Edith Sitwell, Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot, particularly "A Day in the Life", which he compared to Eliot's The Waste Land.[tpl]harvnb|Gould|2007|p=420[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Julien|2008b|p=9[/tpl] The New York Times Book Review characterised Sgt. Pepper as a harbinger of "a new and golden Renaissance of Song" and the New Statesman[tpl]'s[/tpl] Wilfrid Mellers praised its elevation of pop music to the level of fine art.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=9[/tpl]
One of the best-known American critics at the time, Richard Goldstein, wrote a scathing contemporary review in The New York Times that described Sgt. Pepper as "spoiled" and "reeking" of "special effects, dazzling but ultimately fraudulent".[tpl]harvnb|Christgau|2006|p=116[/tpl]: one of the best-known American critics at the time; [tpl]harvnb|Goldstein|2006|pp=97–101[/tpl]: "spoiled" and "reeking". According to the music journalist Robert Christgau, the Times was subsequently "deluged with letters, many abusive and every last one in disagreement", a backlash he credits as "the largest response to a music review" in the newspaper's history.[tpl]sfn|Christgau|2006|p=117[/tpl] Goldstein published a defense of his review in which he explained that, although the album was not on-par with the best of the Beatles' previous work, he considered it "better than 80 per cent of the music around", but felt that underneath the production when "the compositions are stripped to their musical and lyrical essentials" the LP is shown to be "an elaboration without improvement" on the group's music.[tpl]cite web | url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/03/clip_job_richar.php | first = Richard | last = Goldstein |title = I Blew My Cool Through The New York Times |work=Village Voice |date=20 July 1967 |accessdate=28 April 2014[/tpl] In Christgau's 1967 column for Esquire magazine, he described Sgt. Pepper as "a consolidation, more intricate than Revolver but not more substantial", suggesting that Goldstein had fallen "victim to overanticipation", identifying his primary error as "allowing all the filters and reverbs and orchestral effects and overdubs to deafen him to the stuff underneath, which was pretty nice".[tpl]sfn|Christgau|2006|p=116[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Moore asserts that Goldstein's position was an exception among a group of primarily positive contemporary reviewers that he characterises as the most for any single album at the time. He also notes that some negative letters had been sent to Melody Maker that he speculates were written by jazz enthusiasts.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|pp=57–58[/tpl][/tpl]
At the 10th Annual Grammy Awards in 1968, Sgt. Pepper won in the categories of Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts, Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical and Best Contemporary Album.

==Legacy==

Sgt. Pepper continued the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' albums Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966), aiding the development of progressive rock through its focus on self-conscious lyrics, studio experimentation, and its efforts to expand the barriers of conventional three-minute tracks.[tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|pp=18, 70–79[/tpl]; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|2002|pp=64[/tpl]: The origins of progressive rock are "marked by the release of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967"; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|2002|pp=69[/tpl]: "The beginnings of progressive rock are normally traced to the Beatles' Sgt.

While gathering material for his 1979 anthology, Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island, the editor Greil Marcus polled the twenty rock critic contributors regarding their choice for the best rock album of all time, and while Rubber Soul was mentioned Sgt. Pepper was not.[tpl]sfn|Marcus|2007|p=xxi[/tpl] He asserts that by 1968 the album appeared vacuous against the emotional backdrop of the political and social upheavals of American life, describing it as "a triumph of effects", but "a Day-Glo tombstone for its time".[tpl]harvnb|Marcus|2007|p=258[/tpl]: "a Day-Glo tombstone for its time"; [tpl]harvnb|Moore|1997|p=60[/tpl]: "a triumph of effects". He characterises the LP as "playful but contrived" and "less a summing up of its era than a concession to it".[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=205[/tpl] In his opinion, the album "strangled on its own conceits" while being "vindicated by world-wide acclaim".[tpl]sfn|Marcus|2007|p=248[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Riley, Rubber Soul and Revolver are "miracles of intuition" that are "greater than the sum of their parts" while in comparison "Sgt.

Pepper as "a flawed masterpiece that can only echo the strength of Revolver.[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=203[/tpl][/tpl] In 1981 Christgau stated that although few critics agreed with Goldstein at the time of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=59[/tpl] In the opinion of Lester Bangs – the so-called "godfather" of punk rock journalism, also writing in 1981 – "Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review ... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll."[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|The central theme of Goldstein's 1967 critique of Sgt. Pepper involves his complaints about substance overwhelming style, or in his words: "tone overtakes meaning".[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130[/tpl] He places much of the blame for this on the album's copious use of production effects such as echo and reverb, which he characterises as "posturing and put-on".[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130[/tpl] He also criticises the album's lack of lyrical substance, stating: "even from fantasy, I expect authenticity".[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130[/tpl][/tpl] He notes: "In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts."[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|Kimsey asserts that with Sgt. Pepper, "rock began to be called most emphatically an art form."[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl][/tpl] The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce Sgt. Pepper in that respect, accusing the album of "marking a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness."[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Bangs, punk rock "is rock in its most basic, primitive form", a stylistic approach that is decidedly unselfconscious.[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl] In Riley's opinion, Sgt. Pepper "has a degree of self-consciousness throughout that primitive rock and roll snubs in favor of urgency and raw energy."[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=203[/tpl] In late 1967 Down Beat magazine published an unfavourable review written by John Gabree, in which he questions where the proper credit for Sgt. Pepper should lie based on his having heard that "A Day in the Life" consisted of two songs that had been spliced together by Martin. Kimsey cites this as an example of detractors conflating ethical concerns with issues of aesthetics while casting doubt on the musical authenticity of the work.[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|pp=124–125[/tpl][/tpl] In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a "break with all that's good, true and rocking".[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Kimsey, rock purists like Bangs – whom he characterises as a "punk ideologue" – approach the problem of authenticity with the presupposition that true rock music is inherently "uncorrupted by skill or self-consciousness".[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl] He compares Bangs' conception of the "attitude-driven everyman" with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's noble savage, suggesting that Bangs' disdain for Sgt. Pepper is informed by a Romanticised rejection of Modernism.[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl] According to Kimsey, "In this sense, Pepper can be said to have called forth, in dialectical fashion, the discourse of punk."[tpl]sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135[/tpl][/tpl] According to Christgau: "Although Sgt. Pepper is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian – precise, controlled, even stiff – and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream".[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/rocktheater.php|title=Rock Theater|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] In Moore's opinion, "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked to do too much."[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=64[/tpl]

In 2003 it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, preserving the album as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[tpl]cite web| publisher=Library of Congress| year=2003| title=The National Recording Registry 2003| url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2003reg.html| accessdate=19 November 2007[/tpl] In 2005 Rolling Stone placed it at number one in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, describing it as "the pinnacle of the Beatles' eight years as recording artists".[tpl]sfn|Levy|2005|p=9[/tpl] In 2006 it was chosen by Time as one of the 100 best albums of all time.[tpl]cite news|work=Time|year=2007|title=The All-Time 100 Albums|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/index.html|accessdate=20 November 2007[/tpl] That same year the music scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as "the most important and influential rock and roll album ever recorded".[tpl]sfn|Kastan|2006|p=139[/tpl]

===Recording and cover===

In MacFarlane's opinion, Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] most important musical innovation is its "integration of recording technology into the compositional process."[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=39[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Julien, the Beatles' "gradual integration of arranging and recording into one and the same process" began as early as 1963, but developed in earnest during the sessions for Rubber Soul and Revolver and "ultimately blossomed" during the Sgt. Pepper sessions.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008c|p=162[/tpl][/tpl] He credits Edgard Varèse's Poème électronique as the piece of music that made this advance feasible, by "expanding the definition of sound recording from archival documentation to the reification of the musical canvass"; MacFarlane identifies "A Day in the Life" as the Sgt. Pepper track that best exemplifies this approach.[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=39–40[/tpl] According to Julien, the album represents the "epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition."[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008c|pp=166–167[/tpl] The musician and producer Alan Parsons asserts that with Sgt. Pepper "people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance."[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167[/tpl] Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] lasting commercial success and critical impact is due in large part to Martin and his engineer's creative use of studio equipment while originating new processes. Although early analog synthesizers were available at the time, none were used during the album's recording, which relied solely on electric and acoustic instruments and field recordings that were available at Abbey Road Studios.[tpl]sfn|Hannan|2008|p=46[/tpl] Artistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, is one of the album's defining features.[tpl]sfn|Julien|2008b|p=7[/tpl] In the opinion of the Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, Sgt. Pepper represents the group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that would begin to fall away immediately following the album's completion and that completely disappeared by the release of The Beatles in 1968.[tpl]sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=237[/tpl] Emerick notes the minimal involvement of Harrison and Starr, viewing Sgt. Pepper as a work of Lennon and McCartney that was less a group effort than any of their previous releases.[tpl]sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=141[/tpl]
According to Inglis, almost every account of the significance of Sgt. Pepper emphasizes the cover's "unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space".[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101[/tpl] With its release, album sleeves were no longer "a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience."[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101[/tpl] The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the "structures and cultures of popular music" could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that – before Sgt. Pepper – would have seemed like "fanciful conceit".[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Riley, Sgt. Pepper "was the record that made rock criticism worthy of its subject."[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=203[/tpl][/tpl] He writes: Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] "cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit."[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102[/tpl] In the late 1990s the BBC included the cover in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design.[tpl]sfn|Inglis|2008|p=96[/tpl] In July 2008 the iconic bass drum skin used on the front cover sold at auction for €670,000 (US$879,000).[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0711/beatles.html |title=Fab four times price for Beatles drumskin|date=11 July 2008|work=RTÉ news|publisher=RTÉ Commercial Enterprises Limited|accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|On 30 March 2013 a copy of the album that was signed by all four Beatles was sold at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions to an unnamed buyer from the Midwestern United States for a record $290,500.[tpl]cite web|last=Couch|first=Aaron|title=Signed copy of Beatles' 'Sgt.

===Concept revisited===

According to Womack, with Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] first song "the Beatles manufacture an artificial textual space in which to stage their art."[tpl]sfn|Womack|2007|p=170[/tpl] The reprise of the title song appears on side two, just prior to the climactic "A Day in the Life", creating a framing device.[tpl]sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248[/tpl] In Starr's opinion, only the first two songs and the reprise are conceptually connected.[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=99[/tpl] Lennon agreed and in 1980 he commented: "Sgt. Pepper is called the first concept album, but it doesn't go anywhere ... it works because we said it worked."[tpl]sfn|Sheff|1981|p=197[/tpl] He was especially adamant that his contributions to the LP had nothing to do with the Sgt. Pepper concept. Further, he suggested that indeed most of the other songs were equally unconnected, stating: "Except for Sgt. Pepper introducing Billy Shears and the so-called reprise, every other song could have been on any other album".[tpl]sfn|Sheff|1981|p=197[/tpl] Martin became worried upon the album's completion that its lack of musical unity might draw criticism and accusations of pretentiousness.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=64[/tpl]
MacFarlane notes that – despite these concerns – Sgt. Pepper "is widely regarded as the first true concept album in popular music."[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=33[/tpl] In his opinion, the Beatles "chose to employ an overarching thematic concept in an apparent effort to unify individual tracks."[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=33[/tpl] According to Everett, the album's "musical unity results ... from motivic relationships between key areas, particularly involving C, E, and G."[tpl]sfn|Everett|1999|p=122[/tpl] Moore argues that the recording's "use of common harmonic patterns and falling melodies" contributes to its overall cohesiveness, which he describes as narrative unity, but not necessarily conceptual unity.[tpl]sfn|Moore|2008|p=144[/tpl] MacFarlane agrees, suggesting that with the exception of the reprise the album lacks the melodic and harmonic continuity that is consistent with cyclic form.[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=33, 37[/tpl] In a May 1967 review published by The Times, the music critic William Mann made a similar observation, indicating a thematic connection between the title track, its reprise and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!", while suggesting that – aside from those songs – the album's "unity is slightly specious".[tpl]sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=37[/tpl] In 1972 the musicologist Richard Middleton suggested that the album was "undercoded", in that listeners could grasp only a general understanding of the material that, in his opinion, was not particularly meaningful.[tpl]sfn|Moore|1997|p=65[/tpl] Nonetheless, the author Martina Elicker asserts that Sgt. Pepper[tpl]'s[/tpl] release familiarised critics and fans alike with the notion of a "concept and unified structure underlying a pop album", thus originating the term concept album.[tpl]sfn|Elicker|2001|p=231[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=nb|According to Riley, "Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention's Freak Out has claims as the first 'concept album', but Sgt. Pepper was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears."[tpl]sfn|Riley|1988|p=11[/tpl][/tpl]
