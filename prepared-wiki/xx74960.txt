==Appointment as chief justice==

On 17 May 1999, Elias was sworn in as Chief Justice of New Zealand, the first woman to hold that position in New Zealand.

==Appointment as Administrator of the Government==

One aspect of the role of Chief Justice is the role of Administrator of the Government when the Governor-General is unable to fulfil their duties (due to illness or absence from New Zealand or some other cause).Sect 12 (SR 1983/225) Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand Elias has held the position of Administrator of the Government from 22 March 2001 until 4 April 2001, between the terms of Sir Michael Hardie Boys and Dame Silvia Cartwright, from 4 August 2006 until 23 August 2006 between Cartwright's term and that of Sir Anand Satyanand, from 23 August 2011 until 31 August 2011 between the terms of Satyanand and Sir Jerry Mateparae, and at other times when the Governor-General has been unable to act.

==Support for Maori Treaty claims==

In 1984, Elias helped Nganeko Minhinnick's Manukau Harbour claim to the Waitangi Tribunal. This led to work on other treaty cases, including a claim to prevent the Government selling radio frequencies, and the case challenging the 1994 Maori electoral option. This work gave her an appreciation of Maori custom and aspirations that she still fosters among the judiciary and in her private life. In June 2003 she was involved in a landmark case which allowed for the possibility that the Maori Land Court could issue freehold title over the foreshore and seabed.  The subsequent legal uncertainties and upheavals in Maoridom dominated the political agenda for the next 18 months.Elias - top judge and judicial activist, NZ Herald 28 March 2005

==The Blameless Babes speech==

In July 2009 Elias caused controversy with her remarks in the annual Shirley Smith address, organised by the Wellington Branch of the New Zealand Law Society's Women-in-Law committee. The annual lecture is given in honour of noted criminal defence lawyer, Shirley Smith. The speech was entitled "Blameless Babes" after a quote from Smith, who wrote "providing a prison at the bottom of the cliff is not a solution. Criminals will just go on falling into it, at great cost to the community. We have to find out why blameless babes become criminals."Shirley Smith "Kneejerk reaction" The Dominion (17 November 1999, ed 2, 12).
In her speech, Elias expressed concern about prison overcrowding and argued against what she described as the "punitive and knee-jerk" attitude of politicians towards the criminal justice system.[tpl]cite news|url=http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/Chief%20Justice%27s%20jails%20speech.pdf|title=Blameless Babes—2009 Shirley Smith Address|author=Dame Sian Elias|date=9 July 2009|work=The New Zealand Herald[/tpl] She said prison overcrowding had to be managed to prevent "significant safety and human rights issues". She also said several other changes were needed in the criminal justice system including increased education and understanding by the community that, since "criminal justice processes are largely irrelevant to crime reduction", we need to address the causes not just the effects of crime.Editorial: Judge is entitled to a hearing, NZ Herald 19 July 2009 She said New Zealand needed greater focus on early intervention for youth and vulnerable families, improved mental health and drug and alcohol treatment, greater use of community-based sentences, and a fundamental rethink in the way the probation service monitors offenders.Tapu Misa: More prisoners doesn't equal less crime, 20 July 2009
As a final point, Elias said that unless New Zealand takes action to address the underlying causes of crime, Government may be forced into the position of using executive amnesties to reduce the growing number of prisoners. The chief justice's comments were widely reported in the media and led to a public rebuke from Simon Power, the Minister of Justice, who said: "The Chief Justice's speech does not represent Government policy in any way, shape or form".Irate Power tells Chief Justice to butt out of policy, NZ Herald 17 July 2009
