The Mid-American Conference (MAC) is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I collegiate athletic conference with a membership base in the Great Lakes region that stretches from Western New York to Illinois.  Nine of the twelve full member schools are in Ohio and Michigan, with single members located in Illinois, Indiana and New York.  For football, the MAC participates in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision, with an affiliate member in Massachusetts.
The MAC is headquartered in the Public Square district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, and has two members in the nearby Akron area.  The MAC has been referred to as the "Conference of Quarterbacks" because of the accomplishments of numerous former players in the National Football League.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/bowl_preview_2007_international.html |title=International Bowl 2008 |year=2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Mid-American Conference riding Steelers' wave of MAC stars into high-school recruiting battle |url=http://www.cleveland.com/sports/college/index.ssf/2009/02/midamerican_conference_riding.html |author=Alexander, Elton |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2012[/tpl]  The conference also ranks highest among all eleven NCAA Division I FBS conferences for graduation rates.[tpl]cite press release |title=MAC Football Programs Lead I-A Public Institutions In Graduation Success Rates |url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/092806ach.html |publisher=MAC-Sports.com |date=September 8, 2006 |accessdate=September 25, 2009[/tpl]

==History==

The five charter members of the Mid-American Conference were Ohio University, Butler University, the University of Cincinnati, Wayne University (now Wayne State University), and Western Reserve University, one of the predecessors to today's Case Western Reserve University. Wayne University left after the first year. Miami University and Western Michigan University took the place of those charter members for the 1948 season. The MAC added the University of Toledo (1950), Kent State University (1951), and Bowling Green State University (1952).  The University of Cincinnati resigned its membership February 18, 1953, with an effective date of June 1, 1953.  Cincinnati's decision was based on a new requirement that at least 5 conference football games would have to be scheduled each season, University President Raymond Walters saying they "...regretfully resign...as the university could not continue under the present setup..." The Lima News, February 19, 1953
The membership was steady for the next two decades except for the addition of Marshall University in 1954 and the departure of Western Reserve in 1955.[tpl]cite web |title=Volume high, but conference movement itself not unprecedented |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2003/Division+I/volume%2Bhigh,%2Bbut%2Bconference%2Bmovement%2Bitself%2Bnot%2Bunprecedented%2B-%2B12-8-03.html |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=December 15, 2012[/tpl]  Marshall was expelled from the conference in 1969 due to NCAA violations.[tpl]cite web|last=Wilson|first=Tracy|title=The Real Story Behind We Are Marshall|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/we-are-marshall2.htm|accessdate=November 8, 2011[/tpl]  The first major expansion since the 1950s took place in the mid-1970s with the addition of Central Michigan University and Eastern Michigan University in 1972 and Ball State University and Northern Illinois University in 1973.  NIU left after the 1985–86 season.  The University of Akron joined the conference in 1992. The conference became the largest in Division I-A with the re-admittance of Marshall and NIU and addition of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Bulls in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The University of Central Florida joined for football only in 2002, becoming the first football-only member in conference history. Marshall (a second time) and Central Florida (a non-football all-sports member in the Atlantic Sun Conference at the time) would leave after the 2004–05 academic year, both joining Conference USA in all sports.

====Current affiliate members====

Nine schools have MAC affiliate membership status. On July 1, 2012, Temple joined the Big East Conference for football only (the school's other sports would join the Big East/American for 2013–14), and Massachusetts replaced Temple as a football-only member in the MAC East Division. On September 19, 2012, the MAC announced Missouri, Northern Iowa and Old Dominion would join as wrestling affiliates; as the Southeastern and Missouri Valley Conferences do not sponsor wrestling. Missouri and Northern Iowa participated only in the conference tournament in the 2012–13 school year, and began full conference play in 2013–14. Old Dominion did not begin MAC competition until 2013–14, when it left the Colonial Athletic Association (which had sponsored wrestling, but no longer does so) for Conference USA (which has never sponsored the sport).[tpl]cite press release| url=http://www.mac-sports.com/News/tabid/969/Article/163766/MAC-Adds-Three-Affiliate-Members-In-Wrestling.aspx |title=MAC Adds Three Affiliate Members In Wrestling |publisher=Mid-American Conference |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2012[/tpl]

====Future affiliate member====

===Former members===

Nicknames listed here reflect those used during each school's MAC tenure. Two schools have changed their nicknames since leaving the MAC—Central Florida dropped "Golden" from its nickname, becoming simply Knights, while Wayne State now uses Warriors. Western Reserve merged with Case Institute of Technology in 1967 to form today's Case Western Reserve University, with the athletic programs merging in 1971. With the athletic merger, Case Western abandoned the nicknames of both former institutions and adopted Spartans.
