The Reichenbach Falls ([tpl]lang-de|Reichenbachfall[/tpl]) are a series of waterfalls on the Reichenbach stream in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. They have a total drop of [tpl]convert|250|m|ft|lk=on[/tpl]. At [tpl]convert|90|m|ft|lk=on[/tpl], the Upper Reichenbach Falls is one of the highest cataracts in the Alps. Today, a hydro-electric power company harnesses the flow of the Reichenbach Falls during certain times of year, reducing its flow.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.reichenbachfall.ch/images/stories/dokumente/Englisch.pdf | title = Cable railway to the Reichenbach Falls near Meiringen | publisher = Reichenbachfall-Bahn | accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.european-traveler.com/switzerland/visit-the-reichenbach-waterfalls-near-meiringen-in-switzerland/ | title = Visit the Reichenbach Waterfalls near Meiringen in Switzerland | publisher = European Traveller | accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://trawellguide.com/travel-guide-destination.php?id=2681&title=Reichenbach_Falls |title=article Reichenbach Falls for general information |publisher=Trawellguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02[/tpl]
In popular literature, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave the falls as the location of the final confrontation of his hero Sherlock Holmes with the criminal Professor Moriarty in "The Final Problem".

==Location==

The falls are located in the lower part of the Reichenbachtal valley, on the Reichenbach stream, a tributary of the Aar river. They are some [tpl]convert|2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the town of Meiringen, and [tpl]convert|25|km|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Interlaken. Politically, the falls are within the municipality of Schattenhalb in the canton of Bern.[tpl]cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?selectedNode=node_ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-kanton-flaeche.fill1&Y=657491&X=174548&zoom=7&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill&layers_opacity=1&layers_visibility=true&lang=en | accessdate = 2013-01-05[/tpl] 
The falls are made accessible by the Reichenbachfall funicular. The lower station is some 20 minutes walk, or a 6 minute bus ride, from Meiringen station on the Brünig railway line that links Interlaken and Lucerne.

===Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories===

The town and the falls are known worldwide as the setting for a fictional event: it is the location where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's hero, Sherlock Holmes, fights to the death  with Professor Moriarty, at the end of "The Final Problem", first published in 1893. A memorial plate at the funicular station commemorates Holmes and there is also a Sherlock Holmes museum in the nearby town of Meiringen.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8939098/Peter-Lunn.html |title=Peter Lunn |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 6 December 2011|accessdate=2011-12-15 |location=London[/tpl] 
Out of many waterfalls in the Bernese Oberland, the Reichenbach Falls seems to have made the greatest impression on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was shown them on a Swiss holiday by his host Sir Henry Lunn, the founder of Lunn Poly. Sir Henry's grandson, Peter Lunn, recalled, "My grandfather said 'Push him over the Reichenbach Falls' and Conan Doyle hadn’t heard of them, so he showed them to him." So impressed was Doyle that he decided to let his hero die there.
The actual ledge from which Moriarty and Holmes apparently fell is on the other side of the falls from the funicular; it is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque as illustrated here; the English inscription reads: "At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891."  The pathway on which the duel between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty occurs ends some hundred metres away from the falls. When Doyle viewed the falls, the path ended very close to the falls, close enough to touch it, yet over the hundred years after his visit, the pathway has become unsafe and slowly eroded away, and the falls have receded farther back into the gorge.
