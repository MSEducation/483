The Electric Horseman is a 1979 adventure-romance film starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda and directed by Sydney Pollack. The film is about a former rodeo champion who is hired by a cereal company to become its spokesperson, and then runs away on a $12 million electric-lit horse and costume he is given to promote it in Las Vegas.

==Plot==

Norman "Sonny" Steele is a former championship rodeo rider who has sold out to a business conglomerate and is now reduced to making public appearances to sell a brand of breakfast cereal. Prior to making a Las Vegas promotional appearance to ride the $12 million champion thoroughbred race horse who responds to the name of Rising Star, Sonny discovers to his horror that the horse has been drugged and is injured.
Identifying with the plight of the horse and disillusioned with the present state of his life, Sonny decides to abscond with Rising Star and travel cross-country in order to release him in a remote canyon where herds of wild horses roam. Hallie Martin, a television reporter eager to be the first to break the Rising Star story, locates Sonny and follows him on his unusual quest through the countryside. While en route, the unlikely pair have a romance as they avoid the pursuing authorities.

===Development===

Casting for The Electric Horseman either continued or led to many reoccurring collaborations between cast and crew members. On November 28, 1978, Robert Redford was announced to star in the film,[tpl]cite news|title=Redford joins cast|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eBwvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jdsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5166,6338596&dq=electric+horseman+sydney+pollack+filming&hl=en|accessdate=October 25, 2013|newspaper=The Beaver County Times|date=November 26, 1978|agency=United Press International|page=16[/tpl] becoming the fifth film in which Sydney Pollack directed Redford following This Property Is Condemned (1966), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Way We Were (1973) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). This director-actor relationship would continue with two more films: Out of Africa (1985) and Havana (1990). Pollack had also previously directed Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), whereas Redford and Fonda previously teamed on The Chase (1966) and Barefoot in the Park (1967).
The Electric Horseman is noted as being the debut acting performance of long-time country and western singer Willie Nelson, who plays the role of Wendell Hickson. According to Pollack, Nelson improvised most of his dialogue in the film. Pollack would later be executive producer for Nelson's 1980 starring vehicle Honeysuckle Rose. The film was also only the second film performance of character actor Wilford Brimley, who would later team with Redford in The Natural (1984).

[tpl]quote box|quote="For Electric Horseman, I literally ended up writing half of every night before we would shoot. We make jokes now about my saying, 'Let's pick the longest location cause I have time to write the scene by the time we get there.' And that's literally true. There were yellow pads all over the place; we're writing out to work in the morning."|source=—Sydney Pollack, describing script troubles.[tpl]cite AV media|people=Gallagher, John (Interviewer)|title=The Director's Series|medium=Videotape|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq9pDnls2GY|accessdate=October 25, 2013|time=0:11|publisher=TVDays.com|location=New York City[/tpl]|width=35%|align=right[/tpl]
Principal photography for The Electric Horseman took place during late 1978 and early 1979 throughout Nevada and Utah.

While filming generally went smoothly, Pollack struggled with revising the script while filming was underway. In addition, there was one particular day in which production was continuously delayed due to traveling thunderstorms that interrupted the 20-second kissing scene between Redford and Fonda. Ultimately, the scene ended up requiring 48 takes that pushed costs to $280,000.[tpl]cite book|last=Schoell|first=William|title=The Sundance Kid: A Biography of Robert Redford|year=2006|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=1589792971|page=133|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qpK4uqEWTzQC&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=The+Electric+Horseman+48+takes&source=bl&ots=Qeb25RpZzY&sig=y84CJkk2LyORU0PxilL8Y2wtieE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o6JqUp60N82tkAeh94CwAQ&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Electric%20Horseman%2048%20takes&f=false|coauthors=Lawrence J.
