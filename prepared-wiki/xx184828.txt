==Career==

Bellinati's active international career has taken him to Europe, Asia, and the Americas.  Besides performing solo concerts and giving masterclasses in many international guitar festivals, he tours with American bassist Steve Swallow, Brazilian singer Mónica Salmaso, Brazilian flutist Antonio Carrasqueira, and many top European musicians.  In 1994, he won the Prémio Sharp, Brazil's equivalent of a Grammy, for arranging the selections on Gal Costa's CD 'O Sorriso do Gato de Alice'.
In addition to being a performer and arranger, Bellinati is also a respected musical scholar.  He rediscovered, transcribed, and recorded the music of the great Brazilian guitarist-composer Anibal Augusto Sardinha (Garoto).  His landmark recording, 'The Guitar Works of Garoto', and two-volume edition of Garoto's works have received international critical acclaim and recognition for their significance.
