===Insider trading, fraud===

On March 15, 2005, Nacchio and six other former Qwest executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They were accused of a "massive" $3 billion financial fraud between 1999 and 2002 and of benefiting from an inflated stock price.
In its case, the government stated that Nacchio continued to tell Wall Street that Qwest would be able to achieve aggressive revenue targets long after he knew that they could not be achieved. This helped it buy up regional phone rival US West, the government alleges For his part, Nacchio maintained that he believed Qwest would soon be receiving several large government contracts. On November 21, 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nacchio "believed Qwest was doing well because it was getting lucrative secret national-security-related work from the federal government." Nacchio claimed that he was not in a rightful state of mind when he sold his shares because of problems with his son, and the imminent announcement of a number of government contracts.
Nacchio was indicted on December 20, 2005 on insider trading charges in Denver, Colorado. He was forced to surrender his passport for fear that he would flee the country. The indictment against Nacchio charged him with 42 counts of insider trading. Each count carries a potential 10-year jail term and corresponds to a sale of Qwest shares, including a flurry in April–May 2001, when Nacchio sold almost $39 million in stock. At the time, Qwest was trading between $41.12 and $38.31.
Nacchio was convicted on 19 of 42 counts of insider trading case on April 19, 2007.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6574633.stm | work=BBC News | title=Former Qwest boss guilty of fraud | date=April 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl] He was released on a $2 million bond. On July 27, 2007, Nacchio was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Federal Judge Edward Nottingham also ordered Nacchio to pay a $19 million fine and forfeit $52 million he gained in illegal stock sales. On March 17, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit overturned his conviction on the basis of defense expert witness testimony that was improperly excluded, and ordered a new trial before a different trial judge.
Herbert J. Stern led Nacchio’s defense team during the initial trial,
while Maureen Mahoney was lead defense attorney during the appeal.
On February 25, 2009, the full Tenth Circuit reversed the three-judge panel and reinstated the conviction and sentence.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/business/26qwest.html | work=The New York Times | title=Appeals Court Restores Qwest Insider Trading Conviction | date=February 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl]Qwest ex-CEO Nacchio loses appeal - denverpost.com
