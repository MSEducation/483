After the war the senator was active in the investigation of German and Bolshevik propaganda and played a role in bringing on the first Red-Scare that plagued American politics in 1919 and 1920. He was always focused on what was going on inside of the country and how to make peoples lives worry free, meaning that he did not want mass chaos to go on in the United States.This was after the first World War when many innocent men and women were being called in and taken away from their jobs and lives and brought in for questioning and even jailed at some points.

He wanted to keep the red-scare contained so people would not catch wind of it and live in fear. He wrote and sponsored the Overman Act of 1918, which gave President Woodrow Wilson extraordinary powers to coordinate government agencies in wartime. Overman chaired a Senate committee after World War I to investigate activities during the first Red Scare, which many see as a precursor to the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In 1922, Overman was one of the leaders of a 1 hour, 45 minute filibuster that helped defeat the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. In his lengthy speech, he said that the bill was a partisan attempt to solidify the Republican hold on the northern black vote, that the bill had been written by a black person, and that ignorant black people in the South would interpret the bill as permission to "commit the foulest of outrages.""Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bill", New York Times, December 3, 1922
