Thomas Terrell Brandon (born May 20, 1970) is a retired American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Terrell was known throughout his 11-year career for his passing ability, mid-range jump shot and stealing ability.

==Early life==

Brandon was born in Portland, Oregon, United States and attended Grant High School, where he led his team to the 1988 Class AAA Oregon high-school basketball championship,[tpl]cite web | last = Jaquiss | first = Nigel | title = The Education of Brandon Brooks|url =http://wweek.com/html/cover030498.html | work = Willamette Week Online | date = March 4, 1998| accessdate = February 6, 2010[/tpl] being named Oregon  high school player of the year. As a child, he suffered from chronic foot deformation.

==Career==

He attended the University of Oregon, leading his team to the National Invitational Tournament (NIT) in 1989-90 as a freshman. He then went on to hold several school records: career- and single-season scoring average, assists in a single game (13), single-season steals (twice), and single-game steals (eight). Brandon earned team MVP honors in 1990 and ‘91. After being an honorable mention All-American, he became the first Oregon player to leave school early for the NBA.http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=235060
Brandon was selected 11th overall in the 1991 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he spent the first six years of his career in Cleveland, and was selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game in 1996 and 1997. Many regarded Brandon as one of the better point guards in the NBA during the mid-1990s; among them Sports Illustrated, who labeled him "The Best Point Guard in the NBA" in a 1997 issue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9572/index.htm|title=The Best Point Guard in the NBA|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=February 10, 1997|accessdate=December 12, 2008[/tpl] He was also awarded the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 1997, for his work with underprivileged youth. Brandon would hold basketball camps, even counting Lebron James as a 7th grade participant.http://www.stepienrules.com/2011-articles/october/terrell-brandon.html
In September 1997, the Cavs sent Brandon and Tyrone Hill and a 1998 1st round pick (top-10 protected) to the Milwaukee Bucks, who traded Vin Baker to the Seattle SuperSonics, who dealt Shawn Kemp to Cleveland. He played two years for the Milwaukee Bucks before being traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brandte01.html|title=Terrell Brandon Statistics|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=December 18, 2008[/tpl] However, he was often plagued by injuries and on February 13, 2002, he was placed on the injury list by the Timberwolves, from which he did not return. It was in his stint with the Timberwolves that Brandon would get to team up and mentor Chauncey Billups.http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/lockout-2011/2011/09/chauncey-billups-in-charge-iman-shumpert-new-york-knicks/
On July 23, 2003, Brandon was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for salary cap purposes. He was waived by the Hawks on February 17, 2004, two years after his last game, and on March 9 he announced his retirement. Brandon finished his career averaging 13.8 points, three rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.58 steals per game, and came within six points of scoring 10,000 in his career. His career-high for assists registered in a game was 16, which he accomplished five times. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.http://www.stepienrules.com/2012-articles/august/the-electric-blue-jerseys-and-terrell-brandon-appreciation-day.html

==Extortion attempt==

In late February 2008, Brandon and former NFL defensive back Anthony Newman were the victims of an extortion attempt. Both Brandon and Newman received letters demanding money. Brandon and his friend, Timothy Upshaw, went along with the letter's request for Brandon to leave a bag outside of his garage with money inside (though they only placed a single dollar bill and plain paper in the bag). Bobby Hayes, the man responsible for the letters, arrived to retrieve the bag when he was confronted by Upshaw. Police were later called to the scene after a resident heard men talking about killing someone. Bobby Hayes was brought into custody and later released on bail, receiving orders not to contact Brandon, Newman or their families.[tpl]cite web|author = Associated Press | url = http://www.kval.com/sports/local/15875682.html | title= Former NBA player helps police nab suspect  |publisher = KVAL (Fisher Communications) |date = February 22, 2008 |accessdate = February 6, 2010[/tpl]
