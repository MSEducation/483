McGuire's most prominent commission, however, was  the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia (1903–06).

The Virginia Landmarks Register  states that the Cathedral is "a glorious celebration of Roman Catholic art and architecture" and also mentions that the original plans for the building are preserved in Richmond's Valentine Museum.http://books.google.com/books?id=NJa_64aH1iMC&pg=PA423&dq=cathedral+of+the+sacred+heart+richmond,+virginia&hl=en&ei=9d1NTabfLsOqlAeP0aDtDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22cathedral%20of%20the%20sacred%20heart%22&f=false Calder Loth, The Virginia landmarks register, page 423
