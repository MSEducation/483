==Plot summary==

Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is a veterinarian and host of a radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. When she makes a blind date with Brian (Chaplin), a caller to her show, her insecurity about her appearance leads her to persuade her more conventionally attractive (though less intellectual) friend Noelle (Thurman) to pretend to be Abby on their date.
Both women develop feelings for Brian, leading to a series of comic misunderstandings. Brian's persistence in pursuing Noelle in person is thwarted as Noelle tries to maneuver him toward the real Abby.
After Abby behaves jealously while drunk and embarrasses herself at a photo shoot, she leaves and it appears to her that Brian and Noelle sleep together. However, Noelle actually leaves too, and Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners Abby in her apartment where he finds evidence of her real identity as the radio host he fell for through her voice. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian decides he has been the victim of a practical joke and leaves in disgust.
Abby later approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, and although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby and he has fallen for the real Abby and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception. He suggests they start again, and Abby happily agrees.

==Themes==

Many movie reviewers found a similarity to the play Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand, with Abby as the talented but "ugly" Cyrano, Noelle as Christian (Noel is another name for Christmas), and Brian as Roxane.[tpl]cite news |last= Guthmann |first= Edward |title= Garofalo's a Find in Cats & Dogs |work= San Francisco Chronicle |location= |publisher= |date= September 13, 1996 |page=D18[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Cornell |first= Christopher |title= THE TRUTH Will Set Cyrano Free |work= Lexington Herald-Leader |date= September 13, 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Toppman |first= Lawrence |title= Cats and Dogs is CYRANO Light (and Bright) |work= The Charlotte Observer |location= Charlotte, North Carolina |publisher= The McClatchy Company |date= April 26, 1996 |page= 4E[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Connelly |first= David |title= Cats and Dogs reverses genders in Cyrano classic |work= Mobile Register |location= Mobile, Alabama |publisher= |date= April 26, 1996 |page= E1[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Peterson |first= Deborah |title= A Sassy, Sexy Switch On CYRANO Story |work= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |location= |publisher= |date= April 26, 1996 |page= 3E[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Ebert |first= Roger |authorlink= Roger Ebert |title= This Version of Cyrano Has Humor As Well As Sweetness |work= Press-Telegram |location= Long Beach, California |publisher= |date= April 26, 1996 |page=W6[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last= Abedon |first= Emily |title= Cats and Dogs takes a bite of Cyrano |work= The Post and Courier |location= Charleston, South Carolina |publisher= Evening Post Publishing Company |date= April 25, 1996 |page= E6[/tpl]
Uma Thurman said about the ugly-versus-beautiful theme, "We probably keep going back to that idea because there's a whole industry that needs to sell a lot of products that wants us to think that the outside is the important part. There's a war going on. The inside's not as commercial as the outside. People are so affected by how they're received in the world, and some of all of our first experiences are based on how we're externally judged. The conflict between the inner and the outer is a constant battle everybody experiences on lots of levels."[tpl]cite news |last= Kopp |first= Craig |title= M-m-m-m-m- - Uma - She's in a new movie with a moral |work= The Cincinnati Post |location= |publisher= |date= April 25, 1996|page= Metro 12[/tpl]

==Notes==

Although the film was a decent commercial success, Garofalo was not proud of the film, calling it "corny" and unrealistic.
Several years later, Garofalo became a radio talk show host for real (something she'd maintained for years in interviews that she wanted to do), when she co-hosted The Majority Report on Air America Radio.

==Reception==

The film received positive reviews from critics. It has an 84% "fresh" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.Rotten Tomatoes
The reviewer for The State Journal-Register (of Springfield, Illinois) wrote that the film "is a modern-day fantasy, to be sure -- a movie based almost entirely on one long, not particularly credible misunderstanding. But don't think too hard, or you'll underestimate this fragile little movie's bite, which is considerable... The stubby, feisty and, of course, not at all unattractive Garofalo and gangly, not-as-dumb-as-she-seems Thurman make for very appealing odd fellows as they inhabit the sunny Santa Monica landscapes and chic apartment settings... Cats & Dogs gets a little goofy, but stays within its limits. For actress Garofalo, who confidently spits out words like misogynist and biosphere, it should be nothing short of a launching pad. When the skeptical, challenging Abby confronts one of those laminated, condescending, jargon-spouting cosmetics saleswomen, we see a star in the making. Holly Hunter, watch your back. And short, smart and just-regular-looking girls everywhere, rejoice."[tpl]cite news |last= Povse |first= Paul |title= IN TRUTH, IT'S MAINLY THE PLAIN JANE WHO REIGNS |work= The State Journal-Register |location= Springfield, Illinois |publisher= Walt Lafferty |date= May 2, 1996[/tpl]
