The decade is known for being prominent in historical drama, psychological horror, romance and comedy, as well as the sub-genres of spy film, sword and sandal, and spaghetti westerns, all peaking during this decade.
Beginning in the middle of the decade due to the start of the cultural revolution and the abolition of the Hays Code, films became increasingly experimental and daring and were taking shape of what was to define the 1970s.
