Johannes Crellius (Polish: Jan Crell, English John Crell) (26 July Hellmitzheim 1590 – Raków 1633) was a Polish and German theologian.

==Life==

Johann Crell's father, Johann Crell Sr., was pastor of the church at Hellmitzheim, (today part of Iphofen in Kitzingen District), in Franken, northern Bavaria. His son Krzysztof Crell-Spinowski (1622–1680), and his grandsons Christopher Crell Jr. M.D. of London (1658-), Samuel Crellius (1660–1747) and Paweł Crell-Spinowski (1677-), as well as his great-grandsons in Georgia, United States, were all proponents of Socinian views.
Crellius moved to Poland at the age of 22, and quickly became known as one of the chief theologians of the Socinians, also known as Polish brethren. From 1613 he worked at the Racovian Academy at Raków, of which he was the rector from 1616 to 1621.Henry Hallam	''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries 2005 p417 "Crellius was, perhaps, the most eminent of the Racovian school in this century" In 1630 he worked with Joachim Stegmann Sr. in the production of a German version of the Racovian New Testament.

==Influence==

Several of Crell's works were printed first by Rodecki and Sternacki at the printery of the Racovian Academy 1602-1638. These and others then appeared as Vol.III-V of Frans Kuyper's Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant ("Library of the Polish Brethren called Unitarians") Amsterdam 1668(not 1656 as incorrectly listed in some catalogues) Crell also featured in Christopher Sand's bibliography and biographical collection Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum (1684). These works were widely distributed being owned by Voltaire, John Locke and other Enlightenment thinkers.Sarah Mortimer Reason and Religion in the English Revolution: The Challenge of Socinianism (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History) 2010
Since Crell was not translated into English, knowledge of his works passed out of the later generations of English Unitarians. However Thomas Belsham is one of the Unitarian authors who had access to Crell in the Latin and Belsham repeatedly cites Crell in his The Epistles of Paul the Apostle Translated, with an Exposition, and Notes (1822).
