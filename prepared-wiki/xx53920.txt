==Child star==

Ruby Florence Murray was born on the Donegall Road in south Belfast, Northern Ireland.Culture Northern Ireland website. Her voice's unique sound was partly the result of an operation on her throat in early childhood.Official Website. She toured as a child singer and first appeared on television at the age of 12, having been spotted by producer Richard Afton. Owing to laws governing children performing, Murray had to delay her start in the entertainment industry. She returned to Belfast and full-time education until she was 14.

==Chart success==

Again spotted by Afton, she was signed to Columbia and her first single, "Heartbeat", reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1954. Afton had offered her the position of resident singer on the BBC's Quite Contrary television show, to replace Joan Regan. "Softly, Softly", her second single, reached number one in early 1955. That same year Murray set a pop-chart record by having five hits in the Top Twenty in one week, a feat unmatched for many years.
The 1950s was a busy period for Murray, during which she had her own television show, starred at the London Palladium with Norman Wisdom, appeared in a Royal Command Performance (1955), and toured the world. In a period of 52 weeks, starting in 1955, Murray constantly had at least one single in the UK charts — this at a time when only a Top 20 was listed.
She starred with Frankie Howerd and Dennis Price in her only film role as Ruby, in the 1956 farce, A Touch of the Sun. A couple of hits followed later in the decade; "Goodbye Jimmy, Goodbye", a No.10 hit in 1959, was her final appearance in the charts.
EMI put together a compilation album of her hits on CD in 1989, including songs that regularly featured in her act; "Mr. Wonderful", "Scarlet Ribbons" and "It's the Irish in Me". They updated this with the release of EMI Presents The Magic Of Ruby Murray in 1997, and a triple album, Anthology — The Golden Anniversary Collection in 2005, the 50th anniversary of her peak successes on the charts.

A play about Murray's life, Ruby, written by the Belfast playwright, Marie Jones, opened at the Group Theatre in  Belfast in April 2000.

==Personal life==

During the summer of 1957, while working in Blackpool, Murray met Bernie Burgess, a member of a family song-and-dance troupe. Shortly afterwards she left Northern Ireland to marry him and live with him in England. Burgess became her manager and the couple became a double act during the 1960s. After her first marriage failed in 1974, she was granted a divorce in 1976. She married an old friend, Ray Lamar, in 1993, and lived in Torquay, Devon. She had two children from her marriage to Burgess.
Although her days as a major star ended in the 1960s, Murray continued performing until close to the end of her life. She died of liver cancer, aged 61, in December 1996 in Torquay, after a long struggle with alcoholism.
Spending her last couple of years in Aspreys Nursing Home she often delighted her carers with a song, and was visited by her special friend Max Bygraves.
