==History==

===Early 1990s: origins===

Dance music in Spain became prominent in 1988 with the rise of acid house. Mákina followed this trend and has its origins in the early 1990s in Valencia, Spain.[tpl]cite book|author1=Carles Feixa|author2=Carmen Costa|author3=Joan Pallarés|title=From okupas to makineros: citizenship and youth cultures in Spain|date=2001|publisher=Council of Europe|page=297[/tpl] Derived from another style called Bakalao, which was in reality the local name given to an association of electronic dance music played together with pop and rock tunes in Valencian clubs in the second half of the 1980s.[tpl]cite book|author=Damien Simonis|title=Spain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WttmSt7kPmMC&pg=PA404|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=15 March 2007|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-554-3|page=69[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Loretta Chilcoat|author2=Reuben Acciano|title=Western Europe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Enrkj9PsKGwC&pg=PA30|accessdate=22 December 2010|date=15 February 2005|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-927-6|page=30[/tpl]

===Mid-1990s: breakthrough and success===

The genre gained prominence in 1991 when Spanish producer Chimo Bayo released his single, "A Si Me Gusta A Mi (X-Ta Si, X-Ta No)". The song was a success throughout Europe and the genre soon gained prominence. The genre became extremely popular throughout Spain from 1995 to 1997, as many Mákina oriented singles reached number one on the Spanish Singles Chart. Spanish mákina group EX-3 had two number-one singles, "Extres" and "Ex-P-Cial" in 1995 and 1996, respectively.[tpl]cite book |last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=Sólo éxitos: año a año, 1959–2002|accessdate=2011-01-26|edition=1st |date=September 2005|publisher=Fundación Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2[/tpl]
