The Dadu River ([tpl]zh|c=大渡河|p=Dàdù Hé|w=Tatu Ho[/tpl]) is located in Sichuan province, southern China. It is a tributary of the Min River (Mín Jiāng), which is a tributary of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang).
The Shuangjiangkou Dam will be built in its valley.

==History==

The river is noted for being crossed by the Luding Bridge, a historically important bridge. It was the site of a famous retreat by the Chinese communists from the Kuomintang troops during the Long March.

===Landslide dam===

The Kangding Louding earthquake of 1786 caused a landslide dam in the Dadu. Ten days later, 10 June 1786,  the dam broke and the resulting flood extended [tpl]convert|1400|km|mi[/tpl] downstream, and killed 100,000 people. It is the second-deadliest landslide disaster on record.Schuster, R.L. and G. F.

==Culture==

A song from the Chinese musical The East Is Red is entitled "Across the Dadu River."
The Grand/Giant Buddha is located on the high side of the confluence of the Dadu and Min Rivers at Leshan. It is a frequent tourist destination.
