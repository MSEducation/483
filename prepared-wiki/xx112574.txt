[[Dirichlet beta function]]

CATEGORIES: Zeta and L-functions

In mathematics, the Dirichlet beta function (also known as the Catalan beta function) is a special function, closely related to the Riemann zeta function. It is a particular Dirichlet L-function, the L-function for the alternating character of period four.

==Definition==

The Dirichlet beta function is defined as
or, equivalently,
In each case, it is assumed that Re(s) > 0.
Alternatively, the following definition, in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function, is valid in the whole complex s-plane:
Another equivalent definition, in terms of the Lerch transcendent, is:
which is once again valid for all complex values of s.

==Functional equation==

The functional equation extends the beta function to the left side of the complex plane Re(s)where Γ(s) is the gamma function.

==Special values==

Some special values include:
where G represents Catalan's constant, and
Hence, the function vanishes for all odd negative integral values of the argument.

There are zeros at -1; -3; -5; -7 etc.
