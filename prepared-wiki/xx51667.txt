Anthrax were an anarcho punk band formed in Gravesend, Kent, England in 1980.Ian Glasper The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984 2007 Page 128 "And many of those gigs were at the Red Lion, a much-loved Gravesend venue, where bands such as Conflict, Flux, Dirt and Anthrax would play for 50p - great days!" ; Page 134 "Not to be confused with the fun-loving New York metal act of the same name, Gravesend's ANTHRAX were a convincing anarcho-punk band, that dwelt musically somewhere between Crass's unforgiving rants and Conflict's violent bluster" ; Page 135 "We could always fill a coach for gigs further afield, which was good, 'cos we'd turn up mob-handed and have fifty Anthrax fans there straight away, even if most of them were in other bands that we knew! We'd play every week." They recorded their first demo in 1981 and went on to release two 7" EPs on Crass RecordsGeorge Berger The Story of Crass 2006 "Anthrax Capitalism Is Cannibalism E.P. (1982)" and Small Wonder Records.Maximum Rocknroll - 2002 -Issue 230 "However, the band's original record label, Small Wonder, were having trouble finding a pressing plant to make the record due to the alleged blasphemous lyrical content.... Red Alert cassettes released a compilation featuring live performances by Conflict, Anthrax, and the Sinyx, as well as Annie."Maximum Rocknroll - 2002 -Issue 236 "We'd played in Gravesend (Kent) quite a lot by then and had got to know the members of Anthrax who were from around there (I'd like to say we inspired them to form a band, but I doubt that's true). Pete, their drummer, volunteered his services " They appeared on compilations released by Crass Records, Mortarhate Records and Fightback Records. They toured outside the UK twice in the Netherlands with Dutch band The Ex.
In 2007 the band issued a compilation album, One Last Drop, which included demos, both EPs, the Mortarhate compilation track and two live tracks.
