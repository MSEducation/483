This was followed in 1998 by the biotech thriller Crucifix Lane. From 1998 to 2001, Mosse held the position of executive director of the Chichester Festival Theatre. Meanwhile she also remained engaged in research work for the first of a series of timeslip historical adventure novels set in southwest France in the past and present day.
