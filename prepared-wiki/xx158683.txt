==Service history==

===Pacific Theatre operations===

After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay area during April, Trapper got underway on 11 June and proceeded – via Manzanillo, Cuba, the Panama Canal, and San Diego — to the Pacific Ocean war zone. In mid-August, while the minelayer was en route to Hawaii, Japan capitulated. The ship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 August and was routed westward, via Eniwetok, Saipan, and Okinawa, to Japan.
Trapper arrived at Kobe on 25 November 1945 and operated out of that port repairing minesweeping gear until 1 February 1946 when she shifted her base of operations to Wakayama for a month. On 11 March, the minelayer got underway for the United States. En route, she called at Saipan, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Johnston Island, and Hawaii before arriving at San Francisco, on 2 May.

===Transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard===

Trapper was decommissioned and transferred to the United States Coast Guard on 20 June 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 19 July 1946. The former auxiliary minelayer served with the Coast Guard until early 1959 as the USCGC Yamacraw (WARC-333).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t7/trapper.htm |title=Trapper |author=Naval History & Heritage Command |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=U.S. Navy |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl]
During 1957 and 1958 the ship was leased to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for geophysical research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://patriot.net/~eastlnd2/o_arc.htm#Yamacraw |title=ARC-1, Yamacraw (ARC-5) & Nashawena (AG-142) |accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl]

===Reacquisition by the U.S. Navy===

She was reacquired by the United States Navy on 17 April 1959 and commissioned at New York on 30 April as ARC-5, a cable repair ship.
Yamacraw was assigned to the 3rd Naval District for the next six years. She operated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Bermuda and spent much of her at-sea time conducting research projects for the Office of Naval Research and for the Bell Telephone Laboratories.

==Final decommissioning==

On 2 July 1965, Yamacraw was decommissioned, transferred to the permanent custody of the Maritime Administration, and struck from the Navy List.
