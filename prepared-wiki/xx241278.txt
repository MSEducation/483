==Geography==

Ejin Banner is the westernmost banner of Inner Mongolia. It is located in the Gobi Desert and borders on Outer Mongolia in the north, Gansu Province in the southwest, and Alxa Right Banner in the southeast.
Ejin Banner takes its name from the Ejin River, also known as Ruo Shui, which flows from the Qilian Mountains of Gansu, and whose two distributaries terminate in Juyan Lake Basin within Ejin banner. Most of the banner's population resides in this river's valley.

==Transportation==

Eljin Banner is served by the Jiayuguan-Ceke and the Linhe-Ceke Railways, which are primarily used to haul coal, which is trucked from Nariin Sukhait Coal Mine in Outer Mongolia by truck to Ceke, and is loaded on trains at the coal terminals there.
There is also a railway south to both sites (northern and southern) of Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, which are also located within Ejin Banner.
