Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world. It was launched on May 25, 2007, in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide.
Where available, Street View images appear after zooming in beyond the highest zooming level in maps and satellite images, and also by dragging a "pegman" icon onto a location on a map. When dragging the pegman icon, blue lines on the map showing Street View imagery will appear. Using the keyboard or mouse, the horizontal and vertical viewing direction and zoom level can be selected. A solid or broken line in the photo shows the approximate path followed by the camera car, and arrows link to the next photo in each direction. At junctions and crossings of camera car routes, more arrows are shown. By using Google Maps, users can turn on stereoscopic 3D mode by right-clicking in Street View to get an anaglyph version of any Street View images. However, this mode requires users to wear red/cyan glasses to see the 3D effects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.itechdiary.com/google-maps-street-view-now-there-is-3d-option.html |title=Google Maps Street View, now there is 3D option? |publisher=Itechdiary.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]
On November 21, 2008, Street View was added to the Maps application installed on the Apple iPhone. On December 10, 2008, Street View was added to the Maps application for S60 3rd Edition. Street View has now also been added to the BlackBerry and Windows Mobile versions of Google Maps. All versions of Google Maps for the Android operating system feature Street View, and the digital compass can be used to look around the locations.
Google Street View displays panoramas of stitched images taken from a fleet of specially adapted cars. Areas not accessible by car, like pedestrian areas, narrow streets, alleys and ski resorts, are sometimes covered by Google Trikes (tricycles),[tpl]cite news|title=Coming Soon, Google Street View of a Canadian Village You’ll Never Drive To |author=Ian Austen |date=August 22, 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/an-inuit-village-too-remote-for-cars-gets-street-view.html[/tpl] snowmobiles[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/kateshanley/2811857695/in/pool-googlestreetviewcar |title=Googlemaps trike |work=Flickr |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/02/street-view-hits-slopes-at-whistler.html |title=Google Street View snowmobile on Google Lat Long blog[/tpl] or boats.[tpl]cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=-0.579519,-90.247192&spn=0.565765,0.617294&t=m&z=11 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-12-23[/tpl] On each of these vehicles there are nine directional cameras for 360° views at a height of 2.5–3.0 meters (8.2–9.8 feet),[tpl]cite news |author= |title=Google using Street View technology to create detailed virtual walking tour of 400,000 military graves at Arlington National Cemetery |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2500751/Google-using-Street-View-technology-create-detailed-virtual-walking-tour-400-000-military-graves-Arlington-National-Cemetery.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=2013-11-11 |accessdate=2013-12-12 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Erik Kirschbaum |title=Germany to keep close eye on Google "Street View" |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/11/us-germany-google-idUSTRE67A2VJ20100811 |agency=Reuters |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2013-12-12[/tpl] GPS units for positioning and three laser range scanners from Sick AG for the measuring of up to 50 meters 180° in the front of the vehicle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.educatingsilicon.com/2008/04/18/google-street-view-soon-in-3d/ |title=Google Street View – Soon in 3D? |last=Cummins |first=Mark |publisher=Educating Silicon |accessdate=January 3, 2012[/tpl]
These are used for recording a rough 3D model of the surroundings, enabling faux-3D transitions between distinct panoramas where the environment images are momentarily mapped onto this 3D model while being crossfaded to create an animated perspective change as the user travels from one panorama to another. There are also 3G/GSM/Wi-Fi antennas for scanning 3G/GSM and Wi-Fi hotspots.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.rotacoo.com/a-couple-of-thoughts-on-street-view |title=A couple of thoughts on Street View |last=Turnbull |first=James |publisher=Rotacoo.com |accessdate=January 5, 2012[/tpl]  More recently, high quality images have been based on open source hardware cameras from Elphel.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E9ubrmtFbY |title=PhotoTechEDU Day 25: Open-source-based high-resolution cameras |publisher=Google |date=August 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2011[/tpl]

==Development==

Google Street View was introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007 and, until November 26, 2008, featured camera icon markers, each representing at least one major city or area (such as a park), and usually the other nearby cities, towns, suburbs, and parks. Many areas that had coverage were not represented by icons.

==Features==

==Coverage==

Google Street View was introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007,[tpl]Cite news |url=https://epic.org/privacy/googlespyfi/Keyes.pdf |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center |title=Class Action Complaint |date=29 May 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2012[/tpl] and only covered areas of the United States until July 2, 2008. Images can now be seen in 48 countries, dependencies, and autonomous regions (although parts of other countries and dependencies can be seen from locations located near national borders; for example, large portions of Vatican City can be viewed from Rome's street view). Introductions have generally occurred every 2 days to 100 days. Until November 26, 2008, major cities (and early on, the only cities) were marked by camera icons, more of which were added each time. Then, all camera icons were discontinued in favor simply of "blue" coverage, while other features have been added to make access to and use of the feature more user-friendly.
On June 6, 2012, Google announced that it has captured 20 petabytes of data for Street View, comprising photos taken along 5 million miles of roads, covering 39 countries and about 3,000 cities.[tpl]cite web|last=Farber|first=Dan|title=Google takes Street View off-road with backpack rig|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57448293-93/google-takes-street-view-off-road-with-backpack-rig/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=7 September 2012[/tpl]
Below is a table showing the countries available on Street View and the year they were first added. Plain text indicates that a country has only views of certain businesses and/or tourist attractions.

===North America===

====United States====

The United States was the first country to have Street View images and was the only country with images for over a year following introduction. Early on, most locations had a limited number of views, usually constrained to the city limits and only including major streets. Few suburbs or other nearby cities were included. After the first few sets of introductions, image collections from cities added were more detailed, often including every side street, more suburbs and nearby cities.

====Canada====

In Canada, Google Street View cars had been spotted as early as September 2007, in Montreal, though service for Canada was delayed while attempting to settle with the Canadian government over its privacy laws. The first images of Canada were made available on October 7, 2009. Currently, most of Canada can be seen on Street View with the notable exceptions of Labrador, the Gaspé Peninsula and Fort McMurray, Alberta.
On February 10, 2010, many more areas of Canada (barring extremely northern and rural areas) were added. Ski runs on Whistler Blackcomb Resort were also covered in this update. As of November 28, 2012, the northernmost community currently imaged is Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, and the second northernmost place in North America, after Deadhorse Airport near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.

====Mexico====

In Mexico, first reports of sightings came in from Tijuana as early as July 2007 and now Google Street View cars are being spotted in many Mexican states. On November 9, 2009, Street View was made available in the main cities of Mexico, including Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Cancún and Puerto Vallarta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2009/152568/6/mexico-ya-es-accesible-calle-por-calle-en-internet.htm |title=México ya es accesible, calle por calle, en Internet |publisher=Informador.com.mx |accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]

====Caribbean====

===Latin America===

Mexico was the first country in Latin America to be covered by Street View, in 2009 and were followed by Brazil in 2010. As of 2013, Street View is also available in Chile, Colombia, Peru and small parts of Ecuador. Argentina is scheduled to be added to the service in 2014.

===Europe===

In Europe, coverage is available in 23 countries, of which 16 have complete or near-complete coverage. Coverage began in Europe on July 2, 2008, with the Tour de France route in parts of France and Italy, and other parts followed.

===Asia===

In Asia, Google Street View is currently available in parts of Hong Kong, Israel, Macau, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.

===Oceania===

On August 4, 2008, the image collection of Australia was introduced. Extensive mapping of New Zealand was included on December 1, 2008.

===Africa===

Street View can be seen in South Africa, Botswana, the Canary Islands of Spain, Lesotho and Swaziland.

===Antarctica===

==Future==

On November 23, 2012, Google in cooperation with Indonesian Tourism Ministry officially launched the first Google StreetView vehicle in Indonesia starting in the capital city Jakarta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/google-streetview-indonesia/ |title=Google’s StreetView Coming to Indonesia As Camera Cars Hit the Road Today |publisher=TechInAsia.com |date=November 23, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl] Google said that it is the biggest project in Asia to date and will feature several big cities in Indonesia as well as a special project featuring top tourist attractions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/11/23/google-street-view-is-coming-to-indonesia-its-largest-projection-in-asia-to-date/ |title=Street View is coming to Indonesia, as Google partners with the country’s tourism ministry |publisher=Thenextweb.com |date=November 23, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2012[/tpl]

==Cameras==

Google has used three types of car-mounted cameras to take Street View photographs. Generations 1–3 were used to take photographs in the United States. The first generation was superseded and images were replaced with images taken with 2nd and 3rd generation cameras. Second generation cameras were used to take photographs in Australia. The shadows caused by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation cameras are occasionally viewable in images taken in mornings and evenings. The new 4th generation cameras will be used to completely replace all images taken with earlier generation cameras. 4th generation cameras take near-HD images and deliver much better quality than earlier cameras. Even though 4th generation cameras were in use as early as April 2008, Google used older cameras for many areas as late as October 2009 for Street View and as late as September 2010 for Museum View.
In October 2008, Google introduced the Street View Trike, a pedal tricycle with a 4th generation camera mounted to take images where cars cannot reach, including footpaths and dirt tracks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/may/18/google-google-street-view |title=Meet Google Street View's latest weapon: a tricycle |last=Andrews |first=Robert |date=18 May 2009 |location=London |work=The Guardian[/tpl] The 250-pound, 9-foot long tricycles are piloted by athletes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/google-street-view-goes-off-road-with-tricycle-to-capture-more-images.htm|title=Google Street View goes off road with tricycle to capture more images|date=March 1, 2011|publisher=L.A. Times|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] All Street View images taken now will be taken with the 4th generation Street View cameras.
In February 2010, Google introduced the Street View Snowmobile, a snowmobile with a 4th generation camera mounted to take images on the Whistler Blackcomb Ski Slopes in preparation for the winter olympics in Vancouver, Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/streetview/gallery/ |title=Street View Snowmobile |publisher=Google  |date=August 4, 1961 |accessdate=August 27, 2010[/tpl]
Google plans to use 4th generation cameras to re-shoot areas previously covered by earlier versions.
Google uses the open-source cameras from Elphel for capturing Street View photos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2007/08/weekly-google-code-roundup-for-august.html |title=Elphel Cameras used for Street View |publisher=Google  |date=August 4, 1961 |accessdate=July 30, 2012[/tpl]

===Camera quality comparison===

The above shows a comparison of different generations of the Street View cameras. The first image was taken with the 2nd generation Street View camera and the second image was taken with the 4th generation camera. The 4th generation camera provides clearer, sharper, and more vivid images than its predecessors. In most of Europe, for example, images were taken with the 4th generation camera as they were taken later. Images taken with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation cameras are gradually being phased out and replaced by images taken with 4th generation cameras. Eventually, all low resolution images will be replaced with HD images.

===Pegman===

For most areas on street view, the pegman is shown as a standard yellow figure. Some areas have a modified version for specific areas. For example, in Legoland (California) the pegman is shown as a Lego character, in Hawaii the pegman is a surfboarder, and on Half Moon Island (Antarctica) the pegman is shown as a Chinstrap Penguin.[tpl]cite web|title=Who is Pegman?|url=http://maps.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/streetview/learn/pegman.html|work=Google Maps|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 July 2012[/tpl]  In certain stadiums and sports facilities, the pegman appears with sportswear when dropped in the map, such as in Arthur Ashe Stadium in Corona Park, Queens, NY. When Quest mode is enabled and Maps GL is disabled, the pegman is shown in the style of a video game character, and when dropped on NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the pegman is shown as an astronaut.

==Privacy issues==

Privacy advocates have objected to this Google feature, pointing to views found to show men leaving strip clubs, protesters at an abortion clinic, sunbathers in bikinis, and people engaging in activities visible from public property in which they do not wish to be seen publicly.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/other/display.var.1444323.0.0.php |title=Google's Street View site raises alarm over privacy |author=MacDonald, Calum |publisher=The Herald |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] The concerns have led to several temporary bans of Street View in countries around the world. Google maintains that the photos were taken from public property; however, an individual taking pictures of private property using a ladder to gain a view not normally available to a pedestrian would be prosecuted for invasion of privacy or harassment in many jurisdictions worldwide. Google has yet to address this concern. The service also allows users themselves to flag inappropriate or sensitive imagery for Google to review and remove.[tpl]cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/internetprivacy/2007-06-01-google-maps-privacy_N.htm |title=Google's street-level maps raising privacy concerns |author=Mills, Elinor |work=USA Today |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2009[/tpl]
In May 2010, it was revealed that Google had collected and stored payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi connections as part of Street View.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.techeye.net/security/google-admits-it-sniffed-out-peoples-data|title=Google admits it sniffed out people's data|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=TechEye[/tpl] German authorities are considering legal action while the Foreign Minister said "I will do all I can to prevent it."
