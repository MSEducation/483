Morten Frost or Morten Frost Hansen, aka "Mr Badminton",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.badzine.net/features/profile-morten-frost/142/ | title=The iron mask |publisher=BadZine.info| date=2007-01-05[/tpl] (born April 4, 1958) is a former badminton player and later coach, who represented Denmark. As a player, he spent twelve years in the top three of the world rankings.

==Badminton career==

During his career, Frost won almost every available top level championship, except the World Badminton Championships where he scored a silver medal twice (1985 and 1987). When he lost his second World Championship in the finals, the headlines rang out "The World's greatest badminton player may never be World Champion."  While this may be the enduring footnote to his career, Frost dominated at the much coveted All England Open Badminton Championships (comparable to Wimbledon in tennis). He won that tournament in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987. He also was European champion in 1984 and 1986. He won the Nordic championship each year from 1978 through 1984 and again in 1988.
Frost is also distinguished by winning all of the invitational Grand Prix tournaments at least once, including his home country's Denmark Open, of which he was champion 1980-1986 and 1989. Morten Frost represented Denmark on the national team from 1976 to 1991, longer than anyone else.
Noted for his exceptionally smooth and fluid footwork, Frost's playing style was something of a cross between the traditional singles game featuring numerous clears (lobs) and drops, with smashes often reserved for weak returns, and the modern singles game featuring more smashing from the outset of a rally to create openings.
After his playing years were over, he went on to successfully coach the Danish national team. During his tenure as coach, the Danish national squad achieved over 20 major international wins, including an Olympic gold medal in 1996, six gold medals and three silver medals at the European Championships in 1996, the men's singles titles at the 1995 and 1996 All England Championships, and a gold, two silver and four bronze medals at the World Championships in 1995. He later coached the national teams of Malaysia and South Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://shuttler.tripod.com/shuttler/news/news005.htm | title=Danish legend Frost to coach South Africa |publisher=Shuttler| date=2001-03-30[/tpl]
