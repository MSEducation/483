Ilchester Friary was founded between 1221 and 1260 as a Dominican monastery in Ilchester Somerset, England.
The buildings were restored in the 13th and 14th centuries until the site occupied a [tpl]convert|1.6|ha|acre[/tpl] site, and by the 15th century it extended beyond the town walls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=53016|title=Dominican friary, West Street, Ilchester|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]
