</ref>  According to Beyerstein (1995)<ref name="Beyerstein, B.L 1990 27–36 27"/> and Witkowski (2010), NLP jargon—such as ''pragmagraphics'', ''metamodeling'', ''metaprogramming'', ''submodalities''—is intended to impress, obfuscate and give the false impression that NLP is a scientific discipline.<ref name="Witkowski 2010"/>  Beyerstein says, "though it claims neuroscience in its pedigree, NLP's outmoded view of the relationship between cognitive style and brain function ultimately boils down to crude analogies."<ref name="Beyerstein, B.L 1990 27–36 27"/> Furthermore Beyerstein (1995) believed that NLP has helped popularize myths about the brain and neurology and that that the aphorism "you create your own reality" promotes an [[Epistemological relativism|epistemologically relativistic]] perspective, the purpose of which is to gain immunity from scientific testing. Reviewing various applications of  brain lateralization mythology to education and psychotherapy, neuroscientist Lauren Julius Harris writes, "[t]he scientifically most pretentious of these [applications] is known as Neurolinguistic Programming".<ref>
