It is based on a far futuristic planet where four mercenaries try to find the ultimate weapon which can either save humanity or destroy it. Against mechas and strange races, together they sweep the vast planet to reach their goal.
Aqualoid was a prosperous planet, but an attack from a mysterious life force, the Inorganics, transforms it into a post-apocalyptic shell of its former self. When Nam finds a mysterious sword, he is suddenly the object of a planet-wide chase. With the Inorganics closing in, will Nam and his friends discover the secret of the sword and save their world? Or will they destroy Aqualoid in favor of a new Birth?
