Voyagers! was an American science fiction time travel-based television series that aired on NBC during the 1982â€“1983 season. The series starred Jon-Erik Hexum and Meeno Peluce.

==Plot==

Phineas Bogg (Jon-Erik Hexum) was one of a society of time travelers called Voyagers who, with the help of a young boy named Jeffrey Jones (played by Meeno Peluce) from 1982, used a hand-held device called an Omni (which looked much like a large pocket watch) to travel in time and ensured that history unfolded as we know it. In the first episode, Jeffrey ensured that baby Moses's basket traveled down the Nile where it was met by the Pharaoh's daughter.
Bogg and Jeffrey first met when Bogg's Omni malfunctioned and took him to 1982, landing him in the apartment of Jeffrey's aunt and uncle, who were caring for him after his parents's death. Jeffrey accidentally fell out of a window, and Bogg jumped out to rescue him by activating the Omni. Bogg's Guidebook, which contained a detailed description of how history was supposed to unfold, had been grabbed by Jeffrey's dog Ralph, so Bogg had to rely on Jeffrey (whose father had been a history professor) to help him.
Phineas was timeless in his machismo, and managed to fall for a beautiful woman in almost every episode. Whenever Jeffrey's wisdom was paired up against Bogg's stubbornness, Jeffrey usually won out, to which Bogg would always mutter, "Smart kids give me a pain!"
It was revealed later in the series that despite Jeffrey's age, and the accidental circumstances of first encounter with Phineas, he was always destined to become a Voyager.
Over the closing credits of each episode, regular cast member Meeno Peluce said in voice over: "If you want to learn more about element from the episode, take a voyage down to your public library. It's all in books!"

==Reception==

Voyagers ran for one season of 20 episodes, broadcast opposite the top-rated 60 Minutes. The series averaged a 17 share. Voyagers! seemed likely to be renewed for a second season, but controversies in 60 Minutes reporting led executives to believe that 60 Minutes might be successfully challenged by a competing news program instead.Snauffer and Thurm, p. 83 NBC canceled Voyagers![tpl]cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086114,00.html|title=On and Off Camera, Joan Collins Helps in the Making of Male Model Jon-Erik Hexum|last=Wallace|first=David|date=1983-10-11|publisher=People|accessdate=2008-08-16[/tpl] and replaced it with the news magazine program Monitor, which averaged only a 7 share.
