[[MacZoop]]

CATEGORIES: Mac OS-only software

MacZoop was a popular application framework for the Apple Macintosh, based on Carbon. Written exclusively in C++, it was designed as a much smaller and manageable alternative to the popular, but now defunct Think Class Library (TCL) from Symantec, and later, PowerPlant framework from Metrowerks. MacZoop was developed continually from 1994 until 2003, and was available free. In the face of continuing development of the Cocoa framework and the Project Builder tools from Apple for Mac OS X, proactive MacZoop development was discontinued in 2003, though bugfixes and maintenance releases were still made. The MacZoop domain expired sometime in 2008, though a legacy download is still available: http://apptree.net/code.htm
