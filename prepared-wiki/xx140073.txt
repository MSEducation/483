Color Theory is the musical alter ego of American singer-keyboardist-songwriter Brian Hazard. Hazard has released eight studio albums, eight EPs, and one collection of demos to date. His eighth studio album The Sound was released on August 4, 2010.

==Biography==

Hazard, the sole member of Color Theory, began studying the piano at the relatively young age of thirteen. He took lessons on and off through his high school years, while playing piano in the school jazz band and mallet percussion in the drumline. In 1992, Hazard was awarded a Bachelor of Music degree in Piano Performance from California State University, Long Beach. The following year he enrolled in songwriting and recording classes at Golden West College, and began writing songs for the first Color Theory album, Sketches in Grey.

==Recordings==

Sketches in Grey was a local success when it was released in 1994, quickly selling out the first pressing. But it wasn't until fledgling label A Different Drum included "Heart Like a Doll" on its first release, Rise! America's Synthpop Underground, that Color Theory was exposed to the small but dedicated modern synthpop scene.
Hazard began performing Color Theory material live after the release of 1997's Tuesday Song, which includes "The Perfect Song", first performed as a proposal to now-wife Michelle. Hazard long considered 1999's Perfect Tears his best work, representing the culmination of the "electronic piano pop" sound he'd worked six years to refine. 2001's Life's Fairytale explored mostly piano-less electronic textures, representing a significant change of course from earlier material. But the biggest change came with 2002's Something Beautiful, a fully acoustic recording featuring legendary drummer Jonathan Moffett, fretless bassist Baba Elefante, a string quartet, flute, harp, and Hazard on piano and vibraphone. Twenty-six weekly demo recordings were posted on the web as part of the “Bad Song of the Week” project, which allowed fans to vote for their favorites and decide which songs would ultimately be included on the album. These demos were released as a limited edition two-disc set entitled Like Clockwork.
2003 brought another sharp directional change with Color Theory presents Depeche Mode, a one-man tribute to Depeche Mode. In addition to eleven Depeche Mode covers and two new instrumental interludes, the album includes "Ponytail Girl", a Color Theory original that was mislabeled and widely circulated on file sharing networks as a Depeche Mode track from their yet to be released Exciter album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=152_0_2_0_c |title=Color Theory presents Depeche Mode cover album |publisher=Side-Line|date=Sep 10, 2003 |accessdate=Jun 29, 2011[/tpl]  Hazard's voice is said to resemble that of Martin Gore, which has confused Depeche fans.
Five years in the making, 2008's The Thought Chapter contains a Death Cab for Cutie cover and eleven new originals. “If It's My Time to Go” won both a Lennon Award[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jlsc.com/winners/2008b/lennon_awards.php |title=2008 Lennon Award Winners |publisher=John Lennon Songwriting Contest[/tpl] and the Grand Prize in the Electronic category[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jlsc.com/winners/2008b/winners.php |title=2008 Grand Prize Winners - Session II|publisher=John Lennon Songwriting Contest[/tpl] of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest.
