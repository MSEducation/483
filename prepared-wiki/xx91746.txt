Southern Sydney is a general term which is used to describe the southern metropolitan area of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
Depending on the context, 'Southern Sydney' would include the suburbs in the local government areas of Rockdale, Kogarah and Hurstville (collectively known as the St George area), and in broad geographical usage it includes the suburbs in the local government area of Sutherland, south of the Georges River (colloquially known as 'The Shire'). As a result, the area is often referred to as St George and Sutherland, as in the Australian Bureau of Statistics' St George-Sutherland Statistical Subdivision.National Regional Profile : St George-Sutherland (Statistical Subdivision).
