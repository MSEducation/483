[[List of districts of the House of Representatives of Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Districts of the House of Representatives of Japan, Japanese general elections

[tpl]Politics of Japan[/tpl][tpl]As of|2005[/tpl], the House of Representatives of Japan is elected from a combination of multi-member districts and single-member districts. Currently, 180 members are elected from 11 multi-member districts, and 300 members are elected from single-member districts, for a total of 480. These districts are those used for the 2003 general election.
Each Block (multi-member) district spans one or more Prefectures, and each Prefecture spans one or more single-member district, so the districts are organized by Block district and then by Prefecture. In general, the Block districts correspond loosely to the major Regions of Japan, with some of the larger regions subdivided.
Up to the 1993 general election all members of the House of Representatives were elected in multi-member constituencies by Single Non-Transferable Vote. In 1994, parliament passed an electoral reform bill that introduced the current system of parallel voting in single-member constituencies and proportional voting blocks.[tpl]cite news|title=Japanese Pass Bills On Electoral Reform|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E3DF173EF930A35752C1A962958260|work=The New York Times|date=3 November 1993|accessdate=2008-08-09[/tpl] The original draft bill in 1993 by the anti-LDP coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa included proportional party list voting on a national scale, an equal number of proportional and district seats (250 each) and the possibility of split voting. But the bill was stalled in the House of Councillors.CRS: Issue Brief IB93100 in the Government Document Digital Collection of the University of North Texas After the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had returned to power later that year, it was changed to include proportional voting in regional blocks only, the number of proportional seats was reduced, but the possibility to cast two separate votes was kept in the bill. The electoral reform law was finally passed in 1994. It was first applied in the 1996 general election.
