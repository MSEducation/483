The Lions' 2–1 home league victory over the Hammers on 14 May 1979 ended a run of ten games without a win against their rivals, which stretched over 46 years, back to 1933. Pop Robson had given West Ham a half-time lead, but second half goals from Dave Mehmet and Nicky Chatterton gave Millwall the win. A 2–1 victory in the Full Members Cup on 10 November 1987 gave Millwall their first win at Upton Park in 73 years. Alan Dickens gave the Hammers the lead in the second half, but two goals in three minutes from Teddy Sheringham and Tony Cascarino assured Millwall of their first away win in the derby since 1914. [tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], it stands as the Lions last away win in the fixture.

In 1988 Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion, joining West Ham in the First Division for the first time in the club's history.Lindsay, p. 29 Paul Ince scored the only goal at The Den on 3 December 1988, as West Ham won the game 1–0. They also won 3–0 at home on 22 April 1989, with goals from Julian Dicks, George Parris and Alan Dickens. This is the first and only time either side has completed a Football League double over the other. At the end of the season West Ham finished 19th and were relegated. Millwall finished 10th, the highest league finish in their history. The 1988–89 season is the only season both teams have been in the top division of English football. Millwall were relegated from the First Division in the 1989–90 season, the last time they appeared in the top tier.Lindsay, p. 310 During the foundation of the Premier League in 1992, the two teams competed the tier below in the newly formed First Division.

In the 1993–94 season, Millwall moved into the first purpose-built all-seater stadium, after the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Hammers were promoted, spending ten seasons in the Premier League and it was twelve years until they played at Millwall's new ground, The New Den. On Mothering Sunday, 24 March 2004, Millwall beat West Ham 4–1, with two goals from Tim Cahill, one from Nick Chadwick and a Christian Dailly own goal. Marlon Harewood scored the West Ham goal. This is the largest winning margin between the sides in the Football League.Lindsay and Tarrant, p. 470 In an eventful game, Millwall missed one penalty and had another saved by West Ham goalkeeper Stephen Bywater, who was subsequently sent off.
