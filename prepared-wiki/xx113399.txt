[[Dz13]]

CATEGORIES: Experimental medical treatments

Dz13 is an experimental treatment developed by scientists at the University of New South Wales. The drug aims to combat a range of illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Trials of DZ13 were temporarily suspended by UNSW in July 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=UNSW response to ABC 730 story|url=http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/general/unsw-response-abc-730-story|publisher=UNSW Newsroom|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl]http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2013/s3823977.htm

==Mechanism of action==

Dz13 is a DNAzyme that targets c-Jun, a transcription factor found in diseased blood vessels, eyes, lungs and joints. The treatment works by destroying RNA, essentially inhibiting c-Jun expression in cells. The potential of Dz13 as a therapeutic derives from the fact that inactivation of c-Jun can have an effect on downstream genes such as MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF and FGF-2.

==Effects==

Dz13 has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and angiogenesis. Anti-cancer effects have been demonstrated in models of prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma.
Clinical trials of Dz13 in patients with skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) commenced in 2010.
