Back to the roots (aka Spurensuche) is an Austrian exchange program. A group of fifteen young Israelis who have Austrian family roots are invited to Austria and together with fifteen young local Austrians do genealogical research about their ancestors and sometimes travel to the places where those ancestors lived.
Even though the emphasis lies on finding out information about the families of the visiting Israelis, another aim of this project is to develop Austrian-Israeli friendships and diplomacy. This includes sightseeing of cities as well as several free days, in which the young people can decide on their own what they wish to do.
This program enables the Israelis to develop their own and individual relationship to Austria and also help all the participants to regard Austria respectively from the view of "the other one".
