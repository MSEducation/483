[[Mesomeric effect]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical bonding

The mesomeric effect or resonance effect in chemistry is a property of substituents or functional groups in a chemical compound. The effect is used in a qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties of substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the letter M. The mesomeric effect is negative (-M) when the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group and the effect is positive (+M) when based on resonance and the substituent is an electron releasing group.
The net electron flow from or to the substituent is determined also by the inductive effect. The mesomeric effect as a result of p-orbital overlap (resonance) has absolutely no effect on this inductive effect, as the inductive effect is purely to do with the electronegativity of the atoms and their topology in the molecule (which atoms are connected to which).
The concepts of mesomeric effect, mesomerism and mesomer were introduced by Ingold in 1938 as an alternative to the Pauling's synonymous concept of resonance.[tpl]cite journal|title=If It's Resonance, What Is Resonating? |last=Kerber |first=Robert C. |journal=J.

==Mesomerism in conjugated systems==

Mesomeric effect can be transmitted along any number of carbon atoms in a conjugated system. This accounts for the resonance stabilization of the molecule due to delocalization of charge.
It may noted that the energy of the actual structure of the molecule i.e. resonance hybrid is lower than that of any of the resonating structures. The difference in energy between the actual structure and the most stable of the resonating structure is called resonance energy or resonance stabilisation energy.
