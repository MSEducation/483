==Early life==

Princess Marina was born in Athens, Greece, on 13 December 1906. Her father was Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, the third son of George I of Greece. Her mother was Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, a granddaughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She was the youngest of the couple's children.[tpl]cite news|title=Marina, a tragic but well-loved Princess|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BLIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3140,8817486&dq=princess+marina&hl=en|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 August 1968|location=London[/tpl] One of her paternal uncles was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
She was baptised near the end of 1906, and her godparents were: the King of Greece (her paternal grandfather); the King of the United Kingdom (her great-uncle); the Princess of Wales; Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (her paternal uncle); Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia (her maternal uncle); and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (her maternal aunt).Yvonne's Royalty Home Page — Royal Christenings
The family was generally poor and forced into exile when she was 11, following the overthrow of the Greek monarchy. They later moved to Paris, while the Princess stayed throughout Europe with her extended family.

Together the couple had three children:
The Duke of Kent was killed on 25 August 1942, in an aeroplane crash at Eagles Rock, near Dunbeath, Caithness, Scotland, while on active service with the Royal Air Force. The Duchess, according to royal biographer Hugo Vickers, was "the only war widow in Britain whose estate was forced to pay
death duties".Hugo Vickers, Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, Hutchinson, 2005, p. 230
During World War II, the Duchess was trained as a nurse for three months under pseudonym "Sister Kay" and joined the civil nurse reserve.

==Later life and death==

After her husband's death, the Duchess of Kent continued to be an active member of the British Royal Family, carrying out a wide range of royal and official engagements.[tpl]cite news|title=Marina won Britain's heart|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ARo-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=WUoMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3482,3001558&dq=princess+alexandra&hl=en|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Evening Times|date=27 August 1968[/tpl] She was the president of the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for 26 years.

In March 1957 when the Gold Coast (later Ghana)—gained independence from Britain, the Duchess of Kent was appointed to represent the Queen at the celebrations. Fifty years later, at the 50th Anniversary of Ghana's Independence, it would be her son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, who would be appointed by the Queen to represent her.
In September 1966, when the British Protectorate of Bechuanaland became the new Republic of Botswana, the Princess was appointed again to represent the Queen at the celebrations. The main public hospital in Gaborone, the new Botswana's capital, is named "Princess Marina Hospital".
She served as the first Chancellor of the University of Kent at Canterbury from 1963 until her death from a brain tumour at Kensington Palace at 11.40 am on 27 August 1968, aged 61.
