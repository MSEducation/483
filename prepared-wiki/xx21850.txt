[[Finitely-generated abelian group]]

CATEGORIES: Abelian group theory, Fundamental theorems, Algebraic structures

In abstract algebra, an abelian group (G,+) is called finitely generated  if there exist finitely many elements x1,...,xs in G such that every x in G can be written in the form 
with integers n1,...,ns. In this case, we say that the set {x1,...,xs} is a generating set of G or that x1,...,xs generate G.
Clearly, every finite abelian group is finitely generated. The finitely generated abelian groups are of a rather simple structure and can be completely classified, as will be explained below.

==Examples==

==Classification==

The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups
(which is a special case of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain) can be stated two ways (analogously with principal ideal domains):

===Primary decomposition===

The primary decomposition formulation states that every finitely generated abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct sum of primary cyclic groups and infinite cyclic groups. A primary cyclic group is one whose order is a power of a prime. That is, every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form
where the rank n â‰¥ 0, and the numbers q1,...,qt are powers of (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. In particular, G is finite if and only if n = 0.  The values of n, q1,...,qt are (up to rearranging the indices) uniquely determined by G.

===Invariant factor decomposition===

We can also write any finitely generated abelian group G as a direct sum of the form
where k1 divides k2, which divides k3 and so on up to ku.  Again, the rank n and the invariant factors k1,...,ku are uniquely determined by G (here with a unique order).

===Equivalence===

==Corollaries==

Stated differently the fundamental theorem says that a finitely-generated abelian group is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and a finite abelian group, each of those being unique up to isomorphism. The finite abelian group is just the torsion subgroup of G. The rank of G is defined as the rank of the torsion-free part of G; this is just the number n in the above formulas.
Every subgroup and factor group of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated abelian. The finitely generated abelian groups, together with the group homomorphisms, form an abelian category which is a Serre subcategory of the category of abelian groups.
