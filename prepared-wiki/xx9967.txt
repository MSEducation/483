Reptiles generally reproduce sexually, though some are capable of asexual reproduction. All reproductive activity occurs through the cloaca, the single exit/entrance at the base of the tail where waste is also eliminated. Most reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis, while squamates, including snakes and lizards, possess a pair of hemipenes, only one of which is typically used in each session. Tuatara, however, lack copulatory organs, and so the male and female simply press their cloacas together as the male discharges sperm.Lutz, Dick (2005), Tuatara: A Living Fossil, Salem, Oregon: DIMI PRESS, ISBN 0-931625-43-2
Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, but it is flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the inside and outside of the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies: some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs,[tpl]cite journal |last=Piñeiro |first=G. |coauthors=Ferigolo, J.; Meneghel, M.; and Laurin, M. |year=2012 |title=The oldest known amniotic embryos suggest viviparity in mesosaurs |journal=Historical Biology |volume=in press |doi=10.1080/08912963.2012.662230 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08912963.2012.662230[/tpl] although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.
Asexual reproduction has been identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.
Parthenogenetic species are suspected to occur among chameleons, agamids, xantusiids, and typhlopids.
Some reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TDSD), in which the incubation temperature determines whether a particular egg hatches as male or female. TDSD is most common in turtles and crocodiles, but also occurs in lizards and tuatara.[tpl]cite book |title=FireFly Encyclopedia Of Reptiles And Amphibians |year=2008 |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Richmond Hill, Ontario |isbn=978-1-55407-366-5 |pages=117–118 [/tpl] To date, there has been no confirmation of whether TDSD occurs in snakes.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lc5Bg-hmsBYC&lpg=PA101&dq=temperature%20dependent%20sex%20determination%20snake&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q=temperature%20dependent%20sex%20determination%20snake |title=The genetics and biology of sex ... - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2010-03-16|isbn=978-0-470-84346-8|year=2002|author1=Chadwick|first1=Derek|last2=Goode|first2=Jamie[/tpl]

==Defense mechanisms==

Many small reptiles, such as snakes and lizards that live on the ground or in the water, are vulnerable to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals. Thus avoidance is the most common form of defense in reptiles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498684/reptile/38450/Behaviour |title=reptile (animal) :: Behaviour|publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl away into the undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight.

===Camouflage===

Reptiles tend to avoid confrontation through camouflage. Two major groups of reptile predators are birds and other reptiles, both of which have well developed colour vision. Thus the skins of many reptiles are plain or mottled gray, green, and brown to allow them to blend into the background of their natural environment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teachervision.fen.com/animal-behavior/resource/8700.html |title=Reptile and Amphibian Defense Systems|publisher=Teachervision.fen.com |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl]
If the danger arises so suddenly that flight is useless, then crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an enemy. Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate the tip of the tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow beads.

===Alternative defense in snakes===

Camouflage will not always fool a predator. When caught out, snake species will adopt different defensive tactics and use a complicated set of behaviors when attacked. Some will first elevate their head and spread out the skin of their neck in an effort to look large and threatening. Failure of this strategy may lead to other measures practiced particularly by cobras, vipers, and closely related species, who use venom to attack. The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs from a venom gland. Some non-venomous snakes, such as the American corn snake or European grass snake, play dead when in danger.

===[tpl]anchor|Defense in crocodiles[/tpl]Defense in crocodilians===

When a crocodilian is concerned about its safety, it will gape to expose the teeth and yellow tongue. If this doesn't work, the crocodilian gets a little more agitated and typically begins to make hissing sounds. After this, the crocodilian will start to change its posture dramatically to make itself look more intimidating. The body is inflated to increase apparent size. If absolutely necessary it may decide to attack an enemy.
Some species try to bite immediately. Some will use their heads as sledgehammers and literally smash an opponent, some will rush or swim toward the threat from a distance, even chasing the opponent onto land or galloping after it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://animal.discovery.com/convergence/safari/crocs/expert/expert6.html |title=Animal Planet :: Ferocious Crocs |publisher=Animal.discovery.com |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] The main weapon in all crocodiles is the bite, which can generate very high bite force. Many species also possess canine-like teeth. These are used primarily for seizing prey, but are also used in fighting and display.[tpl]cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Gregory M.|coauthors=Gignac, Paul M.; Steppan, Scott J.; Lappin, A.

===Shedding and regenerating tails===

Geckos, skinks, and other lizards that are captured by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The animal can partially regenerate its tail over a period of weeks. The new section will contain cartilage rather than bone, and the skin may be distinctly discolored compared to the rest of the body. The tails are often a separate and dramatically more intense color than the rest of the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first.
