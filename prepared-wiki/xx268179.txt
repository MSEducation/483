Kentucky Motor Speedway is a 3/8-mile short track located in Whitesville, Kentucky. The track was built in 1960, with an infield figure 8 crossover added in 1981. Several NASCAR greats, including Darrell Waltrip, Michael Waltrip, and Jeremy Mayfield, got their start in racing at the speedway.  The facility was idle from 2005â€“2008 due to bankruptcy issues before officially reopening on April 19, 2009.
