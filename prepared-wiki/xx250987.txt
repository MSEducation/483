MeHayom LeMahar ([tpl]lang-he|מהיום למחר[/tpl] lit. From today to tomorrow) is an Israeli current affairs news show, broadcast since 1994 on Channel 1, half an hour before midnight.
The show presents the daily news and current affairs from varied point of views and in a serene form. The program begins with a news flash segment that summarizes the daily news events (accompanied with the Israeli Sign Language for people with Hearing impairments), and thereafter, the program focuses on one or two main news events of the day, accompanied with a commentary of an expert in that field. 
The host of the show, since it was created, has always been David Witzthum, and one that was considered a news and culture analyst legend, Emanuel Halperin, who retired in 2003. Occasionally, Anat Sharen hosts the show as the host's stand-in. 
The show and its hosts became a culture and news analysis icons.
