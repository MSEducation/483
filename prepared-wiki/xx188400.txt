Valaste Waterfall ([tpl]lang-et|Valaste juga[/tpl]) is the highest waterfall in Estonia and neighboring regions (30.5 m)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.envir.ee/klint/eng/8.html |title=North Estonian Klint Regional Site |date= |accessdate=2009-06-17[/tpl] situated between Ontika and Valaste in the Kohtla Parish of the Ida-Viru County and formed by a stream as it flows over the Baltic Klint not far from the shore of the Gulf of Finland. It is a popular tourist attraction with its spray freezing up spectacularly in winter.
There is a parking lot, some explanatory signs, and a very well made trail using a double spiral staircase to get down the cliff. Opposite the waterfall a viewing platform has been built for tourists, and this offers spectacular views of the falls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ida-virumaa.ee/index.php?section=1&sub=3&tab=blocks/attractions.php&lang=fin&mode=11 |title=Ida-Virumaa Online - Valaste waterfall |date= |accessdate=2009-06-17[/tpl]
