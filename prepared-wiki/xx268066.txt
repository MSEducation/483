One Month to Live, also called 1 Month 2 Live, was a 5-issue limited series comic book produced by Marvel Comics on a weekly basis in 2010.  It was written by Rick Remender in collaboration with Stuart Moore, John Ostrander, and Rob Williams.  The original concept was devised by Marvel editor Steve Wacker with the premise "What would you do with one month to change the world?" The storyline centers on a protagonist with terminal cancer, in response to Wacker's aunt having been diagnosed with cancer.This Week In Spandex – One Month To Live #1 at SciFiPulse.net, by Nicholas Yanes; published September 7, 2010; retrieved September 23, 2011
The four writers found the experience of writing the story to be especially poignant, as all had personal experiences with cancer—in particular, Remender, whose father survived a bout with cancer in 2008, and Ostrander, whose wife Kim Yale died of cancer in 1997.Marvel Comics gives a superhero cancer in 'One Month to Live', from USA Today; by Brian Truitt; published September 1, 2010; retrieved September 23, 2011

==Critical response==

USA Today called the story "nuanced and moving".  IGN described it as "one of the most human stories that Marvel has published in a long time", and commended Marvel for not devising "some magical cure for Dennis' cancer";Heroic Age: 1 Month 2 Live #5 Review: And so ends the story of Dennis Sykes at IGN, by Dan Iverson; published September 29, 2010; retrieved September 23, 2011 however, Comic Book Resources stated that it was "ambitious but flawed".The Buy Pile, at Comic Book Resources, by Hannibal Tabu; published September 30, 2010; retrieved September 23 2011
