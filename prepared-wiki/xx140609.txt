"Mad About You" is a pop song written by Paula Jean Brown, James Whelan and Mitchel Young Evans, produced by Michael Lloyd, for Belinda Carlisle's debut solo album Belinda. It was released as the album's first single, in 1986, as a CD single (one of the first ever marketed), 7" single and a 12" single. It was her first hit after leaving the Go-Go's, peaking at number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the Canadian Singles Chart.
The year that the song was released, Carlisle married Morgan Mason, who appears with Belinda in the video for "Mad About You". The guitar solo on the song was performed by Andy Taylor (of Duran Duran), who also appears in the video.
Paula Jean Brown (who took Jane Wiedlin's spot in the band just before it broke up) co-wrote the song with Jim Whelan, and Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey sang back-up vocals. "Mad About You" was one of a very few songs that were being considered to be on the fourth (unrecorded) Go-Go's album. The Go-Go's split and "Mad About You" and two other songs co-written by Paula Jean Brown wound up on Belinda instead.
The single's B-side, "I Never Wanted a Rich Man", was also featured on Carlisle's first long playing work (it closed Side 1 on the vinyl edition). The extended version of "Mad About You", originally on the A-side of the 12" single, was then included on the album compact disc re-release by Virgin in 2003.
