Sinterklaas sɪntər'klaːs or Sint Nicolaas 'nikolaːs Nikolaas2.ogg}} is a traditional winter holiday figure based on Saint Nicholas. Other names for the figure include De Sint ("The Saint"), De Goedheiligman ("The Good Holy Man"), and De Goede Sint ("The Good Saint") in Dutch; Saint-Nicolas in French; and Kleeschen and Zinniklos in Luxemburgish.
Sinterklaas is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on Saint Nicholas' eve (5 December) in the Netherlands and on the morning of 6 December, the feast of Saint Nicholas, in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine and Artois). He is also well known in territories of the former Dutch Empire, including Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Indonesia, and Suriname.
He is one of the sources of the holiday figure of Santa Claus.[tpl]cite book|last=Clark|first=Cindy Dell|title=Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HQNz-JLYOWkC&pg=PA25|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=1998-11-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226107783|pages=26–[/tpl]

===Sinterklaas===

Sinterklaas is an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or chasuble over a traditional white bishop's alb and sometimes red stola, dons a red mitre and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured crosier, a long ceremonial shepherd's staff with a fancy curled top.
He traditionally rides a white horse. In the Netherlands, the horse is called Amerigo, and in Belgium, it is named Slecht Weer Vandaag, meaning "Bad Weather Today".[tpl]cite book|last=|first=|title=Encyclopedia of Observances, Holidays and Celebrations from MobileReference|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5VhTa1Eiq7oC|accessdate=8 February 2014|date=1 January 2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=|pages=[/tpl]
Sinterklaas carries a big book that tells whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year.

===Zwarte Piet===

A Zwarte Piet (Black Pete, plural Zwarte Pieten) is a companion of Sinterklaas, usually portrayed by an adolescent in blackface with black curly hair, dressed up like a 17th-century page in a colourful dress, often with a lace collar, and donning a feathered cap.
Sinterklaas and his Black Pete usually carry a bag which contains candy for nice children and a roe, a chimney sweep's broom made of willow branches, used to spank naughty children. Some of the older Sinterklaas songs make mention of naughty children being put in the bag and being taken back to Spain. The Zwarte Pieten toss candy around, a tradition supposedly originating in Sint Nicolaas' story of saving three young girls from prostitution by tossing golden coins through their window at night to pay their dowry. In recent years the roe has been absent to adapt to modern times.
There are various explanations of the origins of the helpers. The oldest explanation is that the helpers symbolize the two ravens Huginn and Muninn who informed Odin on what was going on. In later stories the helper depicts the defeated devil. The devil is defeated by either Odin or his helper Nörwi, the black father of the night. Nörwi is usually depicted with the same staff of birch ("roe") as Zwarte Piet. Another, more modern story is that Saint Nicolas liberated an Ethiopian slave boy called 'Piter' (from Saint Peter) from a Myra market, and the boy was so grateful he decided to stay with Saint Nicolas as a helper.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
The Zwarte Pieten have roughly the same relationship to the Dutch Saint Nicolas that the elves have to America's Santa Claus. According to tradition, the saint has a Piet for every function: there is a head piet (Hoofdpiet), navigation Pieten (wegwijspiet) to navigate the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands, packing Pieten (pakjespiet) to pack all the gifts, acrobatic Pieten to climb roofs and stuff presents down the chimney, or to climb down the chimneys themselves. Over the years many stories have been added, but over the years, Zwarte Piet developed from a rather unintelligent assistant into a full assistant of the absent-minded Sint.nos.nl; Wie is die Zwarte Piet eigenlijk?, 23 October 2013
Traditionally their faces are blackened because Zwarte Piet is a Spanish (Moorish) servant of Sinterklaas (though some people said Zwarte Piet was originally a slave who, when Sinterklaas bought him his freedom, was so grateful that he stayed to assist him). Today, sometimes the more politically correct explanation that Pete's face is "black from soot" (as Pete has to climb through chimneys to deliver his gifts) is used. With the influx of immigrants to the Netherlands starting in the late 1950s, Zwarte Piet is felt by some to be racist.Expatica.com.; Annual Zwarte Piet debate. Retrieved 7 December 2007. Verene Shepherd, chair of United Nations' Working Group on people of African descent, stated in an interview with the Dutch television news program EEN Vandaag on 22 October 2013 that, "The working group cannot understand why it is that the people in The Netherlands cannot see that it is a throwback to slavery .. as a black person I feel, that I, if I were living in The Netherlands, I would object to it". The working group started investigations in 2012 and sent questions to the Dutch UN representative in January 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eenvandaag.nl/binnenland/47551/_zwarte_piet_terugkeer_naar_slavernij_en_moet_stoppen_ |title=Black Pete throwback to slavery and must stop (article in dutch) |publisher=eenvandaag.nl |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013[/tpl] However, after a more thorough investigation it was announced that the UN would drop any 'racism' related charges against the Dutch.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/10402662/UN-drops-Black-Pete-racism-charge-against-the-Dutch.html |title= UN drops Black Pete 'racism' charge against the Dutch |publisher=Telegraph UK |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl]

===Arrival from Spain===

Sinterklaas traditionally arrives in the Netherlands each year in mid-November (usually on a Saturday) by steamboat from Spain. He then parades through the streets on his horse, welcomed by children cheering and singing traditional Sinterklaas songs.[ref]
