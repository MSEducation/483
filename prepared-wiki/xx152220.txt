Ralph Anthony Hill (December 26, 1908, Klamath Falls, Oregon - October 17, 1994) was an American long distance runner.
Hill studied at the University of Oregon when competing in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles on the 5000 m. In an exciting race on Aug 5 1932, he came in second behind Lauri Lehtinen, with each runner recording a time of 14.30,0. The judges deliberated for an hour before they could decide not to disqualify Lehtinen, as he had appeared to block Hill twice. Hill refused to file a protest, stating that he believed Lehtinen's obstruction of him was accidental. Lauri Virtanen came in third 14 seconds behind.
After college Hill made a career of farming near Klamath Falls. The local Henley High School renamed its football field in September 1992 after its alumnus Hill.
