The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, (also known as AEDPA) is an act of Congress signed into law on April 24, 1996. The bill was introduced by former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, passed with broad bipartisan support by Congress (91-8-1 in the United States Senate, 293-133-7 in the House of Representatives) following the 1990s World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=7480|title=Dark Justice| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2009-06-28|publisher=Criminal Brief[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/(S(0cpgj055wpob3yqvjos2ua55))/displayArticle.aspx?articleid=21054|title=A Tale of Two Justice Systems|last=Holland|first=Joshua|date=2009-04-01|work=AlterNet|publisher=Prison Legal News|accessdate=2009-06-29[/tpl]

==Habeas corpus==

The AEDPA had a tremendous impact on the law of habeas corpus in the United States. One provision of the AEDPA limits the power of federal judges to grant relief[tpl]cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=The Crime of Capital Punishment| url=http://sleuthsayers.blogspot.com/2011/10/crime-of-capital-punishment.html |work=Death Penalty| publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando |date=2011-10-02[/tpl] unless the state court's adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was 
In addition to the modifications that pertain to all habeas cases, AEDPA enacted special review provisions for capital cases from states that enacted quality controls for the performance of counsel in the state courts in the post-conviction phase.  States that enacted these quality controls would see strict time limitations enforced against their death-row inmates in federal habeas proceedings coupled with extremely deferential review to the determinations of their courts regarding issues of federal law.  Only Arizona has qualified for these additional provisions yet, but it has not been able to take advantage of them because it has not followed its own quality control procedures.  More states may qualify for these additional provisions in the future because in 2005 Congress took the power to determine whether a state had qualified away from the federal courts and gave it to the Attorney General.
Other provisions of the AEDPA created entirely new statutory law. For example, before AEDPA the judicially created abuse-of-the-writ doctrine restricted the presentation of new claims through subsequent habeas petitions.  The AEDPA replaced this doctrine with an absolute bar on second or successive petitions.  Petitioners who attempted to bring claims in federal habeas proceedings that have already been decided in a previous habeas petition would find those claims barred.  Additionally, petitioners who had already filed a federal habeas petition were required to first secure authorization from the appropriate federal court of appeals.  Furthermore, AEDPA took away from the Supreme Court the power to review a court of appeals's denial of that permission, thus placing final authority for the filing of second petitions in the hands of the federal courts of appeals.

==History==

The bill was introduced by former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, passed with broad bipartisan support by Congress (91-8-1 in the United States Senate, 293-133-7 in the House of Representatives) following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on April 24, 1996.
Soon after it was enacted, AEDPA endured a critical test in the Supreme Court.  The basis of the challenge was that the provisions limiting the ability of persons to file successive habeas petitions violated  Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the US Constitution, the Suspension Clause.  The Supreme Court held unanimously in Felker v. Turpin, [tpl]ussc|518|651|1997[/tpl], that these limitations did not unconstitutionally suspend the writ.
In 2005, the United States Ninth Circuit indicated that it was willing to consider a challenge to the constitutionality of AEDPA on separation of powers grounds under City of Boerne v. Flores and Marbury v. Madison,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2005/05/is-aedpa-unconstitutional/|title=Is AEDPA unconstitutional?|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=2005-05-05|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=2011-04-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110320202716/http://www.scotusblog.com/2005/05/is-aedpa-unconstitutional/| archivedate= 20 March 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] but has since decided that the issue had been settled by circuit precedent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/summary/opinion/us-9th-circuit/2007/03/06/148143.html|title=Irons v.

==Reception==

While the act has several titles and provisions, the majority of criticism stems from the act's tightening of habeas corpus laws. Those in favor of the bill say that the act prevents those convicted of crimes from "thwarting justice and avoiding just punishment by filing frivolous appeals for years on end,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1996-04-17/pdf/CREC-1996-04-17-pt1-PgS3454.pdf|title=Congressional Record for April 17, 1996, page S3476|date=1996-04-17|accessdate=2011-04-25[/tpl] while critics argue that the inability to make multiple appeals increases the risk of an innocent person being killed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/ncadp/news.jsp?news_item_KEY=3258|title=Witnesses Recant; Law Stymies Death Row Appeal|last=Rankin|first=Bill|last2=Judd|first2=Alan|date=2003-09-21|work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|publisher=National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty|accessdate=2011-04-25[/tpl]
