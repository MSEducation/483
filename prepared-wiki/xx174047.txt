The song is about a phone call received from a former girlfriend with whom the narrator has broken up. In an interview with CMT, he said that he wrote the song from an experience he had with a former girlfriend who had moved to India. He said that after breaking up with her, writing "What Do You Want" helped him "climb out of the funk".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1651646/jerrod-niemann-reveals-his-sensitive-side-in-what-do-you-want.jhtml|title=Jerrod Niemann Reveals His Sensitive Side in "What Do You Want"|last=Parton|first=Chris|date=November 5, 2010|work=CMT|accessdate=December 27, 2010[/tpl]

Karlie Justus of The 9513 gave the song a "thumbs up" in her review. She said that the song "relies on emotion over production" and thought that the lyrics and production had "oddly comforting repetition".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the9513.com/jerrod-niemann-what-do-you-want/|title=Jerrod Niemann — "What Do You Want"|last=Justus|first=Karlie|date=September 23, 2010|work=The 9513|accessdate=December 27, 2010[/tpl] Roughstock critic Matt Bjorke rated the song four stars out of five, calling it a "moody, emotive piece of music" and thought that it showed Niemann's voice more strongly than "Lover, Lover" did.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/jerrod-niemann-what-do-you-want-|title="What Do You Want" review|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|date=September 24, 2010|work=Roughstock|accessdate=December 27, 2010[/tpl]
