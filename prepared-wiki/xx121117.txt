CATEGORIES: DeLeonist organizations, Syndicalism, Socialist Labor Party of America

Socialist Industrial Unions (SIU) are a form of trade unions proposed by Daniel De Leon in the late 1890s / early 1900s as a means of engaging in class struggle within capitalism, of carrying out a revolution and of organizing socialism when it is achieved. This program is still advocated by De Leon's political party, the US Socialist Labor Party.
