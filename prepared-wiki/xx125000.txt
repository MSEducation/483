The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is a non-profit health organization based in Anchorage, Alaska which provides health services to about 130,000 Alaska Natives and American Indians in Alaska. Established in 1997, ANTHC is owned and managed by Alaska Native tribal governments and their regional health organizations.
ANTHC is co-manager, with the Southcentral Foundation, of the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC), a 150-bed facility in Anchorage with a staff including more than 250 physicians and 700 nurses.  ANMC is Alaska's only level II trauma center, the highest level that can be achieved in Alaska. It has received Magnet Status for nursing excellence, a designation achieved by only about 1 percent of all hospitals nationwide. It is the only tribally operated hospital with Magnet Status in the United States. ANMC opened in its current facility in May 1997.
In 1998, ANTHC launched the Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network (AFHCAN) to provide primary and specialty telehealth services to Alaska Native communities.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=3932 |title=Telehealth Improves Access and Quality of Care for Alaska Natives |date=2013-05-22 | accessdate=2013-10-17[/tpl]
In 2003, ANTHC developed the Alaska Dental Health Aide Program to train dental therapists who could provide culturally appropriate education and routine dental services under the supervision of a dentist to high-risk residents of rural villages. These therapists now provide dedicated access to oral health care for more than 35,000 individuals, most of whom lived in communities that typically did not have a dedicated provider.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov/content.aspx?id=1840 |title=Dental Health Aide Program Improves Access to Oral Health Care for Rural Alaska Native People |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2013-05-22[/tpl]
