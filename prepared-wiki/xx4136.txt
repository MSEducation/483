==Historiography==

In recent decades there have been four main schools of historiography regarding India: Cambridge, Nationalist, Marxist, and subaltern.  The once common  "Orientalist" approach, with its the image of a sensuous, inscrutable, and wholly spiritual India, has died out in serious scholarship.Gyan Prakesh, "Writing Post-Orientalist Histories of the Third World: Perspectives from Indian Historiography" Comparative Studies in Society and History (1990), 32 : pp 383-408 [tpl]doi|10.1017/S0010417500016534[/tpl]
The "Cambridge School," led by Anil Seal,Anil Seal, The Emergence of Indian Nationalism: Competition and Collaboration in the Later Nineteenth Century (1971) Gordon Johnson,Gordon Johnson, Provincial Politics and Indian Nationalism: Bombay and the Indian National Congress 1880-1915 (2005) Richard Gordon, and David A. Washbrook,Rosalind O'Hanlon and David Washbrook, eds. Religious Cultures in Early Modern India: New Perspectives (2011) downplays ideology.Aravind Ganachari, "Studies in Indian Historiography: 'The Cambridge School,'" Indica, March 2010, 47#1, pp 70-93
The Nationalist school has focused on Congress, Gandhi, Nehru and high level politics. It highlighted the Mutiny of 1857 as a war of liberation, and Gandhi's 'Quit India' begun in 1942, as defining historical events. More recently, Hindu nationalists have created a version of history for the schools to support their demands for "Hindutva" ("Hinduness") in Indian society.Latha Menon, "Coming to Terms with the Past: India," History Today, Aug 2004, 54#8 pp 28-30
The Marxists have focused on studies of economic development, landownership, and class conflict in precolonial India and of deindustrialization during the colonial period.  The Marxists portrayed Gandhi's movement as a device for the bourgeois elite to harness popular, potentially revolutionary forces for its own ends.Amiya Kumar Bagchi, "Writing Indian History in the Marxist Mode in a Post-Soviet World," Indian Historical Review, Jan 1993, Vol. 20 Issue 1/2, pp 229-244,
The "subaltern school," was begun in the 1980s by Ranajit Guha and Gyan Prakash.Gyan Prakash, "Subaltern studies as postcolonial criticism," American Historical Review, Dec 1994, 99#5 pp 1475-1500 It focuses attention away from the elites and politicians to "history from below," looking at the peasants using folklore, poetry, riddles, proverbs, songs, oral history and methods inspired by anthropology. It focuses on the colonial era before 1947 and typically emphasizes caste and downplays class, to the annoyance of the Marxist school.John Roosa, "When the Subaltern Took the Postcolonial Turn," Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, 2006, Vol. 17 Issue 2, pp 130-147
