[[Modal matrix]]

CATEGORIES: Matrices

In linear algebra, the modal matrix is used in the diagonalization process involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Assume a linear system of the following form:
where X is n×1, A is n×n, and B is n×1.  X typically represents the state vector, and U the system input.
Specifically the modal matrix M is the n×n matrix formed with the eigenvectors of A as columns in M.  It is utilized in 
where D is an n×n diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal of D and zeros elsewhere.  (note the eigenvalues should appear left→right top→bottom in the same order as its eigenvectors are arranged left→right into M)
Note that the modal matrix M provides the conjugation to make A and D similar matrices.
