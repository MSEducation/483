[[Return specialist]]

CATEGORIES: American football positions

A Return Specialist is a player on American football or Canadian football special teams who specializes in returning punts and kickoff returns. There are few players who are exclusively return specialists; most play other positions as well.  The special teams counterpart of a return specialist is a kicking specialist.
According to 2012 College Football All-America Team selection Venric Mark: "Returning punts is harder," Mark said. "You have to judge the ball more, you have to know when to fair catch and when not to. You can't be a superhero and try to catch everything. With kick returns, you catch the ball and — boom — you're going."[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-24/sports/ct-spt-0825-northwestern-football--20100824_1_receiver-arby-fields-jordan-mabin|title=Northwestern's Mark attracting notice: Freshman likely to get nod returning kickoffs and will get shot at punts|accessdate=2012-12-11|date=2010-08-24|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Greenstein, Teddy[/tpl]
