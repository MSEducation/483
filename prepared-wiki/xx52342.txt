==History==

King George lll issued a land  grant of approximately 1350 acres to five foreign protestant  settlers, Leonard Hirtle, John Mossman, Peter Knack, Christian Hartman and John Kayser on July 5, 1787.Book 5,#53,page 45, Registry of Deeds, Municipality District of Lunenburg
For many decades Kingsburg was mixed a fishing and farming community. By the mid twentieth century, with the widespread decline of small-scale Atlantic fishery, most fishing culture has disappeared. With little opportunity, the village's Foreign Protestant population collapsed and many of the buildings were abandoned and destroyed, leaving the village with only a few dozen full time inhabitants. Today it is a quaint little summer hamlet with about 25 houses occupied full time.

==Economy==

Housebuilding is active in the community, with the first wave of construction buying and restoring older houses. With the awe inspiring landscape inspiring creative designers and hard working tradesmen, new custom homes with beautiful views have been created for buyers. The evolution of Kingsburg into a vacation and retirement destination has had a positive impact on the population of this remote village. Today the area boasts a premium for house and land prices compared to nearby communities. A lot of new ground and roads have been opened for future development though about 80% of the houses are vacant during most of the year.
Much of the rural infrastructure for Upper and Lower Kingsburg is centered in Riverport, Nova Scotia. This includes Riverport Electric, the first municipal utility incorporated in Nova Scotia, the Riverport & District Fire Department, Riverport & District Community Center, Riverport Community School and Riverport Post Office. Rose Bay General Store offers a wide range of locally based goods and services. The best location for retail goods is Bridgewater, Nova Scotia and exceptional dining is available in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.

==Culture==

With the anchor of the ocean and the beaches in Kingsburg, the battle for future development and appreciation of natural landscape continues. One organizations in the community is the Kingsburg Coastal Conservancy (KCC). Their work has helped and hindered. They attempt to preserve traditional access to shorelines from construction, and the preservation of various properties in their natural state. Through their efforts major accomplishments of acquiring land at Gaff Point and West Iron Bound Island has occurred.Because of the KCC much of the land within the community is impossible to build on or even allow change to existing properties that is not owned by them and is privately owned.
