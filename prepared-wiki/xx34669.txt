Other emo-leaning punk bands soon followed suit, and the word "emo" began to shift from being vague and undefined to referring to a specific type of emotionally overbearing music that was romantic but distanced from the political nature of punk rock.Greenwald, pp. 31–32. Sunny Day Real Estate fell apart after Diary, as Enigk became a born-again Christian and launched a solo career while the other members drifted into new projects such as the Foo Fighters. They released three more albums through a series of breakups and occasional reunions, but are remembered primarily for the promise of their debut and the shift it engendered in the tastes of underground rock fans.Greenwald, p. 32. ""In many ways Sunny Day's brilliance was its zeitgeist-seizing debut, physically forcing a regime change in the hearts and minds of fans of underground rock."
Despite emo's reinvention in the 1990s, bands such as Policy of 3[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ebullition.com/catalog54.html |title=Ebullition Records Catalog: Policy of 3 |publisher=Ebullition[/tpl] and Hoover[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lurid-traversal-of-route-7-mw0000664186 |title=The Lurid Traversal of Route 7 - Hoover |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hoover-mn0000219446/biography |title=Hoover |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] retained the post-hardcore-oriented emo sound.

===Underground popularity: Mid-1990s===

In the mid-1990s the American punk and indie rock movements, which had been largely underground since the early 1980s, became part of mainstream culture. After Nirvana's success, major record labels capitalized on the popularity of alternative rock and other underground music by signing numerous independent bands and spending large amounts of capital promoting them.Greenwald, p. 33. In 1994, the same year that Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy and Sunny Day Real Estate's Diary were released, punk rock acts Green Day and The Offspring had multiplatinum successes with their respective albums Dookie and Smash. In the wake of the underground going mainstream, over the next several years emo as a genre retreated, reformed, and morphed into a national subculture, then eventually something more. Drawing inspiration from bands like Jawbreaker, Drive Like Jehu, and Fugazi, the new sound of emo was a mixture of hardcore's passion and indie rock's intelligence, bearing the anthemic power of punk rock and its do-it-yourself work ethic but with smoother songs, sloppier melodies, and yearning vocals.Greenwald, pp. 34–35.
Many of the new emo bands originated from the Midwestern and Central United States, such as Braid from Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Christie Front Drive from Denver, Colorado, Mineral from Austin, Texas, Jimmy Eat World from Mesa, Arizona, The Get Up Kids from Kansas City, Missouri, and The Promise Ring from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Greenwald, p. 34. According to Andy Greenwald, "This was the period when emo earned many, if not all, of the stereotypes that have lasted to this day: boy-driven, glasses-wearing, overly sensitive, overly brainy, chiming-guitar-driven college music."

On the east coast, New York City-based Texas Is the Reason bridged the gap between indie rock and emo in their brief three-year lifespan by melding the melodies of Sunny Day Real Estate to churning punk musicianship and singing directly to the listener.Greenwald, pp. 38–39. In New Jersey, Lifetime gained a reputation as a melodic hardcore act, playing shows in fans' basements.Greenwald, pp. 121–122. Their 1995 album Hello Bastards on rising independent label Jade Tree Records fused hardcore with emo's tunefulness, turning its back on cynicism and irony in favor of love songs. The album sold tens of thousands of copiesGreenwald, p. 122. and the band inspired a number of later New Jersey and Long Island emo acts such as Brand New, Glassjaw, Midtown,[tpl]cite web|last = Rashbaum|first = Alyssa|title = A Lifetime of Rock|url = http://www.spin.com/articles/lifetime-rock|publisher = Spin|date = 2006-03-24|accessdate = 2009-03-28[/tpl] The Movielife, My Chemical Romance, Saves the Day,Greenwald, p. 80. Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday, and Thursday.Greenwald, p. 152.
The Promise Ring were one of the premier bands of the new emo style. Their music took a slower, smoother, pop punk approach to hardcore riffs, blending them with singer Davey von Bohlen's goofy, picturesque lyrics delivered with a froggy croon and pronounced lisp, and they played shows in basements and VFW hallsGreenwald, pp. 35–36. Jade Tree released their debut 30° Everywhere in 1996 and it sold tens of thousands of copies, a blockbuster by independent standards.Greenwald, p. 36. Greenwald describes the effect of the album as "like being hit in the head with cotton candy."Greenwald, p. 37. Other bands such as Karate, The Van Pelt, Joan of Arc, and The Shyness Clinic incorporated elements of post-rock and noise rock into the emo sound.Greenwald, p. 40. The common lyrical thread between these bands was "applying big questions to small scenarios."

A cornerstone of mid-1990s emo was Weezer's 1996 album Pinkerton.[tpl]cite web|last = Edwards|first = Gavin|title = Review: Pinkerton|url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/weezer/albums/album/301487/review/6635729/pinkerton|publisher = Rolling Stone|date = 2001-12-09|accessdate = 2009-03-23[/tpl] Following the success of their multiplatinum debut, Pinkerton turned from their power pop sound to a much darker, more abrasive character.[tpl]cite web|last = Erlewine| first = Stephen|url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r241030|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title = Allmusic: Pinkerton: Overview|publisher = Allmusic|accessdate = 2007-09-21[/tpl]Greenwald, p. 50. Frontman Rivers Cuomo's songs were obsessed with messy, manipulative sex and his own insecurities of dealing with celebrity. A critical and commercial failure,[tpl]cite book|last =Luerssen|first = John D.|title =Rivers' Edge: The Weezer Story|publisher =ECW Press|year =2004|location =Toronto|isbn =1-55022-619-3|page =206[/tpl] it was ranked by Rolling Stone as the second-worst album of the year.Luerssen, p. 137. Cuomo retreated from the public eye, later referring to the album as "hideous" and "a hugely painful mistake".Luerssen, p. 348. However, Pinkerton found enduring appeal with teenagers just discovering alternative rock, who were drawn to its confessional lyrics and themes of rejection and came to believe that it was directed at them.Greenwald, p. 51. Sales grew steadily as word of the album passed between fans, over online messageboards, and via Napster. "Although no one was paying attention", says Greenwald, "perhaps because no one was paying attention—Pinkerton became the most important emo album of the decade."
When Weezer returned in 2000, however, they did so with a decidedly pop sound. Cuomo refused to play songs from Pinkerton, dismissing it as "ugly" and "embarrassing".Greenwald, p. 52. Nevertheless, the album held its appeal and eventually achieved both high sales and critical praise, and is noted for introducing emo to larger and more mainstream audiences.[tpl]cite web|last = Montgomery|first = James|title = The Argument: Weezer Are the Most Important Band of the Last 10 Years|url = http://www.mtv.com/bands/w/weezer/news_feature_102504/|publisher = MTV|date = 2004-10-25|accessdate = 2009-03-23[/tpl]

The emo aesthetic of the mid-1990s was embodied in Mineral, whose albums The Power of Failing (1997) and EndSerenading (1998) encapsulated the emo tropes of somber music accompanied by a shy narrator singing seriously about mundane problems.Greenwald, p. 41. Greenwald calls their song "If I Could" "the ultimate expression of mid-nineties emo. The song's short synopsis—she is beautiful, I am weak, dumb, and shy; I am alone but am surprisingly poetic when left alone—sums up everything that emo's adherents admired and its detractors detested." Another significant band of the era was Braid, whose 1998 album Frame and Canvas and B-side song "Forever Got Shorter" blurred the lines between band and listener, as the group was a mirror-image of its own audience in passion and sentiment and sang in the voice of their fans.Greenwald, pp. 46–48.

Though the emo style of the mid-1990s had thousands of young fans, it never broke into the national consciousness.Greenwald, p. 42. A few bands were offered contracts with major record labels, but most broke up before they could capitalize on the opportunity.Greenwald, pp. 45–46. Jimmy Eat World signed to Capitol Records in 1995 and built a following among the emo community with their album Static Prevails, but did not break into the mainstream despite their major-label association as their music was mostly lost amongst the popular ska movement of the period.Greenwald, pp. 99–101. The Promise Ring were the most commercially successful emo band of the time, with sales of their 1997 album Nothing Feels Good topping out in the mid-five figures. Greenwald calls the album "the pinnacle of its generation of emo: a convergence of pop and punk, of resignation and celebration, of the lure of girlfriends and the pull of friends, bandmates, and the road."Greenwald, p. 44. He refers to mid-1990s emo as "the last subculture made of vinyl and paper instead of plastic and megabytes."Greenwald, 48.

===Independent success: Late 1990s and early 2000s===

Beginning in the late 1990s emo had a surge of popularity in the realm of independent music, as a number of notable acts and record labels experienced successes that would lay the foundation for the style's later mainstream breakthrough. As emo gained a larger fanbase the music business began see its marketing potential, and as big business entered the picture many of the acts previously associated with the term intentionally distanced themselves from it:
In 1997 Deep Elm Records launched a series of compilation albums entitled The Emo Diaries, which continued until 2007 with eleven installments.[tpl]cite web|title = The Emo Diaries|publisher = Deep Elm Records|url = http://www.deepelm.com/bands/index_emo.html#anchor1|accessdate = 2009-03-27[/tpl] Featuring mostly unreleased music from unsigned bands, the series included acts such as Jimmy Eat World, Further Seems Forever, Samiam, and The Movielife. The diversity of bands and musical styles made the case for emo as more of a shared aesthetic than a genre, and the series helped to codify the term "emo" and spread it throughout the community of underground music.

Jimmy Eat World's 1999 album Clarity was one of the most significant emo albums of the late 1990s and became a touchstone for later emo bands.Greenwald, p. 101. Writing in 2003, Andy Greenwald called it "one of the most fiercely beloved rock 'n' roll records of the last decade. It is name-checked by every single contemporary emo band as their favorite album, as a mind-bending milemarker that proved that punk rock could be tuneful, emotional, wide-ranging, and ambitious." However, despite warm critical reception and promotion of the single "Lucky Denver Mint" in the Drew Barrymore comedy film Never Been Kissed, Clarity was commercially unsuccessful in a musical climate dominated by teen pop, and the band left major label Capitol Records the following year.Greenwald, pp. 103–104.[tpl]cite web|last = Vanderhoff|first = Mark|url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r396600|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Review: Clarity|publisher = Allmusic|accessdate = 2009-03-26[/tpl] Nevertheless, the album gained steady popularity via word-of-mouth and was treasured by fans, eventually selling over 70,000 copies.Greenwald, pp. 102–205. Jimmy Eat World self-financed the recording of their next album Bleed American (2001) before signing to Dreamworks Records. The album sold 30,000 copies in its first week and went gold shortly after. In 2002 it went platinum as emo broke into the mainstream.Greenwald, pp. 104–108.
Drive-Thru Records, founded in 1996, steadily built up a roster of primarily pop punk bands with emo characteristics such as Midtown, The Starting Line, The Movielife, and Something Corporate.Greenwald, pp. 126–132. Drive-Thru's partnership with major label MCA enabled their brand of emo-inflected pop to reach wider audiences.Greenwald, p. 127. The label's biggest early success was New Found Glory, whose 2000 eponymous album reached No. 107 on the Billboard 200[tpl]cite web| url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=new found glory|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History - New Found Glory: Albums|publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2009-03-31[/tpl] with the single "Hit or Miss" reaching No. 15 on Modern Rock Tracks.[tpl]cite web| url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=new found glory|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History - New Found Glory: Singles|publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2009-03-31[/tpl] Drive-Thru's unabashedly populist and capitalist approach to music allowed its bands' albums and merchandise to sell heavily through popular outlets such as Hot Topic:Greenwald, pp. 127–129.

Independent label Vagrant Records was behind several successful emo acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Get Up Kids had sold over 15,000 copies of their debut album Four Minute Mile (1997) before signing to Vagrant, who promoted the band aggressively and put them on tours opening for big-name acts like Green Day and Weezer.Greenwald, pp. 77–78. Their 1999 album Something to Write Home About was an independent success, reaching No. 31 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=294&cfgn=Albums&cfn=Heatseekers&ci=3035794&cdi=7505634&cid=10%2F23%2F1999 |title=Heatseekers: Something to Write Home About|publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2009-03-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Vagrant signed and released albums by a number of other emo and emo-related acts over the next two years, including The Anniversary, Reggie and the Full Effect, The New Amsterdams, Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional, Hey Mercedes, and Hot Rod Circuit.Greenwald, p. 79. Saves the Day had built a large following on the east coast and sold almost 50,000 copies of their second album Through Being Cool (1999) before signing to Vagrant and releasing Stay What You Are (2001), which sold 15,000 copies in its first week,Greenwald, p. 81. reached No. 100 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite web| url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=saves the day|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History - Saves the Day|publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2009-03-26[/tpl] and went on to sell over 200,000 copies.[tpl]cite web|last = Wilson|first = MacKenzie|url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p311722|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Saves the Day Biography|publisher = Allmusic|accessdate = 2009-03-26[/tpl]
In the summer of 2001 Vagrant organized a national tour featuring every band on the label, sponsored by corporations such as Microsoft and Coca-Cola. This populist approach and the use of the internet as a marketing tool helped Vagrant become one of the country's most successful independent labels and also helped to popularize the term "emo".Greenwald, pp. 81–88. According Greenwald, "More than any other event, it was Vagrant America that defined emo to masses—mainly because it had the gumption to hit the road and bring it to them."

===Mainstream popularity: 2000s===

Emo broke into the mainstream media in the summer of 2002 with a number of notable events:Greenwald, p. 68. Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American album went platinum on the strength of "The Middle", which reached No. 1 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart.[tpl]cite web| url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=jimmy eat world|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Jimmy Eat World singles chart history |publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2009-03-23[/tpl]Greenwald, p. 94.

Their 2004 release Guilt Show also had mainstream success as it peaked at No. 58 on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-get-up-kids-mn0000766078/awards |title=The Get Up Kids  Awards |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] During the success made by emo music at this time, many purists of emo music didn't accept bands such as The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World, The Promise Ring and Dashboard Confessional as emo, often referring to them as "mall emo".[tpl]cite web |url=http://thecabin.net/stories/072802/wor_0728020085.shtml |title='Emo' music getting noticed by mainstream |publisher=Martha Irvine |date=July 28, 2002[/tpl]
Saves the Day toured with Green Day, Blink-182, and Weezer, playing large arenas such as Madison Square Garden,Greenwald, p. 67. and by the end of the year had performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, appeared on the cover of Alternative Press, and had music videos for "At Your Funeral" and "Freakish" in heavy rotation on MTV2. Taking Back Sunday would release their debut album Tell All Your Friends through Victory Records in 2002. The album would give the band a taste of success inside the emo scene thanks to singles like "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)", and "You're So Last Summer". Although initially charting at #183 on the Billboard 200, Tell All Your Friends would eventually lead up to be certified gold by the RIAA in latter years and is now considered a landmark and one of the most influential albums in the emo scene. Articles on Vagrant Records were published in Time and Newsweek,Greenwald, p. 88. while the word "emo" began appearing on numerous magazine covers and became a catchall term for any music outside of mainstream pop.Greenwald, pp. 68–69. Andy Greenwald attributes emo's sudden explosion into the mainstream to media outlets looking for the "next big thing" in the wake of the September 11 attacks:
In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the style became a marketable product.Greenwald, pp. 140–141. Dreamworks Records senior A&R representative Luke Wood remarked that "The industry really does look at emo as the new raprock, or the new grunge. I don't think that anyone is listening to the music that's being made—they're thinking of how they're going to take advantage of the sound's popularity at retail."Greenwald, p. 142. The depoliticized nature of emo, coupled with its catchy music and accessible themes, gave it a broad appeal to young mainstream audiences. Emo staple band Taking Back Sunday would continue to find major success in the years that followed, with their 2004 album Where You Want To Be charting at #3 in the Billboard 200, with the second single of the album "This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know)" being featured in the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack, and their 2006 album Louder Now, with Louder Now being the band's breakout into the mainstream and charting at #2 in the Billboard 200, notably because of the popularity of its lead single "MakeDamnSure", both albums would be certified gold by the RIAA with Where You Want To Be having sold 667,000 copies as of September 2005, and Louder Now having sold over 900,000 copies as of June 9, 2008.
At the same time, a darker, more aggressive offshoot of emo gained popularity. New Jersey–based Thursday signed a multi-million-dollar, multialbum contract with Island Def Jam on the strength of their 2001 album Full Collapse, which reached No. 178 on the Billboard 200.Greenwald, pp. 149–150. Their music differed from the prominent emo bands of the time in that it was more politicized and lacked dominant pop hooks and anthems, drawing influence from more maudlin bands such as The Smiths, Joy Division, and The Cure. However, the band's accessibility, openness, basement-show roots, and touring alongside bands like Saves the Day made them part of the emo movement.Greewald, pp. 153–155.
Screamo, a subgenre of emo, has also been popular. Hawthorne Heights, Story of the Year, Underoath, and Alexisonfire, four bands frequently featured on MTV, have been noted for their popularization of contemporary screamo, although all have since made stylistic changes.[tpl]cite web|author=comments policy  18  comments posted |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/hawthorne_heights/fragile_future/index.html |title=Fragile Future Review Hawthorne Heights Compact Discs Reviews @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.first-media.com/index.php/archive/story_of_the_year/ |title=Story of the Year Archive First Media Communications |publisher=First-media.com |accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl] Other active American screamo acts include Comadre, Off Minor, A Mola Mola,scenepointblank: Men as Trees - Weltschmerz Men As Trees, Senses Fail,[tpl]cite web|title=Let It Enfold You|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-it-enfold-you-r793934/review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 December 2011|author=Alex Henderson[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Life Is Not a Waiting Room|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/life-is-not-a-waiting-room-r1432491/review|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=9 December 2011|author=Andrew Leahey[/tpl]  and Vendetta Red.

===Decline in popularity: 2010s===

By the late 2000s, emo's popularity began to decrease. Some bands moved away from their emo roots and some bands also disbanded. For example, My Chemical Romance' album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys moved away from their emo roots[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2011-05-19/music/my-chemical-romance-shed-their-emo-roots/ |title=My Chemical Romance Shed Their Emo Roots |publisher=Dallas Observer |date=May 19, 2011[/tpl] in favor of a traditional pop punk style.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/18/my-chemical-romance-danger-days-review |title=My Chemical Romance: Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys - review |publisher=The Guardian |date=18 November 2010[/tpl] Additionally, Paramore and Fall Out Boy both moved away from their emo roots during 2013[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/features/paramore-emo-288711.html |title=Have Paramore and Fall Out Boy Finally Killed Emo? |publisher=Cameron Smith |date=17 April 2013[/tpl] with albums like the former's self-titled and the latter's Save Rock and Roll. Moreover, Panic! at the Disco moved away from their emo-pop roots with albums like Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! moving to a more synthpop style.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/too-weird-to-live-too-rare-to-die!-mw0002565550 |title=Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die! - Panic! at the Disco |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Also, by this time many bands associated with the emo genre have disbanded which included bands like My Chemical Romance,Rip My Chemical Romance.

"Emo pop," also called "emo pop punk," emerged as an offshoot from emo that also embraces pop music influences, such as more concise songs and hook filled choruses. Allmusic describes the style as blending "youthful angst" with "slick production" and mainstream appeal, using "high-pitched melodies, rhythmic guitars, and lyrics concerning adolescence, relationships, and heartbreak."[tpl]cite web|title=Explore: Emo-Pop|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/emo-pop-d13770|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl] Britain's The Guardian described the style as a cross between "saccharine boy-band pop" and emo.[tpl]cite news|last=Lester|first=Paul|title=New band of the day - No 445: Metro Station|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/08/new-band-metro-station|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=8 December 2008|quote=They peddle "emo-pop", a sort of cross between saccharine boy-band pop and whatever it is that bands like Panic! at the Disco and Fall Out Boy do – emo, let's be frank.[/tpl] Modern emo pop bands have toned down extremities in loud/soft variations to provide a more widespread appeal.[tpl]cite web|last=Grehan|first=Keith|title=An Emotional Farewell?|url=http://trinitynews.ie/wordpress/archives/2368|work=Trinity News|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=11 June 2011|date=25 January 2011[/tpl]
As emo became more successful in the mid-1990s due to the rise of grunge, emo pop was set as blueprints by bands such as The Wrens, which pioneered a form of emo-pop on 1996's Secaucus, and Weezer, which in 1996 released the definitive emo album Pinkerton.[tpl]cite news|last=SPIN Mobile|title=Weezer Reveal 'Pinkerton' Reissue Details|url=http://m.spin.com/entry/view/id/1/pn/all/p/0/?KSID=44d36181b28adf4a07ea253efa89940a|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=Spin Magazine|date=23 February 2011[/tpl] Other bands which put out releases in the 90s to set up the blueprints for emo pop included Sense Field,[tpl]cite web|last=Kieper|first=Nicole|title=Sense Field: Tonight and Forever - Nettwerk America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rCoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=%22emo+pop%22+techniques&source=bl&ots=i4UzABKAc8&sig=mzxcOhZAGV1bSnOXKGS3yNFaGdM&hl=en&ei=_EnyTfi8JozUgQeWnbjCCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=CMJ New Music Monthly|publisher=CMJ Network|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=October 2001[/tpl] Jejune, Alkaline Trio and The Get Up Kids.[tpl]cite web|last=Butler|first=Blake|title=Four Minute Mile|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&pg=PA462&lpg=PA462&dq=%22emo+pop%22+techniques&source=bl&ots=XIcUKOxXNR&sig=xEPVvZZU06X1AoUWJmfQpoIh2K8&hl=en&ei=_EnyTfi8JozUgQeWnbjCCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2011|coauthors=Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine|page=462|year=2002[/tpl] As emo became commercially successful in the early 2000s, the emo pop movement was birthed by Jimmy Eat World's 2001 release Bleed American and the success of that album's single "The Middle". Bands like Weezer and The Wrens both saw great success in this new movement, the former with its release The Green Album and the latter with Meadowlands, which reinvented punk-pop for the new generation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/a-lbum/the-meadowlands-mw0000325248 Meadowlands - review |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=2014-02-18[/tpl]

The style became really popular in the early 2000s and began to have some success in the late 1990s, which was becoming increasingly successful commercially. The Get Up Kids had sold over 15,000 copies of their debut album Four Minute Mile (1997) before signing to Vagrant Records, who promoted the band strongly and put them on tours opening for famous bands like Green Day and Weezer. Their 1999 album Something to Write Home About was a major success, reaching No. 31 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. Saves the Day had built a large following on the east coast and sold almost 50,000 copies of their second album Through Being Cool (1999) before signing to Vagrant and releasing Stay What You Are (2001), which sold 15,000 copies in its first week,
As the genre coalesced, the record label Fueled by Ramen became a center of the movement, releasing platinum selling albums from bands like Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and Paramore. Two main regional scenes developed; in Florida the scene was created by the label Fueled by Ramen and the band Dashboard Confessional, and in the Midwest emo-pop was promoted by Pete Wentz, whose band Fall Out Boy rose to the front of the style in the mid-2000s.[tpl]cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|title=Fall Out Boy|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fall-out-boy-p533936|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Futterman|first=Erica|title=Fall Out Boy Biography|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fall-out-boy/biography|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=10 June 2011[/tpl] In 2008, the band Cash Cash released Take It to the Floor, which Allmusic stated could be "the definitive statement of airheaded, glittery, and content-free emo-pop".[tpl]cite web|last=Sendra|first=Tim|title=Take It to the Floor|url=http://allmusic.com/album/take-it-to-the-floor-r1471616/review|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=11 June 2011[/tpl] Allmusic further stated that with this release "the transformation of emo from the expression of intensely felt, ripped-from-the-throat feelings played by bands directly influenced by post-punk and hardcore to mall-friendly Day-Glo pop played by kids who look about as authentic as the "punks" on an old episode of Quincy did back in the '70s was made pretty much complete".

===Screamo===

The term "screamo" was initially applied to a more aggressive offshoot of emo that developed in San Diego in 1991, which used short songs that grafted "spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics."Jason Heller, "Feast of Reason". Denver Westword, June 20, 2002. http://www.westword.com/2002-06-20/music/feast-of-reason/print Access date: June 15, 2008 Screamo is a particularly dissonant style of emo influenced by hardcore punk and uses typical rock instrumentation, but is noted for its brief compositions, chaotic execution, and screaming vocals.
The genre is "generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene."Explore style: Screamo at Allmusic Music Guide The style began in 1991, in San Diego, at the Ché Café,"A Day with the Locust", L.A.
