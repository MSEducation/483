==Career==

Moving to Australia in 1976, Kerry Jacobson replaced Neil Storey who had died from an accidental drug overdose.  He went on to play with the band until their official break-up in 1979, when he then joined Mondo Rock for a brief period of time before leaving the band in 1981.  In 1982 Dragon reformed with its original and most notable line-up, including Jacobson, as they needed to pay off some outstanding debts which had accumulated after their breakup in 1979.  After the debt was paid off, the band continued to perform as they enjoyed the limelight again.  In 1983, Jacobson decided to leave the band and become a session musician, where his notable work included the albums "Dark Spaces" by Richard Clapton, "Big City Talk" by Marc Hunter and "Shy Boys Shy Girls" by the Kevin Borich Express.
In 1990 Jacobson moved to Brisbane where he studied Jazz Drums and Piano at the Conservatorium of Music, earning him a diploma in music.  He continued to perform throughout the 1990s touring with many different acts, including a European tour with Cold Chisel guitarist Ian Moss.
Jacobson is currently endorsed by ddrum acoustic and electronic drums and Istanbul Cymbals.  Jacobson also currently teaches percussion at a private school in Brisbane, Australia.  He still performs live with Renee Geyer, Mondo Rock, Kevin Borich Express, Andy Cowan, Dragon and Ian Moss.
