The Human Rights Act 2004 is an Act of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly that recognises the fundamental human rights of individuals. It was the first of its kind in Australia, however Victoria has since passed the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities and the Human Rights Consultation is currently deliberating on whether the federal government should adopt a human rights act.
The Act established an Australian Capital Territory Human Rights Commissioner. It also empowers the ACT Supreme Court to declare on compliance of legislation.
The Act was amended in 2005 by the Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment Act 2005
