In the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Monarchy is a constitutional office and is controlled by the constitution of the Netherlands.  A distinction is made between members of the royal family and members of the royal house. According to the Membership to the Royal House Act[tpl]Cite web | title = Overheid.nl (eng.

==Name of the royal house==

The official name of the Dutch royal house is Orange-Nassau. It is derived from the historical state of the same name, although this branch of the House of Nassau became extinct in the male line in 1962. The Dutch monarchs since 1948 have been members in the male line of the houses of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Lippe and Amsberg, and the latter is reflected in the current name van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg (i.e. Orange-Nassau-Amsberg) also used by members of the royal family. Thus the historical name of Orange-Nassau continues to be used as part of the surname, and in several titles such as Prince of Orange-Nassau and Count of Orange-Nassau.
