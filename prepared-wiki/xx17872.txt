A gyrocompass is a type of non-magnetic compass which is based on a fast-spinning disc and rotation of the Earth (or another planetary body if used elsewhere in the universe) to automatically find geographical direction. Although one important component of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope, these are not the same devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of gyroscopic precession, which is a distinctive aspect of the general gyroscopic effect.[tpl]cite book|title=The Anschutz Gyro-Compass and Gyroscope Engineering|pages=7–24[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The gyroscope pilots ships & planes |journal=Life|date=Mar 15, 1943 |pages=80–83|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YlEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82[/tpl]  Gyrocompasses are widely used for navigation on ships, because they have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses:

==Operation==

A gyroscope, not to be confused with gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on gimbal so that the wheel's axis is free to orient itself in any way. When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of angular momentum, such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in outer space (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since our planet rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope's axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours.Although the effect is not visible in a specific case when the gyroscope's axis is precisely parallel to the Earth's rotational axis. Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as heading indicator, but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn such gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north, is some mechanism that results in an application of torque whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north.
One method uses friction to apply the needed torque:Gyrocompass, Auxiliary Gyrocompass, and Dead Reckoning Analyzing Indicator and Tracer Systems, San Francisco Maritime National Park Association. the gyroscope in a gyrocompass is not completely free to reorient itself; if for instance a device connected to the axis is immersed in a viscous fluid, then that fluid will resist reorientation of the axis. This friction force caused by the fluid results in a torque acting on the axis, causing the axis to turn in a direction orthogonal to the torque (that is, to precess) along a line of longitude.  Once the axis points toward the celestial pole, it will appear to be stationary and won't experience any more frictional forces. This is because true north is the only direction for which the gyroscope can remain on the surface of the earth and not be required to change. This axis orientation is considered to be a point of minimum potential energy.
Another, more practical, method is to use weights to force the axis of the compass to remain horizontal (perpendicular to the direction of the center of the Earth), but otherwise allow it to rotate freely within the horizontal plane. In this case, gravity will apply a torque forcing the compass's axis toward true north.  Because the weights will confine the compass's axis to be horizontal with respect to the Earth's surface, the axis can never align with the Earth's axis (except on the Equator) and must realign itself as the Earth rotates.  But with respect to the Earth's surface, the compass will appear to be stationary and pointing along the Earth's surface toward the true North Pole.
Since the gyrocompass's north-seeking function depends on the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use heading indicators or directional gyros, which are not gyrocompasses and do not position themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to true north.NASA NASA Callback: Heading for Trouble, NASA Callback Safety Bulletin website, December 2005, No. 305.

==Mathematical model of a gyrocompass==

We will consider here a gyrocompass, as a gyroscope which is free to rotate about one of its symmetry axis, and the whole rotating gyroscope is also free to rotate on the horizontal plane, about the local vertical, the zenith. Therefore there are two independent local rotations. In addition to these rotations we will also consider the rotation of the Earth about its North-South (NS) axis, and we will model the planet as a perfect sphere. We will neglect friction and the rotation of the Earth about the Sun.

===First time-dependent rotation===

===Second and third fixed rotations===

===Constant translation===

We now choose another coordinate basis whose origin is located at the barycenter of the gyroscope. This can be performed by the following translation along the zenith axis

===Forth time-dependent rotation===

===Last time-dependent rotation===

The last rotation is a rotation on the axis of symmetry of the gyroscope as in

===Dynamics of the system===

where the tensor of inertia is given by
and
Therefore we find
The Lagrangian can be rewritten as

or

====Particular case: the poles====

This simple solution implies that the gyroscope is uniformly rotating with constant angular velocity in both the vertical and symmetrical axis.

====The general and physically relevant case====

Let us consider the case that
and, further, we allow for fast gyro-rotations, that is 
which corresponds to a period for the oscillations given by

==History==

The first, not yet practical,[tpl]cite book|pages=34–37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DN-9m2jSo8YC&pg=PA37|title=How experiments end|isbn=9780226279152|author1=Galison|first1=Peter|year=1987[/tpl] form of gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos. Usable gyrocompass was invented in 1906 in Germany by Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe, and after successful tests in 1908 became widely used in German Imperial Navy.[ref]http://downloads.german-pavilion.com/downloads/pdf/exhibitor_24199.pdf     Standard 22

The gyrocompass was an important invention for nautical navigation because it allowed accurate determination of a vessel’s location at all times regardless of the vessel’s motion, the weather and the amount of steel used in the construction of the ship. In the United States, Elmer Ambrose Sperry produced a workable gyrocompass system (1908: patent #1,242,065), and founded the Sperry Gyroscope Company. The unit was adopted by the U.S. Navy (1911), and played a major role in World War I. The Navy also began using Sperry's "Metal Mike": the first gyroscope-guided autopilot steering system. In the following decades, these and other Sperry devices were adopted by steamships such as the RMS Queen Mary, airplanes, and the warships of World War II. After his death in 1930, the Navy named the USS Sperry after him.
Meanwhile, in 1913, C. Plath (a Hamburg, Germany-based manufacturer of navigational equipment including sextants and magnetic compasses) developed the first gyrocompass to be installed on a commercial vessel.  C. Plath sold many gyrocompasses to the Weems’ School for Navigation in Annapolis, MD, and soon the founders of each organization formed an alliance and became Weems & Plath.The Invention of Precision Navigational Instruments for Air and Sea Navigation, Weems & Plath.
Before the success of gyrocompass, several attempts had been made in Europe to use gyroscope instead. By 1880, William Thomson (lord Kelvin) tried to propose a gyrostat (tope) to the British Navy. In 1889, Arthur Krebs adapted an electric motor to the Dumoulin-Froment marine gyroscope, for the French Navy. Giving the Gymnote submarine the ability to keep a straight line under water during several hours, it allowed her to force a naval block in 1890.

==Errors==

A gyrocompass is subject to certain errors. These include streaming error, where rapid changes in course, speed and latitude cause deviation before the gyro can adjust itself.Gyrocompass: Steaming Error, Navis. Accessed 15 December 2008. On most modern ships the GPS or other navigational aids feed data to the gyrocompass allowing a small computer to apply a correction. Alternatively a design based on an orthogonal triad of fibre optic gyroscope or ring laser gyroscopes will eliminate these errors, as they depend upon no mechanical parts, instead using the principles of optical path difference to determine rate of rotation.Seamanship Techniques:Shipboard and Marine Operations, D. J. House, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2004, p. 341
