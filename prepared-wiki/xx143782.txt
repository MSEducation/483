The 1965 Football League Cup Final, the fifth to be staged since the competition's inception, was contested between Leicester City and Chelsea over two legs. Leicester, the holders, were aiming to become the first side to retain the trophy while Chelsea were seeking to become the first London side to win it. Chelsea won 3–2 on aggregate, with all the goals coming in the first leg.

==Match review==

The first leg took place on 15 March 1965 at Chelsea's home ground, Stamford Bridge. Chelsea twice took the lead in the match, first through Bobby Tambling and then a Terry Venables penalty, but Leicester equalised on both occasions via Colin Appleton and Jimmy Goodfellow. With ten minutes remaining, Chelsea's Eddie McCreadie received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area and went on a sixty yard run, dribbling past several Leicester players before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Gordon Banks.
McCreadie's goal proved to be the difference between the sides as, despite strong pressure, Leicester were unable to make a breakthrough in the second leg at Filbert Street on 15 April and the game ended 0–0, giving Chelsea a 3–2 aggregate win.
