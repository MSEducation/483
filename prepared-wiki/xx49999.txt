[[U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis]]

CATEGORIES: Iraq War

In April 2003, the United States drew up a list of most-wanted Iraqis, consisting of the 55 members of the deposed Iraqi regime whom they most wanted to capture. The list was turned into a set of playing cards for distribution to United States troops. Later in 2003 the list was renumbered so that it mostly conformed to the order of the playing cards (see most-wanted Iraqi playing cards). 
To date, 6 of the original 55 fugitives are still at large, though they were removed from the U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice list in April 2014.http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/most-wanted/all-regions.html
