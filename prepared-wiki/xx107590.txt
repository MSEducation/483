==History==

In the early 90's, before the creation of Jumbo, Castillo, Charly, Eddie, Chuy Guerra, Javier Othón and René Garza formed a band called "Blueswagen" which played mainly covers of bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Pink Floyd, R.E.M., U2, The Police, Lenny Kravitz, Stone Temple Pilots and Red Hot Chili Peppers. They started gaining more fans and an increasing popularity, which led to playing bars and clubs and recording many demos. BMG obtained one of the demos and started looking for them. Later the band signed with them.
In 1996, Flip joined the band and in 1997 Bugs, Eddie's brother, returned from Quintana Roo, Mexico and also joined the band. They changed the band's name to "Jumbo", after an Asian baby boy named Jumbo Jin Li who weighed at the time approximately 50 kg.
In 1997 and 1998, they recorded their first album, "Restaurant", which included the singles "Monotransistor", "Siento que...", "Aquí" and "Fotografía", songs which were well received by the public. They recorde the song "Lo dudo" for the album "Volcán: Tributo a José José", a tribute to José José, a legend in Mexico.
In May 2005, brothers Eddie and Bugs Wako left the band. Bugs moved with his wife to Los Angeles, while Eduardo left the band so he could pursue different musical projects.
