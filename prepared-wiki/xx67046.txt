==1948â€“56==

After the incorporation of Hyderabad State into India, M. K. Vellodi was appointed as Chief Minister of the state on 26 January 1950. He was a Senior Civil servant in the Government of India. He administered the state with the help of bureaucrats from Madras state and Bombay state.
In the 1952 Legislative Assembly election, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected Chief minister of Hyderabad State. During this time there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send back bureaucrats from Madras state, and to strictly implement 'Mulki-rules'(Local jobs for locals only), which was part of Hyderabad state law since 1919.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/09/06/stories/2002090603210900.htm |title=Mulki agitation in Hyderabad state |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09[/tpl]

==Rajpramukhs==

==Dissolution==

In 1956 during the Reorganisation of the Indian States based along linguistic lines, the state of Hyderabad was split up among Andhra Pradesh, Bombay state (later divided into states of Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960 with the original portions of Hyderabad becoming part of the state of Maharashtra) and Karnataka.
In December 1953, the States Reorganization Commission was appointed to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/01/stories/2005100100040900.htm |title=SRC submits report |work=The Hindu |date= 1 October 2005|accessdate=9 October 2011 |location=Chennai, India[/tpl]
The commission, due to public demand, recommended disintegration of Hyderabad state and to merge Marathi speaking region,
Maratwada, with Bombay state and Kannada speaking region with Mysore state. The Telangana region of Hyderabad state with Andhra state.
Andhra state and Telangana were merged to form Andhra Pradesh state on 1 November 1956 after providing safeguards to Telangana in the form of Gentlemen's agreement. Gulshanabad Division or Medak Division and Warangal Division were considered as area of Hyderabad's Telangana. However when Hyderabad was merged in Andhra Pradesh state, substantial area of Adilabad (the area between Godavari and Penganga/Wardha/Pranahita rivers) was transferred to Maharashtra state.(refer Hyderabad state map)
And later on 2014, the state of Telangana was formed splitting from the rest of Andhra Pradesh region.
