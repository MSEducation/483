Marie-José Pérec (born 9 May 1968 Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe) is a retired, French track and field sprinter who specialised in the 200 and 400 meters and was a three-time Olympic gold medallist.

==Running career==

Pérec won the 1991 World Championships 400 metres title in Tokyo and repeated the feat at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg.  She was the 400 metres champion at the 1992 Olympics Games in Barcelona. Four years later, she entered the 200 metres and 400 metres events at the 1996 Olympics Games in Atlanta and won both, thus achieving the second-ever Olympic 200 metres/400 metres gold medal double (the first was achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in Los Angeles in 1984). Pérec won the 1996 400 meters title in an Olympic record time of 48.25 seconds, which also ranks her as the third fastest woman of all time.
In addition to her Olympic and World titles, Pérec also won the 400 metres title and was a part of the gold medal-winning 4 × 400 metres relay team at the 1994 European Championships in Helsinki.
The two 1996 Olympic titles were Pérec's last international titles. On 22 September 2000, she pulled out of the 200 metres and 400 metres events of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, several days before they were due to begin.  Pérec claimed that she had been threatened and insulted several times since arriving in Australia and that the Australian press had been trying to sabotage her chances of winning the 400 m Olympic gold medal in Sydney.
