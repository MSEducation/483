[[Lagascea]]

CATEGORIES: Asteraceae genera

Lagascea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.  It includes 8 species that occur primarily in Mexico, but some extend into Central America and one reaches north into the western U.S.A.Stuessy, T. F. 1978. Revision of Lagascea (Compositae, Heliantheae). Fieldiana, Botany 38: 75–133.  One species, L. mollis, has been widely introduced to other localities around the tropics and subtropics.  Lagascea is a member of the same subtribe Helianthinae as the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, but it looks different because it has heads that are reduced to have 1 (or 2) flowers, and are clustered into compound units that mimic heads and are sometimes called syncephalia.Harris, E. M. 1994. Developmental evidence for the derivation of syncephalia in Lagascea (Heliantheae; Asteraceae). American Journal of Botany 81: 1139–1148.  The relationships of Lagascea are not well established, but the published work from molecular phylogenetic studies places it as the sister genus to Tithonia.Schilling, E. E. and J. L. Panero. 1996. Phylogenetic reticulation in subtribe Helianthinae. American Journal of Botany 83: 939-948.  Two of the species are herbs, distinguished from each other by features of the heads, and the remaining species are shrubs and are distinguished primarily by vegetative features. The genus is named after the Spanish botanist Mariano Lagasca (1776-1839).Genaust, Helmut (1976). Etymologisches Wörterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen ISBN 3-7643-0755-2
