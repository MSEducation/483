At the top of the hill there is a castle overlooking Málaga city and the Mediterranean Sea.

==History==

Gibralfaro has been the site of fortifications since the Phoenician foundation of Málaga city. At the beginning of the 14th century, Yusuf I of the Kingdom of Granada constructed on its top the eponymous castle within the Phoenician enclosure. The name is said to be derived from the Phoenician word for light, Jbel-Faro, meaning "Rock of Light". 
At the end of 2005, a thick forest of pines and eucalyptus trees were planted on the hill. On its outskirts are the historical buildings of the seminary and the Alcazaba, the Jardines de Puerta Oscura (Dark Gate Gardens), as well as a Parador.Conocer España por la ruta de los paradores, Ediciones Gaesa, page 90 
Currently pending approval is a project intended to safeguard the mount and its surroundings from any urban intervention and promote it as a space for public recreation. Another project is planned to build a cable car linking the city center with the Gibralfaro castle.Impulso al plan para proteger el Monte Gibralfaro y potenciar su uso cultural - Málaga Hoy
