CAD as of 2010 was the leading cause of death globally resulting in over 7 million deaths.

Recent research efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities (angiogenesis) and various (adult) stem cell therapies.

A more controversial link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis.[tpl]cite journal | author=Saikku P, Leinonen M, Tenkanen L, Linnanmaki E, Ekman MR, Manninen V, Manttari M, Frick MH, Huttunen JK. | title=Chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection as a risk factor for coronary heart disease in the Helsinki Heart Study | journal=Ann Intern Med | year=1992 | volume=116 | issue=4 | pages=273–8 | pmid=1733381 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-116-4-273[/tpl] While this intracellular organism has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive as to whether it can be considered a causative factor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular diseases.[tpl]cite journal | author=Andraws R, Berger JS, Brown DL. | title=Effects of antibiotic therapy on outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal=JAMA | year=2005 | volume=293 | issue=21 | pages=2641–7 | pmid=15928286 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2641[/tpl]
Since the 1990s the search for new treatment options for coronary artery disease patients, particularly for so called "no-option" coronary patients, focused on usage of angiogenesis[tpl]cite journal |author=Simons M, Bonow RO, Chronos NA |title=Clinical trials in coronary angiogenesis: issues, problems, consensus: An expert panel summary |journal=Circulation |volume=102 |issue=11 |pages=E73–86 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10982554 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.102.11.e73|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10982554[/tpl] and (adult) stem cell therapies. Numerous clinical trials were performed, either applying protein (angiogenic growth factor) therapies, such as FGF-1 or VEGF, or cell therapies using different kinds of adult stem cell populations.
