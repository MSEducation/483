His opponent Etienne Tshisekedi was trailing with 3.4 million votes, about 34%.Dread permeates Congo ahead of election results, Kabila in lead with 49 percent However, this count did not include much of Kinshasa, where Tshisekedi was expected to have strong results. Kabila recently ceased all email and sms services nationwide. It is also said that over 5.000.000 of pre ticked ballot papers for the number 3 candidate (kabila), However no formal actions were taken by the CENI, which led to the population to act as they burned pre ticked ballot papers that were found.http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ipXVKU789GdE5omsWQN4h5o0nPXw?docId=700127f6203d4a7f82be1bf20e0122c6

The Independent National Electoral Commission declared Kabila as the winner on December 9. The result was put into question by the Carter Center as well as the archbishop of Kinshasa, Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, claiming too many irregularities occurred to assure that the results reflected the will of the people.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/world/africa/congo-president-kabila-denies-reports-of-election-fraud.html?_r=1&ref=world |author=Adam Nossiter |title=Congo President Kabila Denies Reports of Election Fraud|publisher=New York Times|date=December 12, 2011| accessdate=December 12, 2011[/tpl] The Carter Center indicated that ballots had been missing in some areas while in others Kabila achieved unrealistic results. Observers from the Carter Center noted that in some districts voter participation was reported to be 100 percent, a most unlikely possibility.  MONUSCO, the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations, also voiced concern about the results.
While Kabila admitted that some mistakes had been made in the process, he rejected concerns about the outcome. The result was confirmed by the Supreme Court of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Jerome Kitoko, President of the Supreme Court, announcing the official results proclaimed Kabila to be the winner of the Presidential election.
In the parliamentary election, with 432 of 500 seats declared, Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) had 58 seats and Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) 34 seats. Allies of the PPRD gained 106 seats, and with other new parties known to support Kabila, he likely will have 200 seats supporting him; he will still need to reach out for more partners, however, to gain a majority. Almost 100 parties are expected to be represented in the parliament. Most of the undeclared seats are in Kinshasa and are likely to go to the opposition.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16757348 | work=BBC News | title=Congo poll: Etienne Tshisekedi condemns results | date=2012-01-27[/tpl]
