Electric Arguments is the third album by The Fireman, an experimental music duo consisting of Paul McCartney and producer Youth.

==Background and recording==

The album, unlike the earlier Fireman albums, features prominent vocals. Each song on the album was recorded in one day, the album itself done in only thirteen days, spread over the course of a year. The album features the hidden track "Road Trip", at the end of "Don't Stop Running".[tpl]cite web|title=The McCartney Recording Sessions - 2008|url=http://webpages.charter.net/ram71/2008.htm|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] Remixes of "Lifelong Passion" were made: "Sawain Ambient Acapella", and "Sawain Instrumental Dub". Instrumental mixes of "Sun Is Shining" and "Traveling Light" of made, titled "Equinox Instrumental", and "Travelling Light Instrumental", respectively. Instrumental dub mixes were made of "Sing the Changes" and "Don't Stop Running", titled "Morning Mist Instrumental Dub" and "Wickerman Ambient Dub", respectively.
The duo borrowed the title "Electric Arguments" from the poem "Kansas City to St. Louis" by Allen Ginsberg. In Wired magazine, McCartney stated this was because "he's been looking at the beauty of word combinations rather than their meaning."[tpl]cite news|last=Buskirk |first=Eliot Van |title=Video: Paul McCartney and Youth Talk 'The Fireman' |date=18 November 2008 |publisher=Wired |url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/11/the-fireman---.html |accessdate=18 November 2008 [/tpl]
[tpl]cquote|We had a ball making this album, and it was a great departure because it seemed more like improv theatre. In the improv spirit, there are William Burroughs-type cut-ups in the lyrics.  I came to "Sing the Changes," as well as all the other songs in the album, with absolutely no concept of what the melody or lyrics would be about. So it was like writing on the spot, which I think lent an electricity to the whole sound. |4=Paul McCartney [tpl]cite web|last=Cott |first=Jonathon  |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=22 January 2009 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25363046/paul_mccartney_qa_behind_the_firemans_new_psychpop_gem |title=Paul McCartney Q&A: Behind the Fireman's New Psych-Pop Gem |accessdate=3 May 2009[/tpl][/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Electric Arguments debuted at number 79 on the UK Album Charts, marking the first appearance for The Fireman in the British charts.  They also made their inaugural appearance on the Billboard 200, reaching number 67. It was acclaimed by critics, cited as one of the best albums of 2008. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, "There are more twists and turns, more textures, than on any other McCartney album in the last 20 years," awarding the album 4 and  a half stars. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone called the album "the ex-Beatle's headiest music in years" giving it 4 stars. Pete Paphides of The Times gave the album 4 stars, saying "Electric Arguments is delivered with a disregard for production values or playlist potential that would make, say, Keane or the Kooks blush at their own conservatism".[tpl]cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article5174152.ece |title=The Big CD: The Fireman - Electric Arguments |author=Pete Paphides |date=22 November 2008 |publisher=The Times |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl]  Review aggregator Metacritic tallied 74 (out of 100), indicating "generally favorable reviews" based on 23 critics (18 of which were positive, four mixed and one negative).
