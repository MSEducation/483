The University of Stirling is a campus university founded by Royal charter in 1967, on the Airthrey Estate in Stirling, Scotland. Stirling University is a plate glass university, along with Heriot-Watt University, the University of Dundee and the University of Strathclyde. These increased the number of universities in Scotland from four to eight. Stirling was however the only completely new institution of its kind established in Scotland since the University of Edinburgh was founded in 1582. 
The campus was selected from a shortlist of competing sites that also included Dumfries, Inverness, Ayr, Falkirk, Perth and Cumbernauld. The report's author, Lord Robbins, was later appointed the University's first Chancellor in 1968.

==History and campus development==

The main campus is situated around [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] from the centre of Stirling, but is much closer to the town of Bridge of Allan. It was formerly the estate of the Robert Adam-designed Airthrey Castle, which the University has retained and incorporated into the campus as teaching facilities and offices. It is regularly described as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world,[tpl]cite news |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/universityguide/profile/story/0,,491265,00.html |title=Stirling University |work=The Guardian |accessdate=5 April 2007 | location=London[/tpl] and nestles at the foot of Abbey Craig and the Ochil Hills in [tpl]convert|300|acre|km2[/tpl] of grounds centred around the 18th century man-made Airthrey Loch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.instirling.com/sight/univ.htm |title=InStirling |work=Airthrey Estate Overview |accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] 
In 2002, the University of Stirling and the landscape of the Airthrey Estate was designated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites as one of the top 20 heritage sites of the 20th century within the UK.
The campus was originally designed by the Scottish architectural practice Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall in a low-rise, highly functional, modern style, envisaged to integrate with the contours of the surrounding landscape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.is.stir.ac.uk/newlibrary/SpecialCollectionsVision.pdf |title=Stirling University |work=Library and Campus History and Redevelopment|accessdate=5 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] 
When the University first received its Royal Charter on 13 November 1967, there were 164 undergraduate and 31 postgraduate students. By 2007 the university had produced around 45,000 graduates.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/education/life-at-40.html|title = Life Begins at 40|accessdate = 2 September 2007|date=July 2007|publisher = Scotland.org[/tpl] The University of Stirling however has a relatively small student population, ranking 87th in the UK. 92.2% of undergraduates currently enter from state schools or further education.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.sfc.ac.uk/information/information_gmap/HRM%20Institution%20reports/Stirling%20University.pdf| title=Stirling|date=September 2004| author=The good university guide| work=Stirling University| accessdate=4 December 2007[/tpl]
The principal administrative and teaching facilities were originally housed in the Pathfoot Building, which was completed in 1968 and subsequently saw several extensions over the years, including a Tropical Aquarium in 1979 and a Virology unit in 1987. In 1993 the Pathfoot Building was selected by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of sixty key Scottish monuments of the post-war era. It was also voted as one of Prospect's 100 best modern Scottish buildings. A house for the University Principal was also completed in 1967. Designed by the architects Morris and Steedman, it was listed at category A in 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=51322 |title=Stirling University Campus, 1 Airthrey Castle Yard, Principal's House: Listed Building Report |publisher=Historic Scotland[/tpl] Pathfoot was later complemented by the Cottrell Building, which began development in 1970 and houses numerous lecture theatres, departmental offices, classrooms and computer labs. The Cottrell Building was further enhanced with the completion of the Courtroom extension in 1998 and in 2008/09 the entire building underwent a façade recladding project.
The University Library and Andrew Miller Building were completed in 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anniversary.stir.ac.uk/history/cottrell-pathfoot.php|title=History of the Estate – Cottrell and Pathfoot Development|work=Stirling University|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] The Library holds over 500,000 volumes, over 9,000 journals and reopened in August 2010 after a major refurbishment programme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.is.stir.ac.uk/newlibrary/SpecialCollectionsVision.pdf |title=Stirling University |work=Library Refurbishment Project|accessdate=5 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] The Andrew Miller Building incorporates an Atrium, which has several retail and food outlets, including a bookstore, bank and general store. The Atrium also acts as the principal hub for most day-to-day campus activities, due to its central location, linking together the Library and Robbins' Centre Students Union, as well as connecting bridges to both the Cottrell Building and on-campus student residences. The University's first Principal, Tom Cottrell, believed that art should be part of the everyday cultural experience at the University, and his inspiration led to the establishment of the MacRobert Arts Centre, which is a small theatre and cinema complex, located adjacent to the Andrew Miller Building. The Centre is open both to members of the University community and to the general public. Stirling has also developed a considerable fine art collection since 1967, comprising over 300 works including; paintings, tapestries and sculpture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artcol.stir.ac.uk/|title=Art at Stirling|work=Stirling University|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl]
A visit by Queen Elizabeth II to the site in 1972 caused considerable controversy; student protests against the Queen's visit were vociferous and, in some cases, fuelled by alcohol, and the disturbances were widely condemned in the press and the local community, where students were refused access to buses and other facilities for a time.
As the University has continued to expand since its inception, further development has taken place including; the world renowned Institute of Aquaculture opened by Princess Diana in 1982, the R.G. Bomont Building, which was completed in 1998, and houses the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, the Iris Murdoch building, opened in 2002 for The Dementia Services Development Centre, and the Colin Bell Building, completed in 2003 for the School of Applied Social Science.

===Accommodation===

In 2006, the University catered for nearly 9,000 students, around a third of whom live on-campus. There are several student Halls of Residence located on-campus, which include; Andrew Stewart Hall, A.K. Davidson Hall, Murray Hall, Geddes Court, Alexander Court and Muirhead House. There are also other halls of residence located off-campus, within Stirling city centre, including; Union Street and John Forty's Court. Students of over 80 nationalities are represented at the university, with 14 per cent of students coming from overseas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.external.stir.ac.uk/visitor_info/facts/index.php |title=Visitor Information|work=Stirling University|accessdate=5 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403201931/http://www.external.stir.ac.uk/visitor_info/facts/index.php  |archivedate = 3 April 2007[/tpl]

===Business links===

The University has developed major industrial research links, with a large science park – Stirling University Innovation Park, located immediately adjacent to the main university campus. Innovation Park has grown since its initiation in 1993, and is now home to 40 companies engaging in various forms of research and development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suip.co.uk/AboutSUIP.aspx|title=About Us|work=Stirling University Innovation Park|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] 
The university also owns a highly successful International Conference Centre, Stirling Management Centre, which is located on campus, and is a purpose built conference and management training centre and the first Conference Centre of Excellence in Scotland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.external.stir.ac.uk/business/smc/index.php |title=About Us|work=Stirling Management Centre|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] The University admits in its own published estates strategy that the sale of part of its campus to the Wang Laboratories computer manufacturer in the 1980s was a serious mistake. The sale was linked to the adoption by the University of Wang's computing system which was incompatible with other systems and eventually replaced. The site went through various owners and is now a food processing facility.

===Controversies===

The university chose not to defend a claim at an employment tribunal in 2009 in which it conceded it had unfairly dismissed a researcher who had complained that a member of the psychology department, Dr David Donaldson, had removed her name from a grant application and submitted it under his own. The university had rejected the researcher's complaint in its internal process. It subsequently promoted Donaldson to a professorship.  Donaldson issued a written apology to the researcher, and the university was required to pay her more than £10,000 in compensation.Melanie Newman, "Lecturer apologises to researcher for swapping names in grant application", Times Higher Education, 14 May 2009

===Sport facilities===

===Teaching===

Since its inception, Stirling has offered modular degree programmes allowing greater flexibility and choice. Stirling was the first United Kingdom university to introduce the system of two semesters rather than having three terms. The first semester lasts from mid-September to mid-December and the second from mid-February to the end of May.
There are now over 256 courses (including combination courses) at the undergraduate degree level. A wide variety of courses are also available at the postgraduate level.
Excellent teaching ratings for politics, accounting, finance, economics, sociology, religious studies, business studies, psychology and English language demonstrate Stirling's expertise in the arts and social sciences. Among the natural sciences, environmental science also achieved high ratings, its success reflected in the recently completed School of Biological and Environmental Sciences, with substantially refurbished facilities for both teaching and research. All but one of the subjects assessed for teaching quality were rated at least "highly satisfactory" and was ranked in the top ten in the UK for Teaching Assessment by The Times Higher Education Supplement. 
The Philosophical Gourmet report ranks Stirlings' joint graduate philosophy programme with the University of St Andrews as second in the UK and joint 13th in the English-Speaking world.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp| title=Overall Rankings|work=Ranking of Top 50 Faculties in the English-Speaking World|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl]

==Governance==

Unlike the Ancient universities of Scotland, Stirling University's constitution is laid out in its Royal Charter, rather than the Universities (Scotland) Acts. The administrative structure is however broadly similar, with the University Court (governing and financial body) and the Academic Council (academic affairs) based upon the ancient model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strategicplanning.stir.ac.uk/court-committees/index.php |title=Court and Committees|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] The University's constitution, academic regulations, and appointments are comprehensively outlined in the University calendar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calendar.stir.ac.uk/|title=University Calendar|work=Stirling University|accessdate=5 April 2007[/tpl] In 2009 the University reviewed its Charter and Statutes to amend the procedures for discipline of academic staff.

===University Court===

The governing body of the University is the University Court. It has overall responsibility for the management of the University's resources, the ongoing strategic direction of the University and the approval of major developments. It also receives regular reports from Executive Officers on the day to day operation of the University's business. The Court meets four times over the course of the academic year. Stirling's University Court has a number of well known members including James Naughtie and Alistair Moffat.

===Academic Council===

Academic Council is the body which is responsible for the management of academic affairs, awarding of all degrees, and for the regulation and superintendence of the education, discipline and welfare of the students of the University. While the Court has the final responsibility for governing the University, on academic matters it will normally only act on the recommendation of Academic Council. The Council consists of various academics and is chaired by the Principal of the university.

===Committees and Executive Officers===

There are also a number of committees supporting both the Court and Academic Council, that make important decisions and investigate matters referred to them. Day to day management of the University is undertaken by the University Principal (who is also Vice-Chancellor). 
The role of Chancellor itself is largely honorific, the current Chancellor is James Naughtie. The current principal is Gerry McCormac,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stir.ac.uk/about/senior-officers-of-the-university/gerry-mccormac/ |title=Professor Gerry McCormac |work=Stirling University|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] and the current chairman of court is local businessman Alan Simpson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stir.ac.uk/about/senior-officers-of-the-university/chairman-of-the-university-court/ |title=Alan Gordon Simpson |work=Stirling University|accessdate=30 November 2012[/tpl] There are also several Deputy Principals, each with a specific remit. They play a major role in the day to day management of the university.

==Student life==
