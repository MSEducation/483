==South Park==

The song was later included on the South Park soundtrack album Chef Aid: The South Park Album. 
On Chef Aid, the song opens with a mock phone call between Sid Greenfield (voiced by Trey Parker) and South Park creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, talking about putting the song on the album. In the mock phone call (which begins on the previous track, and continues throughout "Horny") Matt and Trey repeatedly voice their dislike for the song, and Sid Greenfield finally agrees not to include it. (Of course this is after the song has already finished playing in its entirety.)

In 2006, a mash-up between "Horny" and The Dandy Warhols' song, "Bohemian Like You" was released as "Horny as a Dandy".
