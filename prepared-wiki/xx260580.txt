Playdate is a Canadian drama anthology television series which aired on CBC Television from 1961 to 1964.

==Premise==

The series replaced General Motors Presents. Ed Moser, a story editor from that previous series, became executive producer of Playdate. He reduced the presence of Canadian script writers, featuring nine Canadian-written scripts in the final season of Playdate compared to 19 Canadian works featured in the final season of General Motors Presents.Rutherford, p. 292
Robert Goulet hosted the earliest episodes of Playdate, replaced by Christopher Plummer from 20 December 1961. From October 1962, episodes of the UK series The Jo Stafford Show were occasionally broadcast, billed by the CBC as Playdate Presents.... In September 1963, similar treatment was given to The Red Skelton Show, an American series, when it was sporadically broadcast in the Playdate time slot.
The CBC cancelled Playdate and Parade by June 1964, as part of a general reduction in variety programming for the 1964-65 season.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MpotAAAAIBAJ&pg=7086%2C2795763 | title=Dial Turns | first=Jack | last=Marsters | newspaper=The Gazette | location=Montreal | date=15 June 1964 | page=10 | accessdate=30 December 2010 [/tpl] In the months following the last Playdate episode, The Red Skelton Show was regularly seen in the time slot.Montreal Gazette television listings, Julyâ€“August 1964
