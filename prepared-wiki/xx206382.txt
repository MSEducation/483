In mathematics and social science, a collaboration graph[tpl]cite journal|last=Odda|first=Tom|year=1979|title=On properties of a well-known graph or what is your Ramsey number?

Topics in Graph Theory.  New York Academy of Sciences, 1979. ISBN 0-89766-028-5 is a graph modeling some social network where the vertices represent participants of that network (usually individual people) and where two distinct participants are joined by an edge whenever there is a collaborative relationship between them of a particular kind. Collaboration graphs are used to measure the closeness of collaborative relationships between the participants of the network.

==Types of collaboration graphs considered in the literature==

The two most well-studied collaboration graphs are:
Social Networks, vol. 22 (2000), no. 2, pp. 173–186.[/ref]Casper Goffman. And what is your Erdős number?, American Mathematical Monthly, vol. 76 (1979), p. 791 where two mathematicians are joined by an edge whenever they co-authored a paper together (with possibly other co-authors present).
Science, vol. 286 (1999), no. 5439, pp. 509–512[/ref] where two movie actors are joined by an edge whenever they appeared in a movie together.
Collaborations graphs have also been considered in other social networks, such as sports, including the "NBA graph" whose vertices are players where two players are joined by an edge if they have ever played together on the same teamV.

==Features of collaboration graphs==

By construction, the collaboration graph is a simple graph, since it has no loop-edges and no multiple edges.
The collaboration graph need not be connected. Thus people who never co-authored a joint paper represent isolated vertices in the collaboration graph of mathematicians.
Both the collaboration graph of mathematicians and movie actors were shown to have "small world topology": they have a very large number of vertices, most of small degree, that are highly clustered, and a "giant" connected  component with small average distances between vertices.Jerrold W. Grossman. The evolution of the mathematical research collaboration graph. Proceedings of the Thirty-third Southeastern International Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing (Boca Raton, FL, 2002). Congressus Numerantium. Vol. 158 (2002), pp. 201–212.

==Collaboration distance==

The distance between two people/nodes in a collaboration graph is called the collaboration distance.[tpl]Cite book|first2=Michel-Marie|last2=Deza|author2-link=Michel Deza|first1=Elena|last1=Deza|title=Dictionary of Distances|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|isbn=978-0-444-52087-6|chapter=Ch. 22|page=279[/tpl]. Thus the collaboration distance between two distinct nodes is equal to the smallest number of edges in an edge-path connecting them. If no path connecting two nodes in a collaboration graph exists, the collaboration distance between them is said to be infinite.
The collaboration distance may be used, for instance, for evaluating the citations of an author, a group of authors or a journal.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.joi.2010.11.001[/tpl]
In the collaboration graph of mathematicians, the collaboration distance from a particular person to Paul Erdős is called the Erdős number of that person. MathSciNet has a free online toolMathSciNet Collaboration Distance Calculator. American Mathematical Society. Accessed May 23, 2008 for computing the collaboration distance between any two mathematicians as well as the Erdős number of a mathematician. This tool also shows the actual chain of co-authors that realizes the collaboration distance.
For the Hollywood graph, an analog of the Erdős number, called the Bacon number, has also been considered, which measures the collaboration distance to Kevin Bacon.

==Generalizations of the collaboration graph==

Some generalizations of the collaboration graph of mathematicians have also been considered. There is a hypergraph version,Frank Harary. Topics in Graph Theory. New York Academy of Sciences, 1979. ISBN 0-89766-028-5 See p. 166 where individual mathematicians are vertices and where a group of mathematicians (not necessarily just two) constitutes a hyperedge if there is a paper of which they were all co-authors. Another variation is a simple graph where two mathematicians are joined by an edge if and only if there is a paper with only two of them (and no others) as co-authors.
