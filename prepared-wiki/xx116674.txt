==History==

Millennium Partners first proposed the development in 2002 with 163 condominiums, 108 rentals and a 136-unit "extended stay" hotel rooms.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/58-story-skyscraper-seeking-S-F-approval-2834584.php |title=58-story skyscraper seeking S.F. approval / Proposal for city's fourth-highest tower |first=Gerald D. |last=Adams |date=May 18, 2002 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl]  The project was approved in 2003 by the S.F. Planning Commission 4-1 and construction began in 2005. The only against vote came from Planning Commissioner Sue Lee.
On September 6, 2010, Dan Goodwin, also known as SpiderDan and Skyscraperman, scaled the outside of the tower using suction cups. Following the climb, Goodwin was arrested by the San Francisco police who charged him with trespassing.  Goodwin, a stage-four cancer survivor, stated the reason he made the climb was to call attention to the inability of fire departments to conduct rescue operations in the upper floors of skyscrapers.  In the 1980s, in advocacy for high-rise firefighting and rescue, Goodwin scaled many of the world's tallest buildings including the Sears Tower, the John Hancock Center, and the World Trade Center.[tpl]cite news | author=The Associated Press | title=Police Arrest Man Who Scaled Millennium Tower | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2010/09/06/state/n165842D24.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 6, 2010 | accessdate=1 September 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In 2013, the building sold its final unit, generating US$750 million in total sales, a 125 percent return on the estimated US$600 million in development costs.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/04/05/millennium-tower-in-san-francisco-is.html |title=Millennium Tower in San Francisco is a $750M sellout |publisher=San Francisco Business Times |first=J.K. |last=Dineen |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-04-06[/tpl]
